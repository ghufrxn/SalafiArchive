<p><br /><strong>إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَٱلَّذِينَ هَادُوا۟ وَٱلنَّصَـٰرَىٰ وَٱلصَّـٰبِـِٔينَ مَنْ ءَامَنَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلْـَٔاخِرِ وَعَمِلَ صَـٰلِحًۭا فَلَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ </strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Verily! Those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians, whoever believes in Allâh and the Last Day and does righteous good deeds shall have their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve</strong> (Suratul Baqarah 2:62)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">English &#8211; Tafsir Ibn Kathir</h2>



<p>Faith and doing Righteous Deeds equals Salvation in all Times</p>



<p>Allah says;</p>



<p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ امَنُواْ وَالَّذِينَ هَادُواْ وَالنَّصَارَى وَالصَّابِيِينَ مَنْ امَنَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاخِرِ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحاً فَلَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ</p>



<p>Verily, those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians (Sabi&#8217;in), whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and does righteous good deeds shall have their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.</p>



<p>After Allah described the condition &#8211; and punishment &#8211; of those who defy His commands, fall into His prohibitions and transgress set limits by committing prohibited acts, He stated that the earlier nations who were righteous and obedient received the rewards for their good deeds. This shall be the case, until the Day of Judgment. Therefore, whoever follows the unlettered Messenger and Prophet shall acquire eternal happiness and shall neither fear from what will happen in the future nor become sad for what has been lost in the past.</p>



<p>Similarly, Allah said,</p>



<p>أَلا إِنَّ أَوْلِيَأءَ اللَّهِ لَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ</p>



<p>No doubt! Verily, the Awliya of Allah, no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve. (10:62)</p>



<p>The angels will proclaim to the dying believers, as mentioned,</p>



<p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ قَالُواْ رَبُّنَا اللَّهُ ثُمَّ اسْتَقَـمُواْ تَتَنَزَّلُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمَلَـيِكَةُ أَلاَّ تَخَافُواْ وَلَا تَحْزَنُواْ وَأَبْشِرُواْ بِالْجَنَّةِ الَّتِى كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ</p>



<p>Verily, those who say:&#8221;Our Lord is Allah (alone),&#8221; and then they stand firm, on them the angels will descend (at the time of their death) (saying):&#8221;Fear not, nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of Paradise which you have been promised!&#8221; (41:30)<br />The Meaning of Mu&#8217;min, or Believer</p>



<p>Ali bin Abi Talhah narrated from Ibn Abbas, about,<br /><br />إِنَّ الَّذِينَ امَنُواْ وَالَّذِينَ هَادُواْ وَالنَّصَارَى وَالصَّابِيِينَ مَنْ امَنَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاخِرِ<br />(Verily, those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day) that Allah revealed the following Ayah afterwards,</p>



<p>وَمَن يَبْتَغِ غَيْرَ الاِسْلَـمِ دِينًا فَلَن يُقْبَلَ مِنْهُ وَهُوَ فِى الاٌّخِرَةِ مِنَ الْخَـسِرِينَ</p>



<p><strong>And whoever seeks religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers. </strong>(3:85).</p>



<p><strong>This statement by Ibn Abbas indicates that Allah does not accept any deed or work from anyone, unless it conforms to the Law of Muhammad that is, after Allah sent Muhammad. Before that, every person who followed the guidance of his own Prophet was on the correct path, following the correct guidance and was saved.</strong><br /></p>



<p class="has-vivid-red-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-30806beb3e73bb9debf8cada81e8a833"><strong>Why the Jews were called `Yahud</strong></p>



<p>The Jews are the followers of Prophet Musa, who used to refer to the Tawrah for judgment. Yahud is a word that means,</p>



<p>`repenting&#8217;, just as Musa said,<br />إِنَّا هُدْنَـا إِلَيْكَ<br />(We have Hudna (we repent, go back and return) unto You), (7:156).</p>



<p class="has-vivid-red-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9bf0f6e8e47c6c89b003334d9c77acf6"><strong>Why the Christians were called Nasara</strong></p>



<p>Allah said;</p>



<p>مَنْ أَنصَارِى إِلَى اللَّهِ قَالَ الْحَوَارِيُّونَ نَحْنُ أَنْصَارُ اللَّهِ</p>



<p>&#8220;Who will be my helpers in Allah&#8217;s cause&#8221; Al-Hawariyyun said:&#8221;We are the helpers of Allah.&#8221; (61:14)</p>



<p>It was said that;</p>



<p>they were called `Nasara&#8217;, because they inhabited a land called An-Nasirah (Nazareth), as Qatadah, Ibn Jurayj and Ibn Abbas were reported to have said, Allah knows best.<br />Nasara is certainly plural for Nasran.</p>



<p>When Allah sent Muhammad as the Last and Final Prophet and Messenger to all of the Children of Adam, mankind was required to believe in him, obey him and refrain from what he prohibited them; those who do this are true believers. The Ummah of Muhammad was called `Mu&#8217;minin&#8217; (believers), because of the depth of their faith and certainty, and because they believe in all of the previous Prophets and matters of the Unseen.<br /></p>



<p class="has-vivid-red-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-7d09a938eb2a9ee1c36bd806243e374e"><strong>The Sabi&#8217;un or Sabians</strong></p>



<p>There is a difference of opinion over the identity of the Sabians.</p>



<p>Sufyan Ath-Thawri said that Layth bin Abu Sulaym said that Mujahid said that,</p>



<p>&#8220;The Sabians are between the Majus, the Jews and the Christians. They do not have a specific religion.&#8221;</p>



<p>Similar is reported from Ibn Abi Najih.</p>



<p>Similar statements were attributed to Ata and Sa`id bin Jubayr.</p>



<p>They (others) say that;</p>



<p>the Sabians are a sect among the People of the Book who used to read the Zabur (Psalms), others say that they are a people who worshipped the angels or the stars.</p>



<p>It appears that the closest opinion to the truth, and Allah knows best, is Mujahid&#8217;s statement and those who agree with him like Wahb bin Munabbih, that;</p>



<p>the Sabians are neither Jews nor Christians nor Majus nor polytheists. Rather, they did not have a specific religion that they followed and enforced, because they remained living according to their Fitrah (instinctual nature). This is why the idolators used to call whoever embraced Islam a `Sabi&#8217;, meaning, that he abandoned all religions that existed on the earth.</p>



<p>Some scholars stated that;</p>



<p>the Sabians are those who never received a message by any Prophet.</p>



<p>And Allah knows best</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Fatwa No. 8377</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: I would like to raise an issue that caused a dispute between some people. It is the writing of the word &#8220;Allah&#8221; and the word &#8220;Muhammad&#8221; in an interlacing shape on top of the door of one of the Masjids (mosques) in Adlab. Some of them said that it is not permissible to write these names in such a shape. The proof they mentioned to support their viewpoint was that in this way, Muhammad&#8217;s status (peace be upon him), would be the same as Allah&#8217;s which is not reasonable. Others said that writing them in such a way is permissible as Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) places His name beside the name of His Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him). I would like you to guide me to what is right. Thank you very much.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ans. by Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta&#8217;, KSA:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shari&#8217;ah (Islamic law) texts join between testifying that no one is worthy of worship except Allah and testifying that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah in certain places, such as in Adhan (call to Prayer), Iqamah (call to start the Prayer), in the Hadith: Islam is based on five pillars: (Testifying that there is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah&#8230;) and other places. These texts point out what Mukallafun (legally competent persons) should believe in with regard to Allah and the Messenger, such as saying that there is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>But mixing the two words in writing was not mentioned in the Book of Allah or the Sunnah </strong>(whatever is reported from the Prophet, peace be upon him).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Moreover, mixing both words in writing contains great danger as this is similar to the false creed of the Christians with regard to the trinity. They believe that the Father, Son and Holy Spirit are one God.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It also contains an element of the false creed of pantheism, and leads to elevating the Prophet </strong>(peace be upon him)<strong> and worshipping him along with Allah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is prohibited to write the Name of Allah and the name of His Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him) by mixing the letters of the two words together.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, it is also <strong>prohibited to write the words (Allah &#8211; Muhammad) next to each other</strong> on the top of the door of the Masjids or any other place because doing so may contain some delusion and misguidance with regard to the prohibitions mentioned above.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Ruling on swearing by the Prophet (peace be upon him)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">A questioner sent us a message that reads: Some people are used to swear by the Prophet (peace be upon him) and this has become customary for them, yet they do not take that as a belief. What is the ruling on this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ans by Imam Ibn Baz:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Swearing by the Prophet (peace be upon him) or any other part of creation is a grave <strong>Munkar</strong> (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect) and a form of <strong>Shirk</strong> (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). Thus, it is not permissible for anyone to swear but by Allah Alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported from Imam Ibn `Abdul­Bar (may Allah be merciful with him) that it is not permissible to swear by other than Allah. Besides, authentic Hadith are related in which the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade this and declared it to be an act of Shirk. One of these Hadith is the one related in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al­Bukhari and Muslim) from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Verily! Allah forbids you to swear by your fathers. If one has to take an oath, they should swear by Allah or else keep silent.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another wording reads:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">.<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>..they should swear by Allah or say nothing.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, Abu Dawud and Al­Tirmidhy related through an authentic Sanad (chain of narrators) from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Anyone who swears by other than Allah has become a Kafir (disbeliever) or Mushrik (one who associates others with Allah in His Divinity or worship).&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Anyone who swears by Amanah (trust) is not one of us.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are numerous Hadith on this issue, and it is obligatory for all Muslims not to swear by other than Allah. Again, it is not permissible to swear by any creature, no matter who it may be, according to the Hadith mentioned above as well as other Hadith. Hence, the one who is used to do so should be warned against that and his family members, companions and acquaintances should be warned against that as well. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Anyone among you who sees (an act of) Munkar should change it with his hand; if he could not (do it), he should do so with his tongue; and if he could not, (even) then he should abhor it from his heart, and that is the least (form) of Iman (Faith).</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Related by Muslim in his Sahih Book of Hadith)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, swearing by other than Allah is a form of <strong>minor Shirk</strong> (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship), based on the above quoted Hadith. It could even be a form of <strong>major shirk</strong> if the one taking oath has it in his heart that the one by whom he swears deserves glorification just as Allah deserves it or that he could be worshipped along with Allah, or any other similar disbelieving objectives.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah to endow all the Muslims with protection against that and to grant them understanding of His Religion and safety from all things that could bring about His Wrath; indeed He is All­Hearing, Ever­Near.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">20- The wisdom of creating the universe</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: It has become quite common knowledge that this world came into existence only for the sake of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and that had it not been for his sake, it would not have come into existence. I hope that our grand Shaykh will answer this question and mention related evidence. May Allah reward you richly.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This claim is adopted by some common people who lack proper understanding of the purpose of life. Some people say that the world was created for the sake of Muhammad. They say that were it not for Muhammad (peace be upon him), neither the world nor the people living in it would have been created. This is a false and groundless claim which is based on corrupt understanding. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allah (Exalted be He) created the world so that people would know Him, realize His existence and worship Him Alone (Glorified and Exalted be He)</strong></span>. He created the world and human beings so that His Names and Attributes, His Graciousness and Knowledge would be known and so that He Alone would be obeyed and worshipped with no partner. <strong><span style="color:#000000;">He did not create this world for the sake of Muhammad, Nuh (Noah), Musa (Moses), Isa (Jesus) or any other prophet</span></strong>. Rather, Allah (Exalted be He) created the universe so that He Alone would be worshiped with no partner or associate,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And I (Allah) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone)</span><span style="color:#008000;">. )</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) states that He created mankind so that they would worship Him and not for the sake of Muhammad (peace be upon him), Being one of the prophets, Muhammad (peace be upon him) was also created to worship His Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) states, (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And worship your Lord until there comes unto you the certainty (i.e, death).</span> </strong>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Surah Al-Talaq, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says, (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">It is Allah Who has created seven heavens and of the earth the like thereof (i.e. seven). His Command descends between them (heavens and earth), that you may know that Allah has power over all things, and that Allah surrounds all things in (His) Knowledge</span></strong>. )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) says,(<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them without purpose!</span> </strong>}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) created mankind so that He would be worshipped, obeyed, glorified and so that people may know that He has power over all things and that He disposes of all affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the questioner must realize that the things which he heard are void and groundless. It was not for the sake of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) nor for the sake of any other messenger that Allah (Exalted be He) created the jinn, mankind, the heavens, the earth or other objects. Rather, Allah (Exalted be He) created life and mankind so that He will be worshipped Alone without any partner and that His Names and Attributes are known to everyone. This is the truth of the matter as is indicated by many proofs. <strong><span style="color:#000000;">This is by no means in contradiction with the fact that Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the best and most honorable of men, the last and final Prophet, and the master of the children of Adam</span></strong>. It must be known that Allah (Exalted be He) created him for the purpose of worshipping Him, which is the very purpose for which all mankind was created. Again, Allah (Exalted be He) did not create people for the sake of Muhammad (peace be upon him). At the same time, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the best of all people. Therefore, you must understand this and convey it to others because this matter is very important.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some &#8216;so-called&#8217; scholars and uneducated extremists have misunderstood this matter and this may confuse common Muslims. On the contrary, people of knowledge and far-reaching insight know very well that these are but false claims and that Allah (Glorified be He) created mankind for the purpose of worshipping Him Alone and that they may come to know about His Names and Attributes, like the All-Wise, the All-Knowing, the Hearer, the Answerer of supplications, the One Who has Power overall things, and the One Whose Being, Names and Attributes and Actions are perfect.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Settling in al-Madeenah and the Coming Down of the Rest of the Religious Duties and the Completion of the Religion</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فلما استقر بالمدينة أمر ببقية شرائع الإسلام ، مثل الزكاة والصوم والحج والجهاد ، والأذان ، والأمر بالمعروف والنهي عن المنكر ، وغير ذلك من شرائع الإسلام ، أخذ على هذا عشر سنين ، وبعدها توفي صلوات الله وسلامه عليه ، ودينه باق وهذا دينه ، لا خير إلا دل الأمة عليه ، ولا شر إلا حذرها منه ، والخير الذي دلها عليه التوحيد وجميع ما يحبه الله ويرضاه ، والشر الذي حذر منه الشرك وجميع ما يكرهه الله ويأباه ، بعثه الله إلى الناس كافة ، وافترض الله طاعته على جميع الثقلين الجن والإنس </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">When he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> settled in al-Madeenah, he was ordered with the rest of the prescribed duties of <em>Islaam</em>, such as the <em>zakaat</em>; fasting (<em><u>S</u>awm</em>); <em>Hajj</em>; <em>Jihaad</em>; the <em>adhaan</em>; commanding good and forbidding evil; and the rest of the prescribed duties of <em>Islaam</em>.  He spent ten years establishing that, after which he passed away, may Allaah extol and send blessings of peace upon him. His religion remains and this is his religion.  There is no good except that he directed his nation to it and there is no evil except that he warned them against it.  The good that he guided them to is <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, and all that Allaah loves and is pleased with. The evil which he warned against was <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> and everything that Allaah hates and rejects.  Allaah sent him as a prophet to the whole of mankind, and Allaah made it obligatory upon all of the jinn and mankind to obey him.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنِّي رَسُولُ اللَّهِ إِلَيْكُمْ جَمِيعًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof is His saying, the Most High: «<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: O people! I am the Messenger of Allaah to you all</strong></span>.» [7:158]<sup> [<span style="color:#ff0000;">67</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">67</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This, as has already been explained, means that the <em><u>sh</u>aree`ah</em> came down in stages until it was completed &#8211; and all praise is for Allaah &#8211; before the death of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and before Allaah sent down to him:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِي وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ الْإِسْلَامَ دِينًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>This day, I have completed your religion for you, perfected My blessings upon you, and am pleased with Islaam as your Religion</strong></span>.» [5:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A short period after this <em>aayah</em> came down, the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> passed away; and his religion remains until the establishment of the Hour.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah completed the religion through him and the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِي وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ الْإِسْلَامَ دِينًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>This day, I have completed your religion for you, perfected My blessings upon you, and am pleased with <em>Islaam</em> as your Religion</strong></span>.» [5:3]<sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">68</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">68</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> did not pass away until after Allaah had completed the religion and the favour through him and had sent down to him His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِي وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ الْإِسْلَامَ دِينًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>This day, I have completed your religion for you, perfected My blessings upon you, and am pleased with <em>Islaam</em> as your Religion</strong></span>.» [5:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>aayah</em> came down to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> whilst he was performing the standing in <em>`Arafah</em> during the Farewell Hajj on the Day of <em>Jumu`ah</em>. And he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> lived after it for a short time and then moved on to the highest company (of angels).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he left his nation upon <strong><span style="color:#000000;"><em>al-ma<u>h</u>ajjah al-baydaa</em></span></strong> (the clear white path) whose night is the same as its day; no one deviates from it except that he is destroyed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>aayah</em> contains a testimony from Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, that this religion has been completed and that it covers everything of benefit to the servants and that it contains a solution for all of their issues and problems until the Establishment of the Hour. And that is suitable for every time and place; they do not need any other legislation after it or any other book to come down or any other messenger to be sent after the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>.<strong>            </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, there is no matter to be found and there is no event that will occur until the Day of Resurrection except that in the Legislation revealed to Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> there is a solution for it and the ruling concerning it. However, the matter relates back to who is competent to extract evidence and to derive proof, rulings and issues. If there are to be found <em>ahlul-`ilm</em> (people of knowledge) and people qualified to make <em>ijtihaad</em> (personal deductions in rulings) who fulfill the conditions of <em>ijtihaad</em>, then indeed, this legislation is complete and contains a solution for all problems. Deficiency only comes about from us from the aspect of deficiency in (our) knowledge and inability to fully understand what Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, has sent down &#8211; or from the aspect of desires, that there occurs a case of following of desires which diverts a person away from the Truth. Otherwise this religion is fully suitable and comprehensive and complete. Allaah has sufficed the <em>Islaamic</em> nation with it until the establishment of the hour if it acts upon it (the religion) correctly and refers back to it in its affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَإِن تَنَازَعْتُمْ فِي شَيْءٍ فَرُدُّوهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَالرَّسُولِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So if you disagree about anything then refer it back to Allaah and the Messenger</strong></span>.» [4:59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Referring back to Allaah is to refer back to the Book of Allaah, and referring back to the Messenger after his passing away is to refer back to his <em>Sunnah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا اخْتَلَفْتُمْ فِيهِ مِن شَيْءٍ فَحُكْمُهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">« <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And whatever you disagree about then its judgment is to be referred to Allaah</strong></span>.» [42:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>aayah</em> (from <em>Soorah al-Maa.idah</em>) contains a refutation of those who make accusations against the <em>Islaamic</em> Legislation of its having shortcomings or of its being deficient, (these accusations coming) from the atheists and the evil heretics, or from the “semi students” whose understanding falls short in being able to understand the hidden wisdoms of the <em>Islaamic</em> Legislation. Therefore, these (foolish people) ascribe deficiency to the <em>Islaamic</em> Legislation and they do not know that the deficiency is with themselves alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it (this <em>aayah</em>) contains a refutation against those who accuse the <em>Islaamic</em> Legislation of deficiency and that it does not cover all needs of the servants and all matters of welfare of the servants until the Establishment of the Hour.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or those who say: &#8220;It was specific to a certain olden times,&#8221; &#8211; because there are many ignorant people who, when it is said to them, &#8220;This is the <em>Islaamic</em> ruling,&#8221; they say, &#8220;That was in the time of the Messenger and the initial time. As for now, conditions have changed and the matters have altered; and the legislated rulings were for people who have now passed away and for problems that have come to an end.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They say this, and this is disbelief in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and it is a denial of His Saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>This day, I have completed your religion for you</strong></span>.» [5:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah completed the religion for this nation until the Hour is established for every time and place and for every generation of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also contains a refutation of the innovators, those who introduce worship from themselves and ascribe it to the religion, when it has no proof from the Book of Allaah and the <em>Sunnah</em> of His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>. Rather they just introduce it in accordance with what they deem to be good or based upon blindly following others whom they have good thoughts about from the people of false ideas and people with their own goals and desires. So therefore, they introduce worship into the religion, which Allaah has sent down no proof for. He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">» <strong>من أحدث في أمرنا هذا ما ليس منه فهو رد </strong>«</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Whoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it, then it is rejected</strong></span>.»</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Reported by al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree no. 2697 and Muslim no. 1718 from a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Aa.ishah, <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu `anhaa</em>.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasallaam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">» <strong>وإياكم ومحدثات الأمور فإن كل محدثة بدعة وكل بدعة ضلالة </strong>«</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And beware of newly introduced matters, for every newly introduced matter is an innovation, and every innovation is misguidance</strong>.</span>»</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Reported by Aboo Daawood, A<u>h</u>mad, at-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee, and Ibn Maajah from the famous <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Irbaad ibn Saariyyah, <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu `anhu</em>. (al-Albaanee declared it <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em>) ].</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever introduces acts of worship which have no proof from the Book of Allaah nor from the <em>Sunnah</em> of the Messenger of Allaah, then he is accusing this religion of not being complete and he wishes to complete the religion himself. He is not actually acknowledging the fact that Allaah has completed it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whatever was not religion in the time of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> will never be religion after him. So this contains a refutation of these groups: The group who say that <em>Islaam</em> is not suitable for every time, or those who innovate newly invented innovations which have no proof from the Book of Allaah nor the <em>Sunnah</em> of His Messenger, and who ascribe them to the religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>aayah</em> (from <em>Soorah al-Maa.idah</em>) contains a refutation of them because the religion was completed by Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. So there is no scope for addition in it nor for reduction from it. And there is no scope for raising doubts nor seeking to obscure the issue by saying that it is not suitable for the people in these later times.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>This day, I have completed your religion for you</strong>.</span>» [5:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Speech of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. He is the Most Truthful One of those who speak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِي وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ الْإِسْلَامَ دِينًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And I perfected My blessings upon you, and am pleased with <em>Islaam</em> as your Religion</strong></span>.» [5:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the last of that which came down to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and it is a testimony from the Lord of the whole of the Creation for this religion that it is complete, comprehensive, and fully suitable for every time and place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying (in this <em>aayah</em>) is an address to this nation, from the first of it to the last of it, and it is not just an address to the first generation alone. Rather it is an address to the whole of the nation until the Hour is established.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <em>ijmaa`</em> (consensus), then the whole nation are agreed in consensus that he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> passed away. No one disagrees about this except the people of false beliefs, those who say that the Messenger did not die. They negate death from the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>. This is baseless speech and speech which is clearly rejected. It is refuted by what has been experienced and what is clearly the case, for the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> indeed passed away amongst his Companions. He was bathed, shrouded, had the funeral prayer prayed over him and he was buried. Can these actions be carried out on a person who is still alive?  He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> was treated as one who had died. He was washed and shrouded and prayed over and then he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> was buried in his grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the way of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, with regards to His Creation. And then where are the Messengers who came before him? What occurred to him occurred to the Messengers who came before him. They died. And he is one of them, so he died. This is by consensus of the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah</em>. No one disagrees about this except the people of false beliefs, those who seek to attach themselves to the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and seek deliverance through him besides Allaah, and say: &#8220;He is still alive.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof that he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam </em>died is His saying, the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّكَ مَيِّتٌ وَإِنَّهُم مَّيِّتُونَ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ إِنَّكُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ عِندَ رَبِّكُمْ تَخْتَصِمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O </strong>(Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>)<strong>! You will certainly die and they will certainly die. Then on the Day of Resurrection you will all dispute before your Lord</strong>.</span>» [39:30-31]<sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">69</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">69</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>, when Allaah completed the religion through him and perfected His Favour through him, caused him to die, as is the way of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, with His creation:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">كُلُّ نَفْسٍ ذَائِقَةُ الْمَوْتِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Every soul shall taste death</strong>.</span>» [3:185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophets and the Messengers enter within this generality:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">كُلُّ نَفْسٍ ذَائِقَةُ الْمَوْتِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Every soul shall taste death</strong></span>.» [3:185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam </em>passed away and moved on from this world to his Lord, He the Mighty and Majestic. This is established by the text, by consensus, and by analogy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the textual (proof), then it is His statement, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّكَ مَيِّتٌ وَإِنَّهُم مَّيِّتُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You will certainly die and they will certainly die</strong></span>.» [39:30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is information from Allaah to His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam </em>that he will soon die.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: You are going to die.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is said to a person who is going to die: &#8220;This is a <em>mayyit</em> (person who is going to die).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the person who has actually already died, then it is said about him: &#8216;<em>mayt</em>,&#8217; with a <em>sukoon</em> (on the letter <em>yaa</em> in the middle of the word), because of His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَوَمَن كَانَ مَيْتًا فَأَحْيَيْنَاهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Or one who was <em>mayt </em>(dead) and We gave life to him</strong></span>.» [6:122]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the <em>mayt</em> is the one whose soul has left his body. As for <em>al-mayyit</em>, then he is the one who will die in future.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>Hijrah</em></strong><strong> to al-Madeenah</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وبعدها أمر بالهجرة إلى المدينة</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">After that, he was commanded to perform <em>hijrah</em> to al-Madeenah.</span></strong><sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">62</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">62</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>): «<strong>After that, he was commanded to perform <em>hijrah</em> to al-Madeenah</strong>»: When the harm from the Quray<u>sh</u> became severe and their evil increased on account of their blocking (people) from Allaah’s path, persecuting the Muslims and torturing those who had no group of people to defend them from the Muslims, who were in a state of weakness – then Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, gave permission for the Muslims to make <em>hijrah</em> to Abyssinia &#8211; the first <em>hijrah</em>, because there was a king with whom no one would be oppressed. He was a Christian, however he was just, so a large group of them migrated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Quray<u>sh</u> came to know of their migration to Abyssinia, they sent two representatives from the wise men of Quray<u>sh</u> to seek (that they be brought back). One of them was `Amr ibn al-`Aas. They had with them gifts for an-Najaa<u>sh</u>ee (the ruler of Abyssinia). They said: &#8220;These people have run away from us and they are relatives of ours. We want them to return to us &#8211; and they are evil doers – so that they do not cause corruption in your land,&#8221; to the end (of what they said). They gave him the gifts that they had with them in order to change his mind, however, he (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) called the <em>muhaajireen</em> and listened to what they had to say and he gave them a choice, so they chose to remain in Abyssinia. Therefore, the two representatives went back frustrated. And the <em>muhaajiroon</em> in Abyssinia remained there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, Allaah favoured an-Najaa<u>sh</u>ee and he accepted <em>Islaam</em> and made his <em>Islaam</em> good. When he died, the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and his Companions prayed the funeral prayer for him with the prayer of one whose body is absent. So in migrating to him there was good for him as well; by means of them, Allaah guided him, so he entered into <em>Islaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> met a group from the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em> (the Muslims from al-Madeenah) in <em>Minaa</em> during the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em>; and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi was allam</em> used to present himself to the tribes during the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em>. He would go to the different camping places of the Arabs in <em>Minaa</em> and call them to Allaah. And it happened that he met some men from the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em>, so he called them to Allaah and he explained his call to them. They accepted the call from the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and gave him a pledge upon <em>Islaam</em>. They went back to their people from the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> and called them to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. Then in the next pilgrimage, a larger number came than those who were in the first. Some men from the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em> came and gave the pledge to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi was allam</em>, the second pledge of <em>al-`Aqabah</em>, meaning: at the stoning place of <em>al-`Aqabah</em>. They gave a pledge upon the basis of <em>Islaam</em> and upon the basis of aiding him if he made the migration to them and that they would defend him just as they defended themselves and their (own) children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So then, after this &#8211; meaning, after this blessed pledge &#8211; the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> commanded those Muslims who were in Makkah to perform <em>hijrah</em> (migration) to al-Madeenah; and whoever migrated, migrated to al-Madeenah. And the Messenger and some of his Companions remained. Then Allaah permitted His Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> to migrate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Quray<u>sh</u> became aware of the migration of his Companions to al-Madeenah and they knew of the pledge that had occurred between him and the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em>, they feared that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> would join up with his Companions in al-Madeenah and would therefore, attain power and gain strength.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On this night, when the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> wanted to depart to make <em>hijrah</em>, they came and surrounded his house. They stood outside the door with their weapons, intending to attack Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>. So, Allaah informed His Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> (and) the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> commanded `Alee to sleep upon his bed so that the people of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> could see him and think that he was the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>. So `Alee <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu `anhu</em> slept upon the bed of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and covered himself with the blanket of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the <em>mu<u>sh</u>riks</em> were waiting for him to come out, thinking that he was the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> when in actuality, the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> had already come out between them and they were unaware. Allaah blinded their sight from him, and he took some dust and scattered it upon their heads, and departed from amongst them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He went to Aboo Bakr <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu `anhu</em> and the two of them departed and went to the Cave of <u>Th</u>awr and hid there for three days. The Quray<u>sh</u> were asking the people to catch him by whatever means; alive or dead. So, when they despaired of finding him after looking and searching, they offered rewards for whoever could bring him <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> alive or dead. When they had totally despaired, Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and his Companion left the cave and rode their riding camels and went to al-Madeenah.<em> </em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">والهجرة : الانتقال من بلد الشرك إلى بلد الإسلام </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Hijrah</em> is to move from the land of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> to the land of <em>Islaam</em></strong></span>.<sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">63</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">63</span>] :<strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>al-Hijrah</em> in the (Arabic) language means &#8220;<strong>to abandon something</strong>.&#8221; As for <em>hijrah</em> in the legislation, then it is just as the <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> defined it: &#8220;<strong>to depart from the land of <em>kufr</em> and go to the land of <em>Islaam</em></strong>.&#8221; This is <em>hijrah</em> in the legislation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em>hijrah</em> is a tremendous deed; Allaah has joined it along with <em>jihaad</em> in many <em>aayaat</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> made the <em>hijrah</em> to al-Madeenah, the <em>Muhaajiroon</em>, who had been in Abyssinia, then came to al-Madeenah and the Muslims gathered in al-Madeenah &#8211; and all praise is for Allaah. A state was formed for the Muslims in al-Madeenah, comprising the <em>muhaajiroon</em> and the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em>; and whoever had accepted Islaam would come to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, Allaah legislated the remaining duties of the religion, so He made the fasting obligatory upon His Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>, and the <em>Zakaat</em> in the second year after the <em>hijrah</em> and He made obligatory upon him the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> in the ninth year after the <em>Hijrah</em> according the correct saying. With that, the pillars of <em>Islaam</em> were completed, the first of them being the two testimonies and the last of them being the <em>Hajj</em> to Allaah’s Sacred House.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in summary, we know from this that <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> is the first requirement in calling to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and that the caller begins with it before he begins with the prayer, the fasting, the <em>zakaat</em> or the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em>, because the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> remained for ten years calling to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and forbidding <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>. He was not commanded with prayer and he was not commanded with <em>zakaat</em> nor pilgrimage nor fasting. Rather these obligatory duties were made obligatory after <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> was established.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when he would send out callers, the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> would command them to call the people with the first thing they would call to being <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, just as occurs in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Mu`aadh:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">» إنك تأتي قوما من أهل الكتاب ، فليكن أول ما تدعوهم إليه  شهادة أن لا إله إلا الله وأن محمدا رسول الله ، فإن هم أجابوا لذلك فأعلمهم أن الله افترض عليهم خمس صلوات «<strong> </strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>You are going to a people from the People of the Book. So let the first thing that you call them to be the testimony that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah. If they accept that from you, then inform them that Allaah has made five prayers obligatory upon them&#8230;» </strong>to the end of the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>.</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Reported by al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree no. 1395 and Muslim no. 19 from a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Abdullaah ibn `Abbaas, <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu `anhumaa</em>.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this proves that a person is not commanded with the prayer nor with the <em>zakaat</em> nor with fasting until <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> is established and <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> is present – and that whoever begins with other than <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, then his call will fail and his methodology is contrary to the methodology of the Messengers, all of them <em>`alaihumassalaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of the Messengers began by calling to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and to the correction of <em>`aqeedah</em>. It is important for those who proceed to be aware of this methodology, for there are many people today, who confuse this methodology and change this methodology and choose a different methodology for themselves from their own ideas or from other people who are ignorant. There must be a return to the methodology of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>. This is the benefit of having awareness of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and his <em>seerah</em> and of making this one of the three fundamental principles. You know how he called the people and what was his <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> methodology in calling them, so you can proceed upon it because he <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasalaam</em> is the example to be followed.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Time Period of the Call in Makkah</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أخذ على هذا عشر سنين يدعو إلى التوحيد</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>He carried this out for ten years calling to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em></strong></span>. <sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">60</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">60</span>] :<strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His statement: «<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He carried this out for ten years calling to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em></strong></span>» meaning: He called the people to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and warned against <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> for ten years in Makkah. He was calling to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and forbidding <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>, because they used to direct worship to the idols.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the wisdom in Allaah&#8217;s sending him as a prophet in Makkah was that Makkah is <em>Umm al-Quraa</em> (the mother of all the cities), that to which all the cities relate back to. Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا كَانَ رَبُّكَ مُهْلِكَ الْقُرَىٰ حَتَّىٰ يَبْعَثَ فِي أُمِّهَا رَسُولًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And your Lord would not destroy the townships until He sent a Messenger in their original one</strong></span>.» [28:59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The &#8216;<em>Umm</em>&#8216; is the source to which something relates back to and the foundation which it relates back to; this is the <em>Umm</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">هُنَّ أُمُّ الْكِتَابِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They are the foundation of the Book</strong>.</span>» [3:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: The source to which the <em>aayaat</em> which are <em>muta<u>sh</u>aabihah</em> (unclear) are referred back to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise Makkah has been honored by Allaah, in that it is the original place to which the whole of the people of the Earth resort back, and Muslims in the different regions of the Earth return to Makkah. So it is <em>Umm al-Quraa</em> with the meaning that it is the place of return. Allaah sent His Prophet Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> in Makkah because it is <em>Umm al-Quraa</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He remained in it for thirteen years forbidding the people of Makkah from <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> and commanding them with <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, because the people of Makkah are the example for others besides them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is binding that Makkah should remain, until the establishment of the Hour, as an abode of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and a beacon for the call to Allaah, and everything which conflicts with that must be kept away from it. So, <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>, innovations, and false superstitions must be kept away from it, because the people always look towards it. What is done in it is propagated around the world. So, if what is done in it is good, then good will spread about and if the opposite is the case, then evil will spread.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory that Makkah be kept pure always and for this reason, He, the Majestic and Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَعَهِدْنَا إِلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ أَن طَهِّرَا بَيْتِيَ لِلطَّائِفِينَ وَالْعَاكِفِينَ وَالرُّكَّعِ السُّجُودِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We enjoined Ibraaheem and Ismaa`eel that they should purify My House for those people who make <em>tawwaaf</em>, and those who stay there for worship and those who bow and prostrate</strong>.</span>» [2:125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory that Makkah be purified from everything that conflicts with <em>Islaam</em>, so that the religion can emanate from it and the call to the East and Western parts of the Earth, because Allaah sent His Prophet in it and he began his call <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> remained in Makkah for thirteen years; from them were ten years in which he called to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and forbade from <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> (only) and he was not commanded with anything other than that. He was not commanded with the prayer nor with the <em>zakaat</em> nor with fasting nor with <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> (the Pilgrimage). Rather his call was restricted to warning against <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> and to commanding <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would say to them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>Say that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, you will be successful!</strong>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they would say:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَجَعَلَ الْآلِهَةَ إِلَٰهًا وَاحِدًا ۖ إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَشَيْءٌ عُجَابٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Does he make all the objects of worship a single object of worship? Indeed this is something very strange!</strong></span>» [38:5]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">58</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was born in Makkah <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam </em>and breastfed amongst the tribe of Banoo Sa`d with <strong><u>H</u>aleemah as-Sa`diyyah</strong>. His father, `<strong>Abdullaah</strong>, died whilst he was still in the womb and his mother died a short time after his birth. So he was taken care of by <strong>Umm Ayman al-<u>H</u>abashiyyah</strong> whom he inherited from his father. He came to be under the guardianship of his grandfather, `<strong>Abdul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib</strong>, then `Abdul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib died and his guardianship moved to his paternal uncle, <strong>Aboo <u>T</u>aalib</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam </em>lived for forty years before prophet-hood being well-known for trustworthiness, truthfulness, generosity, for avoiding the worship of idols and avoiding the drinking of <em><u>kh</u>amar</em> (alcohol). He had not used to do what the people of the day of ignorance did, rather he<em> `alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam </em>used to go out to the cave of <u>H</u>iraa and worship in it for days at a time. He would worship Allaah upon the religious way of Ibraaheem upon <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>. Then, when he reached the age of forty  <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasalaam</em>, the revelation came down upon him such that Jibreel came to him whilst he was in the cave of <u>H</u>iraa, and said to him: &#8220;Recite!&#8221; He said: &#8220;I cannot recite,&#8221; &#8211; meaning: I am not able to read. So he pressed him very tightly and then released him and said: &#8220;Recite!&#8221; He said: &#8220;I am not able to recite!&#8221; Then, he pressed him a second time and released him and said: &#8220;Recite!&#8221; He said: &#8220;I cannot recite!&#8221; So, he pressed for third time and  said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">اقْرَأْ بِاسْمِ رَبِّكَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ &#8211; خَلَقَ الْإِنسَانَ مِنْ عَلَقٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Recite! In the Name of your Lord Who created, who created man from a clot of blood</strong>.</span>» [96: 1-2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was his <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam </em>prophet-hood. Allaah made him a prophet through [the <em>aayah</em>] &#8220;<em>Iqra</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, he went to his house shaking from fear, because he had encountered something which he had not known before, an extremely frightening matter. So, he found his wife <u>Kh</u>adijah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu`anha</em>, and she covered him up and calmed him down. She said to him: &#8220;<strong>Know! By Allaah! Allaah will not humiliate you for indeed you maintain the ties of kinship, you show hospitality to the guest, you look after the orphans, and you help people who have been struck by calamities</strong>.&#8221; So, she prepared him and took him to her paternal uncle, Waraqah ibn Nawfal. He was a man who devoted himself to worship and who read the previous scriptures and who worshipped Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. When he informed him of what he had seen, he said: &#8220;This was the spirit who used to descend to Moosaa,&#8221; meaning: Jibreel <em>`alaihisalaam</em>.<strong> </strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Coming Down of the Revelation to him (<em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>)</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>He was sent as a Messenger with <em>al-Mudda<u>th</u>ir</em>. His land was Makkah and he made migration to al-Madeenah. Allaah sent him to warn against <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> and to call to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>. The proof is His saying:</strong></span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الْمُدَّثِّرُ &#8211; قُمْ فَأَنذِرْ &#8211; وَرَبَّكَ فَكَبِّرْ &#8211; وَثِيَابَكَ فَطَهِّرْ &#8211; وَالرُّجْزَ فَاهْجُرْ  &#8211; وَلَا تَمْنُن تَسْتَكْثِرُ &#8211; وَلِرَبِّكَ فَاصْبِرْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">«<strong>O you wrapped </strong>(in garments)<strong>! Arise and warn! And exalt your Lord! And purify your garments! And shun the idols! And do not give anything in order to receive more in return! And patiently persevere for the sake of your Lord!</strong>»</span> [74:1-7] <sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">59</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">59</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There came down to him, His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الْمُدَّثِّرُ &#8211; قُمْ فَأَنذِرْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you wrapped </strong>(in garments)<strong>! Arise and warn!</strong></span>» [74:1-2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was him being sent as a Messenger and this is the meaning of the saying of the <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>He was sent as a Prophet through [the revelation of] <em>Iqra</em>. and he was sent as a Messenger with <em>al-Mudda<u>th</u>ir</em></strong>.»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The difference between a prophet and a Messenger is that a prophet (<em>nabiyy</em>) is one to whom Allaah has revealed way, but he was not commanded to convey it, whereas a <em>rasool</em> (Messenger) is one to whom a revealed way was sent and he was commanded to convey it. The clarification of that is that the Messenger is one to whom a revealed law comes down and a book, so he (<em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>) was sent as a prophet through <em>Iqra.</em> and he was sent as a messenger through <em>al-Mudda<u>th</u>ir</em> at the age of forty. This was the case with the prophets. A prophet is sent with a revealed law and book from before him and he is entrusted with certain duties like the prophets of Banoo Israa`eel who came after Moosaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>al-Mudda<u>th</u>ir</em></strong></span>» means the one who is wrapped up, because he <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam </em>was struck by alarm, so he said: &#8220;Cover me up with garments! Cover me up with garments!&#8221; Meaning: Cover me up. Therefore, Allaah sent down to him:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الْمُدَّثِّرُ &#8211; قُمْ فَأَنذِرْ &#8211; وَرَبَّكَ فَكَبِّرْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you wrapped (in garments)! Arise and warn! And exalt your Lord!</strong></span>» [74:1-3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong>Meaning: Exalt and venerate Him.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَثِيَابَكَ فَطَهِّرْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And purify your garments!</strong></span>» [74:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Purify your deeds from <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>, because a person&#8217;s actions are garments. Allaah, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَىٰ ذَٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the clothing of dutifulness to Allaah, that is better</strong></span>.» [7:26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dutifulness is called clothing.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَالرُّجْزَ فَاهْجُرْ </span></h3>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>«And keep away from <em>Ar-Rujz</em> (the idols)! »</strong></span>[74:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>ar-Rujz</em></strong></span>» <em>ar-Rujz</em> (filth) means the idols.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Shun </strong>[the idols]</span>» meaning: abandon and keep well away from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah raised him as a Prophet at the age of forty and he remained in Makkah for thirteen years, calling the people to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and to the abandonment of the worship of idols. There were many discussions which he had with the people of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>. He suffered harm upon himself and upon those who believed in him and his followers. The people of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> caused many difficulties throughout the thirteen years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Three years before the migration, he was taken on the Night Journey to Jerusalem. He was taken up through the heavens and the five daily prayers were made obligatory upon him. So, he prayed in Makkah for three years. Then, the Quray<u>sh</u> plotted to kill and attack him, so Allaah permitted him to migrate to al-Madeenah. So, he migrated to al-Madeenah after he had met with the An<u>s</u>aar in the first and second pledge of al-`Aqabah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He migrated to al-Madeenah and remained there for ten years. So, altogether, it was twenty-three years [of prophet-hood]. After the prophet-hood, he <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam </em>lived twenty-three years, thirteen years in Makkah laying the foundations of the call to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, and for ten years in al-Madeenah. Then, Allaah took his soul at the age of sixty-three years. So, his life-span in Messenger-ship was twenty-three years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This blessing which Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, sent down upon him, this abundant knowledge, this <em>jihaad</em>, and this establishment which He granted him upon the earth was all in this short time of twenty-three years. This is one of the signs of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, and from the blessings given to the prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>, the blessings of his call and the blessings of the revelation which was sent down to him. And before all of this, it came about through the aid of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. He is the One who helped him. He is the One who defended him and aided him until he conveyed His call to the East and the West. All praise is for Allaah, the Lord of the whole of creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying: «<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allaah sent him to warn against <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> and to call to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em></strong></span>» This is his call <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>, warning against <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> and calling to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>. And this is what is obligatory for the <em>du`aat</em> (callers) to precede upon in their call, that they should focus upon warning against <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> and calling to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> before everything, otherwise their call will not be upon the <em>manhaj</em> (methodology) of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah sent the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> with warning against <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> and calling to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, so it is essential to lay this foundation down first of all. After that, the person can direct his attention to the rest of the matters, since matters will not be correct and sound except with the presence of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>. If all of the people were to abandon <em>zinaa</em> (fornication), intoxicants, stealing, and they took on every virtuous quality from deeds and behavior, but did not abandon <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>, there would be no benefit in these matters and it will not benefit them. Whereas, if the people were to remain free of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>, but had major sins less than <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>, then there is hope for such a person that Allaah will either forgive him or punish him in accordance with the level of his sins. But his final destination will be to Paradise because he is a person of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>.<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em> is the fundamental basis and foundation. There is no salvation except with the presence of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> firstly. Therefore, it is obligatory to concentrate and always give attention to it and to call the people to it and to teach it to the people and to explain it to them, what is the meaning of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and what is the meaning of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>. The Muslim must be aware of this matter and attain certainty concerning it. He should check himself so that he does not fall into anything from <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> or infringe <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>. This matter is essential and the <em>da`wah</em> must proceed upon this basis.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The meaning of «<strong>Arise and warn</strong>!» is to warn against <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> and call to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>. «<strong>And exalt your Lord</strong>!» meaning: venerate Him with <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>. «<strong>And purify your garments</strong>!» meaning: purify your deeds from <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>. «<strong>And shun <em>ar-rujz</em></strong>» <em>ar-rujz</em> means the idols and «<strong>shunning</strong>» meaning: abandoning them and disassociating from them and their people.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Third Fundamental Principle:<br />
Knowledge About Our Prophet Mu<u>h</u>ammad &#8211;<em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam<br />
</em><strong>His Name, His Lineage, and His Early Life </strong></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الأصل الثالث : معرفة نبيكم محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The third fundamental principle: Knowledge about your Prophet Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em></span></strong>.<sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">56</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">56</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying: «<strong>The third fundamental principle</strong>» meaning: from the three fundamental principles, because the <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) has mentioned at the start of the treatise that it is obligatory upon every Muslim male and female to have knowledge of these three fundamental principles, and they are: knowledge of Allaah, knowledge of the religion of <em>Islaam</em>, and knowledge about His Prophet Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> with the evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the first and second fundamental principles, then a clarification of them has preceded and an explanation of their evidences.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third fundamental principle</strong>: It is knowledge about the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em>, because of the fact that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> is an intermediary between Allaah and His creation with regard to conveying His Religion and His Message. Therefore, it is obligatory to know about him, <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasalaam</em>.  Otherwise, how could you follow a person whom you do not know of?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, you must know about him with regard to his name, the land he was born and grew up in, the land to which he migrated and that you know the extent of his lifespan <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasalaam</em>. And the phases of his life, <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasalaam</em> and the phases of the time period which he was sent in this world. That you also know what occurred before Prophet-hood and after it and before the migration, and after it. That you know how the revelation first came to him, <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasalaam</em> and when the revelation began, and what is the <em>aayah</em> which proves his Prophet-hood and the <em>aayah</em> which proves His Messenger-ship. That you can quote the <em>aayahs </em>which prove His Prophet-hood and the <em>aayahs </em>which prove His Messenger-ship. You must know this; that you know his lineage and which tribe he was from, because the Arabs are made of tribes and he was an Arab without any doubt. So, knowledge of these matters is essential about the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> through studying the <em>aayahs</em> and the <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> which are connected to these matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And you look into the life of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alayhi wa sallam</em> and his call, in order that you should know these matters about your Prophet whom you are commanded to follow and take as an example.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">This is his name and lineage. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>His name is Mu<u>h</u>ammad</strong> </span><em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasalaam</em>. He has other names besides Mu<u>h</u>ammad. However, the most famous one of his names is Mu<u>h</u>ammad and Allaah mentioned that in the Qur.aan in a number of <em>aayahs</em>.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مُّحَمَّدٌ رَّسُولُ اللَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah</strong></span>» [48:29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا مُحَمَّدٌ إِلَّا رَسُولٌ قَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِهِ الرُّسُلُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And Mu<u>h</u>ammad is not except a Messenger, Messengers have passed away before him</strong></span>.» [3:144]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَّا كَانَ مُحَمَّدٌ أَبَا أَحَدٍ مِّن رِّجَالِكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Mu<u>h</u>ammad is not the father of any of your men</strong></span>.» [33:40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And those who have <em>eemaan </em></strong>(truly believe)<strong> and perform righteous deeds, and believe in that which was sent down upon Mu<u>h</u>ammad </strong>(<em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em>)<strong>, for it is the truth from their Lord</strong></span>.» [40:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah mentioned his name Mu<u>h</u>ammad in a number of <em>aayaahs</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">From his names is A<u>h</u>mad</span></strong>. Allaah mentioned in His saying regarding the glad tidings given by al-Masee<u>h</u> <em>`alaihissalaam</em>:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِذْ قَالَ عِيسَى ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ يَا بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ إِنِّي رَسُولُ اللَّهِ إِلَيْكُم مُّصَدِّقًا لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيَّ مِنَ التَّوْرَاةِ وَمُبَشِّرًا بِرَسُولٍ يَأْتِي مِن بَعْدِي اسْمُهُ أَحْمَدُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And remember when `Eesaa ibn Maryam, said: &#8220;O Children of Israa.eel! I am Allaah&#8217;s Messenger to you confirming what came before me from the <em>Tauraat</em>, and giving glad tidings of a Messenger who will come after me, whose name will be A<u>h</u>mad</strong></span>.» [61:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, he is Mu<u>h</u>ammad and A<u>h</u>mad. The meaning of that is one abundant in praise, `<em>alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wa salaam</em>, and abundant in attributes for which he is to be praised.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>From his names are: the Prophet of Mercy (نبي الرحمة), the Prophet of Great War (نبي الملحمة)</strong></span> &#8211; meaning <em>jihaad</em> in Allaah&#8217;s Cause &#8211; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>the one after whom the people will be resurrected (الحاشر)</strong></span>, and <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>the final Prophet (والعاقب)</strong></span>, <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasalaam</em>. The one who is such that the people will be resurrected after his being sent as a Prophet, because he is the last of the Messengers, <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>. So, there is nothing after him except for the establishment of the Hour. After his Messenger-ship, the Hour will be established and the people will be resurrected for recompensing and accounting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever wants to get knowledge of these matters (Names and Meanings) , let him refer back to the Book <em>Jalaa.ul-Afhaam fee a<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>alaati was-Salaam `alaa <u>Kh</u>ayril-Anaam</em> of the <em>Imaam</em> Ibnul-Qayyim (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As for his lineage:</strong></span> He is Mu<u>h</u>ammad, the son of `Abdullaah, the son of `Abdul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib, the son of Haa<u>sh</u>im, the son of `Abdul-Manaaf, the son of Qusay, the son of Kilaab.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was from the tribe of Quray<u>sh</u> which is the noblest of the tribes, and Quray<u>sh</u> are from the descendants of Ismaa`eel <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasalaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabs are of two categories upon the most famous saying:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The original Arabs: They were the descendants of <strong>Qah<u>t</u>aan</strong>.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The assimilated Arabs: They were the descendants of `<strong>Adnaan</strong> from the descendants of Ismaa`eel `<em>alaihissalaam</em>, the son of Ibraaheem, <em>al-<u>Kh</u>aleel</em>,<em> `alaihissalaam</em>. They were called <em>al-Musta`rabah</em> (the assimilated Arabs) because they learned the Arabic language from the original Arabs.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the tribe of <em>Jurhum</em> came and settled in Makkah beside Haajir, the mother of Ismaa`eel and her son Ismaa`eel whilst he was young &#8211; when they found the well of <em>Zamzam</em>, they settled there and made an agreement with Haajir that they should settle beside her and that she should permit them to take water from the well. Ismaa`eel <em>`alaihissalaam </em>was a suckling infant at that time, then he grew older and took the Arabic language from the tribe of Jurhum, and they were from the original Arabs. He married from the tribe of Jurhum and descendants came from him who learnt the Arabic language. They grew up with the Arabs and became Arabs themselves by assimilation. They are the descendants of `Adnaan. As for the original Arabs, then they are the descendants of Qah<u>t</u>aan whose origin was from Yemen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the scholars said: The original Arabs themselves were of two categories: Arabs who became extinct and Arabs who remained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabs who became extinct were the ones who were destroyed. They were the people of Noo<u>h</u>, `Aad, and <u>Th</u>amood, and <u>Sh</u>u`ayb.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the remaining Arabs, then they are those who are divided into the original Arabs and the assimilated Arabs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> was from the descendants of Haa<u>sh</u>im (the tribe of Haa<u>sh</u>im), and Haa<u>sh</u>im was from the descendants of Ismaa`eel, <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wa salaam</em>. His name was Mu<u>h</u>ammad, the son of `Abdullaah, the son of `Abdul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And [regarding] `Abdul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib, this was not his name, his name was <u>Sh</u>aybah. However, he was called `Abdul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib because his paternal uncle, al-Mu<u>tt</u>alib, the son of Manaaf, brought him from al-Madeenah whilst he was little from his maternal uncles, Banoo an-Najaar. So, when the people saw him being dark from travelling, they thought he was a slave owned by al-Mu<u>tt</u>alib. So, they said: `Abdul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib (the slave of Mu<u>tt</u>alib), the son of Haa<u>sh</u>im, the son of `Abdul-Manaaf. `Abdul-Manaaf had four sons: Haa<u>sh</u>im who was the grandfather of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em>, al-Mu<u>tt</u>alib, `Abd-<u>Sh</u>ams, and Nawfal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Banoo Haa<u>sh</u>im are called the <em>Haa<u>sh</u>imiyyoon</em> and Banoo Mu<u>tt</u>alib are called the <em>Mu<u>tt</u>allibiyyoon</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for  `Abd-<u> Sh</u>ams, then from them was `U<u>th</u>maan &#8211;<em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu `anh</em> and Banoo `Umay-yah. They were all from `Abd-<u> Sh</u>ams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Nawfal, he had descendents, from them: Jubayr bin Mut`im and <u>H</u>akeem ibn <u>H</u>izaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibraaheem <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasalaam </em>had Ismaa`eel and he was the eldest. He is the grandfather of the Arab descendants of `Adnaan. And Is<u>h</u>aaq is the grandfather of the children of Israa.eel, and all of the Prophets were from the descendants of Is<u>h</u>aaq, except for our Prophet <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasalaam</em>, he was from the descendants of Ismaa`eel, he was the final prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As for his birth:</strong> </span>He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> was born in the year of the elephant. It is the year when Abrahah, the King of Yemen came towards Makkah. He was sent on a mission by the (christian) King of the Abyssinians to demolish the <em>Ka`bah</em>. With him, there was a very large elephant, so when he reached the place which is called <em>al-Mu<u>gh</u>amas</em>, nothing remained except for him to enter Makkah and demolish the <em>Ka`bah</em>. The people of Makkah had already separated and climbed into the mountains because they had no strength to oppose him. So, he wanted to go on to the <em>Ka`bah</em>, but the elephant was held back and it refused to get up from the ground. Allaah held it back. When he turned it in the direction other than the direction of Makkah, it would get up and trod. And when he pointed it in the direction of Makkah, it was prevented and unable to walk, and whilst they were in that condition, they saw two flocks of birds coming from the direction of the ocean and they had with them stones. Each bird had two stones with it, a stone in its beak and a stone between its feet. They threw these little stones down and they would strike the head of the man and it would come out from his anus and split him in two halves. So, Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, destroyed him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah sent down, with regard to that, reminding the Quray<u>sh</u>, <em>Sooratul-Feel</em>:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَلَمْ تَرَ كَيْفَ فَعَلَ رَبُّكَ بِأَصْحَابِ الْفِيلِ &#8211; أَلَمْ يَجْعَلْ كَيْدَهُمْ فِي تَضْلِيلٍ &#8211; وَأَرْسَلَ عَلَيْهِمْ طَيْرًا أَبَابِيلَ &#8211; تَرْمِيهِم بِحِجَارَةٍ مِّن سِجِّيلٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do you not see how your Lord dealt with the Companions of the Elephant? Did He not make their plan go astray? And He sent against them birds, in flocks, striking them with stones of clay</strong></span>.» [105:1-4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[The stones were] from Hell, and Allaah&#8217;s refuge is sought.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَجَعَلَهُمْ كَعَصْفٍ مَّأْكُولٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So He made them like straws of corn devoured</strong>.</span>» [105:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They became like dry straw which have been eaten by animals and excreted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the story of the elephant, so Allaah defended His Sacred House and destroyed this tyrant Abrahah, and in this year, Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> was born. There appeared along with his birth signs; light appeared along with him which caused the castles of <u>Sh</u>aam to shine. In the night of his birth, the idols shook. The throne room of <em>Kisraa</em> (the emperor of Persians) shook and some balconies from it fell down in the night the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> was born. These were signs of the descending of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> as a Prophet. The devils were thrown into commotion in that tremendous night.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was born in the mountain-pass of `Alee, he was born in Makkah (close to the Ka&#8217;bah) . However, the precise location of the house is not confirmed.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Proof for the testification that &#8216;Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah&#8217; is His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَقَدْ جَاءَكُمْ رَسُولٌ مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ عَزِيزٌ عَلَيْهِ مَا عَنِتُّمْ حَرِيصٌ عَلَيْكُم بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ رَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There has indeed come to you a Messenger from Allaah from amongst yourselves; it grieves him that you undergo suffering. He is eager and anxious for your guidance and he is full of compassion and mercy for the believers. </strong></span>[9:128]<strong> </strong><span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>37</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">37</span>] : <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first pillar of the pillars of Islaam is composed of two matters:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first:</strong> The testification <em>Laa ilaaha illaAllaah</em> (none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah).</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second: </strong>The testification &#8216;<em>Mu<u>h</u>ammadan rasoolullaah</em>&#8216; (Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah).</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these two are a single pillar. The first part means making ones worship purely and sincerely. And the second part means following the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof for the testification that &#8216;Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah&#8217; is His saying: <em> </em></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَقَدْ جَاءَكُمْ رَسُولٌ مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ عَزِيزٌ عَلَيْهِ مَا عَنِتُّمْ حَرِيصٌ عَلَيْكُم بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ رَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There has indeed come to you a Messenger from Allaah from amongst yourselves; it grieves him that you undergo suffering. He is eager and anxious for your guidance and he is full of compassion and mercy for the believers. </strong></span>[9:128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proofs for the testification that &#8216;Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah&#8217; are many in the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, as well as the amazing miracles which prove his <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>&#8216;s Messenger-ship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the Book is this <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَقَدْ جَاءَكُمْ رَسُولٌ مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ عَزِيزٌ عَلَيْهِ مَا عَنِتُّمْ حَرِيصٌ عَلَيْكُم بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ رَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There has indeed come to you a Messenger from Allaah from amongst yourselves; it grieves him that you undergo suffering. He is eager and anxious for your guidance and he is full of compassion and mercy for the believers. </strong></span>[9:128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a witness from Allaah for this Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>, for his Messenger-ship and it is an description of his characteristics.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَقَدْ جَاءَكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There has indeed come to you.</span> </strong>[9:128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>&#8216;Laam&#8217;</em> is a <em>Laam</em> to indicate an oath. So therefore, it carries along with it an oath which is understood (in the meaning) and is taken to be <em>wallaahi</em> (by Allaah) &#8216;there has certainly come to you.&#8217;</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قَدْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">is a particle for confirmation and emphasis.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">جَاءَكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He has come to you.</strong></span> [9:128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Mankind! This is an address to the whole of mankind, because his <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>&#8216;s Messenger-ship was general to all of the <em>thaqalayn</em> (two species), mankind and <em>jinn</em>.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">رَسُولٌ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">A Messenger</span>. </strong>[9:128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was one who had a revealed law sent to him by revelation and he was commanded to convey it. He was called a Messenger because he was <em>mursal</em> (sent) with a Message by Allaah the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>From your own selves. </strong></span>[9:128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From your own species and your own type, from human-kind. He was not an angel from the angels. And this was the Way of Allaah the Perfect and Most High &#8211; that He would send to mankind, Messengers from them, in order to make their affair clear and in order for them to speak with them and because they would know them. If He had sent, as a Messenger to them, an angel, they would have not been able to speak with him because he would have not been from their type of being. Also, they would have not be able to see the angel, because he would have not been from their type of being. So from His Mercy, He the Perfect and Most High, is that He sent as a Messenger to mankind a Messenger from their own type. Indeed he was from the Arabs, and from the most noble of the houses of the Arabs in lineage, from the tribe of Baanee Haashim, who are the most honorable in lineage of Quraysh, and Quraysh are the most honorable of the Arabs in lineage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, he was the specially chosen from the best of people. They knew him and they knew of his personality, his lineage, tribe, and his town. If they had not known him, then how could they attest to his truthfulness? And if he came with other than their language, then how could they understand his speech?</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">عَزِيزٌ عَلَيْهِ مَا عَنِتُّمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">It grieves him greatly that you should suffer</span>. </strong>[9:128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">عَزِيزٌ عَلَيْهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: It troubled him <em><u>s</u>allallaahu‘alaihiwasallam</em>.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَا عَنِتُّمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Whatever troubles you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Inconvenience and hardship. The Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu‘alaihiwasallam</em> was troubled by whatever caused trouble to his nation. He had not used to want hardship for them. Rather, he wanted ease and easiness. And therefore, his revealed law <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>came as something easy and easy-going.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>, said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">بعثت بالحنيفية السمحة</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>I was sent with the Straight and true religion; the religion of ease.</strong>[<span style="color:#999999;">1] [2]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[1] Ahmad (5/266). </span><span style="color:#999999;">[2] Reported by Ahmad 23/623 (22291) from the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of Abu Umaamah Al-Baahilee, <em>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>. [Shaikh Al-Albaanee declared this <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> as strong in <em>As-Sa<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah </em>no. 2924]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا جَعَلَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِي الدِّينِ مِنْ حَرَجٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And He did not place upon you any hardship in the religion</span>. </strong>[22:78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَا يُرِيدُ اللَّهُ لِيَجْعَلَ عَلَيْكُم مِّنْ حَرَجٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah does not wish to place any hardship upon you</span>. </strong>[5:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His revealed Way is easy, it goes along with the capability of the people and with what those given duties, are able to do, and it does not burden them with things they are not capable of. Therefore, the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> used to love to make things easy for them. He was never given a choice between two matters except that he chose the easiest one of the two as long as it was not sinful. He used to love to perform an action but he would leave it out of compassion for his Nation. He would leave the action even though he loved it, from the righteous deeds in order that he should not put difficulty upon his nation. These were from his characteristics, that whatever caused difficulty for his nation was a difficulty he felt himself, and he would become pleased with whatever was pleasing to them, and he would be joyful with whatever caused them to be joyful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever has these as his characteristics, then there is no doubt that he will not bring except that which is <em>khayr</em> (good) and <em>Ra<u>h</u>mah</em> (mercy), <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">حَرِيصٌ عَلَيْكُم</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">He is eager and anxious for you</span>. </strong>[9:128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: For your guidance and that you are taken out from the darkness into the light. Therefore, he himself bore difficulty in calling the people, seeking that they should be guided, and seeking to take them out from darkness into light to such an extent that Allaah said to him:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَعَلَّكَ بَاخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ أَلَّا يَكُونُوا مُؤْمِنِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Perhaps you will destroy yourself with grief that they are not believing. </strong></span>[26:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Perhaps you would bring about your own destruction that they do not believe, because of grief. So do not grieve for them. And this was from the completeness of his sincerity, <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em>.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">He was compassionate and merciful towards the believers.</span> </strong>[9:128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: <em>ra’oof </em>is from<em> ra&#8217;fah</em> (compassion), and it means tenderness and kindness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: He described him with <em>Ra<u>h</u>mah</em> (mercy), so he was not harsh.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَبِمَا رَحْمَةٍ مِّنَ اللَّهِ لِنتَ لَهُمْ ۖ وَلَوْ كُنتَ فَظًّا غَلِيظَ الْقَلْبِ لَانفَضُّوا مِنْ حَوْلِكَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So by mercy from Allaah you were gentle with them, and if you had been severe and hard-hearted, they would have dispersed from around you</span>. </strong>[3:159]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He  <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em> was humble and gentle with the believers, he would lower his wing in gentleness, and he would meet them with a smiling face, and love, affection, and fine treatment. These were from his  <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em> characteristics.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah mentioned five attributes for this Messenger  <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: He was from amongst you.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: He was troubled by whatever troubled you.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: He was eager and anxious for you.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth</strong>: He was compassionate towards the believers.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifth</strong>: He was merciful.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Five characteristics from the characteristics of this Prophet  <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em>. And compassion and mercy were mentioned specifically for the believers since he  <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em><em> </em>was stern upon the people of <em>shirk</em> and the obstinate and willful rejecters of the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would become angry for that which angered Allaah the Perfect and Most High, just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ جَاهِدِ الْكُفَّارَ وَالْمُنَافِقِينَ وَاغْلُظْ عَلَيْهِمْ ۚ وَمَأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ ۖ وَبِئْسَ الْمَصِيرُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O Prophet! Strive against the unbelievers and the hypocrites, and be stern against them. And their dwelling place will be the Hell-Fire, what an evil destination! </strong></span>[9:73]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The mercy and compassion was specific for the believers. Likewise the believers are to be the same with each other.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مُّحَمَّدٌ رَّسُولُ اللَّهِ ۚ وَالَّذِينَ مَعَهُ أَشِدَّاءُ عَلَى الْكُفَّارِ رُحَمَاءُ بَيْنَهُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah and those who are with him are stern against the unbelievers, merciful amongst themselves</span>. </strong>[48:29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These were his <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em> characteristics.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَمَنْ أَطَاعَهُ دَخَلَ الجَنَّةَ وَمَنْ عَصَاهُ دَخَلَ النَّارَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>So whoever obeys him will enter paradise, and whoever disobeys him will enter the fire.<sup>5</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih Al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>Whoever obeys him</strong>”: meaning in that which he commands, then he will enter paradise. And his saying, “<strong>And whoever disobeys him</strong>”: in that which he forbade, then he will enter the fire. This is something for which there is a great deal of confirmation in the Qur’aan. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَّن يُطِعِ الرَّسُولَ فَقَدْ أَطَاعَ اللَّهَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Whoever obeys the Messenger, then he has indeed obeyed Allaah. </strong></span>[4:80]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا أَرْسَلْنَا مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلَّا لِيُطَاعَ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We did not send any Messenger except that he should be obeyed by the permission of Allaah. </strong></span>[4:64]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِن تُطِيعُوهُ تَهْتَدُوا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And if you obey him </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the Prophet </span><span style="color:#008000;"><em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em></span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> you will be rightly guided</span>. </strong>[24:54]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> وَأَطِيعُوا الرَّسُولَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And obey the Messenger that you may be shown mercy. </strong></span>[24:56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever obeys him is guided, and will enter paradise, and whoever disobeys him will be astray and will enter the fire. He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">كلكم يدخل الجنة إلا من أبى ، قالوا : يا رسول الله ومن يأبى ؟ قال : من أطاعني دخل الجنة ومن عصاني فقد أبى</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“All of you will enter paradise except for those who refuse.” They said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, and who will refuse?’ He said, “Whoever obeys me enters paradise and whoever disobeys me has refused.”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong>So his <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> saying, “<strong>He has refused</strong>”: means he will have refused to enter paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لا يسمع بي يهودي ولا نصراني ثم لا يؤمن بالذي جئت به إلا دخل النار</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“No-one will hear of me, no Jew nor any Christian, and then not believe in that which I came with except that he will enter the fire.”<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever obeys him will enter paradise and whoever disobeys him will enter the fire, and this is the distinguishing factor between the true believer and between the disbeliever.</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّا أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَيْكُمْ رَسُولًا شَاهِدًا عَلَيْكُمْ كَمَا أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ رَسُولًا</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَعَصَىٰ فِرْعَوْنُ الرَّسُولَ فَأَخَذْنَاهُ أَخْذًا وَبِيلًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We sent a Messenger to you as a witness for or against you, just as we sent a Messenger to the Pharaoh. But the Pharaoh disobeyed the Messenger so we seized him with a severe punishment. </strong></span>[73:15-16] <span style="color:#993300;"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih Al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And the proof</strong>”: meaning for the sending of the Messenger is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">We sent a Messenger to you as a witness for or against you, just as we sent a Messenger to the Pharaoh. But the Pharaoh disobeyed the Messenger so we seized him with a severe punishment</span>. </strong>[73:15-16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High, “<em>Innaa</em>”, the pronoun here (meaning ‘We’) refers to Allaah the Perfect and Most High and this is a pronoun of one declaring his own greatness, because He is indeed Tremendous, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“We sent”, likewise this pronoun is to show greatness, and the meaning of, <em>“arsalnaa</em>”, is We sent him and sent revelation to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word, “<em>ilaykum</em>”, (to you people), meaning O two weighty species (mankind and the <em>jinn</em>). It is an address to the whole of mankind, because the <em>risaalah</em> (messengership) of this Messenger is universal to all of mankind until the Hour is established.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<em>Rasoolan</em>”, (a Messenger), he is Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam.</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the phrase:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> شَاهِدًا عَلَيْكُمْ كَمَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>As a witness upon you </strong></span>[73:15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: with Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, on the Day of Resurrection, a witness that he conveyed to you the message of Allaah, and that he established the proof upon you, just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">رُّسُلًا مُّبَشِّرِينَ وَمُنذِرِينَ لِئَلَّا يَكُونَ لِلنَّاسِ عَلَى اللَّهِ حُجَّةٌ بَعْدَ الرُّسُلِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah sent Messengers as bringers of glad tidings for the obedient ones, and as warners for the disobedient ones, so that no plea should remain with the people with Allaah, after the sending of the Messengers. </strong></span>[4:165]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So no-one on the Day of Resurrection will be able to say, “I did not know that I was created for worship, I did not know what was obligatory upon me, I did not know what was forbidden for me”. It will not be possible for someone to say this, because the Messengers <em>‘alaihimu<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> conveyed the message to them, and this nation of Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam, </em>it will bear witness against them. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَكَذَٰلِكَ جَعَلْنَاكُمْ أُمَّةً وَسَطًا لِّتَكُونُوا شُهَدَاءَ عَلَى النَّاسِ وَيَكُونَ الرَّسُولُ عَلَيْكُمْ شَهِيدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And likewise We made you the best and a justly balanced nation so that you should be witnesses against mankind, and the Messenger should be a witness upon you. </strong></span>[2:143]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this nation will bear witness against the previous nations on the Day of Resurrection that their Messengers conveyed the messages of Allaah to them, based upon what they find in the Book of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, because Allaah has narrated to us the news of the previous nations and of the Messengers and of what they said to their nations. All of this we know from the Book of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, which is not approached by falsehood from in front nor from behind, which is revelation sent down by the One who is All-Wise, the One Deserving of All Praise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the Messenger he will be … </strong></span>[2:143]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam, </em>he will be upon you, O nation of Mu<u>h</u>ammad, a witness, he will witness upon you with Allaah that he indeed established the proof upon you and that he conveyed the message to you and that he sincerely advised you for Allaah’s sake. So no proof will remain on the Day of Resurrection for a person to say, “Nothing reached me. No warner came to me”. Even the unbelievers, they will confess when they are thrown into the fire. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">كُلَّمَا أُلْقِيَ فِيهَا فَوْجٌ سَأَلَهُمْ خَزَنَتُهَا أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ نَذِيرٌ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قَالُوا بَلَىٰ قَدْ جَاءَنَا نَذِيرٌ فَكَذَّبْنَا وَقُلْنَا مَا نَزَّلَ اللَّهُ مِن شَيْءٍ إِنْ أَنتُمْ إِلَّا فِي ضَلَالٍ كَبِيرٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Whenever a crowd of them are thrown into the fire its keepers will ask them, “Did not a warner come to you?” They will say, “Yes indeed a warner came to us, but we denied, and we said Allaah did not send down anything, you are upon great misguidance.” </strong></span>[67:8-9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said to the Messengers, “You are upon misguidance.” So they denied the Messengers and they declared them to be upon misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the wisdom in the sending of the Messengers – to establish the proof upon the people, and to guide whomever Allaah wished to guide. The Messengers, Allaah guides through them whoever He wishes, and He establishes the proof upon those who obstinately refuse and deny and disbelieve.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">كَمَا أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ رَسُولًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Just as we sent a Messenger to Pharaoh</strong></span> [73:15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger here is Moosaa <em>‘alaihissalaatu wassalaam </em>and the Pharaoh, he was the tyrannical king in Egypt the one who claimed lordship for himself, and the Pharaoh was the title of every king of Egypt – he was called a Pharaoh. And what is meant by it here is the Pharaoh who claimed <em>ruboobiyyah</em> (lordship) for himself.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَقَالَ أَنَا رَبُّكُمُ الْأَعْلَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">That he said: “I am you highest lord.”</span> </strong>[79:24]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَعَصَىٰ فِرْعَوْنُ الرَّسُولَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So the Pharaoh disobeyed the Messenger </strong></span>[73:16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was Moosaa, Pharaoh disbelieved in him just as Allaah has narrated in His Book, narrating what occurred between Moosaa and the Pharaoh, and how the affair of the Pharaoh and his people ended up.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> فَأَخَذْنَاهُ أَخْذًا وَبِيلًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So we seized him with punishment</span> </strong>[73:16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: We seized Pharaoh with punishement and it was that Allaah drowned him, him and his people, in the ocean. Then he entered him into the fire.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مِّمَّا خَطِيئَاتِهِمْ أُغْرِقُوا فَأُدْخِلُوا نَارًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Because of their sins they were drowned, and they were entered into fire</span>. </strong>[71:25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he is in the fire in the <em>Barzakh</em> (the intermediate life after death and before the Day of Resurrection). He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">النَّارُ يُعْرَضُونَ عَلَيْهَا غُدُوًّا وَعَشِيًّا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The fire, they are exposed to it morning and evening </strong></span>[40:46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is in the <em>Barzakh</em> before the hereafter, they are exposed to the fire morning and evening, until the Hour is established, and this is a proof for <em>‘Adhaab-ul-Qabr</em> (punishment of the grave), and Allaah’s refuge is sought.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَيَوْمَ تَقُومُ السَّاعَةُ أَدْخِلُوا آلَ فِرْعَوْنَ أَشَدَّ الْعَذَابِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And on the Day when the Hour is established it will be said, “Enter the people of Pharaoh into the severest torment.</strong></span> [40:46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is three punishments:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: that Allaah drowned them and wiped them out, all of them in a simgle moment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: that they are being punished in the <em>Barzakh </em>until the hour is established.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly</strong>: that when they are raised up on the Day of Resurrection they will enter the severest torment, and Allaah’s refuge is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise will be the case with those who disobey Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam, </em>for his outcome will be more severe than the outcome of the people of Pharaoh, because Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the most excellent one of the Messengers. So whoever disobeys him, his punishment will be worse.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> أَخْذًا وَبِيلًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>With severe punishment </strong></span>[73:16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It means severe and strong with no leniency.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَكَذَٰلِكَ أَخْذُ رَبِّكَ إِذَا أَخَذَ الْقُرَىٰ وَهِيَ ظَالِمَةٌ ۚ إِنَّ أَخْذَهُ أَلِيمٌ شَدِيدٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And thus is the punishment of your Lord when He punishes the towns for their wrongdoing. His punishment is painful and severe</span>.</strong> [11:102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this <em>aayah</em> is a proof for Allaah’s bestowing favour upon us by the sending of the Messenger Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu‘alaihiwasallam </em>to us, and that the purpose behind his being sent is that he should make clear to us the way to worship. So whoever obeys him will enter paradise, and whoever disobeys him will enter the fire, just as the people of Pharoah entered the fire when the disobeyed their messenger Moosaa <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam.</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise the enemies of the Messengers, all of them, this is their way and their path.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَهُوَ مَعْرِفَةُ اللهِ ، <sup> </sup>وَمَعْرِفَةُ نَبِيِّهِ <sup>  </sup></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><sup> </sup>And it is knowledge and awareness of Allaah and knowledge of His Prophet<sup>5</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And it is knowledge and awareness of Allaah</strong>”: How does the servant come to have knowledge and awareness of his Lord? He knows of Him through His Signs and His created things, so from His Signs are the night and the day, and from those things which He has created are the sun and the moon, as will be explained later on <em>inshaa’ Allaah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He knows of Allaah by means of His <strong><em>Aayaat-ul-Kawneeyah</em></strong> (Signs within the creation) and His <strong><em>Aayaat-ul-Qur’aaneeyah</em></strong> (The aayahs of His Qur’aan). If he recites the Qur’aan, then He knows that Allaah the Perfect and Most High – He is the One who created the heavens and the earth and that He is the One who made subservient whatever is within the heavens and the earth, and that He is the One who gives life and gives death, and that He has full Ability over everything, and that He is <em>Ar-Ra<u>h</u>maan </em>the Extremely Merciful One, and <em>Ar-Ra<u>h</u>eem</em> the One Who bestows mercy. So the Qur’aan provides knowledge and awareness of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and that He is the One Who bestowed all favours upon us, and that He is the One who created us and gives us provision, so if you recite the Qur’aan, then you will know your Lord, the Perfect and Most High, by way of His Names and His Attributes and His Actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if you look into the creation, then you will know and be aware of your Lord, the Perfect and Most High – that He is the One Who created this creation, and who made this creation subservient, and Who caused it to proceed by His Wisdom and His Knowledge – He the Perfect and Most High; this is knowledge of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And knowledge of His Prophet</strong>”: he is Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ’alaihi wa sallam</em>, because he was the one who conveyed the message from Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, he is the intermediary between us and Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, with regard to conveying the message, so therefore it is essential that you know him, you know who he is, and you know his lineage, and you know his city, and you know that which he <em>sallallaahu ’alaihi wa sallam</em> came with. That you know how the revelation first came to him, and how he established the call to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, in Makkah and in Al-Madeenah. That you know the life history of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ’alaihi wa sallam </em> even if it is in abridged form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ’alaihi wa sallam</em>, he is Mu<u>h</u>ammad the son of ‘Abdullaah, the son of ‘Abdul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib, the son of Haashim, the son of ‘Abd-Manaaf, all the way to the end of the noble Prophetic lineage, which goes all the way back to Ibraaheem <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em>. And you know how he lived before he was raised as a Prophet, and how the revelation came to him from Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and what did he <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> do after his being raised as a Prophet – you know that through study of his <em>seerah </em>(of his life), and it is not befitting for the Muslim that he should be ignorant of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ’alaihi wasallam</em>. For how can you follow a person when you do not have knowledge of him? This cannot be comprehended.</p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَعْرِفَةُ دِينِ الإِسْلامِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And knowledge of the religion of Islaam<sup>6</sup></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>Knowledge of the religion of Islaam</strong>”: which is the religion of this Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ’alaihi wasallam</em>. Indeed, it is the religion of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, which He commanded His servants with, and which He commanded you to follow, and you are required to follow it, so you must have knowledge and awareness of this religion. And Islaam is the religion of all of the Messengers. All of the Messengers, their religion was Islaam, with the general meaning. So everyone who followed a Messenger from the Messengers, then he is a Muslim, one who submits in Islaam to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, one who submitted to Him and one who singled Him out with all worship – this is Islaam with the general meaning, that it is the religion of all the Messengers. So Islaam is:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الاستسلام لله بالتوحيد والانقياد له بالطاعة والخلوص من الشرك وأهله</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“To submit to Allaah with <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, and to comply to Him with obedience, and remaining free of <em>shirk</em> and its people”</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Islaam with the specific meaning, then it is that which Allaah sent His Prophet Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu’alaihiwasallam</em> with, since after the sending of the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu’alaihiwasallam</em> then there is no religion except for his religion <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatuwassalaam. </em>And Islaam is confined to following him <em><u>s</u>allallaahu’alaihiwasallam, </em>so it is not possible for a Jew to now say, “I am a Muslim”, or a Christian to say, “I am a Muslim”, after the sending of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu’alaihiwasallam, </em>if he does not follow him. So Islaam, after the sending of the Prophet, is following him <em><u>s</u>allallaahu’alaihiwasallam. </em>He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Say: If you people truly love Allaah, then follow Me, then Allaah will love you [3:31]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is Islaam with its general meaning and with its specific meaning.</p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">بِالأَدِلَّةِ<sup>    </sup></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">With the proofs.<sup>7</sup></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “With the proofs”: not due to <em>taqleed</em> (blind following), but rather with the proofs from the Qur’aan and from the Sunnah – this is knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ul-Qayyim said in <em>Al-Kaafiyat-ush-Shaafiyah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Knowledge is Allaah said, His Prophet said,</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>          The Companions said – they are the possessors of knowledge and awareness</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Knowledge is not that you foolishly raise up a disagreement</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>          Between the Messenger and the opinion of so-and-so.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what is knowledge, knowledge is the knowledge contained in the Book and the Sunnah. As for the sayings of the <em>’ulemaa</em> (the scholars), then they only explain and clarify the speech of Allaah and the speech of the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu’alaihiwasallam, </em>and some of them may contain a mistake, and the proofs are not the speech of the <em>’ulemaa</em>, rather the proofs are the <em>aayahs</em> of the Qur’aan and the Prophetic <em>a<u>h</u>adeeth</em>. As for the speech of scholars, then it explains and clarifies that, except it is not a proof in itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the first matter, and it is the foundation, the Shaikh <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> began with it because it is the foundation, and one should begin with <em>‘aqeedah</em> (creed and belief), and with the foundation in learning, and in teaching, and in calling to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. <em>‘Aqeedah</em> should be begun with, because it is the fundamental basis, and it is the foundation.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 55: Point 97</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And acknowledge the excellence of the Banu Haashim due to their kinship to Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and acknowledge the excellence of the Quraysh and of the Arabs and of the branches of the tribes. Acknowledge their station and their rights in Islaam. And the freed slave who belonged to a people is one of them. And acknowledge the rights of the rest of the people in Islaam.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/excellence-of-the-banu-haashim-and-the-quraysh" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“<span style="color:#993300;">acknowledge the excellence of the Banu Haashim (clan of Haashim)</span></strong>,<strong>” </strong>the Banu Haashim; clan of Haashim ibn `Abd Manaaf (the son of `Abd Manaaf) because `Abd Manaaf had a number of sons and they were:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1)Haashim who is the grandfather of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and (2)`Abdu-Shams who is the grandfather of `Uthmaan ibn Affaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and (3) Nawfal ibn `Abd Manaaf who is the grandfather of <u>H</u>akeem ibn <u>H</u>izaam <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and (4) al-Mu<u>tt</u>alib ibn `Abd Manaaf who is the grandfather of Banu Mu<u>tt</u>alib.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are all the sons of `Abd Manaaf. And the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was raised amongst the Banu Haashim (clan of Haashim), the son of `Abd Manaaf; so he was a Haashimee Qurayshee (larger tribe of Quraysh from the clan of Haashim; children of Haashim). And he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Allaah chose Kinaanah from the descendants of Ismaa’eel and he chose from Kinaanah, the Quraysh and he chose from the Quraysh, Banu Haashim and he chose me from the Banu Haashim.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they are the <em>qaraabah</em> (kinfolk) of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>; the believers from Banu Haashim. They are the <em>qaraabah</em> (kinfolk) who have the right upon the Muslims. It is forbidden for them to accept charity (<em><u>s</u>adaqah)</em> but it is permissible for them to accept a gift (<em>hadiyyah)</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for other than the believers then they have no worth even if they are from Banu Haashim. Rather, it is only when <em>qaraabah</em> (close kinship) comes along with <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) then in that case, there is no doubt that they have distinction over other people and they have the right that they be shown honour and respect and they have the right to be respected and given precedence since this is a part of the respect of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. However, if they are not believers (<em>mu&#8217;mineen)</em> then all that is the case is that they are from Banu Haashim and they are disbelievers so there is no honour for them. And the same goes to everyone who ascribes themselves to the Banu Haashim who is not upon the way of the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em> and not upright then he has no worth. So, it is not just being merely closely related on its own that brings about the right. Rather, it is kinship along with having <em>eemaan</em> (true faith). He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>قُل لَّا أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ أَجْرًا إِلَّا الْمَوَدَّةَ فِي الْقُرْبَىٰ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, I do not ask you for any reward for conveying the truth to you but I enjoin you to show love towards me by respecting my close relatives (qurbaa).</span> </strong>(Sooratush-Shoorah (42), <em>aayah</em> 23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, the close relatives of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in one saying. And Allaah appointed for them a share of the <em>khumus</em> (fifth part of booty). He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّمَا غَنِمْتُم مِّن شَيْءٍ فَأَنَّ لِلَّهِ خُمُسَهُ وَلِلرَّسُولِ وَلِذِي الْقُرْبَىٰ </strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And you should know that whatever you take as booty then one fifth of it is assigned for Allaah, the Messenger and the close relatives of the Messenger.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Anfaal (8), <em>aayah </em>41)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><u>Th</u></em><em>il-Qurbaa</em>-The close relatives of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“<strong>and acknowledge the excellence of the Quraysh and of the Arabs,” </strong></span>after the Banu Haashim (clan of Haashim) is the virtue of the Muslims from the Quraysh. They have excellence over the rest of the Arabs; then the Arabs have excellence over the `<em>ajam (</em>non-Arabs). Why? Because Allaah sent down the Qur&#8217;aan in their language and He sent the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> from them and He chose them to convey His message and therefore, He, the Majestic and Most High, said in the Qur&#8217;aan:</p>
<p><strong>فَاسْتَمْسِكْ بِالَّذِي أُوحِيَ إِلَيْكَ ۖ إِنَّكَ عَلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</strong><br />
<strong>وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(<em>In an address to the Prophet <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So hold fast to this Qur&#8217;aan that has been sent down to you. Indeed you are upon a straight and true path and it will be an honour for you. </strong></span>(Sooratuz-Zukhruf (43), <em>aayah </em>43-44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, the Qur·aan will be an honour for you and for your people; meaning the Arabs and you shall soon be questioned concerning it. You people will soon be questioned about the implementation of this Qur·aan and about the call to it and about having conveyed it, because Allaah gave them the duty of bearing it and conveying it to the rest of the world. So this is the aspect for which the Arabs have superiority. They were not given excellence just because they were Arabs alone; rather, they were given superiority on account of what they are specified with by Allaah with regard to the Qur·aan and the Sunnah and the sending of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and because they carry out the duty of conveying this religion. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>كُنتُمْ خَيْرَ أُمَّةٍ أُخْرِجَتْ لِلنَّاسِ تَأْمُرُونَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَتَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ الْمُنكَرِ وَتُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">You are the best nation that has been brought out for mankind, you command the good and you forbid the evil and you truly believe in Allaah.</span> </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<p><strong>وَلْتَكُن مِّنكُمْ أُمَّةٌ يَدْعُونَ إِلَى الْخَيْرِ وَيَأْمُرُونَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ الْمُنكَرِ ۚ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And let there be from amongst you a group who call the people to the good and they command the good and they forbid the evil and they are the ones who will be successful.</span> </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>104)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the aspect in which the Arabs have specific excellence. When they adhere to this religion and they convey it, then they have virtue over others. As for those who do not adhere to this religion then he has no excellence because Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<p><strong>يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنَّا خَلَقْنَاكُم مِّن ذَكَرٍ وَأُنثَىٰ وَجَعَلْنَاكُمْ شُعُوبًا وَقَبَائِلَ لِتَعَارَفُوا ۚ إِنَّ أَكْرَمَكُمْ عِندَ اللَّهِ أَتْقَاكُمْ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O mankind! We have created you all from a single male and female and we made from you nations and tribes so that you should become acquainted with each other. Indeed the most honourable of you with Allaah are those who have the most <em>taqwaa</em> (the most dutiful to Allaah).</span> </strong>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ujuraat (49), <em>aayah </em>13)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“There is no excellence for an Arab over a non-Arab nor for a white person over a black person except on account of taqwaa (dutifulness to Allaah). All of you are from Aadam and Aadam was from earth.” </strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the angle from which the Arabs have superiority. If they establish the duty that Allaah has given to them to propagate this religion and to call to it and to explain it to mankind then they will be more excellent than others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and likewise all the branches of the tribes,” </strong></span><em>Al-Afkhaa<u>th</u></em> means a subsection of the tribes. So first there is the tribe meaning the large unit of the tribe then there are the <em>Afkhaa<u>th</u></em>; branches of the tribe so it is a part of the tribe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So</strong> </span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">acknowledge their station and their rights in Islaam.”</span> </strong>Each one in accordance with his own virtue and right.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“</span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And the freed slave who belonged to a people is from them&#8221;</span>. </strong>This is a <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> from the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> Meaning <em>al-`ateeq</em>; meaning a slave who has been set free. So a person who has been set free by the Haashimiyyeen (clan of Haashim), he will have the ruling of being from the clan of Haashim; or somebody who was a slave who had been set free by anybody else, he will have the same ruling as them.</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Muslim (2,276) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Waathilah ibn al-Asqa` <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Translator’s side point: With regard to this narration, they don’t mention any reference here in the footnotes but Shaykh al-Albaaniyy mentioned this narration occurs in the explanation of At-<u>T</u>a<u>h</u>aawiyyah and Shaykh al-Albaaniyy mentioned in his notes, note no. 461 that this narration is <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> and that it occurs in the <em>Musnad</em> of Imaam A<u>h</u>mad especially the first part of the narration and the latter part you can find it also in the <em>Mu`jam al-Awsa<u>t</u></em> of A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>abaraaniyy and in the <em>Musnad</em> of Al-Bazdaar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy <u>(</u>6761) from Anas ibn Maalik <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> from the Prophet<em> <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The slave set free by a people is from them themselves.”</strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> As for the explanation of <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong></span> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> then he said starting off with the point with regard to Banu Haashim he said, “I say Banu Haashim (the clan of Haashim), they have virtue on account of their being close relatives of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, said to His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p><strong>قُل لَّا أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ أَجْرًا إِلَّا الْمَوَدَّةَ فِي الْقُرْبَىٰ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, I do not ask you for any reward for conveying the truth to you but I enjoin you to show love towards me by respecting the rights of my kinsfolk</span>. </strong>(Sooratush-Shoorah (42), <em>aayah</em> 23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So his saying, <span style="color:#808000;">“<strong>I enjoin you to show love towards me by respecting the rights of my close relatives.” </strong></span>Meaning that that is not counted as taking reward but rather that the Messenger of Allaah <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> sought from the nation that they should recognise the rights of his kinsfolk and respect them from their respect for him and that they should show honour to them as a part of their showing honour to him for indeed a Muslim has rights upon the Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So then a Muslim who is from the Banu Haashim who clings to his religion will have the right of Islaam and he will have the right that is due to a close relative of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and likewise the rest of the branches of the Quraysh except that Allaah has not put the duty upon us to love those who are not upon the correct `<em>aqeedah</em> and who are not upright upon Islaam. And indeed the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> freed himself from those who are contrary to his way. So he <em><u>s</u>alawaatullaahi wa salaamuhu `alayh</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Indeed the people of the father; meaning so and so, they are not my awliyaa </strong>(friends and allies)<strong>. Rather my guardian Lord is Allaah and my allies are the righteous believers.”</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Muslim and Al-Bukhaariyy.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and the rest of the branches,” </strong></span>meaning, the rest of the branches of the Quraysh and the tribes of the Arabs. Their rights in Islaam should be recognised and Allaah grants success.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 52: Point 89</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> that Allaah, the Most High, showed His Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> what was going to occur in his nation until the Day of Resurrection.</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/allaah-revealed-to-his-prophet-what-will-occur-to-his-ummah-till-the-day-of-resurrection" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> does not know the <em>ghayb</em> (hidden and unseen) and no-one from the created beings knows the hidden and unseen (<em>ghayb)</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>قُل لَّا يَعْلَمُ مَن فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ الْغَيْبَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, no-one in the heavens or on the earth knows the hidden and unseen except Allaah.</span> </strong>(Sooratun-Naml (27), <em>aayah</em> 65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em>al-ghayb</em> (hidden and the unseen) is that which is hidden from us, whether it be in the past or in the future, we do not know it. However, the Prophets <em>`alayhimu<u>ss</u>alaatu</em> <em>wassalaam</em>, Allaah shows them something from the hidden and the unseen for the benefit of the <em>da`wah</em> (call to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High). And from them was our Prophet Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> for Allaah showed him some of the matters of the unseen and he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed of them for the benefit of the nation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>عَالِمُ الْغَيْبِ فَلَا يُظْهِرُ عَلَىٰ غَيْبِهِ أَحَدًا</strong><br />
<strong>إِلَّا مَنِ ارْتَضَىٰ مِن رَّسُولٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah is the Knower of the unseen so He does not reveal what He has kept hidden to anyone except to a messenger whom He is pleased with.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Jinn (72), <em>aayah</em> 26-27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Except to a messenger He is pleased with; </strong>meaning that Allaah shows to him whatever He, the Perfect and Most High, wishes. For e.g. the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was walking along with his companions and they passed by two graves so he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“These two are certainly being punished.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The companions were not aware that the two inhabitants of the graves were being punished. Allaah revealed it to His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, the punishment of the two deceased. So he said: <span style="color:#808000;"> “These two are certainly being punished.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was something which Allaah made him aware of and this was from the <em>kha<u>s</u>aa·i<u>s</u></em>, from the matters specific to the Messengers <em>`alayhimu<u>ss</u>alaatu</em> <em>wassalaam</em>. And Allaah made him aware of events that were going to occur in the future and he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed us about <em>Ashraa<u>t</u>is-Saa’ah</em> (The Signs of the Last Hour). He informed us about the <em>fitan</em> (trials and tribulations) in order that we should beware and have fear lest these matters come upon us so that we could be upon clear insight.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He informed us for our benefit from the angle of warning so that we could safeguard ourselves. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“This nation will split into 73 sects, all of them will be in the Fire except one.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was news for him (<em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) that splitting would occur in the nation and it occurred just as he (<em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) informed so that we should remain firm upon the truth and not go off along with those who contradict the truth.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Translator’s side point: <em>Allaah Bi Annallaaha Ta`ala </em>and in some of the versions it has <em>Bi Annallaaha Tabaaraka Wa Ta`ala</em> (Allaah, the Exalted and Most High). Just a slight one addition word; <em>Tabaaraka Wa Ta`ala</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (218) and Muslim (292) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Translator’s side point: In the footnote it mentions checking of this has preceded and it will follow in the next point inshaaAllaah also.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Firstly, with regard to the main point that Allaah, the Most High, shows His Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> what will occur in his nation until the Day of Resurrection and the reference for this as some of the verifiers mention is a <u>h</u>adeeth reported by al-Bukhaariyy (6604) and reported by Muslim (2891) as a <u>h</u>adeeth of Hu<u>th</u>ayfah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The Prophet gave us an address; khutbah, he did not leave anything out of it that will happen until the establishment of the Hour except that he mentioned it. Whoever knew of it, knew it and whoever was ignorant of it was ignorant of it and I used to see things happening, which I had forgotten so then I would recognise them just as a man recognises when something has been absent from him then when he sees it again, he recognises it.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> made an important point also with regard to this point that &#8220;<em>Allaah, the Most High made His Prophet <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam aware. He showed him things that would happen in his nation until the Day of Resurrection&#8221;</em>. Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I say, this saying contains some degree of generality. So Allaah, the Perfect and Most High did not show His Prophet everything that was going to occur in his nation until the Day of Resurrection because this is from <em>ilm ul-ghaib</em> (the knowledge of the hidden and unseen), which is specific to the Lord of Might and Majesty. However, He showed him some events and some matters that were going to occur. And therefore, there occurs in the two sa<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>s from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> came to the graveyard and gave the greeting, “<em>May Allaah grant you security O believing people and we will if Allaah wills be joining you</em>.” Then he said, “I would have loved that I would have seen my brothers.” So they (the companions) said, “Are we not your brothers Oh Messenger of Allaah?” So he said, “You are my companions and my brothers are those who have not yet come.” So they said, “How will you recognise those who have not yet come from your nation O Messenger of Allaah?” He said, do you see if a man had some horses with white marks upon their heads and their arms and they were amongst some dark horses, would he not recognise his own horses?” So they said, “Yes indeed O Messenger of Allaah”. He said, “Then they will come with white marks on account of the wudu and I will precede you to the <em><u>h</u>aw<u>d</u> </em>(the great reservoir). Indeed some men will be repelled away from my reservoir just as a stray camel is repelled away. I will call to them, Come. So it will be said, they changed after you. So then I will say, <em>suhqan</em>, <em>suhqan</em>, be away, be far away.”</strong><strong style="font-size:1rem;"> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So this is a proof that he was not informed of everything that would occur in his nation but rather, he was informed of some things that were going to have a serious effect. So the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed of some of that just as is written in the books of the Sunnah and that does not mean that he became aware of everything that was going to occur in his nation and everything that would occur amongst them and to them as is believed by some people and I have researched this matter of my refutation of Ibn ul Haaj in the book <em>Awza hul al ishaarah fir raddi ala man ajaza mamnu minal ziyaara</em>, the clear indication in refutation of those who make permissible the forbidden type of visitation of graves.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So refer to that treatise because it is beneficial in its topic and that is from the bounty and beneficence of Allaah and His grant of success. And beware O student of knowledge of being slow or being too lazy to digest this matter because it is something that has great importance and by researching it and understanding it, you can become free from the beliefs of <em>shirk</em> and you can come to know the position of the <em>Salaf</em> well in this matter and Allaah is the one who grants success.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then finally on this point, <strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong> <em><u>h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> summarised this point by saying the <em>ghaib</em> (hidden and the unseen) is of two categories. He mentioned:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Firstly, <strong><em>Ghaib ul-Mutlaq</em></strong>: That which is totally hidden and unseen and that is known only to Allaah, nobody else knows it, and,</li>
<li><strong><em>Ghaib ul-Nisbee</em></strong>: That which is partially hidden and unseen.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That which is partially hidden and unseen refers to that which Allaah has made His Prophets aware of just as, He, the Most High said, the <em>aayah</em> that came at the beginning:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>عَالِمُ الْغَيْبِ فَلَا يُظْهِرُ عَلَىٰ غَيْبِهِ أَحَدًا</strong><br />
<strong>إِلَّا مَنِ ارْتَضَىٰ مِن رَّسُولٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah, the Most High, is the Knower of the hidden and unseen so He does not reveal that which He has kept hidden to anyone except to a messenger whom He is pleased with. </strong></span>(Sooratul-Jinn (72), <em>aayah</em> 26-27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the <em>Ghaib ul-Mutlaq</em>; that which is unrestrictedly hidden and unseen is something specific to Allaah and the <em>Ghaib ul-Nisbee;</em> that which is partially hidden and unseen is that which He made His Prophets aware of.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 44: Point 68</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was taken by night up through the heavens and he came to the Throne and he spoke to Allaah, the Exalted and Most High. And he entered Paradise and he saw the Fire and he saw the angels and he heard the speech of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic and the Prophets were brought out for him. And he saw the drapery of the Throne and the Footstool and everything within the heavens and everything within the earths whilst awake. Jibreel took him upon <em>al-Buraaq</em> until he took him through the heavens and the five daily prayers were made obligatory upon him that night. And he returned to Makkah that same night and that was before the <em>Hijrah</em> (migration). </strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/eemaan-true-faith-in-al-israa-wal-miraaj" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying,<strong><span style="color:#993300;"> “And to have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was taken by night up through the heavens,”</span> </strong>this is from the <em>mu`jizaat</em> (miracles) of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So a part of having <em>eemaan</em> in the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is to have <em>eemaan</em> in his miracles, which prove the truthfulness of his messengership <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and the greatest of his miracles are the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah. This is the greatest of the miracles of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and is the miracle which will remain until the Hour is established.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise from his miracles <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is <em>al-Israa· w’al Mi`raaj</em> (the night journey and the ascent through the heavens). The word <em>al-Israa</em>· (the night journey) is to make a journey by night and the word <em>al-Mi`raaj</em> is to <em>asu`ood</em> (ascend). And he was taken on a journey by night from the sacred mosque in Makkah to the farthest mosque <em>al-Masjid ul-Aq<u>s</u>a</em> in Palestine in a single night in the company of Jibreel <em>`alayhissalaam</em> and he was taken up through the heavens from Jerusalem.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And how he was taken in a single night from Makkah to Jerusalem and then taken up through the heavens and then descended from the heavens and then returned to Makkah in a single night, how did this occur? This was through the ability of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, which is such that nothing can render it incapable. It was not by his own ability <em>`alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em>, rather it came about through the ability of Allaah, which is such that nothing can render it incapable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Buraaq</em> was brought to him and it is an animal, which moves very fast. Its step from one step to the next is as far as it can see. So, the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> rode it and Jibreel accompanied him to <em>Bayt ul-Maqdis;</em> to Jerusalem. This is the <em>Israa</em>· (night journey) from Makkah to Jerusalem.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for <em>al-Mi`raaj</em> (the ascent) then he was taken up from Jerusalem to the heavens and he passed beyond the seven levels and reached <em>Sidrat ul-Muntahaa</em> (farthest lote tree) and he heard the speech of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, and He commanded him with the <em><u>S</u>alah</em> (prayer). And on this night he saw Paradise and the Fire and on this night he saw the Messengers and the Prophets in the heavens and Allaah gathered them together for him and he led them in prayer to make manifest his virtue over them. And Allaah made obligatory upon him the five daily prayers whilst he was in the heaven. Then he <em>`alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> descended to Jerusalem then he went from Jerusalem to Makkah in a single night and he entered the morning in Makkah <em>`alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>Israa·</em> and the <em>Mi`raaj</em> (night journey and the ascent) <strong>occurred with his body and his soul</strong>.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1] </a>And it was not just with his soul alone as is said by some of those deniers or some of those who find this matter to be something strange and who say that he was taken on the night journey with his soul but not his body. And the <em>Israa·</em> (night journey) <strong>was not a dream</strong>, rather it occurred whilst he was awake and it is a miracle from he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> miracles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>.. سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي أَسْرَىٰ بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلًا مِّنَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ إِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ الْأَقْصَى الَّذِي بَارَكْنَا حَوْلَهُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Glorified and Perfect is He Who took His servant by night from the sacred mosque to the farthest mosque, the area around which We have blessed …</strong></span>(Sooratul-Israa· (17), <em>aayah</em> 1)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For what purpose?</p>
<p><strong> لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ آيَاتِنَا ۚ إِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ ..</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>… to show him Our signs. Indeed Allaah is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</strong></span>(Sooratul-Israa· (17), <em>aayah</em> 1)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he saw on this night amazing things. Just as He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>لَقَدْ رَأَىٰ مِنْ آيَاتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَىٰ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">He </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the Prophet </span><span style="color:#008000;"><em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em></span><span style="color:#008000;">) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">certainly saw some of the greatest signs of his Lord.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Najm (53), <em>aayah</em> 18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said:</p>
<p><strong> لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ آيَاتِنَا ..</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>… to show him from Our signs. </strong></span>(Sooratul-Israa· (17), <em>aayah</em> 1)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he (<em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saw from the signs of Allaah on this blessed journey that which he saw. So, it is obligatory upon the Muslim to have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in that and to believe in it and that he should not have the slightest doubt about it. And whoever denies it he is a disbeliever (<em>kaafir)</em> since he is denying the truth of what has been said about Allaah and denying the truth about what has been said about the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and denying the consensus (<em>Ijmaa</em>`) of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And he entered Paradise and he saw the Fire,” </strong></span>he entered Paradise (<em>Jannah)</em> and he saw the bliss that was within it and he saw the Fire and he saw the torment that there is within it because Allaah wished to show him from His signs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and he saw the angels,” </strong></span>he saw Jibreel in his angelic form having 360 wings, each wing filling the whole horizon. So an angel, his creation is tremendous, his size is tremendous and Jibreel is the greatest one of the angels and the noblest one of the angels, <em>`alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em>. So he saw the angels and he saw the Messengers (<em>Rusul)</em> and they are deceased. Allaah gathered them for him and Allaah has full ability over everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And he saw the drapery of the Throne (<em>Arsh)</em> and the <em>Kursee</em> (Footstool),” </strong></span>and he saw what was around the `<em>Arsh </em>(Throne) and what was around the <em>Kursee</em> (Footstool) and they are two tremendous created things; the greatest, most tremendous of the created things and what was around them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“and everything within the heavens whilst he was awake.”</span> </strong>This is a refutation of those who say that it was a dream. And if it had been a dream, the disbelievers would not have denied it because dreams are not denied. Rather, they denied it happened whilst he was awake.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<p><strong>..  أَسْرَىٰ بِعَبْدِهِ ..</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>… He took His servant on a journey … </strong></span>(Sooratul-Israa· (17), <em>aayah </em>1)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this word <em>al-`abd</em> (the servant) is a term for the soul and body together. So, the soul alone is not called <em>`abd</em> (servant). The body alone without a soul is not called <em>`abd</em> (servant). So it is not called servant unless it is a body and a soul together.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Jibreel carried him upon <em>al-Buraaq</em>,” </strong></span><em>al-Buraaq</em> was an animal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and the five daily prayers were made obligatory upon him that night.” </strong></span>This is a proof of the tremendousness of these five daily prayers that they were made obligatory upon the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in heaven between him and Allaah without any intermediary as opposed to the rest of the revealed laws for they came down to the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> whilst he was upon the earth by means of Jibreel <em>`alayhissalaam</em>. So, this shows the tremendous importance of these five daily prayers with Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. And the time of the night journey was before the <em>Hijrah</em> (migration) to al-Madeenah and he prayed the five daily prayers in Makkah <em>`alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And he returned to Makkah on that night and that was before the <em>Hijrah</em> (migration).” </strong></span>And he returned to Makkah on that same night and therefore the disbelievers found it something very unlikely and they became overjoyed at this event so that they could belittle the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and ridicule him and mock him. So, Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, rebutted their plot and attested to the truthfulness of His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and sent down some Qur&#8217;aan with regard to that.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong>  The night journey and the ascent (<em>Israa</em>· and <em>Mi`raaj</em>) occurred bodily; the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> with his body and his soul together. You can refer to the <em>Tafseer</em> of Ibn Katheer and <em>Fat<u>h</u> ul-Baaree</em> of Al-<u>H</u>aafidh ibn <u>H</u>ajar and <em>Sharh</em> <em>ul-`Aqeedah</em> <em>a<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>ahaawiyyah</em> of Ibn Abee al-`Izz.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2] </a><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> There’s a <u>h</u>adeeth that Shaykh al-Albaaniyy authenticates in <em>A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> as no. 306 that describes what happens the next morning after the night journey; how the disbelievers of Makkah reacted. <u>H</u>adeeth that Al-<u>H</u>aakim reported in his <em>Mustadrak</em> volume 3, page 62 from `Aisha <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhaa</em> that she said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“When Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was taken on the night journey to Al-Aq<u>s</u>a mosque, he entered the morning telling the people about that. So some people who had believed in him and affirmed his truthfulness turned apostate and they hastened with that news to Aboo Bakr <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and said, “What do you think of your companion, he claims he was taken on a night journey this night to Jerusalem?” So he said, “Did he say that?” They said, “Yes.” He said, “If he said that then he has spoken the truth.” They said, “Will you believe him when he said he went to Jerusalem last night and came back before he entered the morning?” He said, “Yes, I believe him in something which is even harder than that. I believe him with regard to reports which come all the way from heaven, which come down in a single morning or a single evening.” So, therefore, he became known as A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>iddeeq (the truthful one) who attested to the truth, <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.”</span> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the explanation of <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah,</em> then he said on this point:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“To have eemaan that the Messenger of Allaah; his chest was split open and the portion of Satan was taken out and it was filled with eemaan (true faith) and wisdom. And he was taken on a night journey by Jibreel upon Al-Buraaq whose step is as far as it could see and he reached Jerusalem and the Prophets were gathered for him and he led them in prayer as their Imaam. Then Jibreel took him up to the lowest heaven and requested that it be opened and each heaven was opened for him and in the first heaven that he found; Aadam and in the second heaven; Ya<u>h</u>ya and `Eesaa and in the 3<sup>rd</sup> heaven; Yoosuf and in the 4<sup>th</sup> heaven; Haaroon and in the 5<sup>th</sup> heaven; Idrees and in the 6<sup>th</sup> heaven; Ibraaheem and in the 7<sup>th</sup>; Moosaa and in one narration the other way around (with regard to Ibraaheem and Moosa) and that Jibreel took him up to Sidrat ul-Muntahaa (farthest lote tree). Then he took him up to a place where he could hear the scratching of pens and he heard the speech of his Lord, the Mighty and Majestic when the five daily prayers were made obligatory upon him. So then he went back to Moosaa and informed him so he said, “Go back to your Lord and ask him for a reduction.” And finally his Lord said to him, “They are five and they are 50 (in reward), the saying will not be altered with Me.”</strong></span><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Agreed upon]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You can find this narration mentions details reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (3,342) and Muslim (163) from a narration of Abu Tharr <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Shaykh says mentioning that <u>h</u>adeeth, “Meaning 5 with regard to their performance and 50 with regard to the reward and each good deed has the reward of 10 times over and that he entered Paradise and he saw in it domes or mounds made of pearl and other than that from the events, which occur in the <em>Israa·</em> and the <em>Mi`raaj.</em> And this was a matter of extra virtue bestowed upon him granted specifically by Allaah to His Prophet and to the last of His Messengers Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam,</em> no-one else shared with him in it. And he entered the next morning in Makkah and when he informed Quraish of what had happened, they rejected what he had said. Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا جَعَلْنَا الرُّؤْيَا الَّتِي أَرَيْنَاكَ إِلَّا فِتْنَةً لِّلنَّاسِ وَالشَّجَرَةَ الْمَلْعُونَةَ فِي الْقُرْآنِ ۚ وَنُخَوِّفُهُمْ فَمَا يَزِيدُهُمْ إِلَّا طُغْيَانًا كَبِيرًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We did not make that which We showed to you except as a trial for the people a</strong></span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">nd the accursed tree mentioned in the Qur&#8217;aan and We caused them to fear but it does not increase them except in great transgression.</span>  </strong>(Sooratul-Israa (17), <em>aayah</em> 60)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the saying of the author, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Jibreel took him upon <em>al-Buraaq</em> until he took him through the heavens,” </strong></span>this is a matter requiring inspection (meaning something doubtful) since he did not carry him upon <em>al-Buraaq</em> except when he took him to Jerusalem. What’s correct is that he travelled upon <em>al-Buraaq</em> from Makkah to Jerusalem only, then <em>al-Buraaq</em> was left in Jerusalem then he was taken by Jibreel up through the heavens. As for him ascending from Jerusalem to the heavens then what is apparent that it was upon the <em>Mi`raaj</em> (the heavenly stairway) and not upon <em>al-Buraaq</em> as was said by the author, may Allaah have mercy upon him and success is granted by Allaah.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 40 : Point 61</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> that when Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> spoke to those thrown into the abandoned well on the day of Badr, meaning the People of <em>Shirk</em> that they heard his words. </strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/allaahs-messenger-spoke-to-those-thrown-into-the-abandoned-well-on-the-day-of-badr" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>has <em>mu`jizaat</em> (miracles) and a <em>mu`jizah</em> (miracle) is a matter, which is extraordinary and a person is not able to bring them about himself. Rather, they are things created by Allaah, the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p><strong>وَقَالُوا لَوْلَا أُنزِلَ عَلَيْهِ آيَاتٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِ ۖ قُلْ إِنَّمَا الْآيَاتُ عِندَ اللَّهِ </strong> &#8211; 29:50</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(People of </span><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Shirk</em></span><span style="color:#008000;">) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">said, “If only miraculous times were to be sent down to him </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Prophet </span><span style="color:#008000;"><em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em></span><span style="color:#008000;">) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">from his Lord.” Say, “The miraculous times are only with Allaah.”</span> </strong>(Sooratul-`Ankaboot (29), <em>aayah</em> 50)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They were demanding that he should himself bring miraculous times to prove his Messengership as they said. But the miraculous times are with Allaah. The Messenger did not bring any sign except from Allaah, the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p><strong> قُلْ إِنَّمَا الْآيَاتُ عِندَ اللَّهِ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “The signs are only with Allaah.”</span> </strong>(Sooratul-`Ankaboot (29), <em>aayah</em> 50)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He is the one Who manifests miracles, the Perfect and Most High. And He causes them to happen at the hands of His Messengers to attest to their truthfulness. And an example of that is &#8211; the dead person, if you speak to him, he will not hear you and he will not know what you are saying. However, the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>spoke to those who had been killed at Badr from Quraysh, those who used to harm him and harm the Muslims in Makkah and who haughtily rejected true faith and disobeyed and who tyrannized the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and expelled him and who expelled his companions and harmed them. So, Allaah caused them to be overpowered at Badr and they were killed. And their leaders and their eminent people were killed; Shaybah Ibn Rabee`ah and `Utbah ibn Rabee`ah (his brother) and Aboo Jahl Ibn Hishaam and a large number of the eminent ones of the Quraysh were killed at Badr. Then the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> ordered that they should be thrown into an old well from the wells of Badr and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> stood over them and addressed them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“O so and so, son of so and so! O Aboo Jahl Ibn Hishaam! O `Utbah! O Shaybah! O Umayyah!” He addressed them one by one, saying “Have you found what your Lord promised you to be true for I have indeed found what my Lord promised me to be true?” So then Umar said to him “O Messenger of Allaah, how can you speak to them when they have started to decay and they cannot hear.” So he <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam responded, “You people cannot hear any better what I am saying than they can. However, they cannot talk.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was a miracle from the miracles of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, which Allaah caused to happen at his hand.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (3,976) and reported by Muslim (2,873, 2,874 and 2,875).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Narration mentions this happened three days after the battle. In one narration it mentioned when the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> conquered a people then he would remain at that place for three days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This report that he did likewise at Badr, he stayed there for three days and just before he was going to travel and go back to Madeenah, on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day then he stood over the old well and said this saying, he spoke to them, he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Did you find what your Lord promised you to be true? Indeed, I found what my Lord promised me to be true&#8230;”</span> </strong>To the end of the <u>h</u>adeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I say &#8211; the disagreement that there is amongst the People of Knowledge about whether the people in the <em>Barzakh</em> (period in between this life and the hereafter, those in the grave and the like), can they hear those people who address them or is that just specific to the people of that well at Badr?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of them extend this matter and claim that all the people in that life (the <em>Barzakh)</em> can hear the speech that is said to them and some of the People of Knowledge restrict it to the place where the text is mentioned and that is what is apparent from the established texts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the people of <em>Sufism</em> then they extend this matter in a reprehensible manner to the extent that they claim that a dead person even knows what happens amongst his family whether good or bad. And Ibn ul-Qayyim <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> reported in his book <em>Ar-Rooh</em>, some reports from them, which are suspect and Allaah is the one who grants success.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aalih as-Suhaymee</strong> had said on this same point, he mentioned that there are some people who say the dead in general can hear. However, upon verification from the sayings of the people of the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah</em>, what is correct is that we restrict ourselves in the matter of the dead hearing because it is a matter of the <em>ghaib</em> (hidden and unseen) and in matters of the hidden and the unseen, we do not increase upon them upon what occurs from the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And what’s established is two cases where the dead hear:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>Firstly</strong>, the leaders of the Quraysh who were killed at Badr that they heard the words of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>when he addressed them,</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>Secondly</strong>, the deceased, who has died and been buried; they hear the footsteps of his family going away after they are buried.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Beyond that we do not extend the matter any further. Rather, the rest of it falls under the general <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<p> وَمَا أَنتَ بِمُسْمِعٍ مَّن فِي الْقُبُورِ &#8211; 35:22</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And you cannot cause those who are in the graves to hear.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah Faa<u>t</u>ir (35), <em>aayah </em>22)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 18 : Point 17</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have eemaan in the howd (Reservoir/great body of water/lake) of Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. And every Prophet will have a Reservoir except for Saalih `alayhis-salaam, for his Reservoir will be the udder of his she-camel.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F365277362&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/eemaan-in-the-hawd-reservoir-lake-of-allaahs-messenger" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise from the usool, fundamentals, of the Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah is to have eemaan in the howd (Reservoir). So the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam will have a howd, a Reservoir, and every Prophet from the Prophets will have a howd, a reservoir of water, which his nation will come to drink from. Because the people will suffer severe thirst (on the Day of Resurrection after the standing). They will need water. And the Reservoir of our Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam will be the greatest of the reservoirs. Its length is a month (the length of a month’s journey) and its width is that of a month. Its water will be whiter than milk and sweeter than honey and its drinking vessels will be the number of the stars in the sky. Whoever drinks a single drink from it, will never become thirsty after it. [01] And the apostates, who apostasized (left Islaam) after the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam will be pushed away from it. And whoever denied it, and Allaah knows best, will also be pushed away from it from the people of innovations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, <strong>“And every Prophet will have a Reservoir except for Saalih `alayhis-salaam, for his Reservoir will be the udder of his she-camel.”</strong> This exception is not established as far as I know. And what is actually correct is that every Prophet will have a howd as occurs in the hadeeth. [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] There is reported with regard to this (howd) ahaadeeth which are mutawaatir (reported by huge numbers of people at every level of transmission; such a huge number that they could not have got together and made it up). So from them is that which Imaam Muslim reports in his Saheeh (no. 2292) from `Abdullaah ibn `Amr ibn al-`Aas radiyAllaahu`anhumaa who said, “Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘My howd (Reservoir) will have the distance of a month and its sides will be equal. Its water will be whiter than silver and its fragrance will be better than musk, and its drinking cups will be like the stars of the sky. So whoever drinks from it then he will never ever become thirsty after it.’”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Another hadeeth) reported by Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 247) from Aboo Hurayrah radiyAllaahu`anhu that Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“My howd (Reservoir) is larger than the distance from Aylah to `Adn. It is indeed whiter than snow and sweeter than honey in milk, and its drinking vessels will be more than the number of the stars. And I will repel people away from it just as a man repels the camels of other people away from his reservoir.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>They said, “O Messenger of Allaah, will you recognize us on that day? He said, </strong><strong>“Yes. You will have a mark which no one from the other nations has. You will come to me with white marks upon your foreheads and limbs from the traces of wudoo·. And a group from you will be repelled away from me so that you do not reach. So I will say, ‘O my Lord, those are companions of mine. So an angel will respond to me and say, ‘Do you know what they did after you departed?’”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] This occurs from a hadeeth of Samarah ibn Jundub radiyAllaahu`anhu who said, “Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Every Prophet shall have a howd, and they will boast about which of them has the most people who come to drink. And I hope that I will be the one having the most people who come to drink from it.” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by al-Bukhaaree in his book at-Taareekhul-Kabeer and by at-Tirmithee and Ibn Abee `Aasim and at-Tabaraanee; and declared authentic by al-Haafiz al-Mizzee due to its different chains of narration, as was mentioned by Ibn Katheer in his Tafseer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> This hadeeth was declared saheeh authentic by Shaykh al-Albaanee rahimahullaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Saalih as Suhaymee hafizahullaah said in his explanation,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The saying of the author that Saalih, his Reservoir will be the udder of his she camel, this is a point requiring to be looked at because there is no authentic proof for it.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaanee rahimahullaah in his book Silsilatul-Ahaadeeth ad-Da`eefah brings a couple of narrations in that regard (no. 771 and 772) which are not authentic about that. And he judged that these two ahaadeeth are mowdoo` (fabricated). The same was said by Ibnul-Jawzee in his book al Mowdoo`aat and Imaam ath-Thahabee in his book Meezaanul-I`tidaal.</p>

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> The Explanation – Point [42]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are from his attributes <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>خاتم الأنبياء </strong>– <strong>“The last (or seal) of the Prophets.”</strong>  The meaning of “<em><u>kh</u>aatam</em>” (خاتم &#8211; seal) is the one whom no Prophet will come after.  And the <em><u>kh</u>itaam</em> (ختام – seal) of anything is that which is placed upon it as a seal upon it so that nothing can be added to that thing and nothing can be taken away from it.  So Allaah sealed the Messengership with Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.  He the Majestic, in His Highness, said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And Mu<u>h</u>ammad is not the father of any of your men; but rather, he is the Messenger of Allaah and the seal (last) of the Prophets.</span></em> (Sooratul-A<u>h</u>zaab (33), <em>aayah </em>40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there is no need for the coming of any Prophet after him because the Qur.aan is present and the Prophetic Sunnah is present and the <em>`ulamaa. ar-rabbaaniyoon</em> (wise scholars who cultivate the people upon the correct way) are present – calling the people to Allaah and giving clarity to the people.  So therefore, the religion of Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> will remain until the establishment of the Last Hour.  It will not be changed, and it will not be abrogated, and it will not be altered because Allaah, the One free from all imperfections, has made it suitable and fitting for every time and every place.  And as for the revealed laws of the previous Prophets, then they were temporary for their nations in particular times and then Allaah abrogated those legislated laws from before, with other legislated laws suitable for other nations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">For every people from you, we made a set of revealed laws and a clear way to proceed upon.</span></em> (Sooratul-Maa.idah (5), <em>aayah </em>48)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>For every revealed Book there is a set time period</em></span> (Sooratur-Ra`d (13), <em>aayah </em>38)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, each Book (from the previous Books) has a set time period.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the religion of Islaam is complete.  It does not need any Messenger after Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.  And the scholars are the inheritors of the Prophets.  So whoever holds the belief that there will come after Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> any Prophet, then he is a disbeliever in Allaah, outside the fold of the religion.  And the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed that there were going to come liars, falsely claiming Prophethood after him.  He <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">سيأتي بعدي كذابون ثلاثون، كلهم يدعي أنه نبي، وأنا خاتم الأنبياء لا نبي بعدي</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“There will come after me thirty great liars, each one of them claiming that he is a prophet and I am the last of the Prophets; there is no Prophet after me.”</span></em> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever claims Prophethood, or has Prophethood claimed on his behalf, or whoever follows them, then all of them are unbelievers (<em>kuffaar</em>).  And the Muslims have fought against them and have declared them to be unbelievers.  And the last of those whose followers claimed that he was a Prophet in this present time was that <em>Qaadiyaanee</em>.  And these people (the <em>Qaadiyaanee</em>) are called the <em>A<u>h</u>madees</em> as an ascription to his name because his name was A<u>h</u>mad <em>Al-Qaadiyaanee</em> (أحمد القادياني) and the scholars declared him to be an unbeliever (<em>kaafir</em>) and they repelled him from the lands of Islaam and the declared his followers to be unbelievers since this is a denial of Allaah and of His Messenger.  And their being unbelievers is by consensus of the Muslims; no one disagrees about this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is essential that the Muslim believes that he <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> is the last of the Prophets and Messengers and he is the leader of those having <em>taqwaa</em> (those dutiful to Allaah); meaning, that he is the single example to be followed for those who are obedient and dutiful to Allaah, the Mighty and  Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">There is indeed a fine example for you in Allaah’s Messenger for whoever has hope in Allaah and in the Last Day</span></em>. (Sooratul-A<u>h</u>zaab (33), <em>aayah </em>21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for others besides the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, he is only to be followed if he himself is following the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.  And as for a person who contradicts the Messenger <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> then it is not permissible to follow him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “If you truly love Allaah then follow me, then Allaah will love you and forgive you your sins.” </span></em>(Soorah Aal-`Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there is no way towards Allaah except by following the Messenger <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> and proceeding upon his way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the term: <strong>وسيد المرسلين</strong> – <strong>“And he is the noblest of the Messengers;” </strong>that is him, <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>; he is the noblest of the sons of Aadam just as he <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> said about himself,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏أنا سيد ولد آدم ولا فخر</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“I am the noblest of the sons of Aadam, and that is not boasting.”</span></em> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By the statement, <strong><em>“I am the noblest of the sons of Aadam, and this is not a boast,”</em></strong> he informed his nation of that as part of giving thanks to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and also so that the <em>Ummah</em> (Nation) should give thanks to their Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, for this favour – that He made its Messenger the noblest of the Messengers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the word “<em>sayyid</em>” (سيد – the noblest) means <em>al-muqaddim</em> (المقدم – the foremost one) and <em>al-imaam</em> (الإمام – the leader).  So he is the best of the Messengers `<em>alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> and he is their <em>imaam</em> (leader) and he is at the head of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the term: <strong>حبيب رب العالمين</strong> – <strong>“the beloved one of the Lord of the whole of creation,”</strong> the term ‘<em><u>h</u>abeeb’</em> (حبيب) is a term which has a point of criticism against it because it is not sufficient to say (that the Messenger `<em>alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> is) ‘<em><u>h</u>abeeb’</em> (the beloved one).  Rather, he is the ‘<em><u>kh</u>aleel</em>’ – the ‘especially close beloved one’ of the Lord of the creation (خليل رب العالمين).  And <em><u>kh</u>ullah</em> (خلة) is more excellent than just <em>ma<u>h</u>abbah</em> (محبة &#8211; love) because <em>al-ma<u>h</u>abbah</em> (love) is of levels and the highest of its levels is <em>al-<u>kh</u>ullah</em> which is the purest love. And no one attained this level except for two men from the creation: Ibraaheem `<em>alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam,</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And Allaah took Ibraaheem as a <u>kh</u>aleel (especially close beloved one)</span></em> (Sooratun-Nisaa.  (4), <em>aayah </em>125)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, our Prophet `<em>alayhi<u>s</u> <u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>, because he himself informed about that saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إن الله اتخذني خليلًا كما اتخذ إبراهيم خليلًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“Allaah took me as an especially close beloved one just as He took Ibraaheem as a <u>kh</u>aleel (an especially close beloved one).” </em></span>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it should not be said about him that he is <em><u>H</u>abeebullaah</em> – a beloved one of Allaah, because this term is suitable for every believer and there is nothing special for the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in it.  But as for being <em><u>kh</u>ullah</em> (an especially beloved one), then no one (from this Ummah) shares with him in that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [42][4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[43] وكل دعوى النبوة بعده فغي وهوى‏.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[43]     Every claim to Prophethood after him is erroneous and baseless desires.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [43]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This has preceded in the meaning of his being ‘the seal and last of the Prophets’.  So therefore, every claim to Prophethood after him is futile and is unbelief since there will not come any Prophet after our Prophet `<em>alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>.  And as for `Eesaa `<em>alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>, when he descends at the end of time, then it will not be upon the basis that he is a Prophet and a Messenger, nor upon the basis that he is coming with a new revealed Law.  Rather, he will come upon the basis that he is a <em>Mujaddid</em> (مجدد – Reviver) for the religion of the Messenger of Allaah <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, </em>on the basis that he is one following the Messenger of Allaah <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and he will judge with the Islaamic <em><u>Sh</u>aree</em>`<em>ah</em> (Laws).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Translator’s Side Point: There is a narration that <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee points out is weak in his notes to A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>a<u>h</u>aawiyyah.  It is a <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u> </em>of Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em> and in it is quoted that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> himself said,</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] <strong>Translator’s (Dawud Burbank) Side Point</strong>: As for the lineage of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, he was:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Mu<u>h</u>ammad</strong> (محمد) <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> ibn `<strong>Abdillaah</strong> (عبد الله) ibn `<strong>Abdil-Mu<u>tt</u>alib</strong> (عبد المطلب) [this was a title and his name was <u>Sh</u>aybatul-<u>H</u>amd (شيبة الحمد)] ibn <strong>Haa<u>sh</u>im</strong> (هاشم) [this was a title and his name was `Amr (عمرو)] ibn <strong>`Abd Manaaf</strong> (عبد مناف) ibn <strong>Qu<u>s</u>ay</strong> (قصي) [this was a title and his name was Zayd (زيد)] ibn <strong>Kilaab</strong> (كلاب)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ibn <strong>Murrah</strong> (مرة) ibn <strong>Ka`ab</strong> (كعب) ibn <strong>Lu.ay</strong> (لؤي) ibn <strong><u>Gh</u>aalib</strong> (غالب) ibn <strong>Fihr</strong> (فهر) ibn <strong>Maalik</strong> (مالك) ibn <strong>An-Na<u>d</u>r</strong> (النضر) ibn <strong>Kinaanah</strong> (كنانة) ibn <strong><u>Kh</u>uzaymah</strong> (خزيمة) ibn <strong>Mudrikah</strong> (مدركة) [this was a title and his name was `Amr (عمرو)] ibn <strong>Ilyaas</strong> (إلياس) ibn <strong>Mu<u>d</u>ar</strong> (مضر) ibn <strong>Nizaar</strong> (نزار) ibn <strong>Ma`ad</strong> (معد) ibn <strong>`Adnaan</strong> (عدنان)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This list is taken from the Abridged Seerah of Ibn Ka<u>th</u>eer: <em> </em>الفصول في سيرة الرسول صلى لله عليه وسلم<em>.  </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam An-Nawawee said in Tah<u>dh</u>eeb al-Asmaa. wal-Lu<u>gh</u>aat (تهذيب الأسماء واللغات), “This lineage here, there is consensus of the Ummah of these names here.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree in a chapter heading of his book brings the lineage of the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>with these same names here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is by consensus; the lineage of the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is preserved, back to `Adnaan.  With regard to the lineage after `Adnaan then there are different sayings.  Some of the scholars withhold and say that they don’t know the lineage in detail any further than that.  Others mention different names with different numbers of names in the list and the verifiers from the scholars say that after `Adnaan, the lineage is not authentic.  All that we know after `Adnaan, is that `Adnaan was a descendent of the Messenger of Allaah, Ismaa.eel <em>`alayhis-salaam,</em> who was the son of the Messenger of Allaah, Ibraaheem <em>`alayhis-salaam,</em> who was the son of Aazar.  And beyond that we don’t know; except that Ibraaheem <em>`alayhis-salaam</em> was a descendent of the Messenger of Allaah, Noo<u>h</u> <em>`alayhis-salaam</em> and that Noo<u>h</u> <em>`alayhis-salaam</em> was a descendent of Aadam <em>`alayhis-salaam.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Aqeedah Tahaawiyyah : Point # 44: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[44]</strong> <strong>وهو المبعوث إلى عامة الجن وكافة الورى بالحق والهدى، وبالنور والضياء‏.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[44]    And he (sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) is the one sent to the whole of the jinn and to all of mankind with the truth and the guidance and with light and radiance.</strong></p>

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [44]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, this is what it is obligatory to hold as our creed and belief with regard to the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.  </em>It is not sufficient that we merely believe that he is Allaah’s Messenger.  Rather, that he is a Messenger to all of mankind; indeed to the jinn and mankind.  He the Most Perfect said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And We have not sent you (as a Messenger) except to the whole of mankind, as a bringer of glad tidings and as a warner </em></span>(Soorah Saba.  (34), <em>aayah </em>28)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He also said to him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “O mankind! I am the Messenger of Allaah to all of you.”</span></em> (Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>158)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So his Messengership was to all of mankind and this was something particular to him <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>.  So he was a Messenger to all of mankind and obedience to him is obligatory upon the whole of the creation – their Arabs and their non-Arabs, the black of them and the white of them, mankind of them and the jinn of them.  So, everyone whom the call of the Messenger <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> reaches, then it is obligatory upon him to obey him and to follow him.  So whoever agrees that he (Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) is the Messenger of Allaah to the Arabs in particular, as is said by a group of the Christians who say that he was indeed the Messenger of Allaah, but to the Arabs in particular, and they deny that he was a Prophet to anyone else; then this is <em>kufr</em> (disbelieving) in Allaah, the Might and Majestic, and it is a denial of what Allaah the Mighty and Majestic said and a denial of His Messenger.  So, Allaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And We have not sent you except to the whole of mankind, as a bringer of glad tidings and as a warner</span> </em>(Soorah Saba.  (34), <em>aayah </em>28)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the One free of all imperfections, said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Blessed is the One Who sent down the Criterion (the Qur.aan) upon His slave (Mu<u>h</u>ammad <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) so that he should be a warner to the whole of mankind and jinn</span></em> (Sooratul-Furqaan (25), <em>aayah </em>1)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So his Messengership is universal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he, <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“A Prophet used to be sent to his own people in particular, whereas I have been sent to the whole of mankind.”</em> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> wrote letters to the kings of the different lands, calling them to Islaam; so this shows that he was a Messenger sent to the whole of the people of the earth.  And he was commanded with fighting <em>jihaad</em> until the people entered into Islaam; so this shows that his Messengership <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> was universal.  So it is obligatory to believe that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory with regard to him (<em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>), to hold these beliefs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: That he (<em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) is the slave of Allaah and His Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: That he is the last of the Prophets; there is no Prophet after him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly</strong>: That his Messengership was universal, covering all of mankind and jinn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof that his Messengership was universal to mankind is the <em>aayaat</em> which have preceded[2].  And also the fact that the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>wrote the letters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for his Messengership being universal to the whole of the jinn, then in accordance with the saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And (remember) when We sent a group of the jinn to you who listened to the Qur.aan.  So when they attended it, they said (to each other), “Be silent in order to listen!” So when he (<u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) finished reciting, they (the jinn) went back to their people as warners (of Allaah’s punishment upon those who disbelieve).  They said, “O our people! We have heard a Book sent down after (the Book of) Moosaa, confirming the Books which came before it.  It guides to the truth and to the Straight Path.  “O our people, respond to the Messenger of Allaah who calls you to obedience to Allaah.</span></em> (Sooratul-A<u>h</u>qaaf (46), <em>aayaat </em>29-31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “It has been revealed to me that a group of the jinn listened and said, ‘We have heard an amazing Qur.aan; it guides to Right Guidance, so we have believed in it.’” </span></em>(Sooratul-Jinn (72), <em>aayaat </em>1-2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this proves that his Messengership covered the jinn.  So the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was sent to all of the people of the earth – mankind of them and the jinn of them.  So whoever truly believes (has <em>eemaan</em>) in him, then he will enter Paradise and whoever does not truly believe in him will enter the Fire, whether it be from mankind or from the jinn.  And his saying, <strong>“(that he was sent) with light and with radiance;” </strong>these two words (<em>an-noor</em> and <em>a<u>d</u>&#8211;<u>d</u>iyaa</em>.) have the same meaning and the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>was sent with each of these (light and radiance).  Allaah the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">O Prophet! We have sent you as a witness, and as a bringer of good tidings, and as a warner, and as a caller to Allaah by His Permission, and as a shining lamp. </span></em>(Sooratul-A<u>h</u>zaab (33), <em>aayaat </em>45-46)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Points discussed in this excerpt include:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">It does not suffice for us to believe that the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was merely Allaah’s Messenger. Rather, He is a Messenger to all mankind and jinn.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Obedience to him <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>is obligatory upon the whole of the creation as his Messengership is universal.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">It is <em>kufr</em> (disbelief) to believe that he <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>was a Messenger sent only to the Arabs.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory to believe that: (1) he is the slave of Allaah and His Messenger, (2) he is the last of the Prophets and there is no Prophet after him and (3) his Messengership was universal to all mankind and jinn.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Whoever truly believes in him will enter Paradise, and whoever does not, will enter the Fire.</li>

<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s Side Point: Ibn Al-Qayyim rahimahullaah in his book Jalaa.ul-Afhaam (جلاء الأفهام) made an important point that with regard to the names of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, that just as we have a principle with regard to the Names of Allaah the Most High, that all of Allaah’s Names have along with them an Attribute (contrary to what some of the Mu`tazilah and the Jahmiyyah and their like say); the same point applies to the names of the Prophet Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam – his names are not just merely names; all his names are also characteristics found in him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Translator’s Side Point: Some of the names of the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam are as follows:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>Muhammad</strong> (محمد) sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam – the praiseworthy one and also the one who praises abundantly. Amongst the evidences is the aayah,</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Muhammad is but a Messenger and many Messengers have passed away before him</span></em><br />
(Soorah Aal-`Imraan (3), aayah 144)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise the aayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Muhammad is not the father of any of your men</span></em><br />
(Sooratul-Ahzaab (33), aayah 40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, in Soorah Muhammad (47), aayah 2 and Sooratul-Fath (48), aayah 29 the name Muhammad is mentioned for the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and in many, many ahaadeeth.</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;" start="2">
<li><strong>Ahmad</strong> (أحمد) – the most praiseworthy one. An evidence for that is one aayah in the Qur.aan, in the saying of `Eesaa `alayhis-salaam when he foretold of the coming of a Prophet that would come after him,</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">a Messenger bringing glad tidings, who will come after me; his name will be Ahmad</span></em><br />
(Sooratus-Saff (61), aayah 6)</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;" start="3">
<li><strong>Al-Maahee</strong> (الماحي) – the one who eliminates or wipes away; meaning, the one through whom Allaah wipes away unbelief. The evidence for this name is the hadeeth of Jubayr ibn Mut`im radiyAllaahu `anh.</li>
<li><strong>Al-Haashir</strong> (الحاشر) – the first one to be resurrected and the one after whom the rest of the people would be resurrected. The evidence is the same hadeeth of Jubayr ibn Mut`im radiyAllaahu `anh reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim.</li>
<li><strong>Al-`Aaqib</strong> (العاقب) – the last Prophet. The proof being the same hadeeth.</li>
<li><strong>Al-Muqaffaa</strong> (المقفى) or <strong>Al-Muqaffee</strong> (المقفي) – the one who follows on from the previous Messengers and is the final one of them. The evidence for that is the hadeeth of Aboo Moosaa Al-Ash`aree radiyAllaahu `anh, reported by Muslim.</li>
<li><strong>Nabeeut-Tawbah</strong> (نبي التوبة) – the Prophet of repentance; the one through whom Allaah opened the gate of repentance to His servants. The proof being the same hadeeth of Aboo Moosaa Al-Ash`aree radiyAllaahu `anh.</li>
<li><strong>Nabeeur-Rahmah</strong> (نبي الرحمة) – the Prophet of mercy; the one whom Allaah sent as a mercy to the creation. The evidence is the hadeeth of Aboo Moosaa Al-Ash`aree radiyAllaahu `anh.</li>
<li><strong>Nabeeul-Malhamah</strong> (نبي الملحمة) – the Prophet of slaughter or wars; the one sent to fight against the enemies of Allaah. The evidence of this is the hadeeth of Hudhayfah radiyAllaahu `anh reported by Tirmidhee in his Shil.</li>
<li><strong>An-Nabeeul-Mustafaa</strong> (النبي المصطفى) – the chosen Prophet. The evidence being a hadeeth of `Awf ibn Maalik Al-Ashjaa`ee radiyAllaahu `anh.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Along with these names, some of the scholars mention that Allaah has described the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam with a number of attributes and titles in the Qur.aan.  Amongst the titles given to the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam in the Qur.aan are:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>`Abdullaah</strong> (عبد الله) – the slave of Allaah</li>
<li><strong>`abd</strong> (عبد) – a slave</li>
<li><strong>rasool</strong> (رسول) – a Messenger</li>
<li><strong>nabee</strong> (نبي) – a Prophet</li>
<li><strong>ummee</strong> (أمي) – unlettered</li>
<li><strong>shaahid</strong> (شاهد) – a witness,</li>
<li><strong>mubashshir</strong> (مبشر) – a bringer of glad tidings</li>
<li><strong>nadheer</strong> (نذير) – a warner and a caller to Allaah by His Permission</li>
<li><strong>siraajan muneeraa</strong> (سراجا منيرا) – a shining lamp</li>
<li><strong>ra&#8217;oofan raheemaa</strong> (رؤوفا، رحيما) – compassionate and merciful</li>
<li><strong>mudhakkiran</strong> (مذكّرا) – one who reminded the people of their Lord</li>
<li><strong>rahmah</strong> (رحمة) – a mercy</li>
<li><strong>ni`mah</strong> (نعمة) – a favor</li>
<li><strong>haadee</strong> (هادي) – a guide</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are titles and attributes mentioned in the Qur.aan with regard to the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and other scholars mention many others besides these.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>With regard to the ahaadeeth that were evidences for the names, they are:</strong></span></p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>The hadeeth of Jubayr ibn Mut`im radiyAllaahu `anh who said, “Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said,</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">لي خمسة أسماء: أنا محمد، وأحمد، وأنا الماحي الذي يمحو الله بي الكفر، وأنا الحاشر الذي يحشر الناس على قدمي، وأنا العاقب</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I have five names: I am Muhammad and Ahmad and I am Al-Maahee &#8211; the one through whom Allaah wipes away unbelief, and I am Al-Haashir – the one whom the people will be resurrected after me, and I am Al-`Aaqib – the last Prophet.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Reported by Al-Bukhaaree as hadeeth 3532 and also by Muslim.</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;" start="2">
<li>The hadeeth of Aboo Moosaa Al-Ash`aree radiyAllaahu `anh who said,</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">كان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يسمي لنا نفسه أسماء.  فقال: &#8220;أنا محمد، وأحمد، والمقفي، والحاشر، ونبي التوبة، ونبي الرحمة&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam used to call himself different names to us.  So he said, ‘I am Muhammad and Ahmad and Al-Muqaffee (the one who came at the end of all the Prophets before) and Al-Haashir (the first one to be resurrected) and Nabeeut-tawbah (the Prophet of repentance) and Nabeeur-rahmah (the Prophet of mercy).’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Muslim.</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;" start="3">
<li>The hadeeth of Hudhayfah radiyAllaahu `anh who said, “I met the Prophet sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam on one of the paths of Al-Madeenah; so he said,</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">أنا محمد وأنا أحمد وأنا نبي الرحمة ونبي التوبة وأنا المقفي وأنا الحاشر ونبي الملاحم</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I am Muhammad and I am Ahmad and I am the Prophet of mercy and the Prophet of repentance and I am the one who comes last after the other Prophets and I am the one who will be resurrected first and the Prophet of wars or slaughter.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Tirmidhee in his Shamaa.il and declared Hasan (Good) by Shaykh Al-Albaanee.</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;" start="4">
<li>The evidence for the last name, “An-Nabee Al-Mustafaa” (the chosen Prophet) is a slightly longer hadeeth. It is an incident which happened in Al-Madeenah.  Shaykh Al-Albaanee declared the hadeeth authentic (Saheeh) in his checking of Ibn Katheer’s Seerah.  The hadeeth is reported by Imaam Ahmad in his Musnad from `Awf ibn Maalik Al-Ashjaa`ee radiyAllaahu `anh who said,</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam went off one day and I was with him until we entered a church (synagogue) of the Jews in Al-Madeenah on a festival day of theirs and they disliked that we should enter upon them.  So he, sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, said to them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O company of Jews, show me twelve men who bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah, and then Allaah will remove the anger that He has upon them from every Jew beneath the sky.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they were silent, none of them answered him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he repeated it to them but none of them answered him. So he said, ‘You have refused.  So by Allaah, I am certainly Al-Haashir (the one who will be resurrected first) and I am Al-`Aaqib (the last Prophet), and I am An-Nabeeul-Mustafaa (the chosen Prophet) whether you believe or whether you reject me’.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The companion said, “Then he departed and I was with him until we had almost gone out (of the church of the Jews) when a man said from behind us, ‘Remain where you are O Muhammad.’ So that man said, ‘O company of Jews, what sort of person do you know me to be amongst you?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said, ‘By Allaah, we do not know there to have been any man amongst us who knew the Book of Allaah better than you do, nor anyone having more religious knowledge than you do, nor than your father before you, nor than your grandfather before your father.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, ‘Then I testify in his favor that By Allaah! He is the Prophet of Allaah who you find mentioned in the Tawraat.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So then they said, ‘You have lied’ and they rebutted his saying and spoke evil of him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said, ‘You people have lied; your speech will never be accepted.  You have just been praising him as you have done with good, but when he believed then you declared him to be a liar and you said about him what you said.  So you speech will never be accepted.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The companion said, “So the three of us went out – Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, myself and `Abdullaah ibn Salaam (the Jew who just entered into Islaam). No one else from the Jews believed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah the Most High sent down concerning him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Say, “Do you see, if it is indeed from Allaah and you disbelieve in it, when a witness from Banoo Israa.eel witnesses to the like of it and he believes in it, but you people reject haughtily.&#8221; Then Allaah does not guide an unbelieving, wrongdoing people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Sooratul-Ahqaaf (46), aayah 10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Al-Albaanee said the hadeeth is Saheeh (authentic).</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Shaykh Rabee al-Madkhali was asked: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Are there any remnants from the Prophet?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Answer :</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing now from the remnants of the Prophet <em>-alayhi as Sallat wa sallam</em>. Whoever claims that there remains something from his belongings then he is a liar and a crazy foolish person!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We visited India and found people who claimed that they had a hair of the Prophet <em>-alayhi as Sallat wa sallam</em>. They are liars and they are cheaters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We saw, I think it was either in Pakistan or in Bangladesh a Masjid, where they claimed they had the foot print of the Prophet <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in Delhi there was a Masjid and the Imam was a Bukhari and he had a lot of influence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Non-Muslim European men and women who were barely dressed would visit this Masjid.  They would go to a place in the Masjid and this Bukhari person would say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘At this place is a remnant of the Prophet <em>-alayhi as Sallat wa Sallam</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It had the like of a dome built over it. You see shameless women and men gathering to view the footprint of the Prophet <em>-alayhi as Sallat wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I saw this evil and I came to this Imam to advise him and I said: ‘You people claim that the Prophet <em>-alayhi as Sallat wa sallam –</em> came to this place and this is his remnant/sign? ‘</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied: the people say such-and-such.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to him: ‘O Brother we read history and came to know that the Messenger <em>-alayhi as Sallat wa sallam-</em> was taken up to the heavens, he went from Makkah to Madinah and he went out for battles to well known areas and he went to Tabuk, but we did not find in history that the Messenger came to Delhi and stood at this place! !</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was going around in circles. . . . then I spoke to his father when he came – and I had a Salafi with me translating – his father said about me: ‘This is bad manners’ [i.e. towards the Prophet’s hair.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then this Salafi who was with me informed me:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘That when King Saud <em>-rahimullaah-</em> visited India and came to Banaras  which is the main center idols and deities – this place Banaras is like Makkah –  In this place they have many idols,  so when they heard that he will visit this place they covered these idols – I swear by Allaah they covered them up – why ? Out of fear of Tawheed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he came to this Masjid to pray and they said to him: Here is the footprint of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> so he quickly left that place and came to know that this is foolishness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The person who singles out Allaah alone has knowledge and insight, he has understanding, the people of Bida have stupidity, ignorance and foolishness or evilness. May Allaah bless you. So there are many claimants.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Turkey they claim that the Prophet’s hair is present there,  some of the people claim that the Mus’haf which Ali <em>-radiAllaah anhu-</em> wrote with his hand is present etc….. these are lies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sunnah of Allaah regarding these things is that they pass away and cease to exist, this is the Sunnah which Allaah -Subhanahu wa Ta’ala- placed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah send praise and security upon Muhammad, upon his family and his Companions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) said:<span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> &#8220;Show reverence to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) by honouring the members of his family.&#8221;</strong></span> </span>[Al-Bukhari].</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Yazid bin Haiyan reported: I went along with Husain bin Sabrah and `Amr bin Muslim to Zaid bin Arqam (May Allah be pleased with them) and, as we sat by his side, Husain said to him,<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;</span>Zaid, you acquired great merits, you saw Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), listened to him talking, fought by his side in (different) battles, and offered Salat (prayer) behind him. Zaid, you have indeed earned great merits. Could you narrate to us what you heard from Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)?&#8221; Zaid said, &#8220;By Allah! I have grown old and have almost spent up my age and I have forgotten some of the things which I remembered in connection with Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), so accept what I narrate to you, do not compel me to narrate what I fail to narrate&#8221;. He then said, &#8220;One day Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) stood up to deliver a Khutbah at a watering place known as Khumm between Makkah and Al-Madinah. He praised Allah, extolled Him, and exhorted (us) and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `Amma Ba`du. O people, I am a human being. I am about to receive a messenger (the angel of death) from my Rubb and I will respond to Allah&#8217;s Call, but I am leaving with you two weighty things: the first is the Book of Allah, in which there is right guidance and light, so hold fast to the Book of Allah and adhere to it.&#8217; He exhorted (us to hold fast) to the Book of Allah</span> and then said,<strong><span style="color:#0000ff;"> `The second is the members of my household, I remind you (to be kind) to the members of my family. I remind you (to be kind) to the members of my family.</span></strong> Husain said to Zaid, &#8220;Who are the members of his household, O Zaid? Aren&#8217;t his wives the members of his family?&#8221; Thereupon Zaid said, &#8220;His wives are the members of his family. (But here) the members of his family are those for whom Zakat is forbidden&#8221;. &nbsp;He asked, &#8220;Who are they?&#8221; Zaid said, &#8220;Ali and the offspring of `Ali, `Aqil and the offspring of `Aqil and the offspring of Ja`far and the offspring of `Abbas.&#8221; Husain asked, &#8220;For all of them the acceptance of Zakat is forbidden?&#8221; Zaid (May Allah be pleased with him) said, &#8220;Yes&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Part 7 : The Condemnation of the People of Knowledge for this Dome</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that the people of knowledge &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on them &#8211; condemn what has been prohibited by the Sharia&#8217;. Some of them have clearly mentioned their condemnation and some of them -perhaps- have remained silent, since what is known is that there is no advantage to this speech.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps they took into account the permissibility of remaining silent because of the saying of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; to &#8216;Aeysha -radiAllaah anhu:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;If it were not that your people had recently left kufr (disbelief) I would have rebuilt the house (Ka&#8217;ba) on the foundations upon which Ibraheem built it.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Agreed upon by Bukharee and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is understood is that those who openly mentioned their condemnation fulfilled what Allaah had made obligatory upon them, which is advising for the sake of Islaam and the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following are some of those who condemned the building of this dome.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him &#8211; said in his book &#8216;Iqtidaa Siraat ul-Mustaqeem&#8217; :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;…….And this is why, when his apartment was built in the time of the Tabieen (the followers of the Companions) &#8211; I would sacrifice my mother and father for him &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- that<span style="color:#993300;"> they left the top of it as a skylight towards the sky</span>. And it was like that until recent times, with wax placed upon it and rocks on its edges which held it together.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The roof was projecting upwards towards the sky and it was like that at the time the masjid and the mimbar (pulpit) were burnt down in the year six hundred and fifty odd. The fire was so severe in the land of the Hijjaz that it lit up the necks of the camels in Basra. After that came the fitnah (trial) of the Tartars in Baghdad and other Fitn (trials) also came.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Then the Masjid was re-built as it had originally been, as was the roof, and a wooden wall was introduced around the apartment. Then, after a number of years, the dome was erected on the roof whilst there were those who condemned it.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Sanaani &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him &#8211; said in &#8216;Tatheer al-I&#8217;tiqaad&#8217; :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;If you say: This is the grave of the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, a great dome has been built upon it and a lot of money has been spent on it. Then, I say that this is major ignorance of the reality of the situation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Without doubt this dome was not built by the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, nor by his Companions, nor by their successors (Tabieen), nor the followers of the successors, nor the scholars of the Ummah &#8211; the Imaams of his people.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Rather, this dome was imposed on his grave &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; and was built by one of the latter kings of Misr (Eygpt), Qaloon as-Salihee, more well known as king al-Mansoor in the year 678.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He mentioned it in: &#8216;Tahqeeq an-Nasraah bi Talkheehs mu&#8217;aalim Dar al-Hijrah&#8217; and these matters are issued by the governments and not based upon evidences from the text.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">Shaykh Hussain bin Mahdi an-Nuaymi mentions, in his book &#8216;Ma&#8217;arij alAlbaab&#8217;, the statements of some of those who were tried as a result of taking the dome of the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; as sanction for the permissibility of building all domes. A Mufti states, &#8216;From what is well known is that the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; had a dome, just like the &#8216;Aawliya of Madeenah and the &#8216;Aawliya of the rest of the different cities. Building domes is the fashion in every era; it is believed that having a dome is the cause of receiving blessings.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nuaymi &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him &#8211; commented by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;I say: if this is the case, then what about the fact that the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, warned against this, he cautioned and cleared his blessed and pure self &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam from what you did. You did exactly what he specifically prohibited. Was it not sufficient for you that you opposed his command? This (alone) is evidence against yourselves. You were forward in the presence of the Messenger (ie his statement). Did he &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – allude to any of what you hold permissible? Was he pleased with that or did he not prohibit this? As for your belief of blessings descending, then this is from yourselves and not from Allaah, and Allaah has refuted you.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Ikhwaan &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on them &#8211; entered Madeenah at the time of AbdulAzeez &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him -, it was of great importance to them to remove the dome. If only they had done so, but they &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on them &#8211; feared that the fitnah from the <strong>Qubooreeyeen</strong> (the sect of grave-worshippers) would be greater than removing the dome i.e. that removing an evil might lead to something more evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look how many false arguments the Qubooreeyeen have when they are called to remove these domes, some of which are similar to al-Laat, Uzza and Habil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance. &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">–</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>هـل نـسـتـغـفـر النبي؟</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;">Translated &amp; Compiled By Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What has been said about the Ayaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ إِذْ ظَلَمُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ جَاءُوكَ فَاسْتَغْفَرُوا اللَّهَ وَاسْتَغْفَرَ لَهُمُ الرَّسُولُ لَوَجَدُوا اللَّهَ تَوَّابًا رَحِيمًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> If they (hypocrites), when they had been unjust to themselves, had come to you (Muhammad) and begged Allaah’s Forgiveness, and the Messenger had begged forgiveness for them: indeed, they would have found Allaah All-Forgiving (One Who accepts repentance), Most Merciful</strong></span>.&gt;&gt;   [Nisa: 64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>1 – Shaykh ul-Islaam Ahmad bin AbdulHaleem Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) -Rahimullaah- said:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘From the people there are those who interpret the saying of Allaah Ta’ala :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ إِذْ ظَلَمُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ جَاءُوكَ فَاسْتَغْفَرُوا اللَّهَ وَاسْتَغْفَرَ لَهُمُ الرَّسُولُ لَوَجَدُوا اللَّهَ تَوَّابًا رَحِيمًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If they (hypocrites), when they had been unjust to themselves, had come to you (Muhammad) and begged Allaah’s Forgiveness, and the Messenger had begged forgiveness for them: indeed, they would have found Allaah All-Forgiving (One Who accepts repentance), Most Merciful.</strong></span>&gt;&gt; [Nisa: 64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They say : ‘If we seek forgiveness from the Messenger after his death then we are of the status of those who sought forgiveness from amongst the Companions.’  However, with this statement they oppose the Ijmaa (consensus) of the Companions and those who succeeded them with goodness and the rest of the Muslims, since not a single one of them sought from the Prophet –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– after his death that he intercede for them. Nor did they ask him anything and not a single one of the Imams mentioned this in their books.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Majmoo al-Fatawa 1/190]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>2 – Shaykh Allaama Saddeeq Hasan Khan (d. 1307 A.H.) said about this Ayaah :</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This ‘visiting/coming to the Prophet’ is specific to his  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam–  life time, and this does not mean that ‘this visiting /coming to’ is to  the enlightened place where he is buried after his death  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.  What indicates to this is what is mentioned in this Ayaah, as is affirmed in the book: ‘Saarim al-Munky’. This is why none from the Salaf of the Ummahand their Imams, not from  the Companions, Successors, nor from those who followed them in goodness ever took this extreme possibility [of seeking forgiveness from the Prophet –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– after his death.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Fath al-Bayan fee Maqasid al-Qur’aan 2/315]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">3 – Shaykh Abdul Muhsin bin Hamd al-Abbad al-Badr said:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for the saying of Allaah Ta’ala :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ إِذْ ظَلَمُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ جَاءُوكَ فَاسْتَغْفَرُوا اللَّهَ وَاسْتَغْفَرَ لَهُمُ الرَّسُولُ لَوَجَدُوا اللَّهَ تَوَّابًا رَحِيمًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If they (hypocrites), when they had been unjust to themselves, had come to you (Muhammad) and begged Allaah’s Forgiveness, and the Messenger had begged forgiveness for them: indeed, they would have found Allaah All-Forgiving (One Who accepts repentance), Most Merciful</strong></span>.&gt;&gt;   [Nisa: 64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then this Ayaah is in regard to the Munafiqeen, this becomes clear from what preceded this Ayaah and what came after it. ‘Coming to’ the Prophet  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– is specific to, in his lifetime. What is established in ‘Saheeh al-Bukhari’ from the Hadeeth of ‘Aeysha –Radhi Allaahu anha–that when she said: ‘O my head is hurting!’ The Messenger of Allaah –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– said to her:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>ذَاكِ لَوْ كَانَ وَأَنَا حَىٌّ، فَأَسْتَغْفِرُ لَكِ، وَأَدْعُو لَكِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘If you die and I am alive then I will seek forgiveness for you and I will pray for you. . . ‘</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the Prophet –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– was to seek forgiveness for anyone after his death then there would not have been a difference between him dying before her or her dying before him. Some of the people of Bida’ claim that which is much more than that, which is that the Prophet  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– brought his hand out of the grave and shook hands with one of the followers of the people of Bida’. What clearly invalidates this, is that the likes of this never occurred for the Companions –Radhi Allaahu anhum– and they are the best of this Ummah.  The Prophet  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>أَنَا سَيِّدُ وَلَدِ آدَمَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ وَأَوَّلُ مَنْ يَنْشَقُّ عَنْهُ الْقَبْرُ وَأَوَّلُ شَافِعٍ وَأَوَّلُ مُشَفَّعٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">‘I am the leader of the son of Adam on the Day of Judgement and I am the first for whom the grave will be opened and I am the first to intercede and the first to be interceded.’</span></strong> [Muslim] And this opening of the grave will be when the resurrection takes place. Allaah Ta’ala said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>ثُمَّ إِنَّكُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ تُبْعَثُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Then (again), surely, you will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection.</span></strong> &gt;&gt;[al-Muminun : 16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Butlaan Qisatay by AbdurRahmaan al-Umaysaan p.179-180]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaykh Abdul Muhsin bin Hamd al-Abbad al-Badr also said:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for the saying of Allaah -Tabarak wa Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ إِذْ ظَلَمُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ جَاءُوكَ فَاسْتَغْفَرُوا اللَّهَ وَاسْتَغْفَرَ لَهُمُ الرَّسُولُ لَوَجَدُوا اللَّهَ تَوَّابًا رَحِيمًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#000000;">If they (hypocrites), when they had been unjust to themselves, had come to you (Muhammad) and begged Allaah’s Forgiveness, and the Messenger had begged forgiveness for them: indeed, they would have found Allaah All-Forgiving (One Who accepts repentance), Most Merciful.</span></strong>&gt;&gt;   [Nisa: 64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the intent is not approaching his grave  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– after his death, but rather the intent is come to him during his lifetime  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– just as the Companions–Radhi Allaahu anhum– understood it.  I clarified this is in a booklet called ‘The Importance of Tawheed al-Eebaadah’ (p.69) where I said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The inmates of graves are visited and Dua is sought for them and they are not supplicated to. Allaah is requested for them and nothing is requested from them, not Dua’ nor cure nor to achieve benefit nor to repel harm. Since this is indeed requested from Allaah, Allaah -Subhanahu wa Ta’ala- is the One Who is supplicated to and to have hope in. Dua is made for anyone other than Allaah and is not supplicated to, the proof for this is that the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– used to request from him to make Dua during his lifetime and he would make Dua for them. After his death  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam–  during his life of the Barzakeeyah they would not go to his grave  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam–  and requested Dua from him. This is why  when the drought occurred at the time of Umar –Radhi Allaahu anha– he requested Dua for rain from al-Abbas–Radhi Allaahu anha– and Umar requested him to make Dua’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Bukhari collected in his book from Anas that Umar bin al-Khattab used to request Dua for rain from al-Abbas bin AbdulMuttalib, if there was a drought and he would say: ‘O Allaah indeed we used to come closer to You (make Tawassul) with Your Prophet –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– and You [Allaah] would give us rain, and indeed we come closer to You with his uncle, so give us rain,’ then the rain would come down.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if the request for Dua from the Prophet  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– after his death was permissible Umar –Radhi Allaahu anha– would not have turned away from it and requested Al-Abbas to make Dua’ for rain.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ومعنى شهادة أن محمدا رسول الله : طاعته فيما أمر ، وتصديقه فيما أخبر ، واجتناب ما عنه ﻧﻬى وزجر، وأن لا يعبد الله إلا بما شرع</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The meaning of the testification that &#8216;Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah&#8217; is to obey him in whatever he commanded, to believe in the truth of whatever he informed of, and to avoid whatever he forbade and prohibited, and that Allaah is not to be worshipped except with that which He legislated</span></strong>.<span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>38</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[38]: <strong>Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The testification that &#8216;Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah&#8217; has a meaning and something which it necessitates; it is not just a mere saying to be said. So its meaning is that you acknowledge with your tongue and heart that he is the Messenger of Allaah. You say it with your tongue and you hold it as your creed and belief with your heart that he is Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for testifying it upon the tongue whilst denying it in the heart, then this is the way of the hypocrites just as Allaah informed us about them in His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا جَاءَكَ الْمُنَافِقُونَ قَالُوا نَشْهَدُ إِنَّكَ لَرَسُولُ اللَّهِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ إِنَّكَ لَرَسُولُهُ وَاللَّهُ يَشْهَدُ إِنَّ الْمُنَافِقِينَ لَكَاذِبُونَ </span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">اتَّخَذُوا أَيْمَانَهُمْ جُنَّةً فَصَدُّوا عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ ۚ إِنَّهُمْ سَاءَ مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">When the hypocrites come to you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(O Messenger of Allaah</span><span style="color:#008000;"><em> <u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em></span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, they say: &#8216;We bear witness that you are indeed the Messenger of Allaah.&#8217; Allaah knows that you are certainly His Messenger and Allaah bears witness that the hypocrites are certainly liars. They take their oaths as a cover to shield themselves</span>. </strong>[63:1-2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They make their oaths, meaning their testimonies, a screen to conceal them. They block and prevent people from Allaah&#8217;s Path. So this shows that saying it upon the tongue is not sufficient.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise believing in the heart whilst not saying it upon the tongue for one who is able to speak will also not suffice. This is because the <em>mushrikoon</em> (the people of <em>shirk</em>) used to know that he was Allaah&#8217;s Messenger, however, they obstinately refused just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قَدْ نَعْلَمُ إِنَّهُ لَيَحْزُنُكَ الَّذِي يَقُولُونَ ۖ فَإِنَّهُمْ لَا يُكَذِّبُونَكَ وَلَٰكِنَّ الظَّالِمِينَ بِآيَاتِ اللَّهِ يَجْحَدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">We certainly know that that which they say grieves you (O Messenger of Allaah<em> <u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em>): however, they do not believe you to be a liar. But rather, the <em>Dhaalimoon</em> just outwardly reject the signs of Allaah</span>. </strong>[6:33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in their hearts, they acknowledge his Messenger-ship and they know that he is indeed Allaah&#8217;s Messenger. However, they were prevented with haughtiness and obstinacy from affirming his Messenger-ship (upon their tongues).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, they were prevented by  envy as is the case with the Jews and the Arab <em>mushriks</em>. Aboo Jahl &#8216;Amir bin Hishaam used to acknowledge and say: We and Banoo Haashim used to be equal in all matters. However, now they say: From us has come a Messenger and there is no Messenger from us. How could we bring out a Messenger?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, they deny his Messenger-ship out of envy towards Banoo Haashim.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> Aboo <u>T</u>aalib said in his poem:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>And I certainly know that the religion of Mu<u>h</u>ammad</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>is the best of the religions of the people.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>If it were not for the fear of being rebuked or abused</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>He would have found me clearly embracing that</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, he acknowledged in his heart the Messenger-ship of Muhammad, however zealousness for his own people from the days of ignorance prevented him. So, he did not reject the religion of &#8216;Abdul-Muttalib which was the worship of idols. Therefore, they acknowledged his Prophet-hood in their hearts. But acknowledgement in the heart that he is the Messenger is not sufficient. Rather, it is essential that the person (also) states it with his tongue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, it is not sufficient that a person states it upon his tongue and acknowledges it with his heart, rather a third matter is essential which is to follow the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em>. Allaah the Most High said with regard to him:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا بِهِ وَعَزَّرُوهُ وَنَصَرُوهُ وَاتَّبَعُوا النُّورَ الَّذِي أُنزِلَ مَعَهُ ۙ أُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So those who believe in him </strong>(Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em>)<strong>, honor him, aid him, and follow the light which he was sent down with, they are the successful ones.</strong></span> [7:157]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even if a person were to aid him to the extent that Aboo <u>T</u>aalib did, and defend him whilst knowing that he is Allaah&#8217;s Messenger, however he does not follow him, then he will not be a Muslim unless and until he follows him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why the <em>Shaykh</em> (Mu<u>h</u>ammad bin &#8216;Abdul-Wahhaab) said: The meaning of the testification that &#8216;Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah&#8217; is to obey him regarding whatever he commanded, to believe in his truthfulness with regard to whatever he informed of, and to avoid whatever forbade and prohibited, and that Allaah is not worshipped except with that which He legislated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there has to be, along with acknowledgement of his Messenger-ship outwardly, inwardly and in belief, there has to be following of him <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that is summarized in these four phrases which the <em>Shaykh</em> (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: To obey him in whatever he commanded. Allaah the Majestic and Most High says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَّن يُطِعِ الرَّسُولَ فَقَدْ أَطَاعَ اللَّهَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Whoever obeys the Messenger has indeed obeyed Allaah</span>. </strong>[4:80]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Perfect says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا أَرْسَلْنَا مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلَّا لِيُطَاعَ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We did not send a Messenger except that he should be obeyed by the Permission of Allaah.</span> </strong>[4:64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He joined obedience to the Messenger along with obedience to Him, He the Perfect and Most High. And He joined disobedience to the Messenger to disobedience to Him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And whoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger, then there will be for him the Fire of Hell. They will remain forever in it. </strong></span>[72:23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِن تُطِيعُوهُ تَهْتَدُوا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if you obey him, you will be rightly guided. </strong></span>[24:54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَطِيعُوا الرَّسُولَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> </strong><strong>And obey the Messenger so that you may receive mercy. </strong></span>[24:56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is essential to obey him <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em>. The person who bears witness that he is the Messenger of Allaah, then it becomes binding upon him to obey him regarding whatever he commanded. This is because of His saying He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا آتَاكُمُ الرَّسُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَاكُمْ عَنْهُ فَانتَهُوا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And whatever the Messenger gives you, then accept it. And whatever he forbids you from, then desist. </strong></span>[59:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَلْيَحْذَرِ الَّذِينَ يُخَالِفُونَ عَنْ أَمْرِهِ أَن تُصِيبَهُمْ فِتْنَةٌ أَوْ يُصِيبَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So let those who oppose his command, beware lest a trial befall upon them or a painful punishment. </strong></span>[24:63]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who oppose his command: Meaning: the command of the Messenger. So therefore, it is essential to obey the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: Believing in the truth of whatever he informed of because the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam </em>informed of many matters of the hidden and the unseen. He informed about Allaah, the angels, and he informed about matters which are not present and matters of the future with regard to the establishment of the Hour, the signs of the Hour and Paradise and the Fire. And he informed about matters of the past with regard to the conditions of the previous nations. So it is essential to attest to the truth of whatever he informed of because it is true, there is no falsehood in it. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا يَنطِقُ عَنِ الْهَوَىٰ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا وَحْيٌ يُوحَىٰ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He does not speak from his own desires, it is just revelation sent. </strong></span>[53:3-4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam </em>did not speak with these reports or with these commands or prohibitions &#8211; he did not speak with anything from his own self <em>&#8216;alaihi<u>s</u>alaatu wassalaam</em>. He only spoke through revelation from Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. So therefore, what he reported is true and whoever does not believe him with regard to which he informed of, then he is not a believer and he is not truthful in his testification that he is the Messenger of Allaah. How can a person testify that he is indeed the Messenger of Allaah and then disbelieve in what he narrates? How can he bear witness that he is Allaah&#8217;s Messenger and then not obey his command?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: Avoiding whatever he forbade and prohibited. Keep away from whatever the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em> forbade. He forbade you from many sayings, actions, and characteristics and he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em> would not forbid anything at all unless it contained harm and evil. He would not command something except something containing good and righteousness. So if the servant does not avoid that which Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em> prohibited, then he is not truly bearing witness to his Messenger-ship. Rather, he is contradicting himself; how could he bear witness that he is Allaah&#8217;s Messenger and then not avoid that which the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam </em>forbade him from?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah the Most High says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا آتَاكُمُ الرَّسُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَاكُمْ عَنْهُ فَانتَهُوا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And whatever the Messenger gives you, then accept it. And whatever he forbids you from, then desist. </strong></span>[59:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam </em>said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ﭽإذا ﻧﻬيتكم عن شيء فاجتنبوه ، وإذا أمرتكم بأمر فأتوا منه ما استطعتمﭼ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>When I forbid you from something, then keep away from it. When I command you with a matter, then do from it what you are able to.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is essential to avoid whatever he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em> forbade.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth</strong>: Allaah is not to be worshipped except with that which he legislated. Restrict yourself in acts of worship to that which Allaah legislated for his Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em>. So do not perform an act of worship which the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em> did not legislate even if you are intending good and even if you are desiring reward, for this action will be a futile action because the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em> did not come with it. The intention will not suffice, rather there must be following.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So actions of worship are <em>tawqeefiyyah</em> (depend upon the text). It is not permissible to perform acts of worship which Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em> did not legislate. Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ﭽمن عمل عملا ليس عليه أمرنا فهو ردﭼ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Whoever does an action which our affair is not in accordance with, then it is rejected.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ﭽعليكم  بسنتي وسنة الخلفاء الراشدين المهديين من بعدي ، تمسكوا ﺑﻬا وعضوا عليها بالنواجذ ، وإياكم ومحدثات الأمور ، فإن كل محدثة بدعة ، وكل بدعة ضلالةﭼ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Adhere to my <em>Sunnah</em> and the <em>Sunnah</em> of the rightly-guided orthodox Caliphs who come after me. Adhere to it and cling unto it with your molar teeth. And beware of newly introduced matters, for every newly introduced matter is an innovation and every innovation is an astray</strong>.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So performing an act of worship which was not legislated by Allaah&#8217;s Messenger is counted as an evil innovation which is prohibited, even if so-and-so or so-and-so holds it as his saying or if it is done by so-and-so from the people because it is something outside what the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em> came with, then it is innovation and misguidance. So therefore, Allaah may not be worshiped except with that which he legislated upon the tongue of His Messenger. And the newly-invented matters introduced in the religion and false superstitions are all false and futile actions. They will be a deficiency and a misguidance for the one who does it, even if he is intending good by it and intending to gain reward. This is since it is not the intended goals that are counted, rather what is counted is <em>al-ittibaa&#8217;</em> (the following of the Messenger), obedience and compliance. And if we were free to do whatever we wish and to perform as many acts of worship as we want, then we would have not needed the sending of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather from the Mercy of Allaah upon us is that He did not leave us to our own intellects and He did not leave us to so-and-so and so-and-so from the people because these are matters which are referred back to the legislation, to Allaah and His Messenger. And nothing from them (i.e. acts of worship) will benefit except that which conforms to that which Allaah and His Messenger legislated. So this means avoiding all of the innovations, and whoever introduces any innovation in the religion which the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em> did not come with, then he has not truly borne witness that He is the Messenger of Allaah. He has not given the true testification because the one who testifies that he is indeed the Messenger of Allaah <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em> with a true testification will restrict himself to that which he legislated and he will not introduce anything from himself or follow anything which has been introduced by those who preceded him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the meaning of the testification that &#8216;Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah.&#8217; It is not just a few words which are said upon the tongue without adherence, without action and without restricting oneself to that which the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em> came with.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Neither Wealthy, Nor Knowledge of the Unseen, Nor an Angel<br />
By Shaykh ul-Islaam Ahmad bin AbdulHaleem Ibn Taymeeyah -Rahimullaah-</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">قُلْ لَا أَقُولُ لَكُمْ عِنْدِي خَزَائِنُ اللَّهِ وَلَا أَعْلَمُ الْغَيْبَ وَلَا أَقُولُ لَكُمْ إِنِّي مَلَكٌ إِنْ أَتَّبِعُ إِلَّا مَا يُوحَى إِلَيَّ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#000000;">Say (O Muhammad): “I don’t tell you that with me are the treasures of Allah, nor (that) I know the unseen; nor I tell you that I am an angel. I but follow what is revealed to me by inspiration.”</span></strong>&gt;&gt; [Soorah Ana’am : 50]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ahmad bin AbdulHaleem Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) -Rahimullaah- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed the Messenger –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– was ordered to free himself from claiming these three things with Allaah’s statement &lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Say : ‘I don’t tell you that with me are the treasures of Allaah, nor (that) I know the unseen; nor I tell you that I am an angel. I but follow what is revealed to me by inspiration.’</span></strong> &gt;&gt; This is also what Nuh -alayhi as-Salam- said and he was the first of the main Messengers, the first Messenger&nbsp;[1] whom Allaah Ta’ala sent to the people of the earth. Here, too now, is the seal of the Messengers and the seal of the main Messengers and they have both freed themselves from this claim. This is because people sometimes seek knowledge of the unseen from the Messenger–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, as in the saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَى هَذَا الْوَعْدُ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#000000;">They say: “When will this promise (i.e. the Day of Resurrection) come to pass? if you are telling the truth.”</span> </strong>&gt;&gt; [Mulk:25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ السَّاعَةِ أَيَّانَ مُرْسَاهَا قُلْ إِنَّمَا عِلْمُهَا عِنْدَ رَبِّي</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>They ask you about the Hour (Day of Resurrection): “When will be its appointed time?” Say: “The knowledge thereof is with my Lord (Alone)</strong></span>. &gt;&gt; [al-Aa’raaf: 187]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also they sometimes seek this knowledge to be persuaded of the truth, as in the saying of Allaah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَقَالُوا لَنْ نُؤْمِنَ لَكَ حَتَّى تَفْجُرَ لَنَا مِنَ الْأَرْضِ يَنْبُوعًا () أَوْ تَكُونَ لَكَ جَنَّةٌ مِنْ نَخِيلٍ وَعِنَبٍ فَتُفَجِّرَ الْأَنْهَارَ خِلَالَهَا تَفْجِيرًا () أَوْ تُسْقِطَ السَّمَاءَ كَمَا زَعَمْتَ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفًا أَوْ تَأْتِيَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْمَلَائِكَةِ قَبِيلًا () أَوْ يَكُونَ لَكَ بَيْتٌ مِنْ زُخْرُفٍ أَوْ تَرْقَى فِي السَّمَاءِ وَلَنْ نُؤْمِنَ لِرُقِيِّكَ حَتَّى تُنَزِّلَ عَلَيْنَا كِتَابًا نَقْرَؤُهُ قُلْ سُبْحَانَ رَبِّي هَلْ كُنْتُ إِلَّا بَشَرًا رَسُولًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#000000;">And they say: “We shall not believe in you, until you cause a spring to gush forth from the earth for us; “Or you have a garden of date-palms and grapes, and cause rivers to gush forth in their midst abundantly; “Or you cause the heaven to fall upon us in pieces, as you have pretended, or you bring Allaah and the angels before (us) face to face; “Or you have a house of adornable materials (like silver and pure gold, etc.), or you ascend up into the sky, and even then we will put no faith in your ascension until you bring down for us a Book that we would read.” Say : “Glorified (and Exalted) be my Lord (Allaah) above all that evil they (polytheists) associate with Him! Am I anything but a man, sent as a Messenger?”</span></strong>&gt;&gt; [al-Israa: 90-93]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sometimes, they would regard the human need a Messenger had as shameful, as in the saying of Allaah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَقَالُوا مَالِ هَذَا الرَّسُولِ يَأْكُلُ الطَّعَامَ وَيَمْشِي فِي الْأَسْوَاقِ لَوْلَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْهِ مَلَكٌ فَيَكُونَ مَعَهُ نَذِيرًا () أَوْ يُلْقَى إِلَيْهِ كَنْزٌ أَوْ تَكُونُ لَهُ جَنَّةٌ يَأْكُلُ مِنْهَا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And they say: “Why does this Messenger eat food, and walk about in the markets (like ourselves). Why is not an angel sent down to him to be a warner with him? “Or (why) has not a treasure been granted to him, or why has he not a garden whereof he may eat?”</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [Furqan : 7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, Allaah ordered the Messenger to inform them that he neither knew the unseen, nor did he possess the treasures of Allaah, nor was he an Angel who was not in need of eating or wealth. Rather, he was a follower of what was revealed to him, following that which was revealed to him is the Deen, which is obedience to Allaah and he was commanded to worship Him with knowledge and actions, both inward and outward. A person attains from those three things, according to the amount Allaah Ta’ala gives him. He learns from him what He has taught him and has ability according to what Allaah gives him the capability to do, and he suffices himself with that which Allaah enriched him with in matters which would otherwise oppose general practices or the practice of the majority of the people.’</p>

<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ إِذ ظَّلَمُوا أَنفُسَهُمْ جَاءُوكَ فَاسْتَغْفَرُوا اللَّهَ وَاسْتَغْفَرَ لَهُمُ الرَّسُولُ لَوَجَدُوا اللَّهَ تَوَّابًا رَّحِيمًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>If, when they had wronged themselves, they had come to you &#8211; O Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) – and had sought Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness, and the Messenger had asked for Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness for them, then they would have found that Allaah would have accepted their repentance and had mercy upon them. </strong></span><span style="text-align:center;">[Sooratun-Nisaa (4): 64]</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Ibnul-Qayyim (<em>rahimahullaah</em>)</strong> said:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Since Allaah – the One free of all imperfections – knew that those to whom the Messenger was sent would certainly wrong themselves and follow their desires, He guided them to that which would repel the evil of that wrong and remove its causes. This lay in two things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>, there was something that they themselves were to do, which was to seek forgiveness of their Lord – the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>, there was something for someone else to do, and this was that the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) should ask forgiveness for them when they came to him, submitted obediently to him and acknowledged their wrong-doing. So, if they were to do these two things, they would find that Allaah would accept their repentance and forgive them. He would accept their repentance, thus wiping away the effect of their sins and protecting them from their evils. In addition to this, He would grant them His Mercy, His favourable and fine treatment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, what share of this Aayah is there for a person who wrongs himself after the death of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ? Does the use of the Aayah support those people who claim that the person should go to his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) grave; ask for forgiveness there, and for his intercession?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reply is that, as for the share of the person who wrongs himself after the death of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) with regard to this Aayah, he should ask for Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness, with sincere repentance and this applies in every time and place. It is not a condition for the correctness of his repentance that he should go to his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) grave, and ask for forgiveness there. (By consensus- Ijmaa&#8221;).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">As for going to his grave and seeking forgiveness there and seeking his intercession, using this Aayah as an evidence, then the Aayah does not indicate this in any sense at all. It only refers to going to him (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ; not going to his grave; nor does it state that he will seek forgiveness for them if they seek intercession from him after his death.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is thus shown to be a false and futile argument which is further clarified by the fact that the Companions, those who of all people knew best about the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) , did not understand the Aayah in this way. So it is known that this is an innovation. That which is most frequently used as evidence by those who permit it, is the narration of al-`Utabee from an unknown Bedouin, even though we do not know any chain of narration for it. If this disconnected report, or it&#8217;s like, were a hadeeth or a report from a Companion, then it would not be permissible to use it as a proof, and its ruling would not be binding upon us because of its lack of authenticity. How then can it be permissible to use as proof for this a story that is not authentic, concerning a Bedouin who is unknown!? [1]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaikh ‘Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Naasir as-Sa`dee</strong> (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Meaning: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If, when they had wronged themselves, they had come to you &#8211; O Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">i.e. acknowledging their sins, and fully confessing them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>…and had sought Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness, and the Messenger had asked for Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness for them, then they would have found that Allaah would have accepted their repentance and had mercy upon them</strong></span>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">i.e. He would have turned to them, forgiven their wrongdoing, and been Merciful to them; by accepting their repentance, guiding them to it and granting it to them, and rewarding them for it. This coming to the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was something specific to his lifetime.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>This is what the context indicates, because seeking forgiveness from the Messenger cannot occur except in his lifetime. As for after his death, then nothing can be sought from him; rather that would be shirk.&#8221;</strong></span> [2]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align:center;"><strong>بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>IMAAM AN-NASAA·EE</strong> reported in his &#8220;`Amalul-Yawm wal Laylah&#8221; (no. 250):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>Aboo Bakr ibn Naafi` related to us, saying: Bahz narrated to us, saying: Hammaad ibn Salamah narrated to us, saying: Thaabit narrated to us: from Anas: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">that some people said to Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم): &#8220;O best one of us, and the son of the best of us! O our chief and the son of our chief!&#8221; So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: &lt;&lt; O people! Say what you have to say, and do not let Satan mislead you into following desires. I do not want you to raise me above the position which Allaah -the Most High &#8211; gave to me. I am Muhammad the son of &#8216;Abdullaah. His Slave and His Messenger</span>.</strong> &gt;&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also reported by Ahmad, Ibn Humayd in &#8220;al-Muntakhab&#8221;, Ibn Mandah in &#8220;atTawheed&#8221;, and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaikh al-Albaanee</strong> said: &#8220;Its chain of narration is &#8220;Saheeh&#8221; to the standard of Muslim.” [&#8220;Ghaayatul-Maraam&#8221; (no. 127); &#8220;as-Saheehah&#8221; (nos. 1097 &amp; 1572).</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>***</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Shaikh Saalih al-Fawzaan</strong></span> -hafizahullaah- said in &#8220;I`aanatul-mustafeed bisharh Kitaabit-Tawheed&#8221; (2/435- ):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8230;Their saying: &#8220;O our chief and the son of our chief!&#8221; was something the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) rebuked; and likewise their saying: &#8220;O best one of us and the son of the best of us! &#8220;The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) also criticised this, because the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not desire praise. Rather he wanted to be described with that which Allaah-the Most High &#8211; described him with: with Messengership and Prophethood, and that is sufficient honour for him (صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying: &lt;&lt; And do not let Satan mislead you into following desires ( laa yastahwiyannakumush-Shaytaan). &gt;&gt; : (yastahwiyannakum) means: that he leads you into following desires which lead away from the path of Allaah -the Mighty and Majestic; or it is from &#8220;al-Hawiyy&#8221;, which means falling into destruction; meaning: let not Satan cause you to fall into misguidance, or let him not cause you to fall into desires which lead you astray from the path of Allaah -the Mighty and Majestic; for Satan misleads people in gradual stages, until he brings about their destruction. So the Muslim should be aware of Satan, and his misleading in gradual stages, and his leading into following desires. He should not relax with regard to Satan about anything, even if it is something slight, since it will become greater and larger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &lt;&lt; I am Muhammad, Allaah’s Slave and His Messenger. &gt;&gt;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the correct way to mention him (صلى الله عليه و سلم) with praise: servitude and Messengership.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&lt;&lt; I do not love that you raise me above the position which Allaah -the Mighty and Majestic-gave to me. &gt;&gt;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the wisdom behind his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) forbiddance: that he feared for them, in their praising of him, that they would raise him above the position which Allaah gave to him; and that is Servitude (`Uboodiyyah) and Messengership (Risaalah). So he feared that they would start to believe that he had some aspects of Lordship ( Ruboobiyyah), just as happened to the Christians with regard to `Eesaa -`alaihis-Salaatu was-Salaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the saying &#8220;His Slave&#8221; (`Abduhu ) prevents excessive praise (ghuluww); and the saying &#8220;His Messenger&#8221; (Rasooluhu) prevents belittlement of him (صلى الله عليه و سلم). So you should not just say that he is only a man and a human, and think that he has no distinction over the rest of mankind, as is said by the Unbelievers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;You are nothing but a man like us&#8221;</span></em> [Sooratush-Shu`araa·. (26): 154]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>SO THESE TWO HADEETH [1] GIVE US SOME TREMENDOUS POINTS OF BENEFIT:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] i.e. This hadeeth along with a similar hadeeth of `Abdullaah ibn ash-Shikhkheerradiyallaahu `anhu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THE FIRST POINT OF BENEFIT:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is a warning against going beyond the limits (al-ghuluww) with regard to him (صلى الله عليه و سلم), by way of excessive praise; and that he should only be described with those attributes given to him by Allaah: Servitude ( al-`Uboodiyyah) and Messengership (ar-Risaalah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for going beyond the limits regarding him, and describing him as removing troubles and forgiving sins, and that rescue and relief can be sought from him- `alaihis-Salaatu was-Salaam-after his death: as actually occurs with many of those who have deviated today, in what they call &#8220;poems of praise of the Prophet&#8221;- such as &#8220;al-Burdah&#8221; of al-Boosayree; and its like from what has been said by the deviants; then this is excessiveness ( ghuluww) which has led to shirk; such as the saying of al-Boosayree:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>‘O noblest one of the creation! I have none to seek protection</em><br />
<em> and shelter with besides </em><em>you, when disasters strike;</em><br />
<em> And if you do not take hold of my hand in the Hereafter,</em><br />
<em> as a favour from you, then O how I shall fall!</em><br />
<em> Since from your generosity comes the whole world and its treasures;</em><br />
<em> and from your knowledge is the knowledge of the Preserved Tablet and the </em><em>Pen.’</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is going beyond the due limits (ghuluww), and Allaah&#8217;s refuge is sought, which led to Unbelief and Shirk, to such an extent the he did not leave anything for Allaah at all! He ascribed everything to the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم): This world and the Hereafter ascribed to the Messenger. The Preserved Tablet and the Pen ascribed to the Messenger. That none can save from the Torment on the Day of Resurrection except the Messenger. So what then remains for Allaah- the Mighty and Majestic?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a poem which they circulate, memorise, and recite during the &#8220;mawlid&#8221; (Innovated birthday celebrations). Likewise other poems of Kufr and Shirk, particularly that which they recite during the innovated mawlid (birthday celebrations) from poems of Shirk. The cause of all of this is exceeding the bounds (ghuluww) with regard to the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for praising him (صلى الله عليه و سلم) with that which Allaah described him with, that he is a Slave [of Allaah] (`Abd) and Messenger (Rasool), and that he is the best of the creation, then there is no harm in this ; just as occurs in the poetry of the Companions who praised him, like the poetry of Hassaan ibn Thaabit, and Ka`b ibn Zuhayr, and likewise Ka`b ibn Maalik, and `Abdullaah ibn Rawaahah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are pure and good poems. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) heard them and approved of them because they did not contain any excessive praise (ghuluww); rather they contained a mention of his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) characteristics…. &gt;&gt;. ”</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>***</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Shaikh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-`Uthaymeen</strong></span> &#8211; rahimahullaah- said in &#8220;alQawlul-Mufeed `alaa Kitaabit-Tawheed&#8221;. ( 2/519-521):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;His saying: &#8220;I am Muhammad, the Slave of Allaah and His Messenger&#8221;: Muhammad is his personal name and &#8220;`Abdullaah’ (Allaah&#8217;s Slave) and &#8220;Rasooluhu&#8221; (His Messenger) are two attributes of his; and these two characteristics are the finest and most profound of the characteristics of the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم). So therefore Allaah -the Most High &#8211; described him with Servitude with regard to the greatest of positions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">in the position of His sending the Qur·aan down to him. He-the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Exalted is He who sent down the Criterion to His Slave&#8221;</span></em> [Sooratul-Furqaan (25):1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and He described him with it in the situation of the Night-Journey. He-the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Perfect is He who took His Slave on a journey by night&#8221;</span></em> [Sooratul-Israa· (17):1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and He described him with it in the situation of his ascent through the heavens. He -the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;So He revealed to His Slave whatever He revealed&#8221;</span></em> [Sooratun-Najm (53): 10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and He described him with it in the situation of defending him and challenging his opponents. He-the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And if you are in doubt concerning that which We sent down to Our Slave&#8221;</span></em> [Sooratul-Baqarah (2):23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and the same was the case with the (rest of the) Prophets, such as in His Saying &#8211; He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;O descendants of those whom We carried in the ship along with Nooh. Indeed he was a thankful slave&#8221;</em></span> [Sooratul-Israa· (17): 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a special and specific Servitude, and it is the highest of the types of servitude. Then servitude to Allaah is the greatest of the attributes of mankind, since man will either worship Allaah or Satan. He-the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;Did I not command you, O descendants of Aadam, that you should not worship Satan. Indeed he is a clear enemy to you. And that you should worship Me alone. That is the Straight Path&#8221;</em></span> [Soorah YaaSeen: (36):60-61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibnul-Qayyim</strong> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;They fled away from the Servitude for which they were created, and were afflicted instead with servitude to the self and to Satan… (And His Messenger): Meaning: The One sent by Him to the whole of mankind. He- the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;Say: O Muhammad! I am indeed the Messenger of Allaah to you all&#8221;</em></span> [Sooratul-A`raaf (7):158]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is at the pinnacle of the levels of righteousness. He the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And whoever obeys Allaah and the Messenger, then they will be along with those whom Allaah has bestowed favour upon; from the Prophets, their true and sincere followers, the martyrs, and the righteous; and what a fine company they are&#8221;</span></em> [Sooratun-Nisaa· (4):69]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So amongst the Prophets was the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم), indeed he was the most excellent of them…</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And two groups went to extreme with regard to the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A group who went to such an extreme that they worshipped him, and they took him for times of ease and hardship, and they worshipped him and called upon him besides Allaah;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A group denied him; and claimed that he was a liar, a sorcerer, a poet, a madman, a soothsayer, and the like;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying &#8220;Allaah’s Slave and His Messenger’ is a refutation of both of the groups…”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Sending Salaat* Upon The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم)</strong><br />
[* i.e. saying &#8220;Allaahumma salli &#8216;alaa Muhammad&#8230;&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam an-Nasaa·ee</strong> –rahimahullaah- reported in his &#8220;Sunan&#8221; (no.1297):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Ishaaq ibn Mansoor related to us, saying: Muhammad ibn Yoosuf narrated to us, saying: Yoonus ibn Abee Ishaaq narrated to us: from Burayd ibn Abee Maryam who said: Anas ibn Maalik narrated to us, saying: Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Whoever sends a single salaat upon me, then Allaah will send ten salawaaat upon Him, and ten sins will be removed from him, and he will be raised by ten ranks</span></strong> &gt;&gt;.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaanee-rahimahullaah- declared it &#8220;Saheeh&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaikh al-Albaanee</strong> said in &#8220;Sifatus-Salaat&#8221; (p.165): ‘‘The most correct saying about the meaning of salaat upon the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the saying of Abul-&#8216;Aaliyah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Allaah&#8217;s salaat upon His Prophet is His extolling him [[to the Angels]] and exalting him; and the salaat of the Angels and others upon him is to request this from Allaah -the Most High&#8221;; and what is meant is seeking increase, not the initiation of salaat al-Haafiz [Ibn Hajr] mentioned it in &#8220;al-Fath&#8221;.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Ibnul-Qayyim</strong> -rahimahullaah, in his book &#8220;Jalaa·ul-Afhaam fee Fadlis-Salaati was-Salaam &#8216;alaa khayril anaam (صلى الله عليه و سلم)&#8221;, mentions <strong>forty benefits arising from sending salaat upon Allaah&#8217;s Messenger</strong> (صلى الله عليه و سلم):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Compliance with the Command of Allaah-the Perfect and Most High. [i.e. in Aayah 65 of Sooratul-Ahzaab].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Conformity with Him- He the Perfect- in sending salaat upon him, even though the two forms of salaat are different. So our salaat upon him is a supplication and a request, whereas the salaat of Allaah-the Most High-upon him is extolling and ennobling&#8230;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Conformity with the Angels in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Attaining ten salawaat [[plural of salaat]] from Allaah by the person who sends salaat upon him once.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. That he is raised by ten levels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. That he has ten good deeds written for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. That ten sins are erased from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. That it is to be hoped that his supplication will be responded to if he precedes it with that. So it causes the supplication to ascend to the Lord of creation, when prior to this it was suspended between the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. It is a means to attain his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) Intercession, if it is accompanied by a request for alwaseelah (a singular station in Paradise) for him, or even if it is on its own&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. It is a means for forgiveness of sins …</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. It is a cause for Allaah to suffice the servant with regard to whatever concerns him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. It is a means for the person to gain nearness to him (صلى الله عليه و سلم) on the Day of Resurrection…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">13.( It has the position of being like an act of charity upon a needy person.)**</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. It is a cause for the fulfillment of your needs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15. It is a cause for Allaah to send salaat upon the person, and for the salaat of His Angels upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16. It is a cleansing (zakaat) and purification for the person.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">17. (It is a cause for the servant to receive glad tidings of Paradise before his death…) **</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">18. (It is a means for salvation from the terrors of the Day of Resurrection…) **</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19. It is a cause for the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to respond to the one who sends salaat and salaam upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">20. (It is a cause for the servant to remember that which he has forgotten.) **</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">21. It is a cause of good for the gathering, and for its not becoming a source of regret for its people on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">22. (It is a means to repel poverty&#8230;) **</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">23. It repels from the person the description of being a miser, if he sends salaat upon him whenever he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">24. He becomes saved from being supplicated against that his nose should be cleaved in dust, for abandoning it when he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">25. It puts its companion upon the path to Paradise, and it causes the one who abandons it to err with regard to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">26. It saves from the stench of a gathering wherein Allaah and His Messenger are not mentioned, and where Allaah-the Most High- is not praised and extolled, and where salaat is not sent upon His Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">27. It is a means for the completion of the speech which was begun with praise of Allaah and salaat upon His Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">28. (It is a cause for the servant&#8221;s light to be increased upon the Bridge (as-Siraat).) **</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">29. It takes the servant away from coarseness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">30. It is a cause for Allaah –the Perfect- to bestow favourable praise upon the one who sends salaat upon him, praising him to the inhabitants of the Heavens and the earth. This is because the one who sends salaat upon him is asking Allaah to extol His Messenger, and to honour, and ennoble him. So recompense conforms to the type of deed, so the one who sends salaat must in turn receive some form of this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">31. It is a cause of blessing for the one who sends salaat, in his self, his deeds, and his life, and the means of his welfare. This is because the one who sends salaat is supplicating to his Lord that He should bless him and his true followers; and this supplication will be answered; and recompense conforms to the deed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">32. It is a means for his attaining the Mercy of Allaah, since mercy is either the meaning of the salaat –upon the saying of some; or it is otherwise something necessitated by it, and required from it-upon the correct saying. So the one who sends salaat upon him must certainly receive Mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">33. It is a means to perpetuate his love of the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم),and to increase it, and to multiply it; and that is one of the essential fundamentals of Eemaan, which it will not be complete without; since the more a servant mentions the one he loves, and remembers him in his heart, and remembers his fine qualities, and those things which instill love of him, then his love of him will increase, and yearning for him will grow, and this will overcome his whole heart. But if he turns away from mentioning him and from thinking of him and of his fine qualities in his heart, then love of him will be reduced in his heart. So there is nothing more pleasing to the one who loves than seeing the one whom he loves, and nothing gives greater pleasure to his heart than mentioning him, and thinking of him and of his fine qualities. So when this becomes strong in his heart, then his tongue will praise and extol him…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">34. That salaat upon him (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is a cause of his loving that person. So because it is a cause for the one who sends salaat upon him to increase in love of him, likewise it is a cause for him to love the one who sends salaat upon him (صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">35. It is a means for the guidance of the person and for his heart to have life…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">36. (It is a cause for the one who sends salaat upon him (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to have his name presented to him, and for his being mentioned to him&#8230;) **</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">37. (It is a cause for the feet to be planted firmly upon the Siraat, and for the person&#8221;s passing over it&#8230;) **</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">38. That sending salaat upon him fulfils the slightest part of his right…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">39. That it comprises remembrance of Allaah and thankfulness to Him, and recognition of His Favour upon His servants in sending him. So the one who sends salaat upon him (صلى الله عليه و سلم) includes in his salaat upon him remembrance of Allaah and remembrance of His Messenger…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">40. That salaat upon him from the person is supplication (du&#8217;aa), and the persons du&#8217;aa. to his Lord and his requests to his Lord are of two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) His requesting his own needs and concerns, and whatever he requires throughout the night and the day. So this is supplication and request, and is to give precedence to that which the servant loves and seeks;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) His requesting that He should extol His chosen and beloved servant, and increase him in nobility and honour, and make mention of him, and elevate him. So there is no doubt that Allaah-the Most High-loves that, and his Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) loves it. So the one who sends salaat upon him (صلى الله عليه و سلم) has turned his requests, that which he desires, and that which he seeks towards that which is loved by Allaah-the Most High- and His Messenger; and he has given preference to that over his own needs and requirements. Indeed this that he seeks has become the most beloved of things to him, and that which he most prefers. So he has given preference to that which Allaah and His Messenger love over that which he himself loves. So he has given preference to Allaah and to what He loves over everything else, and recompense conforms to the action. So whoever gives preference to Allaah over everything else, then Allaah will give preference to him over others…&#8221;&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 43:</strong> It was reported from the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) that he was bewitched. So we would like you to talk about the means by which he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was bewitched. Furthermore, is it contradictory to the status of Prophethood that bewitchment of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) took place?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong> It has been confirmed in the Saheehayn (al- Bukhaaree and Muslim collections of Ahaadeeth) and in other traditions that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was enchanted. <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>His bewitchment, however, did not affect him from the aspect of Legislation or Revelation</strong></span>. The utmost thing in this respect is that he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) reached a stage whereby he began to fancy that he was doing a thing which he was not actually doing. The magic material intended for the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was the cast of a Jew known by the name Labeed ibn al-A’sam. Allaah, The One free of all imperfection and The Most High, protected the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) from it, until he was informed of what occurred to him by way of inspiration. He used to seek refuge in Allaah against evil by the recitation of al-Mu’awwithatayn, soorat al- Falaq and soorat An-Naas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And this kind of magic does not influence the state of Prophethood, since it did not affect the behavior of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) regarding the Revelation and acts of worship</strong></span>, as we have mentioned earlier. Some people have denied that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was bewitched under the pretext that such saying necessitates believing the unbelievers, and even the wrongdoers who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">You follow none but a witched man.</span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-Israa’ (17): 47].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt, however, that such saying does not obligate approving those unbelievers and wrongdoers in what they have attributed to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم). Since they claim that the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is bewitched in what he utters from Revelation, and what he has brought is mere hallucination, like the hallucination of the bewitched. However, the bewitching that occurred to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not affect him in anything of the Revelation whatsoever, or in anything of the acts of worship. And it is forbidden that we deny his enchantment based upon our misunderstanding of the texts.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Night Journey and the Ascent through the Heavens</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وبعد العشر عرج به إلى السماء ، وفرضت عليه الصلوات الخمس ، وصلى في مكة ثلاث سنين</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">After the ten years, he was taken up through the heavens and the five daily prayers were made obligatory upon him and he prayed in Makkah for three years. </span></strong><sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">61</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">61</span>] : <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying «<strong>After the ten years, he was taken up through the heavens</strong>» He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> remained for ten years upon this &#8211; forbidding <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> and calling to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, laying down this foundation. Then, in the eleventh year, he was taken by night from <em>Masjid al-<u>H</u>araam</em> (the Sacred Mosque) to <em>Masjid al-Aqsaa</em> (the farthest mosque, i.e. the mosque in Jerusalem).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي أَسْرَىٰ بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلًا مِّنَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ إِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ الْأَقْصَى</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Perfect and Exalted is He who took His slave on a journey by night from the Sacred Mosque to the farthest mosque</strong></span>.» [17:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whilst he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> was sleeping in the house of Umm Haani, Jibreel <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> came to him and had with him an animal called <em>al-Buraaq</em>, which was smaller than a mule and larger than a donkey. Its steps were as far apart as the distance which it could see. So, he <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> was caused to ride upon it and he was taken to Jerusalem at night.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(أسرى) is from (السرى) which means: &#8216;to travel by night.&#8217; This was something special to him <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and from the miracles given to him <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em>. So there, he met the prophets in Jerusalem, then he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> was taken up through the Heavens. Meaning: he was raised up from Jerusalem to the heavens in the company of Jibreel &#8211; and the meaning of (العروج) is &#8216;to ascend.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, he was taken on a night journey from Makkah to Jerusalem and he was taken up from Jerusalem to the heavens &#8211; meaning: Jibreel <em>`alaihissalaam</em> took him up and he passed by the inhabitants of the heavens. At each level, Jibreel requested that it should be opened for him until he came to the seventh heaven.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, he ascended over the heavens to the farthest lote tree and there Allaah spoke to him with whatever He wished from His revelation and He made obligatory upon him the five daily prayers. So, He obligated for each day and night fifty prayers. However, Moosaa <em>`alaihissalaam</em> advised our Prophet Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> to ask his Lord for a reduction, for his nation would not be able to bear fifty prayers in each day and night. So, Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> kept going back to his Lord asking for a reduction until they came to be five.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, said, as occurs in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of the <em>Israa.</em> and the <em>Mi`raaj</em>:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">»أمضيت فريضتي ، وخففت عن عبادي ، وأجزي الحسنة عشرا«</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>I have established My obligatory duty and I have made it easy upon My servants, and I will reward a good deed ten times over</strong></span>.»<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the narration of Anas from Aboo <u>Dh</u>arr, He said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">»هي خمس وهي خمسون«</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They are five and they are fifty</strong></span>.»<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: They are five with regards to the action and fifty in the balance (of good deeds).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Five prayers in each day and night are equal to fifty prayers upon the balance, because a good deed is rewarded with ten times its like. So a single prayer takes the place of ten prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Night Journey is mentioned at the beginning of <em>Soorah Sub<u>h</u>aan</em> (the 17<sup>th</sup> <em>soorah</em>) [also known as] <em>Soorah</em> <em>Banee Israa.eel</em>; and the <em>Mi`raaj</em> is mentioned at the beginning of <em>Sooratu-Najm</em>:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَقَدْ رَآهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَىٰ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">عِندَ سِدْرَةِ الْمُنتَهَىٰ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">عِندَهَا جَنَّةُ الْمَأْوَىٰ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَىٰ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">مَا زَاغَ الْبَصَرُ وَمَا طَغَىٰ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">لَقَدْ رَأَىٰ مِنْ آيَاتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And he saw Jibreel on another occasion. By the farthest lote tree. Near it is the Garden of Refuge. When the lote tree was covered by that which covered it! His </strong>(<em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em>) <strong>sight did not deviate to the right or left nor did it go beyond that with which he was commanded. He certainly saw tremendous signs of his Lord</strong>.</span>» [53:13-18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was with regard to the <em>Mi`raaj</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He descended from the heaven to Jerusalem, then he returned to Makkah in the same night. So, in the morning he informed the people about that. The believers increased in <em>eemaan</em>, but as for the disbelievers, then their evil increased and they became happy at this and went about broadcasting it: &#8220;How can your companion claim that he went to Jerusalem and came back in a single night when we have to exert ourselves upon camels to reach it, taking a whole month to go there and a month to come back?!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, they made analogy between the ability of the Creator and the ability of the creation, for the <em>Israa.</em> and the <em>Mi`raaj</em> were a test from Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, for the people. The people of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> increased in mockery and their evil and their belittlement of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> whereas the believers increased in <em>eemaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore when the people of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> said to Aboo Bakr a<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>iddeeq <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu`anhu</em>: &#8220;Look at your companion &#8211; what he is saying!&#8221; He said: &#8220;What is he saying?&#8221; They said: &#8220;He is claiming that he went to Jerusalem (and that he was taken up through the heavens) and that he came back in a single night!&#8221; Aboo Bakr a<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>iddeeq said: &#8220;If he said it, then it is just as he said. He has spoken the truth.&#8221; They said: &#8220;How can that be?&#8221; He said: &#8220;I attest to the truth of what he says with regard to something greater than that. I attest to the truth with regard to the news coming down from the heavens upon him. So, how should I not attest to the truth of what he says with regard to his being taken at night to Jerusalem?&#8221;<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This [night journey and ascension] came about through the ability of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, not through the ability of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>. It was only through the ability of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. This was one of the miracles given to the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and is a case of Allaah showing his honorable status with his Lord, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It must be held as a person&#8217;s creed and belief that he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> was taken on the Night Journey and taken up through the Heavens with his soul and his body together whilst awake and not as a dream;, because some people say: &#8220;He was taken on the Night Journey with his soul, and as for his body, then it did not go outside Makkah. And he was only taken on the Night Journey and taken up through the heavens with his soul.&#8221; This is false and futile speech. Rather he was taken on the Night Journey with his soul and his body <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> and he was carried upon <em>al-Buraaq</em>. And this was in a state of being awake, not asleep, since if it had happened with his soul only or if it had been a dream, then what would have been the difference between it and (other) dreams?.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whereas Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي أَسْرَىٰ بِعَبْدِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Perfect and Exalted is He who took His <em>`abd</em> on a journey by night</strong></span>.» [17:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>`abd</em> is used to apply to the soul and the body together. It is not used for just the soul alone that it be described as <em>`abd</em>, nor is it applied to the body alone that is an <em>`abd</em>. It is not used except to apply to the soul and the body combined, for He did not say: &#8220;Perfect and Exalted is He who took the soul of His <em>`abd</em>.&#8221; Rather He said: «&#8230;<strong>took His <em>`abd</em> on a journey by night</strong>.» The <em>`abd</em> is the combination of the soul and the body. And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, is not rendered incapable by anything and He is the One who has full power over everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) said: «<strong>And the five daily prayers were made obligatory upon him and he prayed in Makkah for three years</strong>» He used to pray them as two <em>rak`ahs</em>. When the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> migrated, the four <em>rak`ah</em> prayers were completed and became four <em>rak`ahs</em> – except for <em>Fajr</em> prayer, for in that he lengthened the recitation so it remained as two <em>rak`ahs</em> just as it was, and except for the <em>ma<u>gh</u>rib</em> prayer, for indeed it is three from the first period when it was made obligatory, because it is the <em>witr</em> (prayer with the odd number of <em>rak`ahs</em>) of the daytime. As for the <em><u>Dh</u>uhr</em>, <em>`Asr</em> and the <em>`Ishaa</em> prayers, then in Makkah they were two <em>rak`ahs</em> each but when the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> made <em>Hijrah</em>, they were made complete as four <em>rak`ahs</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As occurs in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">»أول ما فرضت الصلاة ركعتين فلما هاجر النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم   أتمت صلاة الحضر وبقيت صلاة السفر«</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>The prayer was first made obligatory as two <em>rak`ahs, </em>then when the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> made <em>Hijrah</em>, the prayer for the resident was completed and the prayer of the traveler remained as it was</strong>.»<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is by consensus of the people of knowledge, that the prayer was obligatory in Makkah and that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> prayed it in Makkah. However, they differ about whether it was made obligatory three years before the <em>Hijrah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what is more correct, just as the <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> mentioned here. Or it is otherwise said that it was made obligatory five years before the <em>Hijrah</em>, or it is said one year before the <em>Hijrah</em>, or it is said a year and a half. However the most correct saying is what the <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> mentioned is that it was three years before the <em>Hijrah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And was anything else from the pillars of Islaam made obligatory along with the prayer? This is an area of disagreement amongst the scholars; some of them held that the <em>Zakaat</em> was also made obligatory in Makkah, and that only its applicable limits, its amounts and those eligible to receive it were made clear in al-Madeenah. But as for the origin of its being made obligatory, then that was in Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> وَآتُوا حَقَّهُ يَوْمَ حَصَادِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And give the right due from the crops on the day when it is harvested</strong>.</span>» [6:141]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of the «<strong>due</strong>» here is the <em>Zakaat</em>. And the whole <em>soorah</em> came down in Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise in His statement:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَالَّذِينَ فِي أَمْوَالِهِمْ حَقٌّ مَّعْلُومٌ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">لِّلسَّائِلِ وَالْمَحْرُومِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And those whose wealth has a known portion for the beggar who asks and for the deprived</strong>.</span>» [70:24-25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>soorah</em> also came down in Makkah. And what is meant by the «<strong>known portion</strong>» is the <em>Zakaat</em>. So, it was in origin made obligatory in Makkah, however, its details were made clear in al-Madeenah. This is one saying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second saying: what is apparent from the speech of the <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> here, is that the <em>Zakaat</em> was only made obligatory in al-Madeenah and nothing was made obligatory in Makkah, except for the first pillar which is <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and the second pillar which is the prayer. This is what is apparent from the speech of the <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em>.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[81] <span style="color:#008000;">And He revealed to him what He revealed to him, {And the heart did not lie about what it saw.}</span> (Sooratun-Najm (53) aayah 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[82] <span style="color:#008000;">So may Allaah extol him and grant him peace and security in the Hereafter and in this life.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">We are obligated to have Faith in everything that the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) informed us about and in what has been authentically attributed to him through reports, whether we witnessed it or it was hidden from us. We know that it is a reality and the truth. This is the same with regard to whether we comprehend it or we do not comprehend it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We do not go beyond the outer actuality (i.e. literalness) of its meaning, such as the hadeeth concerning the <strong>Israa and the Mi&#8217;raaj</strong>.[20] It occurred while the Prophet was awake and not in a dream, for indeed the Quraish denied it and considered it something incredible. And they did not used to deny dreams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example of that, is when the <strong>angel of death approached Moosaa</strong> in order to take his soul. He (Moosaa) struck him and gouged his eye, so he returned to his Lord who gave him his eye back.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example of that: are the signs of the Hour, such as the emergence of the <strong>Dajjaal</strong>, the <strong>descent of &#8216;Eesaa</strong> bin Maryam, who will then kill him, the coming out of <strong>Ya&#8217;jooj and Ma&#8217;jooj</strong>, the emergence of the <strong>Beast</strong>, the <strong>rising of the sun from the west</strong>, and all that is related to this from what has been authentically reported. [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <strong>punishment and pleasure of the grave</strong> are true. The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) would seek refuge from it (the punishment) and he commanded that it be done in every prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The trial of the grave is true. The questioning of Munkar and Nakeer is true. The resurrection after death is true, and that will occur when Israafeel blows on the trumpet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And behold from the graves they will come out quickly to their Lord.”</span> [Surah YaaSeen (36): 51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mankind will be gathered on the Day of Judgement, barefoot, naked, uncircumcised, and having nothing with them (i.e. possessions). They will stop at the final place of standing, until our Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) intercedes for them and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, Blessed and Exalted, reckons with them (i.e. judges them). The <strong>Balances</strong> will be set up, the <strong>records</strong> will be distributed and the pages containing the deeds of each individual will be dispersed into the right hands and the left hands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Then as for him who will be given his record in his right hand, he surely, will receive an easy reckoning. And will return back to his family in joy! But whoever is given his record behind his back (or in his left hand), he will invoke (for his) destruction. And he shall enter a blazing Fire and made to taste it’s burning flames.”</span> [Surah Al-Inshiqaaq (84): 7-12]</p>
<p>The <strong>Balance (Al-Meezaan)</strong> has two scales and a tongue, with which it will weigh the deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Then those whose Balances (of good deeds) are heavy, they are the successful. And those whose Balances (of good deeds) are light, they are those who lose their own selves, in Hell will they abide.”</span> [Surah Al-Mu&#8217;minoon (23): 102103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Prophet Muhammad (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) will have the <strong>Fountain (AlHawd)</strong> on the Day of Judgement. Its water is whiter than milk and sweeter than honey. Its drinking vessels are as numerous as the stars in the sky. Whosoever drinks a serving from it, will never thirst again after that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Bridge</strong> is true. The righteous ones will cross it and the evil ones will fall from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) <strong>will intercede</strong> for the members of his ummah who have entered the Hellfire due to their major sins. Thus they will be extracted from it due to his (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) interceding (for them), but only after having been set ablaze and burned to ashes and charcoal. Then they will enter Paradise due to his intercession.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There will also be interceding done by the rest of the prophets, believers and angels. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And they cannot intercede except for him with whom He is pleased. And they stand in awe for fear of Him.”</span> [Surah Al-Anbiyaa (21): 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The intercession of the interceders will be of no avail to the disbelievers. <strong>Paradise and the Hellfire</strong> are two creations that will not cease to exist. Paradise is the abode of the close friends of Allaah, while the Hellfire is the place of punishment for His enemies. The inhabitants of Paradise will abide therein (i.e. Paradise) forever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Verily, the sinful evildoers will be in the torment of Hell to abide therein forever. (Their torment) will not be lightened for them, and they will be plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows.”</span> [Surah Az-Zukhruf (43): 74-75]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Death</strong> will be brought in the form of a sturdy ram and slaughtered between Paradise and Hellfire. Then it will be said: <span style="color:#008000;">“O inhabitants of Paradise! Eternity for you and no (more) death! And O inhabitants of Hellfire! Eternity for you and no (more) death!”</span> [22]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslim believes that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah and the last Prophet. Allaah (Azza wa Jal) says: <span style="color:#008000;">Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allaah and the last of the Prophets</span>. [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Ahzaab, 33:40].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah entrusted Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) with the final and complete message of Islam, calling mankind to worship none but Allaah. He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the best of the Messengers and the best of mankind. He, has no share at all of Ruboobiyyah (lordship) nor any share of Divinity. Contemplate the saying of Allaah regarding Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Say, O Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم), it is not within my power to bring benefit nor to keep away harm except as Allaah wills; and if I knew what the future holds I could amass a great deal of wealth and harm would not befall me. But I am just a Messenger from Allaah sent by Him to warn those who disobey Him of His punishment, and to give glad tidings of His reward fro those who truly believe in Him and are obedient to Him.</span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-A’raaf, 7:188].</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">I am just a human like yourselves, I forget just as you forget. So, if I forget, then remind me.</span>” [28]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The belief that Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the Messenger of Allaah necessitates that</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1-He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the true Messenger of Allaah; he did not lie nor was he belied.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2-The Muslim should follow his teachings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3-The Muslim believes in all of the reports which he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) related regarding the past, present and future and that these reports were revealed to him by Allaah (Azza wa Jal) and was not something which he knew on his own.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4-We comply with his commands</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5-We stay away from what he forbade</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6-We defend the Sharee’ah with which he was entrusted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7-We comply with all that the he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) brought from the Sharee’ah as if it were from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>In the sight of the mystic Soofis,</strong></span> the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is looked upon in ways that oppose the path which Allaah (Azza wa Jal) intended for the believers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This could be summarized in the following points:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1-Many Soofis stress the concept of what they call <strong>Al- Haqeeqah Al-Muhammadiyyah</strong> or the <strong>“Perfect Man” (Al- Insaan Al-Kaamil)</strong>. In the world of Soofism, Al-Insaan Al-Kaamil is the “barrier” qualified with both the Essence of Allaah and the essence of creation. And he is the one who comprises all the worlds of the Divine and that of creation, the complete and the partial. He deserves the Names of the Thaat (Allaah’s Essence) and the Divine Qualities. The Soofee mystics refer to Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) as being the “Perfect Man” or the “Al- Haqeeqah Al-Muhammadiyyah”: The Thaat (Essence of Allaah) in its first designation; to him (Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) belongs all of the Most Beautiful Names [of Allaah] and that he is Al-Ism Al-A’tham (Allaah’s Greatest Name). From Muhammad, the entire creation, this world and the Hereafter, was brought to exist!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is most fully described by ‘Abdul al-Karim Al-Jeeli (d.820Hj/1417 C.E.), a Soofee of the school of Ibn ‘Arabi, in his book Al-Insaan Al-Kaamil. [29] In this book he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Know, may Allaah guard and protect you, that Al-Insaan Al-Kaamil (the Perfect Man) is the Qutub (the axis) around which the spheres of existence from beginning to end revolves. And he is one since the being of existence and forever and ever. Furthermore, he takes on various forms and appears in churches&#8230;his original name which belongs to him is Muhammad&#8230;I met him while he was in the image of my sheikh Sharaf-ud-Deen Ismaa’eel Al- Jhubratee&#8230;the secret behind this matter is him being able to take the form of every image&#8230;” [30]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the same creed of Ibn ‘Arabi and the advocates of <strong>Wahdat Al-Wujud</strong>, those who claim that Allaah is the essence of all that exits. They consider the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) as the first created being and from him originated rest of creation and that he himself is the God who is above the Throne. Such concept is similar to the philosophical concept of the “<strong>first cause</strong>” or the “<strong>first active intellect</strong>” from whom the creation emanated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2-Some Soofis hold to the same concept as above but do not say that the essence of Muhammad is above the ‘Arsh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3-Many Soofis claim that <strong>the light of Muhammad</strong> (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the first being, and that he is the most honorable of creation, and for his sake Allaah has created the universe. They do not explicitly say that the creatures originated from him. [31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most Soofis, however, concur that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the <strong>essence of emanation of all knowledge</strong>. Some of them consider that this emanation is eternal, meaning that it is present even before the existence of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم). That is why a large sector of the Soofis believe that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) <strong>knows the Ghayb</strong> and that nothing escapes his knowledge in the heavens and on the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They have also innovated many practices aimed at showing their so-called love of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) including <strong>celebrations of the Prophet’s birthday</strong> and his journey of <strong>Israa’ and Mi’raaj</strong>, his <strong>Hadrah</strong>, [32] and so forth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They even <strong>call upon the Prophet</strong> (صلى الله عليه و سلم) seeking aid and help believing that he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) responds and answers such Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such concepts, beliefs, and practices concerning the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) are corrupt and contradict the Message of the Qur’aan and Sunnah as well as the way of the true believers, the Sahaabah and those who followed them on the path of righteousness, may Allaah be pleased with them all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The third question of Fatwa no. 2442</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 3: <strong>What is the ruling on acting the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet, may Allah be pleased with them) in school theaters?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The Council of Senior Scholars previously reviewed this question and issued a decree as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Allah (Exalted be He) has praised and set clear the high status of the Sahabah. Thus, acting any of them on stage or on the screen is contrary to this Divine praise and is <strong>detrimental to the high status and honor</strong> which Allah has bestowed upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Representing any of them in this way <strong>exposes them to mockery and ridicule</strong>. Actors are usually people who have no room for righteousness, piety, and Islamic morals in their lives. Moreover, those who put on plays are doing so as a means to earn money, and no matter how much they try to avoid it, it will involve some lying and backbiting. Acting the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) may have an <strong>effect on their status in the hearts and minds of the Muslims, or diminish the reverence they have for them, and paves the way for arousing doubts in Muslims about their religion and disputes over the personalities of the Sahabah</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also necessarily implies that one of the actors will play the role of Abu Jahl and other disbelievers, thus he will have to <strong>utter words insulting Bilal, and insulting the Messenger (peace be upon him) and the Message of Islam</strong> that he brought. Undoubtedly, this is a great evil. This act may be targeted to confuse the Muslims about their creed, the Book of Allah and Sunnah of their Prophet (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. If it is claimed that this serves the interest of calling people to Islam and spreading noble Islamic morals and etiquette through showing exact biographies of those Sahabah is simply an assumption and wishful thinking. Whoever knows the real nature and aims of actors will realize that this kind of acting is in sharp contrast to the real nature of the actors, their standards, lives, and behaviors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. It is basically stated in the principles of Shari`ah (Islamic law) that <strong>if a certain matter is definitely or probably harmful, it will be forbidden</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">Acting the Sahabah may serve some interest, but the harm done by this is far greater than any good that might be achieved.</span> Accordingly, to protect those interests and ward off harm, and to preserve the honorable status of the Sahabah of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), we must not allow that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings of Allah be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>[9:22 minutes]</strong><br /><strong>Dr. Saleh as Saleh (rahimahullah)</strong></p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p><strong>Transcript of the audio: (may Allaah reward the sister who transcribed)</strong></p>



<p>Is the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alaihi Wa sallam) alive in his Grave?</p>



<p>The answer to this question is:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Our Prophet Mohammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) is alive in his grave living the life of barzakh (in Arabic) which is the barrier life, between this life of this world and the next one in the hereafter enjoying all the grace of Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) bestowed upon him as a reward. This type of barzakh life is a medium one between this one and hereafter. His sole is not returned to him such that he lives the life of this world and not connected to him anyway which would make him a life like the life in the hereafter. But rather a medium life of barzakh. And from this way for it is known that he died (صلى الله عليه وسلم) as others died before him from the Prophets and others except for Jesus (عليه السلام), where he Jesus will be sent before the end of time then after that he will die the death we know. Qaala Allaahu ta a&#8217;ala [Allaah سبحانه و تعالىsaid] in Soorathul Anbiya 21:34</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>وَمَا جَعَلۡنَا لِبَشَرٍ۬ مِّن قَبۡلِكَ ٱلۡخُلۡدَ‌ۖ أَفَإِيْن مِّتَّ فَهُمُ ٱلۡخَـٰلِدُونَ</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>And We granted not to any human being immortality before you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), then if you die, would they live forever?</strong></p>



<p>and Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) also said the Sooratur-Rahman verse 26 &amp; 27</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>كُلُّ مَنۡ عَلَيۡہَا فَانٍ۬</strong><br /><strong> وَيَبۡقَىٰ وَجۡهُ رَبِّكَ ذُو ٱلۡجَلَـٰلِ وَٱلۡإِكۡرَامِ</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Whatsoever is on it (the earth) will perish. And the Face of your Lord full of Majesty and Honour will remain forever.</strong></p>



<p>And He Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) the one free of all imperfections, the most high said, in soorathul Zumar (39:30)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">إِنَّكَ مَيِّتٌ۬ وَإِنَّہُم مَّيِّتُونَ</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Verily, you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will die and verily, they (too) will die</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">and the like of the verses indicating that Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) told them to die. And because the companions washed him (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and performed the funeral prayer upon him. And they buried. Had he been living the life of this world, they wouldn&#8217;t have done to him what they did like what is done with any deceased. And also because Fatima his daughter, may Allah be pleased with her, sought the inheritance of her father because she believed that he died. But no one of the companions agreed with her inheritance claim and Abu Bakr responded to her that the Prophets are not to be inherited. Rather they have there is no inheritance from them. They are not inherited. And because also companions, may Allaah be pleased with them ,gather to choose a Khaleefa some one to succeed the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and that is done by choosing of AbuBakar ( رضي الله عنه) and has the Prophet(صلى الله عليه وسلم) been alive the life we know all, they wouldn&#8217;t have done that. so, in this therefore there is consensus that he died.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And that the fitan and the problems and the afflictions which increased during the time of Uthmaan, may Allaah be pleased with him, and even before and after him the companions did not go to his grave consulting with him or asking him as to the way out from these problems, afflictions and tribulations. And have he been alive the life of this world, he wouldn&#8217;t have left it while they were in need to be saved from these afflictions.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">so all these evidences stand to prove that this special life of the barzakh is for our prophet the other prophets except Jesus and the others who die and it does not resemble the life of this world nor that of the hereafter and therefore from this we know the wrong committed by many people who go and travel to the grave of the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) seeking him and calling him thinking that he is alive and he responds to their requests as if he was in this life where they use to go him to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) asking him to invoke Allaah for them at the time of the companions.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">May Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) guide us to the true path of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) which he was upon and his companions were upon, the path of the righteous predecessors. May Allaah save us from all afflictions and innovations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">This right is the greatest right of any of the creation. None of the creation have a right greater than the rights of Allah&#8217;s Messenger <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>. Allah &#8211; <em>the Most High</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="quran"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Indeed We have sent you as a witness rind a bringer of good-tidings and a warner, in order that mankind may believe in Allah and His Messenger, and that you may assist and honour the Messenger.&#8221;</span> </span>[<cite>Al-Qur&#8217;an</cite> 48:89]</p>
<div class="floatframe" style="text-align:justify;">
<div class="articleimage"></div>
<div class="articledescription">Therefore it is obligatory to love the Prophet <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> over and above any of mankind &#8211; even above one&#8217;s love for himself, his parents and his children. The Prophet <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> said: <span class="hadith" style="color:#008000;">&#8220;None of you will truly believes until he loves me more then his parents, his children and the whole of mankind.&#8221;</span> [<span id="qtip0" class="toggle">1]</span></div>
</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the rights that are due to the Prophet <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> are: that he should be honoured, loved and respected &#8211; but without any <em>ghulu</em> (exaggeration) or any falling short in the matter. Honouring the Prophet <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>during his lifetime implied honouring his <em>Sunnah</em> (guidance and example) and his noble character and conduct. As for honouring him after his death, then this implies honouring his <em>Sunnah</em> and the <em>Shari&#8217;ah</em> (the Prescribed Laws) that he was sent with. Whosoever reflects upon the lives of the <em>Sahabah</em> (Companions of the Prophet) will come to know how these great and virtuous people established the obligation of honouring the Messenger <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Urwah ibn Mas&#8217;ud said to the Quraysh: <span class="salaf">&#8220;O my people! I have seen kings. I have seen Caeser, Chouoes and Negus. But by Allah! I have never seen a king whose companions respect and honor him in the way that the Companions of Muhammad honour Muhammad <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>. By Allah! When he spits, the spittle would fall into the hands of one of them, who would then rub his face and skin with it; when he orders them with something, they promptly fulfill it; when he performs <em>wudhu&#8217;</em>(ablution), they vie with each other for the remains of the water; and when they speak in his presence, they lower their voices and do not look directly at his face, due to their respect and honour for him.&#8221; [</span><span id="qtip1" class="toggle">2]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is how the Companions <em>radhiallahu &#8216;anhum</em> loved and honoured him, for Allah had endowed and blessed the Prophet<em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> with a generous and noble character and a mild and easy-going nature. Had he been harsh and hard-hearted, people would not have been able to gather around him and be with him as they did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from the rights that are due to the Prophet <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> is to believe in all that he informed as of with regards to the accounts of previous people and nations, to do that which he has commanded and leave that which he has prohibited, and to have <em>&#8216;iman</em> (faith) that his guidance and example is the best and most perfect guidance and example, and that the <em>Shari&#8217;ah</em>(Prescribed Laws) that he was sent with is perfect and complete &#8211; no human laws nor systems are to be given precedence or priority over his <em>Shari&#8217;ah</em>. Allah &#8211; <em>the Most High</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="quran"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;But no by your Lord! They will not truly be Believers, until they make the Prophet a judge in all their disputes, and then find in their souls no resistance against his decision, but rather accept it with the utmost submission.&#8221;</span> </span>[<cite>Al-Qur&#8217;an</cite> 4:65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="quran"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Say: If you do love Allah then follow the Prophet. Allah will then love you and forgive you your sins. Indeed Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most-Merciful.&#8221;</span> </span>[<cite>Al-Qur&#8217;an</cite> 3:31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the rights of the Prophet <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> is to defend his <em>Shari&#8217;ah</em> and his guidance with the strength and capacity at one&#8217;s disposal, and also in proportion to the attack that it is under. Thus, if the enemies are attacking it with false proofs and doubts, then his guidance and <em>Shari&#8217;ah</em> should be defended with sound knowledge which refutes such false arguments and clarifies the doubts. If, however, the attack is made by any other types of weapons, then the defence should be made in a similar manner. It is not possible for any Believer to hear of some attack upon the Prophet&#8217;s <em>Shari&#8217;ah</em> or his noble personality, and then to keep silent about it &#8211; especially when one has the power to counter such on attack.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Meaning of The Shahaadah: Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 13:</strong> You explained the meaning of the Shahaadah: La Ilaaha Illallaah. So, what is the meaning of the Shahaadha: Muhammad Rasoolullaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong> As for the meaning of the testification that Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the Messenger of Allaah [Muhammad Rasoolullaah] then it is the attestation with the <strong>tongue</strong> and the belief with the <strong>heart</strong> that Muhammad bin ‘Abdullaah al- Qurashee al-Haashimee is the Messenger of Allaah to all of the creation, to the Jinn and mankind, as stated by Allaah, The Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Verily! I am Allaah’s Messenger to you all. He is the One to whom the Dominion of the heavens and the earth belongs, none has the right to be worshipped but Him; It is He Who gives life and causes death. So believe in Allaah and His Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write, who believes in Allaah and in His Words [this Qur’aan] and follow him so that you may be guided.</em></span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-A’raaf (7): 158].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, The Most High, also Said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>(Exalted is) Blessed be He Who sent down the Criterion [of right and wrong, i.e. the Qur’aan] to His slave [Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم] that he may be a warner to the ‘Aalameen (mankind and Jinn).</em></span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-Furqaan (25): 1].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Shahaadah necessitates that</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">you <strong>believe</strong> whatever Allaah’s Messenger informed you of;</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">you <strong>comply</strong> with whatever he commands;</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">you <strong>avoid</strong> whatever he forbade and prohibited, and that</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">you do not worship Allaah except with that which he <strong>prescribed</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also necessitates that</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">you do not believe that Allaah’s Messenger has any share nor any right in Ar-Ruboobiyyah or in controlling the affairs of the creation, nor any right to be worshipped at all.<span style="line-height:1.5;">Rather, he صلى الله عليه و سلم is a slave worshipper, not one to be worshipped; and that he is a Messenger who is not to be belied. </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">It is not in his power to bring harm or benefit, neither for himself nor for others, except as Allaah Wills.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is evident in the Saying of Allaah, The Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Say [O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم]: “I do not tell you that with me are the treasures of Allaah, nor that I know of al-Ghayeb (the hidden and unseen); nor I tell you that I am an angel. I but follow what is revealed to me (by inspiration).”</em></span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-An’aam (6): 50].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is a slave of Allaah who acts as he is commanded and follows the orders he is given. And Allaah, The Most High, Says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">[Say O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم]: “It is not in my power to cause (bring) you harm or bring (guide) you to the Right Path.” Say: “None can protect me from Allaah’s Punishment [if I were to disobey Him], nor should I find refuge except in Him.”</span></em> [Qur’aan, soorat al-Jinn (72): 21-22].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, The Most High, also Says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم): “I possess no power of benefit or hurt to myself except as Allaah Will. And if I had the knowledge of the Ghayeb, I shoud have secured for myself an abundance of wealth, and no evil should have touched me. I am but a warner, and a bringer of glad tidings unto people who believe.”</em></span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-A’raaf (7): 188].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this is the meaning of the testimony of Laa Ilaaha Illalaah, Muhammad Rasoolullaah. From this meaning the person knows that nothing from the creation deserves the right to be worshipped, not the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه و سلم nor anyone from the creation who is below him in rank; and that worship an only be for Allaah, alone; and that the right of Allaah’s Messenger upon us is to give him the rank and standing which Allaah, The Most High, gave to him: The slave of Allaah and His Messenger.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Some haters of Islam often say that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) married a &#8220;six-years old child,&#8221; referring to &#8216;Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her. What is the response?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong> &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s covenant of marriage was conducted when she was six years old, but the actual commencement of the marriage took place when she was nine-years of age. She was the only virgin he married. Marrying at such young age was not the exception in Arabia at that time. In fact many were married in the young age period of 9-12 when they were physically mature. Furthermore, had this been something degrading and immoral, the enemies of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) from the Pagans would have loved to use this against the character of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s father (Abu Bakr, may Allah be please with him), the first one to believe the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and support his propagation of Islam. Not to mention this would have been a major block against the spread of Islam amongst the Arabs if the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) would appear as a man of &#8220;uncontrolled sexual drive.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This would have been obvious to resort to, especially when it is known that they accused the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) of many other things like being a magician, a poet, etc. The fact that they did not attempt even to consider this marriage as a tool against the integrity of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) stands as a strong irrefutable evidence that such marriages were of the norm, not the exception. In so many societies, it was even considered that the girl who does not get married before she reaches fifteen years of age as someone being &#8220;late&#8221; on the scale of marriage timing! In fact such marriages were common in Asia, East Europe, Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, it was known that one of the Pagans (Jubair bin Mut&#8217;im bin &#8216;Adiye) was interested to marry &#8216;Aaisha before her engagement to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), but her mother (Umm Romaan, may Allah be please with her), rejected him. This proves that she was physically mature for marriage. Her family sought the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) because of his noble character as her mother asserted when she told her husband (Abu Bakr صلى الله عليه و سلم) of her intent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a great wisdom in her marriage whereby &#8216;Aaisha witnessed the revelation and the rulings of Islam pertaining to the most particular and private matters of women, transmitting that to the men and women of the world. She reported about 2100 narrations from the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) covering rulings, worships, and transactions . She was the greatest woman scholar in Islam and she had many students of knowledge from the companions of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>As to the often-raised question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why did Allah permit the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) more than four wives while limiting the number to four for the rest of the Muslim men (Qur&#8217;aan 4: 3)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This matter is from the particularities that Allah gave him. In contrast, there are certain rulings that are allowed for the general Muslims but not permitted for the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), like taking charity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, many things pertaining to rulings and/or miracles were made particular to Prophets and Messengers before. Of all the Prophets and Messengers, five were distinguished the most (Noah, Abraham. Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad, peace be upon them all), and Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was further distinguished as the leader of all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that there are great and noble wisdoms for such particularizations. We are not commanded, however, to search and find them, especially if such search arises from objection to the decree of Allah or due to certain doubts concerning it. This often comes from deviants and/or enemies of Islam. Nothing of this of course occurs from the believers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The position of the Muslims regarding the wisdoms behind matters of Islam should be as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">If they see any clear wisdom(s) relevant to these matters, then they take by it and thank Allah for that, and if not</span></strong></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">then they ask the people of knowledge, and</span></strong></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">in case there is no apparent wisdom reached at by the people of knowledge, then they say: &#8220;Allah Knows Best,&#8221; and they should not resort to any speculation lest they end up forging lies against Allah.</span></strong></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What about the Prophet&#8217;s (صلى الله عليه و سلم) Marriage to Zaynab (may Allah be pleased with her) after her Divorce from Zayed bin Haarithah (may Allah be pleased with him)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zayed bin Haarithah (radhi Allaahu anhu) was a slave of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) before he freed and adopted him. His name was Zayed bin Muhammad until Allah revealed the command:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Call them (adopted sons) by (the names of) their fathers, that is more just with Allah.</em></span> [Qur&#8217;aan 33: 5].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Afterwards people called him Zayed bin Haarithah. As to Zaynab, she was Zaynab bint Jahsh bin Rabaab Al-Asdiyyah. Her mother was Umaymah bint &#8216;Abdul Mutalib, the aunt of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم). It was the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) who worked for her to get married to Zayed when he was his adopted son. She initially refused and said she was better than him in lineage. It is reported that Allah صلى الله عليه و سلم revealed the following verse concerning this matter:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any option in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, he has indeed strayed in a plain error.</span></em> [Qur&#8217;an 33: 36].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So she accepted and submitted in obedience to the command of Allah and as a fulfillment of the wish of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم). She stayed one year in marriage with Zayed. They encountered some marital problems. So Zayed complained to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), and he, Zayed, hinted that he may divorce her. So the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) told him to hold on to the marriage and be patient despite the fact that he knew by inspiration from Allah that Zayed will divorce her and that she will be his (the Prophet&#8217;s wife). He, however, feared that people might insult him as someone who marries his adopted son&#8217;s wife, something forbidden in the pre-Islamic traditions. Allah (Azza wa Jal) blamed the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) on that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And (remember) when you said to him (Zayed bin Haarithah; the freed slave of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) on whom Allah has bestowed Grace (by guiding him to Islam) and you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم too) have done favour (by manumitting him) &#8220;Keep your wife to yourself, and fear Allah.&#8221; But you did hide in yourself (i.e. what Allah has already made known to you that He will give her to you in marriage) that which Allah will make manifest, you did fear the people (i.e., Muhammad married the divorced wife of his manumitted slave) whereas Allah had a better right that you should fear Him</span></em>. [Qur&#8217;an 33: 37].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, you hid in yourself what Allah informed you already of that which will actually take place (divorce of Zaynab from Zayed) and your marriage of her in accordance with Allah&#8217;s plan and as manifestation of His Wisdom. Moreover, that you feared people&#8217;s sayings and their insults while Allah deserves to be feared most. Thus, you should have declared what was inspired to you from the details related to you, Zayed and Zaynab, without any consideration of people&#8217;s attitudes.<br />
As to the Prophet&#8217;s (صلى الله عليه و سلم) marriage from Zaynab, he conducted the marriage contract on her after she finished her waiting period following her divorce from Zayed. Allah gave her in marriage to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) without a guardian on her behalf or witnesses, for he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the guardian of all believers. Rather he is closer to them than their ownselves, as Allah described him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم is closer to the believers than their ownselves, and his wives are their (believers&#8217;) mothers (as regards respect and marriage).</span></em> [Qur&#8217;aan 33:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Though this marriage, Allah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) nullified adoption as practiced in the pre-Islamic era, and made it lawful for Muslims to marry the wives of adopted sons after divorce or death of the husbands. This is from Allah&#8217;s Mercy and a removal of any unease regarding such relations. Allah clearly stated in the following decree:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">So when Zayed had accomplished his desire from her (i.e. divorced her), We gave her to you in marriage, so that (in future) there may be no difficulty to the believers in respect of (the marriage of) the wives of their adopted sons when the latter have no desire to keep them (i.e. they have divorced them). And Allah&#8217;s Command must be fulfilled.</span> </em>[Qur&#8217;aan 33: 37-40].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As to the story claiming that the Prophet&#8217;s (صلى الله عليه و سلم) heart became attached to Zaynab after he saw her from behind a veil, and he fell in love and desired her, and that when Zayed knew of this he disliked her and decided to divorce her, then this has not been verified in any authentic way. The Prophets are far removed from such base manners and are in high and noble rank in their characters and behaviors. Not to forget that it was the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) himself who wanted her to get married to Zayed in the first place. Had he been attached to her, and in love with her, he would have preferred her for himself, especially when she refused to marry Zayed in the beginning. The reality, therefore, is that it is the pre-decreed plan of Allah and His judgment in order to nullify the habits and traditions of the pre-Islamic days of ignorance, and to have Mercy and Clemency on mankind.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong> بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم </strong></h2>
<p><em>The following are the excerpts from Fatwas of Ibn Baz &#8211; read the full article at <a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;PageID=139&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=14" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.alifta.net</a></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>This was published in the magazine of the Islamic University in Madinah, the fourth edition, the sixth year, Rabi` Al-Thany, 1394 A.H., pp. 175-182.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allah. May peace be upon the Last Prophet, his family, and his Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Muslim related in his Sahih (Book of sound Hadiths) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;If anyone invokes blessings on me once, Allah will bless him ten times&#8221; </strong></span></em>[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Do not make your houses graves and do not make my grave a place of celebration but invoke blessings on me, for your blessings reach me wherever you may be&#8221; </span></strong></em>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (May peace and blessings be upon him) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;May his nose soil with dust in whose presence mention is made of me and he does not supplicate for me&#8221; </strong></span></em>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since invoking peace and blessings on the Prophet (peace be upon him) is permissible in Salah during Tashahhud (a recitation in the sitting position in the second/last unit of Prayer) and permissible in Khutbah (sermon), invocations, seeking forgiveness, after Adhan (Call to Prayer), upon entering, and leaving the Masjid (mosque), when uttering his name and in other positions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is confirmed to write the form of invoking peace and blessings when writing His name in a book, a message, or an article, because of the proofs mentioned above. It is permissible to write the full form in order to apply what Allah has commanded and the reader would remember it when passing by it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">You should not reduce it to the acronym e.g. <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>(P)</strong></span> that stands for peace or <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">(PBUH)</span></strong> that stands for (peace be upon him) or the like abbreviations that may be used by some writers.Such an act is against the ordinance of Allah (May He be Praised and Glorified) which are mentioned in His Book by His saying: <em><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Send your Salât on (ask Allâh to bless) him (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and (you should) greet (salute) him with the Islâmic way of greeting (salutation i.e. As-Salâmu ‘Alaikum)</span></strong></em>.[Surah Al­Ahzab, 33: 56] It does not have the same privilege of writing (peace be upon him) in full form. The reader may not watch out or may not understand the meaning, bearing in mind that referring to it is disapproved by the religious scholars who even warned against it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Al-Salah said in his book: &#8220;`Ulum al-Hadith&#8221; i.e. The sciences of Hadith, known as &#8220;Muqadimat Ibn Al-Salah&#8221; in the twenty fifth type of his book: (Al-Hadith wa Kayfiyat Dabt-ul-kitab wa Taqyiduh). He said that which means:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ninth: A person must keep writing the form of sending Salat and taslim i.e. &#8220;peace and blessing be upon the Messenger of Allah&#8221; in full form upon mentioning him. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>A person must not be weary of repeating it, because it is one of the greatest benefits which the Hadith students and writers may overlook</strong></span>. Whoever disregards this, he will be deprived of a great reward. We have seen good visions for the people who write the form in full, because it is a form that a person writes as a Du`a&#8217; (supplication), not a part of the narration to make it dependent on the source of narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Similarly, the same is true with regard to praising Allah (Glorified be He) upon mentioning His Name such as (Glorified and Exalted be He), (Blessed and Exalted be He), and the like&#8230;</strong></span> (Until he says): then a person should avoid two shortcomings:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">First: Writing it in incomplete form by two letters or the like.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Second: Writing it in short form by meaning such as (wa sallam i.e. blessings).</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated from Hamzah Al-Kinany (may Allah be merciful to him) that he used to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I used to record the Hadith and I used to write down upon mentioning the name of the Prophet (salla-Allah-u-`alaihi i.e. May Allah&#8217;s peace be upon him) without writing (wa sallam). Thereupon, I saw the Prophet (peace be upon him) in a vision saying to me: Why do you not complete the form of invoking peace and blessingson me? He continued: Ever since, I did not write it in short form like this (salla-Allah-u-`alaihi) but in this form (salla-Allah-u-`alaihi-wa-sallam i.e. May Allah&#8217;s peace and blessings be upon him). Ibn Al-Salah added: I said: it is also reprehensible to write (`alaihi-s-salam i.e. peace upon him) and Allah knows best.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of quote.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His authority, the encyclopedic scholar Al-Sakhawy (May Allah be merciful with him) said in his book (Fath-ul-Mughith Sharh Alfiyat Al-Hadith by Al-`Iraqy) :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O writer, avoid (referring to it) i.e. peace and blessings upon the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) by writing only two letters or the like as done by Al-Kattany and the ignorant of the non-Arabs and ignorant students. They write instead of (May Allah&#8217;s peace and blessings be upon him), <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">(p) </span></strong>or <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">(pb) </span></strong>or <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">(pbuh)</span></strong> and that entails decrease in reward, because it is unlike the proper manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Suyuty (May Allah be merciful with him) said in his book (Tadrib Al-Rawy Fi Sharh Taqrib Al-Nawawy):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reprehensible to write the short form of peace and blessings here and in every position where invoking peace and blessings is required as mentioned in the commentary of Sahih Muslim and others because of Allah&#8217;s saying: <span style="color:#008000;"><em>Send your Salât on (ask Allâh to bless) him (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and (you should) greet (salute) him with the Islâmic way of greeting (salutation i.e. As-Salâmu ‘Alaikum)</em></span>.[Surah Al­Ahzab, 33: 56] Until he says: It is reprehensible to refer to it with one or two letters as those people who write (pbuh), he must write it in full form.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of quote, adapted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My advice for every Muslim; reader or writer, is to <strong><span style="color:#000000;">seek for the best reward</span></strong> and stay away from what <strong><span style="color:#000000;">may invalidate or reduce it</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah to grant us success to that which pleases Him, for He is the Most Generous. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 62:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">As regard those who bequeath that the Faatihah be recited on behalf of the Prophet’s soul, or on his behalf by the Prophet’s grave?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer by Shaykh Uthaymeen (rahimahullaah):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not binding to execute this bequest, because it is a bequest of an unprescribed matter. For the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) does not prescribe for anyone to worship Allaah and then dedicate the reward of worship to the Messenger (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam). Since, had this been prescribed, then the companions, may Allaah be pleased with them, would have been the most preceding people in attaining it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also because the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is in no need for this. For indeed there is no person who does a righteous deed except that the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) would have a similar reward. Because he (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is the one who has directed to this, and, [as the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said]: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">“The one who guides to what is good is like the one who does it.”</span></strong> [92] So, this bequest is from the <strong>foolish</strong> and <strong>futile</strong> actions as well as a <strong>bid’ah</strong>, something which has not been reported from the righteous predecessors, may Allaah be pleased with them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And similarly if he said: “Recite the Faatihah on my behalf by the Prophet’s grave,” then it is not binding to fulfill this bequest. The reason for this is that <strong>specifying a particular place for a particular worship not prescribed by the sharia, is from the bida’</strong> as it is known in the aforementioned discussion pertaining to the issue of “Pursuance of the Messenger (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam).” [93] And that the following of the Messenger (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) cannot be achieved until the act of worship agrees with the Sharee’ah in six matters: <strong>cause, type, extent, manner, time, and place</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>References</strong> :</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q : A brother from Dar&#8217;a, Syria asks: What is the correct opinion about the stories narrated from one of the famous leaders of Sufism, Al-Sayyid <strong>Ahmad Al-Rifa&#8217;y</strong> that he visited the Mosque of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in Al-Madinah and supplicated at the Prophet&#8217;s grave. The Messenger (peace be upon him) then stretched his hand out to him and he kissed it?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">This is a widespread belief among the followers of his Tariqah (Sufi order). It is a belief they hold firmly, even though he lived in the 6th century A.H. How true is this story?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph">A : This is false and baseless, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) died as decreed by Allah (Glorified be He) who says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Zumar, 39: 30" target="_blank" name="Verilyyou(OMuhammad%D8%B5%D9%84%D9%89%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Verily you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will die, and verily they (too) will die.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> [Surah Al-Zumar, 39: 30]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph">According to a Sahih Hadith, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph"><span id="ContentParagraph"><span style="color:#008000;">Allah has angels roaming around the land; if they find anyone greeting me, they carry back these greetings to me.</span></span><span style="color:#008000;">There is no one who sends greetings upon me but Allah will restore my soul to me so that I may return his greeting.</span></span><span id="ContentParagraph">[1]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (peace be upon him) said: <a name="Themostexcellentofyourdays"></a><span id="ContentParagraph"><span style="color:#008000;">The most excellent of your days is Friday; so invoke more blessings on me on that day, for your blessings will be submitted to me.</span> The people asked: O Messenger of Allah, how can it be that our blessings will be submitted to you while your body is decayed? He replied: <span style="color:#008000;">Allah, the Exalted, has prohibited the earth to consume the bodies of the prophets. </span></span><span id="ContentParagraph">[2]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Hadiths which say similar things but it is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>not narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said that he would shake hands with anybody</strong></span>. This indicates that this story is false. Even if we were to assume that it is true, then it could be that this was a <strong>shaytaan</strong> (devil) who shook hands with him in order to deceive him and lead him and others astray.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What all Muslims have to do is to fear Allah and adhere to His Shari`ah, which is indicated in His Noble Book and in the Sunnah of His trustworthy Messenger, and beware of anything that goes against that. May Allah reform the Muslims and grant them understanding of His religion and cause them to adhere to His Shari`ah, for He is the Most Generous, Most Kind.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">Compiled &amp; Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 – Imam Shaafi’ee (d.199 A.H.) <i>-Rahimullaah-</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The first of manners which should be followed is that which the Messenger of Allaah  <i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> did.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘al-Adab’ by al-Bayhaqi (300) / ‘Tawjee al-Muqtasid’ p.5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 – Abul Abbas bin ‘Atta said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever adheres to the manners of the Sunnah then Allaah enlightens his heart with the light of knowing his <i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> Sunnah.  There is no station/status more noble than following the beloved <i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> in his commands, actions, his manners and in following his manners in statements and actions and intentions.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: Zuhud al-Kabeer by al-Bayhaqi (287) / ‘Tawjee al-Muqtasid’ p.5-6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) <i>-Rahimullaah- </i>said:<i></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Know that it is obligatory upon every mature, intelligent person from mankind and the Jinn to testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah sent him with the guidance and the religion of the truth to make it uppermost above all religions, and Allaah is sufficient as a witness. Allaah sent him to all of creation, mankind and Jinn, the Arabs and the non-Arabs, the Persians and the Indians, the Barbars and the Romans, and all the different types of non-Arabs, black and white.  What is meant by non-Arabs is those who do not have the Arab language, amongst all their different languages.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Muhammad <i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> was sent for every single person from the humans and the Jinn, whether they are from those who follow a revealed Book or not. He was sent for every single person in relation to his Deen, from the inward matters and outward ones, regarding his beliefs, realities, methods and his legislations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there is no ‘Aqeeda/belief except the Messenger’s <i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i>‘Aqeeda, and there is no reality except his reality, and there is no method except his method, and there is no legislation/Sharia’ except his Sharia’/legislation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No one from the creation can reach to Allaah, and to His pleasure, and His Paradise, and to His Generosity, and His Guardianship except by following the Messenger <i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> inwardly and outwardly, and in sayings and actions inwardly and outwardly, in statements of the heart and its beliefs, and the conditions of the heart and its realities, and the statements of the tongue and the actions of the limbs.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Majmoo’ Fatawa’ 10/430-431]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 – Imam Abu Muthaffar Samaani (d.489 A.H.) <i>-Rahimullaah-</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed we have been ordered with following and have been recommended to it, and prohibited from innovating and rebuked for it.  The sign of the Ahl-ul-Sunnah is that they follow the Salaf as-Salih, and that they leave everything that is innovated and a novelty.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘al-Inteesar li Ahl-ul-hadeeth’ p.69]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 – Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) <i>-Rahimullaah- </i>said:<i></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for the beliefs (al-‘Iteeqad) then it is not taken from me nor from someone more senior than me, rather it is taken from Allaah and His Messenger <i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> and that which the Salaf of the Ummah were gathered upon.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Majmoo’ Fatawa’ 3/161]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 – al-Hasan al-Basari (d.110 A.H.)  said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘A statement is not correct except with action, and a statement and action are not correct except with intention, and a statement and action and intention are not correct except with the Sunnah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Sharh Asool I’teeqad’ 1/57]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7 – Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) <i>-Rahimullaah- </i>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Following the Prophet <i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> is a proof and evidence that the follower loves Allaah –Azza wa Jal – and what indicates to that is the saying of – Jala wa ‘Ulaa – : &lt;&lt;Say (O Muhammad): ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me, Allaah will love you and forgive you of your sins.&gt;&gt; [Aal’Imraan:31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Majmoo’ Fatawa’ 1/334]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8 – Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) <i>-Rahimullaah- </i>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘What is necessary to comprehend is that Allaah Subhanahu said in His Book: &lt;&lt;Say (O Muhammad): ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me, Allaah will love you and forgive you of your sins.&gt;&gt; [Aal’Imraan:31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">A group from the Salaf said: there were a people at the time of the Messenger of Allaah<i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> who claimed that they love Allaah, so Allaah revealed this Ayaah: &lt;&lt;Say (O Muhammad): ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me, Allaah will love you and forgive you of your sins.&gt;&gt; [Aal’Imraan:31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah explained that His love obligates following the Messenger <i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> which in turn obligates the love of Allaah for His slave.  Allaah tested those who claim to love Allaah by this specific love, and indeed this issue has many claimants and those who are dubious in their love for Allaah.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Excerpts from Works by a Numerous People of Knowledge<br />
Translated &amp; Compiled by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Salaf as-Salih Did Not Celebrate It</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said regarding the<em>Mawlid</em> of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Salaf as-Salih did not do this even though they could have done it and there was no prevention in doing so.  If the <em>Mawlid</em> was good or seen as beneficial the Salaf <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhum</em><em>&#8211;</em> would have had more of a right to it than us because they were the greatest in love for the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and in respect for him, compared to us, and were more concerned for goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed loving him completely and respecting him is by following him <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>, obeying him and following his commands, reviving his Sunnah outwardly and inwardly and conveying what he was sent with, striving upon that with the heart, hand and tongue, as this was the way of the foremost to embrace Islaam from the Muhajireen, the Ansar and those who followed them in goodness.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘Iqtida’ as-Siraat al-Mustaqeem’ Vol.2 p.619</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> was asked, as occurs in ‘Fatawa al-Misreeyah’, regarding completing the Qur’aan every year on the night of the <em>Mawlid</em> of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> is that a recommended action or not?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘All Praise belongs to Allaah, the gathering of people for food on the two Eids and the days of stoning in the Hajj is sunnah and is from the distinguishing features of Islaam which the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> established as a Sunnah for the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Helping and feeding the poor in the month of Ramadan is also from the <em>Sunnan</em> of Islaam.  The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever opens a fasting person’s fast then he has the reward similar to the fasting person.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Giving the poor recitors what aids them in reciting the Qur’aan is a good action at all times, and whoever helps them in this shares in the reward.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for taking a season other than the legislated seasons, like some of the nights of the month of Rabi al-Awwal- which it is said is the night of the <em>Mawlid</em>&#8211; or taking some of the nights of Rajab or the 18<sup>th</sup> of Dhul-Hijjah, the 1<sup>st</sup> Jumu’ah of Rajab or the 8<sup>th</sup> of Shawwal which the ignorant people call <em>Eid al-Abrar</em> then all of this is from Bida’ (innovations) which the Salaf neither recommended nor did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘Rasil fee Hukm al-Ihteefal bil-Mawlid an-Nabawi’ Vol.2 p.429</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Is it Obligatory or Recommended?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   The ‘Allaama Shaykh Taj-Uddeen Faakihanee[1] who died in the year (734 A.H.) said in his unique booklet about this subject entitled: ‘al-Mawrid fee Amal al-Mawlid’ and this is its wording and text:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘In The name of Allaah, The Most Kind and Most Merciful</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allaah who guided us to follow the leader of the Messengers and supported us with the guidance to aid the <em>Deen</em>, Who made it easy for us to follow the <em>Athaar</em> of the Salaf as-Saliheen until our hearts filled up with the light of the knowledge of the<em>Sharia’</em> and the definite clear truth and Who purified our hearts from introducing new innovations and innovating in the <em>Deen</em>.  I praise Allaah with what He has favoured us with of the light of certainty and I thank Him for what He has conferred on us holding on to the strong rope of the <em>Deen</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I testify that none is worthy of worship except Allaah – Alone who has no partner- and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger, the leader of the earlier people and of those who came later.  May Allaah send His prayers upon His Messenger, his Family, his Companions and his pure wives, who are the Mothers of the Believers, continuously until the day of Judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Amma Ba’d:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed a question has been repeated from a group of blessed people about a gathering which some of the people organize in the month of Rabi al-Awwal and they call it ‘<em>al-Mawlid</em>’:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Does it have an origin in the <em>Sharia’</em>?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or is it a Bida’ and innovation in the <em>Deen</em>?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They wanted the answer to this to be clear and to clarify it specifically.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I say – and success is with Allaah – :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I do not know of an origin for this <em>Mawlid</em> neither in the Book of Allaah nor in the Sunnah, nor was it narrated that any of the scholars of the <em>Ummah</em> performed it; those scholars who are an example for the <em>Deen</em>, holding on to the <em>Athaar</em> of the predecessors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, <em>Mawlid</em> is a Bida’, it was innovated by magicians; those parasites who followed their desires and became rich by it.  The evidence for this is that if we applied the five types of <em>Sharee’ah</em>rulings to it we would say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is either obligatory (<em>Waajib</em>), recommended (<em>Mandoob</em>), permissible (<em>Mubaah</em>), disliked (<em>Makrooh</em>) or prohibited (<em>Muharam</em>)!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By consensus it is neither obligatory nor recommended; because the reality of a recommended act is: an act which is sanctioned by the<em>Sharia’</em> without any disapproval for the one who leaves it.  The<em>Sharia’</em> did not give permission for the <em>Mawlid</em> and the Companions did not do it, neither the <em>Tabieen</em> nor the religious scholars – as far as I know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is my response to this before Allaah –Ta’ala – if I am asked about it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nor is it correct that it is permissible (<em>Mubaah</em>), because innovating in the <em>Deen</em> is not permissible – and all the Muslims are in agreement regarding this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So nothing remains except that it is disliked (<em>Makrooh</em>) or prohibited (<em>Muharam</em>).’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘al-Hukm al-Haqq fee al-Hihteefal biMawlid sayyid al-Khalq’  p.11</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Differing on the Date of Birth</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   Ustadh Abu Abdullaah Muhammad al-Haffar[2]  – who died in the year (811 A.H.) as stated in the book ‘al-Ma’yeyar al-Ma’arab’ (7/99-101):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Salaf as-Salih – and they are the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and those who followed them – never used to gather on the night of the <em>Mawlid</em> for worship, they would not do anything on that night which they would not do on any other night of the year because the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>is not revered except due to that which the <em>Sharia’</em> regards as reverential.  Revering the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> is from the greatest of ways of drawing closer to Allaah but drawing closer to Allaah – the Magnificent – is only with what He has legislated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The evidence that the Salaf never used to do anything extra on that night – over what they did on any other night – is that they differed in the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It had been said: the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> was born in Ramadan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It had been said: in Rabia’ al-Awwal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They differed regarding the day on which he was born with four different sayings!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if there was worship that occurred due to the birth of the best of creation <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> on the night preceding the day on which he was born – then it would have been well-known and widespread and no difference would have occurred regarding it, but observing extra reverence was not legislated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do you not see that Friday is the best day upon which the sun rose?! And the best thing to do on the best day is to fast.  Despite this, the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> prohibited fasting on Fridays – even though it is an excellent day.  So this indicates that no worship occurs for any time or place except that which is legislated and if it is not legislated, then it is not done, since the last of this <em>Ummah</em>cannot bring guidance better than what the first of this <em>Ummah</em>brought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this door to unlegislated worship were opened then people would come and say: the day the Messenger migrated to Madeenah was the day Allaah honoured Islaam, so there should be a gathering and worship should be performed!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Others will say: the night on which the Messenger was taken on the night journey he received honour that cannot be valued!  Then worship would be innovated on that night…..so, they would not stop at this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And good – all of it – is in following the Salaf as-Salih; whom Allaah chose for Himself, so whatever they did we do and whatever they left we leave.[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if this is understood, then gathering on that night is not required by the <em>Sharia’</em> rather it is commanded to leave it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘al-Hukm al-Haqq fee al-Hihteefal biMawlid sayyid al-Khalq’ p.14</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Following the Salaf</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   ‘Allaama Ibn al-Haaj who died in (737 A.H.) said in the book ‘al-Madkhal’ (2/11-12) – clarifying the ruling of performing al-Mawlid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘….that it is an addition to the <em>Deen</em> and is not from the actions of the Salaf of the past.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Following the Salaf takes precedence – rather it is more obligatory than intending increase to the <em>Deen</em> by opposing that what they were upon – because they were the greatest of the people in following the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and in proclaiming greatness for him and his Sunnah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.</em>  The Salaf have the superiority and excellence of haste to the Sunnah and it is not narrated from anyone of them that the Messenger suggested observing the <em>Mawlid</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We follow the Salaf; so what was permissible for them is what is permissible for us, and it is known that following them should be in following their sources and their pathways to watering holes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘al-Hukm al-Haqq fee al-Hihteefal biMawlid sayyid al-Khalq’  p.16</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   Hafidh Abu Fadl bin Hajr al-Asqalani who died in the year (852 A.H.) said in his <em>Fatawa</em> about celebrating the <em>Mawlid</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The origin of celebrating the <em>Mawlid</em> is a Bida’.  It has not been conveyed from anyone from the Salaf as-Salih of the first three generations.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘Hasan al-maqasid fee Amal al-Mawlid’ by Suyootee. &amp; From: ‘Rasil fee Hukm al-Ihteefal bil-Mawlid an-Nabawi’ Vol.2 p.444</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   As-Sakhawi said in his <em>Fatawa</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Celebrating the noble <em>Mawlid</em> has not been conveyed from anyone of the Salaf as-Salih from the first three excellent generations, rather it was invented after them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘Subal al-Huda wa Rashad Fee Seerat Khair al-Abaad’ by Muhammad bin Yusuf Salih p.439 &amp; From: ‘Rasil fee Hukm al-Ihteefal bil-Mawlid an-Nabawi’ Vol.2 p.444</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Not From the Way of the Arabs</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   As-Sayyid ‘Alee Fikri who died in the year (1372 A.H.) in the sixteenth lecture of the book ‘al-Muhadaraat al-Fikreeyah’ (p.128):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It was not from the ways of the Arabs that they would celebrate the date of birth of anyone from amongst them and it was not the way of the Muslims – in the times that have preceded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is mentioned in the books of history – and in other books – that the practice of celebrating the <em>Mawlid</em> of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> is from the innovated ways.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘al-Hukm al-Haqq fee al-Hihteefal biMawlid sayyid al-Khalq’  p.17</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   The ‘Allaama ash-Shaykh Abdul Lateef bin Abdur Rahman bin Hasan bin Imaam Muhammad bin AbdulWahhab said explaining the <em>Da’wah</em> of Imaam Muhammad bin AbdulWahhab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Muhammad bin AbdulWahhab criticized what the people were doing in that and other countries, from proclaiming the greatness of the <em>Mawlid</em> and the Eid celebrations of <em>Jahileeyah</em> for which there was no revealed authority raising its status and for which there was no<em>Sharia’</em> evidence or proof; because in those celebrations and in their time and place is resemblance of the misguided Christians’ Eid celebrations and it is falsehood and rejected in the <em>Sharia’</em> of the leader of the Messengers.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from ‘Majmoo’ ar-Risail wal-Masail an-Najdeeyah’ Vol.4 p.440 &amp; ‘Durrar as-Saneeyah’ Vol.4 p.409 &amp; From: ‘Rasil fee Hukm al-Ihteefal bil-Mawlid an-Nabawi’ Vol.2 p.438</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The best of generations and the best of the people of knowledge did not </strong>celebrate the<strong> <em>Mawlid</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   Shaykh Zuhair ad-Deen Jafar at-Tazmantee who died in the year (682 A.H.) said clarifying the ruling of Mawlid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This action was not performed by the Salaf as-Salih in the early period, even though they revered the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>greatly, those whose love for him was so great that if you were togather our love for him, it would not reach the amount of love of even one of them for him, not even a fraction of it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this is a principle which is free from a need for elaboration and it is not in need of any form of evidence, since the Salaf were more knowledgeable and more pious, nobler and more guided.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘al-Hukm al-Haqq fee al-Hihteefal biMawlid sayyid al-Khalq’ p.18</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   The Imam Ibn Katheer ad-Damishqi ash-Shaafia’e who died in the year (774A.H.) said in his ‘Tafseer’ (13/12)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Explaining the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And those who disbelieve (strong and wealthy) say of those who believe (weak and poor): ‘Had it been a good thing, they (weak and poor) would not have preceded us thereto!’ &gt;&gt; [al-Ahqaaf: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Which means that they – the unbelievers – said about those who believed in the Qur’aan, ‘that if the Qur’aan was good then they would not have preceded us to it;’ meaning by this Bilaal, ‘Ammar, Suhaib, Khabbab – and their likes, their peers from the weak, the male-slaves and female slaves.  That was only because they believed, with regard to themselves that they had a high rank with Allaah and that He had concern for them!!  But they were mistaken, horrendously mistaken!  They clearly erred!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Thus We have tried some of them with others, that they might say: ‘Is it these (poor believers) that Allaah has favoured from amongst us?’ &gt;&gt; [An’aam: 53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means: they are amazed; ‘How were these people guided and not us?!’  That is why the disbelievers said: &lt;&lt; ‘Had it been a good thing, they (theweak and poor) would not have preceded us thereto!’&gt;&gt; [al-Ahqaaf: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jamaah they say about every action and statement – which is not proven from the Companions – that it is a Bida’, since if it was good they would have preceded us to it, because they did not leave anything of the qualities of good except that they hastened to it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘al-Hukm al-Haqq fee al-Hihteefal biMawlid sayyid al-Khalq’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Principles of Loving according to the <em>Sharia’</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The claim of those who celebrate <em>Mawlid</em> is that they do it due to the love of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>-.  This is a false claim since the evidence for love is to follow and not to go beyond limits in matters just as Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Say: ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me &gt;&gt; [Al-Imraan: 31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah – Subhanahu – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; So stand (ask Allaah to make) firm and straight (on the religion of Islaamic Monotheism) as you are commanded and those who turn in repentance (unto Allaah) with you, and transgress not. Verily, He is All-Seer of what you do.  &gt;&gt; [Hud: 112]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Katheer said in his ‘Tafseer’ (1/358) explaining the first<em>Ayah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This <em>Ayah</em> is a ruling upon everyone who claims the love of Allaah – while he is not upon the way of the Prophet –that he is a liar in his claim unless he follows the legislation of Muhammad and the Prophetic religion in all his sayings and actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As is established in ‘the Saheeh’ on the authority of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> that he said: ‘Whoever does an action which we have not commanded then it will be rejected.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why Allaah said &lt;&lt;Say: ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me&gt;&gt; [Al-Imraan: 31] which means: you achieve more than what you request due to your love for Him, which is Him loving you, which is greater than the former.  Also, as some of the scholars and wise-people said: ‘The issue is not whether you love Him; rather the issue is whether you are loved.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan al-Basri and others from amongst the Salaf have said: ‘A people claimed that they loved Allaah; so Allaah tried them with this<em>Aayah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Say: ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me, Allaah will love you and forgive you of your sins.  And Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.’&gt;&gt;[Al-Imraan: 31]’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Qadi ‘Ayyaad mentioned in ‘Shifaa bi Haqqooq al-Mustafaa’ (2/24): ‘Know that whoever loves something then he follows it and he follows that which it agrees upon otherwise he will not be truthful in his love and will be a mere claimant.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the one who is truthful in his love for the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> is the one who makes those signs outwardly manifest; the first of which is taking the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> as an example, implementing his Sunnah, following his sayings and actions, fulfilling his commands, keeping away from what he prohibited and to follow his character in ease and hardship and in times of strength and weakness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof for this is Allaah’s -Ta’ala – saying: &lt;&lt;Say: ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me, Allaah will love you&gt;&gt; i.e. following what Allaah legislated above his own desires making his desires in agreement with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala- said: &lt;&lt; and they have no jealousy in their hearts for that which they have been given (from the booty of Banî An-Nadîr), and give them (the emigrants) preference over themselves, even though they were in need of that. &gt;&gt; [Hashr : 9]’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘al-Hukm al-Haqq fee al-Hihteefal biMawlid sayyid al-Khalq’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and blessings be upon our final</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Prophet Muhammad, his</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">family, his companions</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and all those who</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">follow his</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Imaam Ibn Katheer mentioned his biography in ‘al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah’ (18/370): ‘Shaykh, al-Imaam, possessor of skills…..distinguished &amp; advanced in the knowledge of Arabic grammar –  &amp; other sciences – …’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Farhoon al-Malikee said in ‘ad-Deebaaj al-Madhab’ (2/80): ‘He was a scholar, respected, had many skills in hadeeth, Fiqh, al-Usool, Arabic, literature….’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Ustadh Muhammad bin Muhammad Makhloof mentioned in his biography in the book ‘Shajaratul noor az-Zakeeyah’ : (1/247) saying: ‘He was the Imaam of Garnaatah (a city in Andalus) he was its Muhaddith, its Mufti… he was a Faqihi, scholar, a righteous exemplary…’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]Here we can say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every good is in the following of the Salaf * and every evil is in the innovations of the Khalaf</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The transliteration of which is: ‘Kullu khairin fee ittiba’ man Salaf * wa Kullu Sharrin fee Ibtida’ man Khallaf’ (T.N.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#666699;">By Shaykh ul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah as-Salafi <em>-Rahimullaah-<br />
</em>From his book  ‘Madarij as-Salikeen’</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah as-Salafi <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘</strong>Allaah’s slave cannot implement &lt;&lt;You (Alone) we worship&gt;&gt; except with two great principles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of which is following the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second is <em>Ikhlaas</em> (sincerity) for the One worshipped.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is then implementing &lt;&lt;You (Alone) we worship&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people are divided into four categories in relation to these two principles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first of which is the people who have <em>Ikhlaas</em> for the One worshipped and for following the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>. They are, in reality, the people of &lt;&lt; You (Alone) we worship&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So all their actions are for Allaah, their sayings are for Allaah, their giving and their prohibiting are for Allaah, their loving is for Allaah and their hating is for Allaah.  Their apparent dealings and hidden dealings are for Allaah’s Face Alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They do not want reward from the people for this or thanks, nor do they desire position with them, nor do they request praise or status in their hearts or escape from their criticisms.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather they hold the people at the same status as those who are in graves. They do not possess any harm or benefit for them, neither life or death, nor the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, action done for the sake of the people, desiring refuge and status among them and hoping for harm and benefit from them, never emanates from the one who knows the people, but rather itemanates from the one who is ignorant of their affairs and one who is ignorant of his Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who knows the people places them according to their status.  So whoever knows Allaah, then he makes his actions and sayings sincerely for Allaah, he obeys Him and prohibits for Him,loves for Him and hates for Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A person does not deal with any thing from the creation, to the exclusion of Allaah, except due to his ignorance of Allaah and his ignorance of the creation.  Otherwise, if he knew Allaah and knew the people, he would prefer his dealing with Allaah to his dealing with the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, all his actions and worship should be in agreement with the command of Allaah and with what Allaah loves and is pleased with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the only actions which Allaah accepts from the one who performs them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this, He tries His worshippers with life and death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Who has created death and life, that He may test you which of you is best in deed. &gt;&gt; [Mulk: 2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He made whatever is on the earth as beautification for it so He could test which of them is the best in action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fudayl bin ‘Aayaad said: ‘A good action is one that is sincere and correct.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘O Abu ‘Alee which one is sincere and correct?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘If the action is sincere but is not correct, then it will not be accepted and if it is correct but not sincere it will not be accepted, until it is sincere and correct.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Khaalis</em> (sincere) is that which is for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Sawaab</em> (correct) is that which is according to the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what is mentioned in the saying of Allaah <em>–Ta’ala-</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord.’  &gt;&gt; [Khaf: 110]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And who can be better in religion than one who submits his face (himself) to Allaah (i.e. follows Allaah’s Religion of Islaamic Monotheism); and he is a good-doer. &gt;&gt; [Nisa: 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah does not accept actions except those that are sincerely for His Face, following His command. Anything other than these are rejected and returned to the one who performs them– even though he is in a great need of their being accepted – them being scattered in all directions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Saheeh, from the hadeeth of ‘Aeysha, on the authority of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>: ‘Every action which we have not commanded then it is rejected.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every action without a precedent does not increase the one performing it except in distance from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Allaah <em>–Ta’ala –</em> is surely worshipped according to His commands and not by opinions and desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second category is the one who neither has <em>Ikhlaas</em> nor does he follow.  His action is then not in accordance with the <em>Sharia’</em> nor is it sincerely for the one worshipped, such as actions which are beautified for the people, those who show off hypocritically by other than what Allaah and His Messenger legislated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These people are the most evil of creation, they are the most hated to Allaah <em>–Azza wa Jal</em>.  They have a greater share in the saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Think not that those who rejoice in what they have done (or brought about), and love to be praised for what they have not done,- think not you that they are rescued from the torment, and for them is a painful torment.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[aal-Imraan:188]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They rejoice in what they have been given of <em>Bida’</em>, misguidance and<em>Shirk</em> and they love being praised for falsely following the Sunnah and <em>Ikhlaas</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many of this type – from those who ascribe themselves to knowledge, poverty and worship – from those who deviated away from the <em>Sirat al-Mustaqeem</em> (straight way).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed they perform <em>Bida’</em> and misguidance, they show off – boasting about their actions, loving to be praised for that which they have not done of <em>Ittiba</em> (following the Messenger), <em>Ikhlaas</em> (sincerity) and<em> Ilm</em> (knowledge). They are the people who have Allaah’s Anger upon them and are the people of misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third category is he who is sincere in his actions, however he is not upon path of following the command, just like the ignorant worshippers and those who ascribe themselves to paths of <em>Zuhud</em>and poverty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everyone who worships Allaah without following Allaah’s command, believing that his act of worship is a form of drawing closer to Allaah, then his condition is like this.  Such as the one who thinks that listening to whistling and the clapping of hands is a form of drawing closer to Allaah or that being in isolation – which necessitates leaving the <em>Jummah</em> prayer and the congregational prayer – is a form of drawing closer to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or the one who thinks that continuous fasting, day and night, is a form of drawing closer to Allaah or fasting the day which all the people refrain from fasting is a form of drawing closer to Allaah or other similar examples.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth category is when his actions follow Allaah’s command, but they are for other than Allaah, such as obedience to those who hypocritically show off or like a man who fights to show off, or fanatically or for bravery or performs <em>Hajj</em> so it can be said that he performs <em>Hajj</em> or reads Qur’aan so it can be said that he recites Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Outwardly, the actions of these people are righteous actions which have been commanded, however they are not righteous and so they will not be accepted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allaah, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him), and perform prayer and give the <em>Zakaat</em>: and that is the right religion &gt;&gt;[al-Bayyinah: 5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So everyone has been ordered not to worship other than Allaah except by what He has commanded, having <em>Ikhlaas</em> for Him in worship and these are the people of</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything) &gt;&gt;’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from ‘Madarij as-Salikeen’ Volume 1, p.104-106</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#666699;">Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">By the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 1095 – From Abu Rashid al-Hubraani who said: Abu Umama al-Bahili took me by the hand and said: the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> took me by my hand and said to me: ‘O Abu Umama! Indeed from the believers are those who soften (with love) their hearts towards me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ahmad]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the meaning of ‘soften their hearts towards me’ is that they are gentle and incline towards me with love and affection and Allaah knows best.  And this cannot be achieved except with <em>Ikhlaas</em> (sincerity) and following the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> more than any other human being, because Allaah Ta’ala singled that out as an evidence to prove that a person really loves Allaah –Azza wa Jal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said: &lt;&lt;Say (O Muhammad): ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me, Allaah will love you and forgive you of your sins.&gt;&gt; [Aal’Imraan:31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it not about time that those who claim to love the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> in their speech and their <em>an-Nasheed</em> (songs), that they return to adhere to the true love which will lead to the love of Allaah Ta’ala, so that they will not be from those whom, the poet said:<br />
تعصي الإله َ وأنتَ تـُظهرُ حـُـبـَّه ُ *** هذا لـَعـَمْرُكَ في القياس ِ بديع ُ<br />
لو كانَ حـُبـُّكَ صادقا ً لأطعتـــَـــه ُ *** إنَّ المـُحـِبَّ لمنْ يُحـِبُّ مـُطيع ُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You disobey your Lord and present your love *** I swear that this action is innovative</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If your love was truthful you would have obeyed Him *** Indeed the one who loves is obedient to the one whom he loves</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">By The Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ Muhammad Nasiruddeen al-Albaani </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following is a summary of what the Shaykh al-Albaani (d. 1420 A.H.) said in the introduction to a book entitled ‘<em>Bidaytus – Sooli Fee Tafdeel Rasool </em><em>-salAllaahu ‘alaihi wassalam</em><em> as-Sharraffa w­­a Karrama</em>’:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed I firmly believe that it is upon every Muslim who is sincere in his Islaam, to familiarize himself abundantly with a good amount of manners, which Allaah has honoured His Prophet with, in addition to the virtues that Allaah placed upon the Prophet in order for him to excel above all the worlds, from the Jinn and all of mankind altogether, rather even above those Angels who are close to Allaah Ta’ala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This familiarization can be attained through the established evidences from the Book and the Sunnah, researching them and having the correct understanding of them, because indeed that is what will, – without any doubt – increase the Muslim in <em>Eemaan</em>, and sincere love for the Prophet  <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Love for the Prophet  <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> which is a primary principle that becomes firm in the heart of the believer is also connected to the love of Allaah<em>Ta’ala</em>, Who out of His Excellence sent us His Messenger, and blessed us – and Allaah Posses all blessings – with the Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>Tabarak</em> <em>wa</em> <em>Ta’ala</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; He it is Who sent among the unlettered ones a Messenger from among themselves, reciting to them His Verses, purifying them, and teaching them the Book and <em>Al-Hikmah</em> (<em>As-Sunnah</em>). And verily, they had been before in manifest error &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is why the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There are three characteristics, whoever has them finds the sweetness of <em>Eemaan</em>: that Allaah and His Messenger are more beloved to him than other than them; that when he loves a person he loves him only for Allaah’s sake and that he hates to return to disbelief after Allaah has saved him from it just as he hates to be thrown into the Hell-Fire.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this love continues to rise in his heart until the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, becomes more beloved to him, more beloved than every respected person he knows.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘None of you truly believes until I am more beloved to him than his son, his father and all mankind.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know O brother Muslim, that it is not possible for anyone to rise to this level of love for Allaah and His Messenger except with the <em>Tawheed</em> of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> in His worship Alone [rather than to any other than Him].  And singling out the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, by following him from amongst Allaah’s slaves, due to the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; He who obeys the Messenger, has indeed obeyed Allaah &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Say: ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me, Allaah will love you&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘No, by Him in Whose Hand is my soul, even if Moosa was alive today he would have no recourse except to follow me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Albaani) say:  so if it is not granted even for the likes of Moosa whom Allaah spoke to, to follow other than the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, then would it be granted for anyone other than Moosa?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is from the unequivocal/absolute proofs of the obligation of singularly following the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.  It is from the necessities of the testimony of ‘Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah.’ And this is why Allaah <em>Tabarak wa Ta’ala</em>stated it in the preceding Ayah, that following the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>alone is a proof of Allaah loving a person. And there is no doubt that whoever is loved by Allaah, then Allaah will be with him in all that he does, as is mentioned in the authentic <em>hadeeth</em> <em>al</em>&#8211;<em>Qudsi</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And My slave does not come closer to Me except with that which is more beloved to Me than what I have made obligatory upon him, My slave continues to come closer to Me with the optional deeds until I love him, if I love him I will be his hearing with which he hears, and the sight with which he sees, and his hand with which he grips and the leg with which he walks, and if he asks Me I will definitely give it, and if he seeks refuge then I will definitely give him sanctuary . . ..  ’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this is the divine concern that Allaah has for his beloved slave, then it is obligatory upon every Muslim to take those means which make him more beloved to Allaah. And this is done by no other way than singularly following the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>&#8211; as opposed to anyone else. Only by doing this alone will one be granted the special concern from ones Master [Allaah] <em>– Tabaarak wa Ta’ala –</em>do you not see that there is no path to knowing that which is obligatory and distinguishing that from optional worship except by following the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>alone?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt, that when a Muslim becomes more knowledgeable about the biography of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, and knows more of his beautiful qualities and his excellence, then his love for the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>&#8211; would be more, and thus his following of him <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>would be more extensive and more comprehensive.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What drove me to research and distribute this blessed booklet was for me to help my Muslim brothers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In reality my only goal in this life, after fulfilling the obligatory rights that Allaah has upon me, is to familiarize the Muslims through educating, lecturing and writing about the authentic <em>Seerah</em> of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, from all its different angles according to my capability. And to encourage them to take the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>as the only example to be followed, just as Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>encouraged them in doing so, in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a good example to follow for him who hopes in (the Meeting with) Allaah and the Last Day and remembers Allaah much. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and therein lies their happiness in the <em>Dunyaa</em> and the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The last piece of work that I worked on was about a year ago (1401 A.H.) when I summarized the book ‘<em>Shammail al-Muhammadeeyah</em>’ by <em>Imam</em> Tirmidhi.  I distinguished between the hadeeth being <em>Saheeh</em> and <em>Da’eef</em> by commenting upon them, this was while I was staying in my new place of migration ‘Amman’ [capital of Jordan], during a time of afflictions that interrupted me, simultaneously I was preoccupied with buying land and building my home.  After staying there for a few months, an event caused disruption resulting in my leaving my home and my family and travelling to the first place I migrated to: ‘Damascus’ where I went back and stayed for two days, and then from there to Lebanon in spite of a lot of turmoil and chaos making it a difficult place to reach.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed I then preceded to complete this book [<em>‘Bidaytus &#8211; Sooli Fee Tafdeel Rasool</em> <em>-salAllaahu ‘alaihi wassalam</em> <em>as-Sharraffa wa Karrama’</em>] despite great problems during this work, and with very upsetting news which caused me much pain, namely the death of my elder brother Muhammad Naajee Abu Ahmad during the season of Hajj, I continued completing this book whilst seeking mercy for my brother, being patient upon this affliction, due to his death. He was the best of my brothers and was the most sincere towards me, and the strongest from amongst them in response to my <em>Dawa</em>’ and he held a great concern for it. He was enthusiastic in calling to the <em>Dawa</em>’ may Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> bestow his abundant mercy upon him.  We were patient, my brothers and his children and his grandchildren and his in-laws with this affliction. May Allaah grant them someone good as he was a good predecessor for them, may Allaah gather us all with him under the banner of the master/leader of the son of Adam, Muhammad <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>&lt;&lt;The Day when there will not benefit [anyone] wealth or children But only one who comes to Allah with a sound heart.&gt;&gt; [26:88-89] and indeed we belong to Allaah and indeed to him is our return.  O Allaah reward me for my affliction and compensate it for me with better than that. O Allaah forgive Abu Ahmad and raise his rank amongst those who were guided to Islaam to the best of creation (the Prophet), and place someone to look after those still alive after him, and forgive us and him O Lord of all the worlds, and make his grave spacious for him, and make light in there for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed I have digressed a lot from what we were dealing with. Everything that happens to humans is protection under the Will of Allaah and His Compassion, so we return to what we were discussing, so I say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you can comprehend that which has preceded in that <strong>Allaah’s Love cannot be attained except by following His Prophet, you should therefore be concerned with following his Sunnah</strong>, and one should spend in that cause, strive with oneself completely. He should not be deceived by that which some of the deceived, misguided people are upon, from amongst the <em>Soofeeyah</em> and frivolous people, those who have taken their religion to be play and amusement, with <em>an</em>&#8211;<em>Nasheed</em> (songs) and tunes. <strong>By which they claim that they please Muhammad </strong><strong><em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em></strong>with that which they call ‘religious <em>an</em>&#8211;<em>Nasheed</em>’ and they play them constantly for their<em>Dhikr</em> (meetings for remembrance of Allaah) and in their gatherings, which they organize on innovated Eids like the <em>Eid</em> of <em>Mawlid</em> (celebrating the Prophet’s birth) etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed they are –and I swear by Allaah– clearly misguided, and are deviated from the truth.  How can they not be in clear misguidance since they have mixed up the <em>Deen</em>with false amusements, and they have blindly copied shameless singers, with their rhythmical musical tunes, <strong>and they adhere to this in their <em>Soofi</em> paths which kill the hearts</strong>, and divert them from the remembrance of Allaah and the recitation of the Qur’aan.  The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘He is not from us who does not recite the Qur’aan in a beautiful way.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is especially because they add singing to musical instruments and clapping thus completing the resemblance between the two different groups. That is then broadcasted by some foreign radio stations, not only the Arab radio stations. Trying to please the people in the name of <em>Dhikr</em> (remembrance of Allaah) or religious <em>an</em>&#8211;<em>Nasheed</em>!  And regretfully some of the religious radio stations have began to follow their footsteps for which Allaah’s aid is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has even reached me that some of the visual broadcasters (Television) have presented some of these <em>Dhikr</em> (remembrances of Allaah) or religious <em>an</em>&#8211;<em>Nasheed</em>, as if it is from Islaam, and that it is from the characteristics of sincerity in which Muslims call to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I will never forget, once a long time ago I visited a centre from some of the Islaamic organizations, and I was shocked to hear the sound of the <em>Adhaan</em> chanted with musical instruments!  So I questioned them regarding it?  It was said:  ‘It is some Muslim youth from some Arab countries who have come as guests to this organization, and one of them lets them hear the <em>Adhaan</em> with a musical chant,’ and now this is what we hear from many of the Islaamic radio stations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was finally brought to the attention of some Muslim youth, concerning that which those <em>an-Nasheed</em> contain of evil and deviancy opposing the Islaamic <em>Sharia’</em>, so they modified it to a different type of <em>an</em>&#8211;<em>Nasheed</em> which talked about enthusiasm, strength and reminders of Islaamic heroism, and they would also adhere to some musical chanting and some of them have even added some musical instruments like the <em>Duff</em>(Arabic drum) etc. to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, I heard it, with my own ears in some music stores, something of the like, so I spoke with them, due to that which is obligatory in the <em>Deen</em> by way of advising them and reminding them that it is not allowed, especially since many of them have begun listening to <em>an</em>&#8211;<em>Nasheed</em> as a habit, and it has busied them from reciting Qur’aan or listening to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this is from the evil of the deviancy of keeping away from the <em>Salaf</em>, indeed I am certain that this was not from their practice, even though they used to sometimes recite poetry in wars and battles. This practice is one thing and taking that and applying to it a musical chant and making it a habit and resembling the practice of the people of evil and mere amusements, then that is something else, and it is not hidden from the people of knowledge and insight.  May Allaah have mercy upon the one who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Every good is in the following of the <em>Salaf</em> * and every evil is in the innovations of the <em>Khalaf</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In summary: Indeed I advise everyone who reads this book, that they do not suffice with the knowledge in it but follow that up with hopeful consequences which is to sincerely follow this great Messenger, which necessitates the love of Allaah, and His Forgiveness for ones sin, &lt;&lt;and this is the great success&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘We ask Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> that He makes us from them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: A summary from the introduction to ‘Bidaytus &#8211; Sooli Fee Tafdeel Rasool &#8211;<em>salAllaahu ‘alaihi wassalam</em> as-Sharraffa wa Karrama’ p.4 -12]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Consequence of the One who Does not Believe in the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;<br />
</em>Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’</span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;">By the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’  </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 157 – From Abu Hurairah from the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘By Him in whose Hand is my soul; there is not a person who hears about me from this<em>Ummah</em>, not a Jew, nor a Christian, then does not believe in me, except that he will be from the people of the Hell-Fire.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ibn Munda in ‘Tawheed’ and Muslim in his Saheeh, likewise Abu ‘Awaanah and Ahmad]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">‘The hadeeth is clear in that whoever hears about the Prophet  <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and what he was sent with, and then it reaches that person in the way that Allaah revealed it to the Messenger  <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>, and does not believe in the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> then his path is to the Hell-Fire.  There is no difference in this between a Jew, or a Christian, or a fire-worshipper, and the atheist.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">My belief is that if many of the non-Muslims were granted the opportunity to become acquainted with the principles, beliefs and worship that Islaam came with, then they would hasten to enter into Islaam in crowds, as it occurred in the beginning of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">If only some of the Islaamic countries would send callers to the western countries, from those who have knowledge of Islaam and know its reality, and that they know what has attached itself to Islaam from superstitions, <em>Bida’</em> (innovations) and lies. So that the one who calls to Islaam will be able to present it in a good manner to those he is calling, and this requires the caller to have knowledge of the Book and the authentic Sunnah, and he knows some of the common foreign languages. This is a matter which is honourable and it is something nearly lost.  So this issue requires keen preparation, so perhaps they will begin this preparation.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from Silsilah Ahadeeth as-Saheehah  by Shaykh al-Albaani (vol 1/157)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 3093 From Sa’eed bin Jubair <em>Mursal</em> that the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">‘There is no-one who hears about me from this <em>Ummah</em>, not a Jew, nor a Christian, then does not believe in me, except that he will be from the people of the Hell-Fire.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Sa’eed bin Jubair said: ‘I began to say: Where is the confirmation of that in the Book of Allaah?!’ Sa’eed continued: ‘It was very rare that I heard a hadeeth from the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> except that I found a confirmation for that in the Qur’aan; until I found this <em>Ayaah</em>: &lt;&lt; وَمَنْ يَكْفُرْ بِهِ مِنَ الْأَحْزَابِ فَالنَّارُ مَوْعِدُهُ &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;but those of the sects (Jews, Christians and all the other non-Muslim nations) that reject it (the Qur’aan), the Fire will be their promised meeting-place &gt;&gt; includes all the different nations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Tabari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">‘It is possible to include this hadeeth to be from what is a clarification and explanation of the saying of Allaah Ta’ala: &lt;&lt; وَمَا كُنَّا مُعَذِّبِينَ حَتَّى نَبْعَثَ رَسُولًا &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning).&gt;&gt; along with the point where the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>said: ‘hears of me’ i.e. that he hears about the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> upon reality as a human, a Messenger, a Prophet.  So whoever hears about the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>upon other than what he <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>was upon, other than what he <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>was upon from guidance, light and excellent manners; due to some of the ignorant Muslims, or the misguided callers from the Christian evangelists and atheists, who present the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>to their people in other than his real way that he was well known for.  So the likes of these people have not heard of the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>, and the<em>Dawa</em> has not reached them, so the warning mentioned in the hadeeth does not include them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">And this is like the saying of the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>: ‘Whoever sees me in his sleep then it is as if he sees me in his wakeful state, since indeed Shaytaan cannot resemble me.’ [Silsilah Saheeh No.1004]  i.e. sees him in this real form and his characteristics which he was upon in his lifetime.  So whoever really claims that he saw an old Shaykh with a white beard, then he has not seen the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>; because this characteristic opposes that which the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>was upon, from that which is known from his characteristics <em>SallAllaahu Ta’ala alayhi wa Alahi wa sallam</em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Compiled by   The Eminent Shaykh, the Muhaddith Rabee’ ibn Haadee al-Madkhalee</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise belongs to Allaah and peace and prayers be upon the Messenger of Allaah and upon his family and his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To Proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a lecture explaining the status of the Messenger of Allaah and his rights upon this <em>Ummah</em>, which is the <em>Ummah</em> of those who have accepted Islaam and of those who are called to Islaam, from the <em>Jinn</em>and mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the noble Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – has a great status, and a very high position which none from the creation can reach, since he is the leader of the sons of Adam on the Day of Judgment.  Adam and whoever came after him is under the Messenger’s flag- sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was given the great intercession which the other great Messengers excused themselves from.  This great intercession that Allaah chose especially for him and preferred it for him above all the worlds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Without doubt, his Lord <em>Azza wa Jaal</em> honored him and favoured him with abundant miracles which Allaah never gave to the other Prophets &#8211; Alayhim as-Sallam- and yet Allaah has given all of them high positions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – said: ” I was preferred over the other Prophets with six things: I was given eloquent speech, victory by frightening the enemy, the war-booty was made permissible for me, the earth was made as a means of purification and a place of worship, I was sent to all of creation and Prophet hood was completed with me.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh Muslim (523)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <em>hadeeth</em> of Jaabbir: ” … and I was given the right of intercession.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukharee (328) and Muslim (521)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said, in clarifying the status of the Messenger of Allaah and explaining his noble characteristics:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Verily, there has come unto you a Messenger from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty, he is anxious over you.  For the believers he is full of pity, kind, and merciful. &gt;&gt; [at-Tauba: 128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Indeed Allaah conferred a great favour on the believers when He sent among them a Messenger from among themselves, reciting unto them His Verses (the Qur’aan), and purifying them, and instructing them in the Book  and <em>Al­-Hikmah</em>, whilst before that they had been in manifest error.&gt;&gt; [Aal-Imraan: 164]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; He it is Who sent among the unlettered ones a Messenger from among themselves, reciting to them His Verses, purifying them, and teaching them the Book and <em>Al-Hikmah</em>.  And verily, they had been before in manifest error&gt;&gt; [Jummah: 2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; O Prophet! Verily, We have sent you as a witness, a bearer of glad tidings and a warner.  As one who invites to Allaah, by His permission, and as a lamp spreading light.  Announce to the believers the glad tidings that they will have from Allaah, a Great Bounty.  And obey not the disbelievers and the hypocrites and harm them not.  And put your trust in Allaah, Sufficient is Allaah as a<em>Wakeel</em> (Trustee, or Disposer of affairs). &gt;&gt; [Ahzaab: 45-48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said, praising the Messenger and mentioning him and his status with Allaah and His blessings upon him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Have We not opened your chest (heart) for you? And removed from you your burden, which weighed down your back? And raised high your fame?&gt;&gt; [ash-Sharh: 1-4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abbas said: ‘Exposed him to the light of Islaam.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sahl said: ‘With the light of Islaam.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan said: ‘He filled him with wisdom and knowledge and He removed from you your burden which weighed down on your back.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam as-Sa’adee -May Allaah have mercy upon him – said: “We will enrich him due to the legislations of the <em>Deen</em> and the <em>Da’wah </em>to Allaah, characterize him with noble manners and made him concerned with the hereafter and the ease of doing good actions, so he was not constrained nor oppressed &lt;&lt; And removed from you your burden, Which weighed down your back? &gt;&gt;  And We removed from you your burden which weighed down heavy on your back is like the saying of Allaah Ta’ala: &lt;&lt; That Allaah may forgive you your sins of the past and the future, and complete His Favour on you, and guide you on the Straight Path &gt;&gt; [al-Fath : 2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And raised high your fame? &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That we have raised your rank and we have made for you good high praise which none from the creation can reach.  So, Allaah is not mentioned except that His Messenger Muhammad &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – is mentioned along with Him, like when entering into Islaam, also in the call to the prayer, the <em>Iqama</em> (the call at the time of standing for the obligatory prayer), in sermons and many other places where Allaah raises the mention of His Messenger Muhammad &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.  His <em>Ummah</em> has love in their hearts for him and a highly regarded place, with splendour which no one other than him can have, which comes second to loving Allaah Ta’ala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, may Allaah reward him, on behalf of his <em>Ummah,</em> the best of what a Prophet can be rewarded with, on behalf of his <em>Ummah</em>.”  See ‘Tafseer as-Sa’adee’ for this <em>Soorah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah swears with the Messenger’s great rank and He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Verily, by your life, in their wild intoxication, they were wandering blindly. &gt;&gt; [al-Hijr: 72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer -May Allaah have mercy upon him – said: ‘Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> swears with the life of His Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, and this is a great honour, a lofty station and befitting glory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar bin Maalik an-Nakree said on the authority of Abu Jooza’ on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas that he said: Allaah did not create anything, nor exempted anyone, more noble to Him than Muhammad &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – and I have never heard that Allaah swears with the life of anyone other than the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says: &lt;&lt;Verily, by your life, in their wild intoxication, they were wandering blindly.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He says ‘by your life, by your life span, by your stay in the world, indeed in their wild intoxication they are blinded, i.e. that they play around.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration on the authority of Ibn Abbas: they are confused.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said, owing to His concern over His Messenger and His protecting him and honouring him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; By the forenoon (after sun-rise); And by the night when it is still (or darkens); Your Lord has neither forsaken you nor hated you.And indeed the Hereafter is better for you than the present (life of this world).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And verily, your Lord will give you (all i.e. good) so that you shall be well-pleased.  Did He not find you an orphan and give you refuge? And He found you unaware and guided you?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He found you poor, and made you rich (self-sufficient with self-contentment, etc.)?  Therefore, treat not the orphan with oppression, repulse not the beggar and proclaim the Grace of your Lord (i.e. the Prophethood and all other Graces).  &gt; &gt; [Soorah Dhuh]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer said: Imaam Ahmad said: Abu Na’eem narrated to us that Sufyaan narrated to us on the authority of al-Aswaad bin Qayees that, I heard Jundub saying: The Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – fell ill, so due to this he did not stand for the prayer for one or two nights.  Then, a woman came and said: O Muhammad, I do not see you except that your shaytaan has left you. [She said this meaning that he was not on guidance] so Allaah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; By the forenoon (after sun-rise); and by the night when it is still (or darkens); Your Lord has neither forsaken you nor hated you&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer said: What was narrated by Bukharee and Muslim and Tirmidhee and Nisaa’ee from the way of al-Aswaad bin Qayees on the authority of Jundub bin Abdullaah al-Bajalee, then al’Alqee narrated with his narration, and also in the narration of Sufyaan bin ‘Uaynah on the authority of al-Aswaad bin Qayees, who heard Jundub say: Jibraeel delayed in coming to the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – so the <em>Mushrikoon</em> said Muhammad’s Lord has forsaken him, then Allaah Ta’ala revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; By the forenoon (after sun-rise); and by the night when it is still (or darkens); Your Lord has neither forsaken you nor hated you. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an oath from Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> where He swears by the forenoon (after sunrise) and of what He made in it of light.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And by the night when it is still (or darkens)&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means it has become peaceful and dark -this was stated by Mujhaid, Qatadah and ad-Dhihaak and by other than them.  This is proof of the capability of the Creator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Your Lord has neither forsaken you &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means: Allaah did not leave the Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And : &lt;&lt; nor hated you. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means: Allaah does not hate the Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And indeed the Hereafter is better for you than the present (life of this world). &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means: ‘the place in the hereafter is better for you than this place.’  This is why the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –was the one who abstained the most from this <em>duniya</em> from amongst the people and he was the one who rejected it the most out of the people, as is well-known [ by necessity ] from his biography.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, when he was given the choice, at the end of his life, between staying in this <em>duniya</em> until its end and then entering into Paradise, or proceeding to Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal,</em> he chose what was with Allaah over this despicable, lowly <em>Duniya</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – said: ‘I have no want of this earth.  Indeed my example and the example of this world, is like a rider who takes a nap under a tree, then he leaves that place and moves on.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And verily, your Lord will give you (all good) so that you shall be well-pleased.  &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means: (i.e. pleased) with what Allaah has prepared for him in the hereafter of the gardens of Paradise and great blessings, seeing his Lord and the lake, the intercession and the rest of what Allaah has honoured him with in the hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, Allaah mentions what He granted him of blessings.  Allaah protected him when he was an orphan and sheltered him until He chose him for His message.  He revealed the Book and the Wisdom to Him and taught him that which he did not know and what Allaah bestowed upon him was great.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qadi ‘Aayaad -may Allaah have mercy upon him &#8211; said in his book ‘ash-Shifaa bi-Taareef Haqooq al-Mustafa’:   ‘This <em>Soorah</em> contains what Allaah honoured the Messenger with, praising him and Allaah exalting him, in six ways:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- Allaah took an oath for him, regarding what Allaah had informed him about, in His Ta’ala saying:&lt;&lt; By the forenoon (after sun-rise); And by the night when it is still (or darkens);  &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means: ‘I swear by the Lord of the forenoon (after sunrise)’, – this is from the greatest degrees of support.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- An illustration of the Messenger’s status with Allaah and Allaah’s favour upon him, where Allaah says: &lt;&lt; Your Lord has neither forsaken you nor hated you. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means: He did not leave you and did not hate you.  It has been said that it means, He did not neglect you after choosing you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- Regarding the saying of Allaah Ta’ala : &lt;&lt; And indeed the Hereafter is better for you than the present (life of this world).  &gt;&gt; Ibn Ishaaq said: What you have in recourse to Allaah is greater than what Allaah has given you, of honour, in this world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sahl said: what has been stored for you, of the intercession, and the place of noble standing (<em>maqaama Mahmooda</em>) is better for you than what you have been given in this world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- Allaah Ta’ala’s saying &lt;&lt; And verily, your Lord will give you (all good) so that you shall be well-pleased.   &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>Ayaah</em> is comprehensive: it contains all the different points of honour, types of happiness and the various blessings in the two worlds and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Ishaaq said: Allaah will make the Messenger pleased with success in the <em>Duniya</em>, and reward in the Hereafter.  It has been said that is the lake in Paradise and the intercession of the Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5- What Allaah has prepared for him from His blessings.  Allaah assigned bounties from Himself and blessings in the rest of the<em>Soorah</em>; from the guidance of Allaah where He guided the Messenger or guiding the people by the Messenger – this difference in meaning is due to the different <em>Tafseer</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger had no wealth and Allaah made him wealthy by what He had given him, or by what Allaah had placed in his heart due to contentment and wealth.  The Messenger was an orphan and his uncle became affectionate to him and sheltered him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been said: Allaah sheltered him – Allaah reminds him with this great favour and what is known, from <em>Tafseer, </em>is that Allaah did not neglect the Messenger when he was young, in a poor state and an orphan before he was well known as a Prophet.  Allaah did not forsake him, nor did He hate him, so what about after Allaah appointed and chose him for Prophet Hood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah commanded His Messenger to manifest His blessings upon him and to be thankful for what He had honoured him with, by announcing it and to commend it by mentioning this blessing, due to the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala </em>&lt;&lt; And proclaim the Grace of your Lord (i.e. the Prophet hood and all other Graces) &gt;&gt; since, indeed, being thankful of blessings is talking about them.  This was specific for the Messenger and general for his <em>Ummah</em>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 2 – The Excellence of the lineage of the Messenger</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Waatheelah bin al-Asqa <em>-radiAllaah anhu &#8211;</em> who said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> say: ‘Certainly Allaah chose a branch from the son of Isma’eel and chose the Quraish from this branch. He chose Bani Hashim from the Quraish, and He chose me from Bani Hashim.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Huraira <em>-radiAllaah anhu &#8211;</em> that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> said: ‘I was sent from the best of all the generations of the children of Adam, generation after generation until I was in the generation in which I was sent.’<br />
Bukharee – Characteristics (3557)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was Abul-Qaasim Muhammad bin Abdullaah bin Abdul Muttalib bin Hashim bin Abd Munaf bin Qoose bin Keelab bin Marra bin Ka’ab bin Luu’ee bin Ghalib bin Fahr bin Malik bin an-Nadhr bin Kananah bin Khuzaimah bin Mudrikah bin Ilyaas bin Madhar bin Nazzar bin Ma’d bin Adnaan. Up to here there is an agreement about its authenticity, as for after Adnaan then there is a difference of opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no difference that Adnaan was from the sons of Isma’eel bin Ibraheem. What is correct is that Isma’eel was the one to be slaughtered, and that it was Ishaaq is incorrect.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 3 – The Messenger’s beautiful physical characteristics</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Ishaq who said I heard al-Bara say: that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – was the handsomest of all the people and had the best appearance. He was neither very tall nor was he short.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Bukharee in ‘The Book of the Excellence of the Prophet and His Companions’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also on the authority of al-Bara who said: The Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – was of a moderate height having broad shoulders, his hair reached his ear-lobes. I saw him in a red cloak and I had never seen anyone more handsome than him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Bukharee in ‘The Book of the Excellence of the Prophet and His Companions’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Ishaq who said that al-Bara was asked: ‘Was the face of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – as bright as a sword?’ He said: ‘No, as bright as the moon.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Bukharee in ‘The Book of the Excellence of the Prophet and His Companions’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of ‘Abdullah bin Ka’b who said: I heard Ka’b bin Malik talking when he stayed behind from the battle of Tabuk, saying: ‘When I greeted the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – his face was glittering with happiness. Whenever Allaah’s Messenger was happy his face used to light up, as though it were a piece of the moon, and we used to know it (his happiness) from his face.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Bukharee in ‘The Book of the Excellence of the Prophet and His Companions’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Anas &#8211; radiAllaah anhu &#8211; who said: I never touched silk or <em>Dibaj</em> (i.e. thick silk) softer than the palm of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – nor did I smell a fragrance or perspiration better than the fragrance or perspiration of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Bukharee in ‘The Book of the Excellence of the Prophet and His Companions’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Juhaifa who said: the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – went to a place called al-Batha’ at noon, performed <em>wudu</em> and prayed two <em>Rakat</em> <em>Zuhr </em>prayer and a two <em>Rakat</em>for the <em>‘Asr</em> prayer. A spear was planted before him and passersby were passing in front of it. (After the prayer), the people got up and held the hands of the Prophet and passed them on their faces. I also took his hand and kept it on my face and noticed that it was colder than ice and its fragrance was nicer than musk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Bukharee in ‘The Book of the Excellence of the Prophet and His Companions’</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 4- His Noble Manners</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <em>Noon</em>. By the Pen and what the (angels) write (in the Records of men). You are not, by the Grace of your Lord, a madman. And verily, for you will be an endless reward. And verily, you are on an exalted standard of character. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Aeysha &#8211;<em>radiAllaah anha</em> &#8211; said: ‘That his manners were that of the Qur’aan.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And by the Mercy of Allaah, you dealt with them gently. And had you been severe and harsh­ hearted, they would have broken away from about you; so pass over (their faults), and ask (Allaah’s) Forgiveness for them; and consult them in the affairs. Then when you have taken a decision, put your trust in Allaah, certainly, Allaah loves those who put their trust (in Him). &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Imran:159]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abdullah bin ‘Amr bin al-Aaas <em>-radiAllaah anhumma &#8211;</em>who said: ‘The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> never used bad language neither did he say or do evil acts. He used to say ‘The best amongst you are those who have the best manners.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of ‘Aeysha <em>-radiAllaah anha &#8211;</em> who said: ‘The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was never given the choice between two matters, except that he would choose the easier of the two, as long as it was not sinful to do so, but if it was sinful to do so, he would be the farthest away from it from amongst the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> never took revenge for his own sake but when what Allaah had prohibited was transgressed,then he would take revenge for Allaah’s Sake.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri <em>-radiAllaah anhu &#8211;</em> who said: ‘that the Prophet was shyer than a virgin in her private living quarters.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Huraira <em>-radiAllaah anhu &#8211;</em> who said: ‘The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> never criticized any food, if he liked it he would eat it otherwise, he would leave it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Anas bin Malik <em>-radiAllaah anhu &#8211;</em> who said: ‘I served the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> for ten years. I swear by Allaah, he never said a harsh word to me nor did he question me as to why I had done such-and-such or why I had not done such-and-such in a particular way.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another wording: ‘I served him on journeys and while resident. I swear by Allaah he never said to me about what I did ‘Why did you do this like this?’ or about something that I had not done, ‘Why did you not do this in this way?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also on the authority of Anas <em>-radiAllaah anhu-</em> who said: ‘The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> was the best of the people in his manners.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Jabir bin Abdullah <em>-radiAllaah anhu &#8211;</em> who said: ‘The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>never said no to anything that he was asked for.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Anas &#8211;<em>radiAllaah anhu</em>&#8211; who said Allaah’s Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was never asked for anything for the sake of Islaam except that he would give it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas mentions that a man came to him and so he gave him some sheep<strong><em>.</em></strong>  The man then went back to his people and said: ‘O people accept Islaam, for Muhammad gives so much charity he has no fear of want.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Ibn Abbas <em>-radiAllaah anhuma-</em> that Allaah’s Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was the most prolific of people in doing good. He was generous to the utmost in the month of Ramadan. Indeed Jibreel <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> would meet him every year during the month of Ramadan up until its end.  Allaah’s Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> would recite the Qur’aan to him and when Jibreel would meet him, Allaah’s Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> would be the most generous in goodness; more so than the blowing wind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The intent of the meaning ‘more so than the blowing wind’ is that he was swift and comprehensive in doing good deeds.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 5 – The Prophet’s <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> Courage</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Anas bin Malik <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> who said that Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was the best of the people, the most generous amongst them and he was the bravest of men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One night the people of Madina felt frightened and they set forth in the direction of a noise when the Messenger of Allaah <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> met them on his way back, as he had gone towards that noise ahead of them.  He was on Abu Talha’s horse, which had no saddle over it, with a sword slung around his neck while he was saying: ‘There was nothing to be afraid of, nothing to be afraid of.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said: ‘We found this horse like a torrent of water (very fast),’ whereas the horse had been slow before that time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">i.e. That this horse was slow but when the Messenger of Allaah<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> rode it, it was the fastest racing horse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abbas ibn AbdulMuttalib, the uncle of the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said: I witnessed the Day of Hunain with the Messenger of Allaah <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>.  Abu Sufyan bin al-Harith bin Abdul-Muttalib and I stuck close to the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> and we did not separate from him. The Messenger of Allaah<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was on a white pony of his which was given to him as a gift by Farwatu bin Nufatha al-Juthaami.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Muslims fought the Kuffar, the Muslims retreated, but the Messenger of Allaah <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> began to gallop on his pony towards them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abbas said: I was holding onto the reins of the Messenger of Allaah’s &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> pony trying to hold it back from speeding up and Abu Sufyan was holding the stirrup of Allaah’sMessenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em><em>.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said: ‘O Abbas, call the people of al-Samura.’ (Those who took the oath of allegiance of Ridwaan on the Day of Hudaybeeyah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abbas mentions he was a man with a loud voice: So I said at the top of my voice: ‘Where are the people of al-Samura.’ (Those who took the oath of allegiance of Ridwaan on the Day of Hudaybeeyah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abbas mentions: I swear by Allaah, they came back when they heard my voice just as the cows return for their calves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: We are here, we are here!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘Fight the kuffar.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the narrator continues:  ………then the Messenger of Allaah<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said: ‘Now the battle has become inflamed.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abbas said: Then the Messenger of Allaah <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> took some stones and threw them in the face of the kuffar and said: ‘They are defeated, I swear by the Lord of Muhammad.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abbas said: ‘I went to watch and the battle took place as I was watching. I swear by Allaah, just as he threw his stones towards them I saw their strength decline and saw them retreat.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Imaam Muslim cites a summary of the hadeeth which mentions: ‘He said: ‘They are defeated, I swear by the Lord of Ka’bah. They are defeated, I swear by the Lord of Ka’bah.’ With theadditional wording: ‘Until Allaah defeated them and it was as if I was watching the Prophet of Allaah <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> chasing them on his pony.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Imaam Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, from al-Bara’s hadeeth of the story of Hunain: The people turned to the Messenger of Allaah <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> and Abu Sufyan bin al-Harith was leading his pony.  So he got down, prayed and supplicated for Allaah’s help by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I am the Prophet, this is the truth *** I am the son of Abd al-Muttalib</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah, send down your help.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bara’ mentioned: I swear by Allaah when the battle grew fierce, we would seek protection by being close to the Messenger due to his bravery and even the bravest among us was would stand near the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Imaam Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim narrates the story of Hunain from the hadeeth of Salama bin al-Akwaa’ within which occurs: ‘So we gathered around the Messenger of Allaah <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>-, he got down from his pony and grabbed a handful of dust from the ground, then he turned towards the faces of the enemy and said: ‘May these faces be disfigured.’ There was no-one from amongst them that Allaah created except that Allaah filled their eyes with dust from that handful of dust.  They turned back in flight.  Allaah the Exalted and Glorious defeated them and the Messenger of Allaah <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>distributed their booty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh Muslim</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 6- The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was the most knowledgeable about Allaah and had the most fear of Allaah</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Anas bin Malik <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> who said: ‘A group of three people came to the houses of the Prophet’s wives asking about the Prophet’s worship.  When they were informed about it, they regarded their own as insignificant and said: ‘Where are we compared to the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>? Indeed Allaah has forgiven him his past and future sins.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of them said: As for me then I will pray all night.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other one said: I will fast continuously and not open my fast<strong><em>.</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The last one said: I will keep away from women and never marry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> came he said: Are you those who said such-and-such. Then I swear by Allaah that indeed I am the most fearful of Allaah from amongst you and the one who has the most <em>Taqwa</em> of Him.  However, I fast and open my fast, I pray and I sleep and I marry women.  So whosoever does not desire my Sunnah is not of me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of ‘Aeysha <em>-RadiAllaah anha-</em> who said: ‘The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> did an action and made a concessionfor it. When this reached some of the people from his Companions it was as though they disliked it and regarded it as insignificant.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When this reached the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> he stood, gave a sermon and said: ‘What is wrong with the people?  It reaches them that I have made a concession in a matter yet they dislike it and regard it as insignificant.<strong><em>  </em></strong>I swear by Allaah, indeed I am the most knowledgeable of them about Allaah and have the most fear of Allaah from amongst them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari narrated it in ‘al-‘I’tisaam’ &amp; Muslim in ‘Fadail’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the narration of Muslim: ‘When that reached the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> he became angry until the anger became apparent on his face.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was narrated by Bukhari in the chapter: ‘That which is dislikedregarding delving too deeply, disagreement and extremism in the<em>Deen</em> and <em>Bida</em>’.’  Then he mentioned the <em>Ayaah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">? ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?   ?  ?  ?  ??    ? ??????: ???</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Do not exceed the limits in your religion, nor say of Allaah anything but the truth. &gt;&gt; [Nisa’:171]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nawawi said: ‘In this hadeeth there is an encouragement to follow the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> a prohibition against delving too deeply into worship and a rebuke of abstaining from the permissible acts, doubting their permissibility.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also shows the allowance of showing anger when there is a violation of the <em>Sharia’</em> even if the one violating it brings an interpretation for it.  It also indicates to the maintenance of good relations by rebuking and showing dislike for an action via general statements and not by specifying the one who did it such that it is said: ‘What is wrong with the people’ or other similar statements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hadeeth also mentions that being close to Allaah is a reason for knowledge increasing.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Shaykh Rabee’) say: the intent here is the clarification that the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> is the most knowledgeable about Allaah and the strongest of them in having fear of Allaah.  In this is a refutation of the ideology of the extreme Soofis who say: ‘Indeed I worship Allaah, neither fearing His Fire nor desiring His Paradise!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are also other texts which refute this falsehood.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 7 – Regarding the Messenger’s <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> reliance upon his Lord <em>–Azza wa Jal</em></h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says :</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And obey not the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and harm them not (till you are ordered). And put your trust in Allaah, and Sufficient is Allaah as a <em>Wakeel</em> (Trustee, or Disposer of affairs)&gt;&gt;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">[ al-Ahzab:48 ]</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was the best of those who adhered to Allaah and the best in reliance upon his Lord, the Lord of all the worlds.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Allaah saved and protected him from the plots of those who opposed him and from his enemies whether it was in the <em>Makkan</em> period or the <em>Madini</em> period, whether it was in the field of giving <em>Dawa’ </em>and conveying the <em>Deen</em> or in the field of battles and Jihad.  He used to have bodyguards in Madina but when Allaah’s statement was revealed : &lt;&lt; Allaah will protect you from the people&gt;&gt; he pardoned his guards from their duty, relying upon Allaah <em>– Azza wa Jal –</em> trusting in the promise of his Lord.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Jaabir bin Abdullaah that he was on the way to a battle along with the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> towards Najd.  The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was on his way back I was with him.   When I reached the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> and his Companions, I found them taking a siesta in a valley with many trees with thorns, the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> stopped there and the people dispersed among the trees with thorns, shading themselves with the trees, the Messenger of Allaah stopped under a tree with a lot of leaves and hung his sword on it.</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;" align="right">Jaabir said: We fell into a deep sleep. All of a sudden the Messenger began calling us so we came to him and found a Bedouin sitting near him.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah said: ‘Indeed this person took my sword out of its scabbard while I was sleeping when I awoke he had taken it out of its scabbard and it was in his hand and he said to me: who will prevent me from killing you? I said: Allaah and here he is sitting.’  The Messenger of Allaah did not punish him.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Agreed upon</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari – in the ‘Book of battles’ &amp; Muslim in the ‘Book of Excellence’.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Part 8 : </strong><strong>The </strong><strong>Prophet’s </strong><strong><em>&#8211;</em></strong><strong><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em></strong> <strong>Compassion for his <em>Ummah</em></strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> said: &lt;&lt; Verily, there has come unto you a Messenger from amongst yourselves (i.e. whom you know well). It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty. He (Muhammad) is anxious over you, for the believers (he is) full of pity, kind, and merciful. But if they turn away, say: ‘Allaah is sufficient for me. <em>Lâ ilâha illa Huwa </em>(none has the right to be worshipped but He), in Him I put my trust and He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne.’&gt;&gt;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Musa al-Ashaari on the authority of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>who said: ‘My example and the example of what I have been sent with is that of a man who came to some people and said, ‘O people! I have seen the army with my own eyes, and I am the clear Warner; so protect yourselves!’ Then a group of his people obeyed him and fled proceeding slowly, so they were saved. Another group of them disbelieved him and stayed at their place until the morning when the army came upon them, and destroyed them and ruined them. So this is the example of the one who obeys me and follows what I have brought (the <em>Qur’aan</em> and the <em>Sunnah</em>), and the example of the one who disobeys me and disbelieves in the truth I have brought.’</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Bukhari and Muslim</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Huraira <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em>who said: that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed my example and the example of my <em>Ummah</em> is like a man who lit a fire, and moths and insects began to fall into it.  So I am holding on to the waist of your waist wrapper while you are rushing into it.’</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">[in another narration: so that is my example and your example while I take hold onto the waist of your waist wrapper from the fire, saying keep away from the fire, keep away from the fire you are overcoming me and rushing into it.’</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Agreed upon by Bukhari &amp; Muslim</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Anas <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em>said:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">‘I never saw any one more merciful with his family members than the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>’</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Muslim ‘Book of Excellence’</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of ‘Aeysha <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anha</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said: that some Bedouins came to the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and said to the people: ‘Do you kiss your children?’</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘Yes.’</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Thereupon the Bedouins said: ‘We swear by Allaah that we do not kiss our children.’</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said: ‘Then what can I do if Allaah has deprived you of mercy?’</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Muslim</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Huraira who reported that al-Aqra’ bin Habis saw the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> kissing Hasan.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘I have ten children, but I have never kissed any one of them.’</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">So the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">‘He who does not show mercy, no mercy will be shown to him.’</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Muslim</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Jareer bin Abdullah who said: ‘That the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">‘He who shows no mercy to the people, Allaah does not show mercy to him.’</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari and Muslim</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">قُل لَّا يَعۡلَمُ مَن فِى ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٲتِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضِ ٱلۡغَيۡبَ إِلَّا ٱللَّهُ‌ۚ وَمَا يَشۡعُرُونَ أَيَّانَ يُبۡعَثُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Say: &#8220;None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghaib (unseen) except Allâh, nor can they perceive when they shall be resurrected.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Naml 27:65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَعِندَهُ ۥ مَفَاتِحُ ٱلۡغَيۡبِ لَا يَعۡلَمُهَآ إِلَّا هُوَ‌ۚ وَيَعۡلَمُ مَا فِى ٱلۡبَرِّ وَٱلۡبَحۡرِ‌ۚ وَمَا تَسۡقُطُ مِن وَرَقَةٍ إِلَّا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;And with Him are the keys of the Ghaib (all that is hidden), none knows them but He. And He knows whatever there is in the land and in the sea; not a leaf falls, but he knows it. There is not a grain in the darkness of the earth nor anything fresh or dry, but is written in a Clear Record.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-An’aam 6:59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Verily, Allâh! With Him (Alone) is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs. No person knows what he will earn tomorrow, and no person knows in what land he will die. Verily, Allâh is All¬Knower, All¬Aware (of things).&#8221;</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 align="Center"><a href="#">Imam Al-Nawawi&#8217;s Riyad-us-Saliheen</a><br />
Chapter 243<br />
The Obligation of Supplicating Allah to Exalt His Mention and its Excellence,<br />
and its Manner</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Allah exalts the mention of His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and His angels supplicate Him to do so. O you who believe! supplicate Allah to exalt his mention and to grant him safety and security</b></span><b>.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1397.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Whoever supplicates Allah to exalt my mention, Allah will exalt his mention ten times.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1398.</b> Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The people who will be nearest to me on the Day of Resurrection will be those who supplicate Allah more often for me</span>.&#8221;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1399.</b> Aus bin Aus (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Among the best of your days is Friday; so supplicate Allah more often for me in it , for your supplications will be displayed to me</span>.&#8221; He was asked: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! How will our blessings be displayed to you when your decayed body will have mixed with the earth?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allah has prohibited the earth from consuming the bodies of the Prophets</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1400.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">May his nose soil with dust in whose presence mention is made of me and he does not supplicate for me</span>.&#8221;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1401.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do not make my grave a place of festivity, and supplicate Allah for me, for your supplication reaches me wherever you are</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1402.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Whenever someone greets  me, Allah returns the soul to my body (in the grave) and I return his greeting</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1403.</b> `Ali (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The miser is the one in whose presence I am mentioned but he does not supplicate for me</span>.&#8221;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1404.</b> Fadalah bin `Ubaid (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) heard some one supplicating after his prayer without praising Allah and without supplicating Allah for the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). With regard to him, the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">This man rushed.</span>&#8221; Then he called him and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">When any one of you have performed Salat (prayer) and wants to supplicate, let him praise Allah first then glorify Him in the beginning and then he should supplicate Allah for me.

He then went in and (later on) came out and then after that offered the sunset and night prayers together and then said: God willing, you would reach by tomorrow the fountain of Tabuk and you should not come to that until it is dawn, and he who amongst you happens to go there should not touch its water until I come. We came to that and two persons (amongst) us reached that fountain ahead of us. It was a thin flow of water like the shoelace. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) asked them whether they had touched the water. They said: Yes. Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) scolded them, and he said to them what he had to say by the will of God. The people then took water of the fountain in their palms until it became somewhat significant and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) washed his hands and his face too in it, and then, took it again in that (fountain) and there gushed forth abundant water from that fountain, until all the people drank to their fill.

Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said. Make an assessment (of the price of its fruit). And Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) also made an assessment and it was ten wasqs. He asked that lady (to calculate the amount) until they would, God willing, come back to her. So we proceeded on until we came to Tabuk and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: The violent storm will overtake you during the night, so none amongst you should stand up and he who has a camel with him should hobble it firmly. A violent storm blew and a person who had stood up was carried away by the storm and thrown between the mountains of Tayy. Then the messenger of the son of al &#8216;Alma&#8217;, the ruler of Aila, came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) with a letter and a gift of a white mule. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) wrote him (the reply) and presented him a cloak. We came back until we halted in the Wadi al-Qura. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) asked that lady about her garden and the price of the fruits in that. She said: Ten wasqs. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: I am going to depart, and he who amongst you wishes may depart with me but he who wants to stay may stay. We resumed the journey until we came to the outskirts of Medina. (It was at this time) that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: This is Taba, this is Uhud, that is a mountain which loves us and we love it, and then said: The best amongst the houses of the Ansar is the house of Bani Najjar. Then the house of Bani Abd al-Ashhal, then the house of Bani Abd al-Harith b. Khazraj, then the house of Bani Sa&#8217;ida, and there is goodness in all the houses of the Ansar. Said b. Ubada came to us and Abu Usaid said to him: Did you not see that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has declared the houses of the Ansar good and he has kept us at the end. Said met Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, you have declared the house of the Ansar as good and have kept us at the end, whereupon he said: Is it not enough for you that you have been counted amongst the good.</p>

There is a good piece of land which receives the rainfall (eagerly) and as a result of it there is grown in it herbage and grass abundantly. Then there is a land hard and barren which retains water and the people derive benefit from it and they drink it and make the animals drink. Then there is another land which is barren. Neither water is retained in it, nor is the grass grown in it. And that is the similitude of the first one who develops the understanding of the religion of Allah and it becomes a source of benefit to him with which Allah sent me. (The second one is that) who acquires the knowledge of religion and imparts it to others.

And that is the similitude of the one who obeyed me, followed with which I had been sent and the similitude of the other is of one who disobeyed and belied me and the Truth with which I have been sent.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Huraira reported Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) never told a lie but only thrice: two times for the sake of Allah (for example, his words):&#8221; I am sick,&#8221; and his words:&#8221; But it was the big one amongst them which has done that&#8221; and because of Sara (his wife). He had come in a land inhabited by haughty and cruel men along with Sara. She was very good-looking amongst the people, so he said to her: If these were to know that you are my wife they would snatch you away from me, so if they ask you tell that you are my sister and in fact you are my sister in Islam, and I do not know of any other Muslim in this land besides I and you. And when they entered that land the tyrants came to see her and said to him (the king): &#8216;there comes to your land a woman, whom you alone deserve to possess, so he (the kings sent someone (towards her) and she was brought and Ibrahim (peace be upon him) stood in preyer, and when she visited him (the tyrant king came) he could help but stretch his hand towards her and his hand was tied up. He said: Supplicate Allah so that He may release my hand and I will do no harm to you. She did that and the man repeated (the same highhandedness) and his hand was again tied up more tightly than on the first occasion and he said to her like that and she again did that (supplicated), but he repeated (the same highhandedness and his hands were tied up more tightly than on the previous occasion). He then again said: Supplicate your Lord so that He may set my hand free; by. @ llah I shall do no harm to you. She did and his hand was freed. Then he called the person who had brought her and said to him: You have brought to me the satan and you have not brought to me a human being, so turn them out from my land, and he gave Hajira as a gift to her. She returned (along with Hajira) and when Ibrahim (peace be upon him) saw her, he said: How have you returned? She said: With full safety (have I returned). Allah held the hand of that debauch and he gave me a maid-servant. Abu Hiaraira said: O sons of the rain of the sky, she is your mother.</p>

I heard Ubayy b. Ka&#8217;b say: Moses (peace be upon him) stood up to give sermon to the people of Isra&#8217;il. He was asked as to who amongst the people has the best knowledge, whereupon he said: I have the best knowledge. Thereupon Allah was annoyed with him that he did not attribute (the best knowledge) to Him. He revealed to him: A servant amongst My servants is at the junction of two rivers who has more knowledge than yours. Moses said: How can I meet him? It was said to him: Carry a fish in the large basket and the place where you find it missing there you will find him. Thereupon Moses proceeded forth along with a young man (Yusha&#8217;). Joshua b. Nan and Moses (peace be upon him) put the fish in the basket and there went along with him the young man (Yusha&#8217;) until they came to a certain rock and Moses and his companion went to sleep and the fish stirred in that basket and fell into the ocean and Allah stopped the current of water like a vault until the way was made for the fish. Moses and his youn. companion were astonished and they walked for the rest of the day and the night and the friend of Moses forgot to inform him of this incident. When it was morning, Moses (peace be upon him) said to the young man: Bring for us the breakfast for we are dead tired because of this journey, and they did not feel exhausted until they had passed that place where they had been commanded (to stay). He said: Don&#8217;t you know that when we reached the Sakhra (rock) I forgot the fisii and noth ng made me forget it but the satan that I. could nit remember it? How strange is it that the fish found a way in the river? Moses said: That was what we had been aiming at. Then both of them retraced their steps until they reached Sakhra; there they saw a man covered with a cloth. Moses greeted him. Khadir said to him: Where is as-Salam in our country.? He said: I am Moses, whereupon he (Khadir) said: You mean the Moses of Bani Isra&#8217;il? He said: Yes. He (Khadir) said: You have a knowledge out of the knowledge of Allah which in fact Allah imparted to you and about that I know nothing and I have knowledge out of Allah&#8217;s knowledge which He imparted to me and about that you do not know. Moses (peace be upon him) said to him: May I follow you so that you may teach me that with which you have been taught righteousness. He said: You will not be able to bear with me; how you will be able to bear that about which you do not know? Moses said: Thou wilt find me patient, nor shalt I disobey you in aught. Khadir said to him: If you were to follow me, then do not ask me about anything until I myself speak to you about it. He said: Yes. So Khadir and Moses set forth on the bank of the river that there came before them a boat. Both of theni talked to them (the owners of the boat) so that they might carry both of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They had recognised Khadir and they carried them free. Khadir thereupon took hold of a plank in the boat and broke it away. Moses said: These people have carried us without any charge and you attempt to break their boat so that the people sailing in the boat may drown. This is (something) grievous that you have done. He said: Did I not say that you would not bear with me? He said: Blame me not for what I forgot and be not hard upon what I did. Then both of them got down from the boat and began to walk along the coastline that they saw a boy who had been playing with other boys. Khadir pulled up his head and killed him. Moses said: Have you killed an innocent person who is in no way guilty of slaying another? You have done something horrible. Thereupon he said: Did I not say to you that you will not be able to bear with me? He (Moses) said: This (act) is more grievous than the first one. He (Moses) further said. If I ask you about anything after this, keep not company with me, then you would no doubt find (a plausible) excuse for this. Then they both walked on until they reached the inhabitants of a village. They asked its inhabitants for food but they refused to entertain them as their guests. They found in it a wall which had been bent on one side and was about to fall. Khadir set it right with his own hand. Moses, said to him: It is the people to whom we came but they showed us no hospitality and they did not serve us food. If you wish you can get wages for it. He (Khadir) said: This is the parting of ways between mt and you. Now I wish to reveal to you the significance of that for which you could not bear with me. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said. May Allah have mercy upon Moses! I wish if Moses could show patience and a (fuller) story of both of them could have been told. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said that the first thing which Moses said was out of forgetfulness. Then there came a sparrow until it perched on the wall of the boat and took water from the ocean. Thereupon, Khadir said: My knowledge and your knowledge in comparison with the knowledge of Allah is even less than the water taken by the sparrow in its beak in comparison to the water of the ocean, and Sa&#8217;id b. jubair used to recite (verses 79 and 80 of Sura Kahf) in this way: There was before them a king who used to seize every boat by force which was in order, the boy was an unbeliever.</p>

<p><em><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="030.5865"></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Book 030, Number 5865:</p>
<p><em><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="030.5865"></a></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="030.5865"></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa, id b. jubair reported that it was said to Ibn &#8216;Abbas that Nauf al-Bikali was of the opinion that Moses who went in search of knowledge was not the Moses of Bani Isra&#8217;il. He said: Sa&#8217;id, did you hear it from him? I said: Yes. Thereupon he said that Nauf had not stated the fact. Ubayy b. Ka&#8217;b narrated to us that he had heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Moses had been delivering sermons to his people. And he made this remark: No person upon the earth has better knowledge than I or nothing better than mine. Thereupon Allah revealed to him: I know one who is better than you (in knowledge) or there is a person on the earth having more knowledge than you. Thereupon he said: My Lord, direct me to him. It was said to him: Keep a salted fish as a provision for journey. The place where that fish would be lost (there you will find that man). So he set forth and a young slave along with him until they came to a place Sakhra. but he did not find any clue. So he proceeded on and left that young man there. The fish began to stir in water and the water assumed the form of an ark over the fish. The young man said: I should meet Allah&#8217;s Apostle (peace be upon him) and inform him, but he was made to forget and when they had gone beyond that place, he (Moses) said to the young man: Bring breakfast. We have been exhausted because of the journey, and he (Moses) was not exhausted until he had crossed that (particular) place (where he had) to meet Khadir, and the youth was reminded and said: Did you not see that as we reached Sakhra I forgot the fish and it is satan alone who has made me forgetful of it&#8217;? It is strange that he has been able to find way in the ocean too. He said: This is what we sought for us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They returned retracing their steps, and he (his companion) pointed to him the location (where) the fish (had been lost). Moses began to search him there. He suddenly saw Khadir wrapped in a cloth and lying on his back. He said to him: As-Salamu-&#8216;Alaikum. He removed the cloth from his face and said: Wa &#8216;Alaikum-us-Salam! Who are you? He said: I am Moses. He said: Who Moses? He said: Moses Of Bani Isra&#8217;il. He said: What brought you here? He said: I have come so that you may teach me what you have been taught of righteousness. He said: You shall have to bear with me, and how can you have patience about a thing of which you have no comprehensive knowledge? You will not have patience when you see me doing a thing I have been ordered to do. He said: If Allah pleases, you will find me patient, nor shall I disobey you in aught. Khadir said: If you follow me, don&#8217;t ask me about anything until I explain it to you. So they went on until they embarked upon a boat. He (Khadir) made a hole in that. Thereupon he (Moses) said: You have done this so that you may drown the persons sitting in the boat. You have done something grievous. Thereupon he said: Did I not tell you that you will not be able to bear with me? Thereupon he (Moses) said: Blame me not for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for what I did. (Khadir gave him another chance.) So they went on until they reached a place where boys were playing. He went to one of them and caught hold&#8217;of one (apparently) at random and killed him. Moses (peace be upon him) felt agitated and said: You have killed an innocent person not guilty of slaying another. You have done something aboininable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: May Allah have mercy upon us and Moses. Had he shown patience he would have seen wonderful things, but fear of blame, with respect to his companion, seized him and he said: If I ask anything after this, keep not company with me. You will then have a valid excuse in my case, and had he (Moses) shown patience he would have seen many wonderful things. He (the narrator) said: Whenever he (the Holy Prophet) made mention of any Prophet, he always said: May there be mercy of Allah upon us and upon my brother so and so. They, however, proceeded on until they came to the inhabitants of a village who were very miserly. They went to the meeting places and asked for hospitality but they refused to show any hospitality to them. They both found in that village a wall which was about to fall. He (Khadir) set it right. Thereupon he (Moses) said: If you so liked. you could get wages for it. Thereupon he said: This is the partince, of ways between me and you, and, taking hold of his cloth, he said: Now I will explain to you the real significance (of all these acts) for which you could not show patience. As for the boat, it belonged to the poor people working on the river and I intended to damage it for there was ahead of them (a king) who seized boats by force. (When he came) to catch hold of it he found it a damaged boat, so he spared it (and later on) it was set right with wood. So far as the boy is concerned, he has been, by very nature, an unbeliever, whereas his parents loved him very much. Had he grown up he would have involved them in wrongdoing and unbelief, so we wished that their Lord should give them in its place one better in purity and close to mercy. And as for the wall it belonged to two orphan boys in the city and there was beneath it a (treasure) belongin to them,&#8230; up to the last verse. This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Abu Ishaq.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Utba b. Mas, ud reported that &#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Abbas contended with Hurr b. Qais b. Hisn al-Fazari aboat the companion of Moses (peace be upon hiin). Ibn &#8216;Abbas said that he was Khadir. There happened to pass Ubayy b. Ka&#8217;b Ansari. Ibn Abbas called him and said: Abu Tufail, come to us. There has been a difference of opinion between me and my friend about the companion of Moses whom he wanted to meet on the way. Did hear anything from Allah&#8217;s meesenger (may peace be upon him) making a mention of anything? Ubayy said: I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may Peace be upon him) as saying: As Moses was amongst the group of Bani Isra&#8217;il, there came to him a person and he said to him: Do you know anyone having better knowledge than you? Moses said: No. Thereupon Allah revealed to Moses: Of course, there is amongst Our servants Khadir (who has better knowledge) than you. Moses asked the way of meeting him. Allah made the fish a sign and it was said to him: Where you miss the fish return to that (place) and you will soon find him. So Moses moved on as Allah wished him to move on. He then said to his young companion: Bring for us the breakfast. Thereupop that young man said to Moses. when he asked him for the breakfast: Don&#8217;t you see that as we had reached the Sakhra I forgot the fish and nobody made it forget (in our mind) but the satan that I should remind you of it? Mosed said to that young man: This was what we wanted. So they retraced their steps and met Khadir and the events which followed have been described in His Book except that Yunus (the narrator) said that he followed the traces of fish in the ocean.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Rabi bin Hirash: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Uqba bin &#8216;Amr said to Hudhaifa, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you relate to  us of what you have heard from Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I heard him saying,  &#8220;When Al-Dajjal appears, he will have fire and water along with him. What the people  will consider as cold water, will be fire that will burn (things). So, if anyone of you  comes across this, he should fall in the thing which will appear to him as fire, for in  reality, it will be fresh cold water.&#8221; Hudhaifa added, &#8220;I also heard him saying,  &#8216;From among the people preceding your generation, there was a man whom the angel of death  visited to capture his soul. (So his soul was captured) and he was asked if he had done  any good deed.&#8217; He replied, &#8216;I don&#8217;t remember any good deed.&#8217; He was asked to think it  over. He said, &#8216;I do not remember, except that I used to trade with the people in the  world and I used to give a respite to the rich and forgive the poor (among my debtors). So  Allah made him enter Paradise.&#8221; Hudhaifa further said, &#8220;I also heard him saying,  &#8216;Once there was a man on his death-bed, who, losing every hope of surviving said to his  family: When I die, gather for me a large heap of wood and make a fire (to burn me). When  the fire eats my meat and reaches my bones, and when the bones burn, take and crush them  into powder and wait for a windy day to throw it (i.e. the powder) over the sea. They did  so, but Allah collected his particles and asked him: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Why did you do so? He replied: For fear of You. So Allah  forgave him.&#8221; &#8216;Uqba bin &#8216;Amr said, &#8220;I heard him saying that the Israeli used to  dig the grave of the dead (to steal their shrouds).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha and Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On his death-bed Allah&#8217;s Apostle put a sheet over his-face  and when he felt hot, he would remove it from his face. When in that state (of putting and  removing the sheet) he said, &#8220;May Allah&#8217;s Curse be on the Jews and the Christians for  they build places of worship at the graves of their prophets.&#8221; (By that) he intended  to warn (the Muslim) from what they (i.e. Jews and Christians) had done. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The Israelis used to be ruled and  guided by prophets: Whenever a prophet died, another would take over his place. There will  be no prophet after me, but there will be Caliphs who will increase in number.&#8221; The  people asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What do you order us (to do)?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Obey the one who will be given the pledge of allegiance first. Fulfil their (i.e.  the Caliphs) rights, for Allah will ask them about (any shortcoming) in ruling those Allah  has put under their guardianship.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 662: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Said: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;You will follow the wrong ways, of  your predecessors so completely and literally that if they should go into the hole of a  mastigure, you too will go there.&#8221; We said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Do you mean the  Jews and the Christians?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Whom else?&#8221; (Meaning, of course, the  Jews and the Christians.) </font></p>
<hr />
<p></a><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.056.663"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 663: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people mentioned the fire and the bell (as means  proposed for announcing the time of prayer) and by such a suggestion they referred to the  Jews and the Christians. But Bilal was ordered, &#8220;Pronounce the words of the Adhan  (i.e. call for the prayer) twice and the Iqama once only.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 664: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That she used to hate that one should keep his hands on his  flanks while praying. She said that the Jew used to do so. </font></p>
<hr />
<p></a><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.056.665"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 665: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Your period (i.e. the Muslims&#8217;  period) in comparison to the periods of the previous nations, is like the period between  the &#8216;Asr prayer and sunset. And your example in comparison to the Jews and the Christians  is like the example of a person who employed some laborers and asked them, &#8216;Who will work  for me till midday for one Qirat each?&#8217; The Jews worked for half a day for one Qirat each.  The person asked, &#8216;Who will do the work for me from midday to the time of the &#8216;Asr  (prayer) for one Qirat each?&#8217; The Christians worked from midday till the &#8216;Asr prayer for  one Qirat. Then the person asked, &#8216;Who will do the work for me from the &#8216;Asr till sunset  for two Qirats each?&#8217; &#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;It is you (i.e. Muslims) who are  doing the work from the Asr till sunset, so you will have a double reward. The Jews and  the Christians got angry and said, &#8216;We have done more work but got less wages.&#8217; Allah  said, &#8216;Have I been unjust to you as regards your rights?&#8217; They said, &#8216;No.&#8217; So Allah said,  &#8216;Then it is My Blessing which I bestow on whomever I like. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 666: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard &#8216;Umar saying, &#8220;May Allah Curse so-and-so!  Doesn&#8217;t he know that the Prophet said, &#8216;May Allah curse the Jews for, though they were  forbidden (to eat) fat, they liquefied it and sold it. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 667: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Convey (my teachings) to the people  even if it were a single sentence, and tell others the stories of Bani Israel (which have  been taught to you), for it is not sinful to do so. And whoever tells a lie on me  intentionally, will surely take his place in the (Hell) Fire.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The Jews and the Christians do  not dye (their grey hair), so you shall do the opposite of what they do (i.e. dye your  grey hair and beards).&#8221; </font></p>
<hr />
<p></a><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.056.669"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 669: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jundub: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Amongst the nations before you  there was a man who got a wound, and growing impatient (with its pain), he took a knife  and cut his hand with it and the blood did not stop till he died. Allah said, &#8216;My Slave  hurried to bring death upon himself so I have forbidden him (to enter) Paradise.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>
<hr />
<p></a><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.056.670"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 670: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that he heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Allah willed to  test three Israelis who were a Leper, a blind man and a bald-headed man. So, he sent them  an angel who came to the leper and said, &#8216;What thing do you like most?&#8217; He replied,  &#8220;Good color and good skin, for the people have a strong aversion to me.&#8217; The angel  touched him and his illness was cured, and he was given a good color and beautiful skin.  The angel asked him, &#8216;What kind of property do you like best?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Camels (or  cows).&#8217; (The narrator is in doubt, for either the leper or the bald-headed man demanded  camels and the other demanded cows.) So he (i.e. the leper) was given a pregnant  she-camei, and the angel said (to him), &#8216;May Allah bless you in it.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The angel then went to the bald-headed man and said, &#8216;What  thing do you like most?&#8217; He said, &#8216;I like good hair and wish to be cured of this disease,  for the people feel repulsion for me.&#8217; The angel touched him and his illness was cured,  and he was given good hair. The angel asked (him), &#8216;What kind of property do you like  bests&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Cows,&#8217; The angel gave him a pregnant cow and said, &#8216;May Allah bless  you in it.&#8217; The angel went to the blind man and asked, &#8216;What thing do you like best?&#8217; He  said, &#8216;(I like) that Allah may restore my eye-sight to me so that I may see the people.&#8217;  The angel touched his eyes and Allah gave him back his eye-sight. The angel asked him,  &#8220;What kind of property do you like best?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Sheep.&#8217; The angel gave him a  pregnant sheep. Afterwards, all the three pregnant animals gave birth to young ones, and  multiplied and brought forth so much that one of the (three) men had a herd of camels  filling a valley, and one had a herd of cows filling a valley, and one had a flock of  sheep filling a valley. Then the angel, disguised in the shape and appearance of a leper,  went to the leper and said, I am a poor man, who has lost all means of livelihood while on  a journey. So none will satisfy my need except Allah and then you. In the Name of Him Who  has given you such nice color and beautiful skin, and so much property, I ask you to give  me a camel so that I may reach my destination. The man replied, &#8216;I have many obligations  (so I cannot give you).&#8217; The angel said, &#8216;I think I know you; were you not a leper to whom  the people had a strong aversion? Weren&#8217;t you a poor man, and then Allah gave you (all  this property).&#8217; He replied, &#8216;(This is all wrong), I got this property through inheritance  from my fore-fathers&#8217; The angel said, &#8216;If you are telling a lie, then let Allah make you  as you were before. &#8216; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then the angel, disguised in the shape and appearance of a  bald man, went to the bald man and said to him the same as he told the first one, and he  too answered the same as the first one did. The angel said, &#8216;If you are telling a lie,  then let Allah make you as you were before.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The angel, disguised in the shape of a blind man, went to  the blind man and said, &#8216;I am a poor man and a traveler, whose means of livelihood have  been exhausted while on a journey. I have nobody to help me except Allah, and after Him,  you yourself. I ask you in the Name of Him Who has given you back your eye-sight to give  me a sheep, so that with its help, I may complete my journey&#8217; The man said, &#8216;No doubt, I  was blind and Allah gave me back my eye-sight; I was poor and Allah made me rich; so take  anything you wish from my property. By Allah, I will not stop you for taking anything (you  need) of my property which you may take for Allah&#8217;s sake.&#8217; The angel replied, &#8216;Keep your  property with you.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 671: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Once three persons (from the  previous nations) were traveling, and suddenly it started raining and they took shelter in  a cave. The entrance of the cave got closed while they were inside. They said to each  other, &#8216;O you! Nothing can save you except the truth, so each of you should ask Allah&#8217;s  Help by referring to such a deed as he thinks he did sincerely (i.e. just for gaining  Allah&#8217;s Pleasure).&#8217; So one of them said, &#8216;O Allah! You know that I had a laborer who  worked for me for one Faraq (i.e. three Sas) of rice, but he departed, leaving it (i.e.  his wages). I sowed that Faraq of rice and with its yield I bought cows (for him). Later  on when he came to me asking for his wages, I said (to him), &#8216;Go to those cows and drive  them away.&#8217; He said to me, &#8216;But you have to pay me only a Faraq of rice,&#8217; I said to him,  &#8216;Go to those cows and take them, for they are the product of that Faraq (of rice).&#8217; So he  drove them. O Allah! If you consider that I did that for fear of You, then please remove  the rock.&#8217; The rock shifted a bit from the mouth of the cave. The second one said, &#8216;O  Allah, You know that I had old parents whom I used to provide with the milk of my sheep  every night. One night I was delayed and when I came, they had slept, while my wife and  children were crying with hunger. I used not to let them (i.e. my family) drink unless my  parents had drunk first. So I disliked to wake them up and also disliked that they should  sleep without drinking it, I kept on waiting (for them to wake) till it dawned. O Allah!  If You consider that I did that for fear of you, then please remove the rock.&#8217; So the rock  shifted and they could see the sky through it. The (third) one said, &#8216;O Allah! You know  that I had a cousin (i.e. my paternal uncle&#8217;s daughter) who was most beloved to me and I  sought to seduce her, but she refused, unless I paid her one-hundred Dinars (i.e. gold  pieces). So I collected the amount and brought it to her, and she allowed me to sleep with  her. But when I sat between her legs, she said, &#8216;Be afraid of Allah, and do not deflower  me but legally. &#8216;I got up and left the hundred Dinars (for her). O Allah! If You consider  that I did that for fear of you than please remove the rock. So Allah saved them and they  came out (of the cave).&#8221; (This Hadith indicates that one can only ask Allah for help  directly or through his performed good deeds. But to ask Allah through dead or absent  prophets, saints, spirits, holy men, angels etc. is absolutely forbidden in Islam and it  is a kind of disbelief.) </font></p>

(After a while) they passed by a lady who was  being pulled and teased (by the people). The child&#8217;s mother said, &#8216;O Allah! Do not make my  child like her.&#8217; The child said, &#8216;O Allah! Make me like her.&#8217; Then he said, &#8216;As for the  rider, he is an infidel, while the lady is accused of illegal sexual intercourse (falsely)  and she says: Allah is sufficient for me (He knows the truth).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Amongst the men of Bani Israel  there was a man who had murdered ninety-nine persons. Then he set out asking (whether his  repentance could be accepted or not). He came upon a monk and asked him if his repentance  could be accepted. The monk replied in the negative and so the man killed him. He kept on  asking till a man advised to go to such and such village. (So he left for it) but death  overtook him on the way. While dying, he turned his chest towards that village (where he  had hoped his repentance would be accepted), and so the angels of mercy and the angels of  punishment quarrelled amongst themselves regarding him. Allah ordered the village (towards  which he was going) to come closer to him, and ordered the village (whence he had come),  to go far away, and then He ordered the angels to measure the distances between his body  and the two villages. So he was found to be one span closer to the village (he was going  to). So he was forgiven.&#8221; </font></p>

A cow speaks!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I believe this, and Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar  too, believe it, although neither of them was present there. While a person was amongst  his sheep, a wolf attacked and took one of the sheep. The man chased the wolf till he  saved it from the wolf, where upon the wolf said, &#8216;You have saved it from me; but who will  guard it on the day of the wild beasts when there will be no shepherd to guard them except  me (because of riots and afflictions)? &#8216; &#8221; The people said surprisingly,  &#8220;Glorified be Allah!

He told me that it was a Punishment sent by Allah on whom he wished, and Allah  made it a source of mercy for the believers, for if one in the time of an epidemic plague  stays in his country patiently hoping for Allah&#8217;s Reward and believing that nothing will  befall him except what Allah has written for him, he will get the reward of a  martyr.&#8221; </font></p>

By Allah, if Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad stole, I  would cut off her hand.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The tribe of Quraish has precedence  over the people in this connection (i.e the right of ruling). The Muslims follow the  Muslims amongst them, and the infidels follow the infidels amongst them. People are of  different natures: The best amongst them in the pre-lslamic period are the best in Islam  provided they comprehend the religious knowledge. You will find that the best amongst the  people in this respect (i.e. of ruling) is he who hates it (i.e. the idea of ruling) most,  till he is given the pledge of allegiance.&#8221; </font></p>

You should keep  good relation between me (i.e. Muhammad) and you.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;From this side from the east,  afflictions will appear.

Those men are the ignorant amongst you. Beware of such hopes as make the people  go astray, for I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;Authority of ruling will remain with  Quraish, and whoever bears hostility to them, Allah will destroy him as long as they abide  by the laws of the religion.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

(&#8216;Abdullah) bin AzZubair said, &#8221; &#8216;Aisha should be stopped from doing  so.&#8221; (When &#8216;Aisha heard this), she said protestingly, &#8220;Shall I be stopped from  doing so? I vow that I will never talk to &#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair.&#8221; On that, Ibn  Az-Zubair asked some people from Quraish and particularly the two uncles of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle to intercede with her, but she refused (to talk to him). Az-Zuhriyun, the uncles  of the Prophet, including &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Aswad bin &#8216;Abd Yaghuth and Al-Miswar bin  Makhrama said to him, &#8220;When we ask for the permission to visit her, enter her house  along with us (without taking her leave).&#8221; He did accordingly (and she accepted their  intercession). He sent her ten slaves whom she manumitted as an expiation for (not  keeping) her vow. &#8216;Aisha manumitted more slaves for the same purpose till she manumitted  forty slaves. She said, &#8220;I wish I had specified what I would have done in case of not  fulfilling my vow when I made the vow, so that I might have done it easily.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the news of the advent of the Prophet reached Abu  Dhar, he said to his brother, &#8220;Ride to this valley and bring me the news of this man  (i.e. the Prophet ) who claims to be a Prophet receiving information from the Heaven.  Listen to him and then come to me.&#8221; His brother set out till he met the Prophet and  listened to his speech and returned to Abu Dhar and said to him, &#8220;I have seen him  exhorting people to virtues and his speech was not like poetry.&#8221; Abu Dhar said,  &#8220;You have not satisfied me as to what I wanted.&#8221; So, he took his journey-food  and a water-skin full of water and set out till he reached Mecca, where he went to the  Mosque looking for the Prophet , whom he did not know, and he would not like to ask  someone about him. So, a portion of the night had passed when &#8216;Ali saw him and realized  that he was a stranger. Abu Dhar followed him (to his house), but neither of them asked  the other about anything till it was morning, when he carried his water-skin and food and  went to the Mosque. He spent that day without being observed by the Prophet till it was  night, when he returned to his sleeping place. &#8216;Ali again passed by him and said,  &#8220;Hasn&#8217;t the man (i.e. Abu Dhar) recognized his dwelling place yet?&#8221; So, &#8216;Ali let  him get up and took him (to his house), but neither of them asked the other about  anything, till it was the third day when &#8216;Ali had the same experience with him and Abu  Dhar again stayed with him. &#8216;Ali then asked, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you tell me what has brought you  here?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;If you give me a promise and a convention that you will  guide me, then I will tell you.&#8221; When &#8216;Ali did, Abu Dhar informed him (of his  purpose). &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;It is the Truth, and he (i.e. Muhammad) is the Apostle of  Allah. So when the morning comes, follow me, and if I should perceive any danger  threatening you, I will give you a hint by pretending to go to the watercloset. But if I  carried on walking, follow me till you enter the place that I will enter.&#8221; Abu Dhur  agreed and followed &#8216;Ali till he entered the place of the Prophet and Abu Dhur entered  with him. He then listened to the speech of the Prophet and embraced Islam on that very  spot. The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Go back to your people and inform them (of this  religion) till you receive my (further) orders.&#8221; Abu Dhur said, &#8220;By Him in Whose  Hands my life is! I will proclaim my conversion to Islam publicly amongst them (i.e.  infidels).&#8221; He went out till he reached the Mosque and announced as loudly as  possible, &#8220;I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that  Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah.&#8221; The people then got up and beat him till they  knocked him down. Al-Abbas came and threw himself over him (to protect him) saying, Woe to  you! Don&#8217;t you know that he is from Ghifar and there is the route (road) to your merchants  towards Sham (i.e. through the place where this tribe dwells)?&#8221; Thus he saved him  from them. Abu Dhar did the same on the next day and the people beat him again and  Al-&#8216;Abbas drew himself over him (to save him as before). </font></p>

Neither did I know him (i.e. the  Prophet ), nor did I like to ask anyone about him. I Kept on drinking Zam zam water and  staying in the Mosque. Then &#8216;Ali passed by me and said, &#8216;It seems you are a stranger?&#8217; I  said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; He proceeded to his house and I accompanied him. Neither did he ask me  anything, nor did I tell him anything. Next morning I went to the Mosque to ask about the  Prophet but no-one told me anything about him. Ali passed by me again and asked, &#8216;Hasn&#8217;t  the man recognized his dwelling place yet&#8217; I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Come along with me.&#8217; He  asked me, &#8216;What is your business? What has brought you to this town?&#8217; I said to him, &#8216;If  you keep my secret, I will tell you.&#8217; He said, &#8216;I will do,&#8217; I said to him, &#8216;We have heard  that a person has appeared here, claiming to be a Prophet. I sent my brother to speak to  him and when he returned, he did not bring a satisfactory report; so I thought of meeting  him personally.&#8217; &#8216;Ali said (to Abu Dhar), &#8216;You have reached your goal; I am going to him  just now, so follow me, and wherever I enter, enter after me. If I should see someone who  may cause you trouble, I will stand near a wall pretending to mend my shoes (as a  warning), and you should go away then.&#8217; &#8216;Ali proceeded and I accompanied him till he  entered a place, and I entered with him to the Prophet to whom I said, &#8216;Present (the  principles of) Islam to me.&#8217; When he did, I embraced Islam &#8216;immediately. He said to me, &#8216;O  Abu Dhar! Keep your conversion as a secret and return to your town; and when you hear of  our victory, return to us. &#8216; I said, &#8216;By H him Who has sent you with the Truth, I will  announce my conversion to Islam publicly amongst them (i.e. the infidels),&#8217; Abu Dhar went  to the Mosque, where some people from Quraish were present, and said, &#8216;O folk of Quraish !  I testify that None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and I (also) testify that  Muhammad is Allah&#8217;s Slave and His Apostle.&#8217; (Hearing that) the Quraishi men said, &#8216;Get at  this Sabi (i.e. Muslim) !&#8217; They got up and beat me nearly to death. Al &#8216;Abbas saw me and  threw himself over me to protect me. He then faced them and said, &#8216;Woe to you! You want to  kill a man from the tribe of Ghifar, although your trade and your communications are  through the territory of Ghifar?&#8217; They therefore left me. The next morning I returned (to  the Mosque) and said the same as I have said on the previous day. They again said, &#8216;Get at  this Sabi!&#8217; I was treated in the same way as on the previous day, and again Al-Abbas found  me and threw himself over me to protect me and told them the same as he had said the day  before.&#8217; So, that was the conversion of Abu Dhar (may Allah be Merciful to him) to  Islam.&#8221; </font></p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle never took revenge  (over anybody) for his own sake but (he did) only when Allah&#8217;s Legal Bindings were  outraged in which case he would take revenge for Allah&#8217;s Sake. </font></p>

The people rushed to take some of the water. Bilal  again went in and brought out a spear-headed stick, and then Allah&#8217;s Apostle came out. As  if I were now looking at the whiteness of his leg. Bilal fixed the stick and the Prophet  offered a two-Rakat Zuhr prayer and a two-Rak&#8217;at &#8216;Asr prayer, while women and donkeys were  passing in front of the Prophet (beyond the stick) . </font></p>

He used to offer four Rakat, let  alone their beauty and length, and then four Rakat, let alone their beauty and length.  Afterwards he would offer three Rakat. I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Do you go to bed before  offering the Witr prayer?&#8217; He said, &#8216;My eyes sleep, but my heart does not sleep.&#8221;&#8216; </font></p>

Three persons (i.e. angels) came to the  Prophet before he was divinely inspired was an Aspostle), while he was sleeping in Al  Masjid-ul-Haram. The first (of the three angels) said, &#8220;Which of them is he?&#8221;  The second said, &#8220;He is the best of them.&#8221; That was all that happened then, and  he did not see them till they came at another night and he perceived their presence with  his heart, for the eyes of the Prophet were closed when he was asleep, but his heart was  not asleep (not unconscious). This is characteristic of all the prophets: Their eyes sleep  but their hearts do not sleep. Then Gabriel took charge of the Prophet and ascended along  with him to the Heaven. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Imran bin Husain: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That they were with the Prophet on a journey. They  travelled the whole night, and when dawn approached, they took a rest and sleep  overwhelmed them till the sun rose high in the sky. The first to get up was Abu Bakr.  Allah&#8217;s Apostles used not to be awakened from his sleep, but he would wake up by himself.  &#8216;Umar woke up and then Abu Bakr sat by the side of the Prophet&#8217;s head and started saying:  Allahu-Akbar raising his voice till the Prophet woke up, (and after traveling for a while)  he dismounted and led us in the morning prayer. A man amongst the people failed to join us  in the prayer. When the Prophet had finished the prayer, he asked (the man), &#8220;O  so-and-so! What prevented you from offering the prayer with us?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I  am Junub,&#8221; Alllah&#8217;s Apostle ordered him to perform Tayammam with clean earth. The man  then offered the prayer. Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered me and a few others to go ahead of him.  We had become very thirsty. While we were on our way (looking for water), we came across a  lady (riding an animal), hanging her legs between two water-skins. We asked her,  &#8220;Where can we get water?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;Oh ! There is no water.&#8221; We  asked, &#8220;how far is your house from the water?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;A distance of  a day and a night travel.&#8221; We said, &#8220;Come on to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, &#8220;She  asked, &#8220;What is Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; So we brought her to Allah&#8217;s Apostle against  her will, and she told him what she had told us before and added that she was the mother  of orphans. So the Prophet ordered that her two water-skins be brought and he rubbed the  mouths of the water-skins. As we were thirsty, we drank till we quenched our thirst and we  were forty men. We also filled all our waterskins and other utensils with water, but we  did not water the camels. The waterskin was so full that it was almost about to burst. The  Prophet then said, &#8220;Bring what (foodstuff) you have.&#8221; So some dates and pieces  of bread were collected for the lady, and when she went to her people, she said, &#8220;I  have met either the greatest magician or a prophet as the people claim.&#8221; So Allah  guided the people of that village through that lady. She embraced Islam and they all  embraced Islam. </font></p>

A stone pot containing water  was brought to the Prophet, who wanted to put his hand in it, but It was too small for him  to spread his hand in it, and so he had to bring his fingers together before putting his  hand in the pot. Then all the people performed the ablution (with that water).&#8221; I  asked Anas, &#8220;How many persons were they.&#8221; He replied, &#8220;There were eighty  men.&#8221; </font></p>

He asked, &#8216;What is wrong with you?&#8217; They replied, &#8216;We have no water either for performing  ablution or for drinking except what is present in front of you.&#8217; So he placed his hand in  that pot and the water started flowing among his fingers like springs. We all drank and  performed ablution (from it).&#8221; I asked Jabir, &#8220;How many were you?&#8221; he  replied, &#8220;Even if we had been one-hundred-thousand, it would have been sufficient for  us, but we were fifteen-hundred.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Talha said to Um Sulaim, &#8220;I have noticed  feebleness in the voice of Allah&#8217;s Apostle which I think, is caused by hunger. Have you  got any food?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; She brought out some loaves of barley and  took out a veil belonging to her, and wrapped the bread in part of it and put it under my  arm and wrapped part of the veil round me and sent me to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. I went carrying  it and found Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the Mosque sitting with some people. When I stood there,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked, &#8220;Has Abu Talha sent you?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes&#8221;. He  asked, &#8220;With some food? I said, &#8220;Yes&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said to the men  around him, &#8220;Get up!&#8221; He set out (accompanied by them) and I went ahead of them  till I reached Abu Talha and told him (of the Prophet&#8217;s visit). Abu Talha said, &#8220;O Um  Sulaim! Allah&#8217;s Apostle is coming with the people and we have no food to feed them.&#8221;  She said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; So Abu Talha went out to receive  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Allah&#8217;s Apostle came along with Abu Talha. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O  Um Sulaim! Bring whatever you have.&#8221; She brought the bread which Allah&#8217;s Apostle  ordered to be broken into pieces. Um Sulaim poured on them some butter from an oilskin.  Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle recited what Allah wished him to recite, and then said, &#8220;Let ten  persons come (to share the meal).&#8221; Ten persons were admitted, ate their fill and went  out. Then he again said, &#8220;Let another ten do the same.&#8221; They were admitted, ate  their fill and went out. Then he again said, &#8216;&#8221;&#8216;Let another ten persons (do the  same.)&#8221; They were admitted, ate their fill and went out. Then he said, &#8220;Let  another ten persons come.&#8221; In short, all of them ate their fill, and they were  seventy or eighty men. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The companions of Suffa were poor people. The Prophet once  said, &#8220;Whoever has food enough for two persons, should take a third one (from among  them), and whoever has food enough for four persons, should take a fifth or a sixth (or  said something similar).&#8221; Abu Bakr brought three persons while the Prophet took ten.  And Abu Bakr with his three family member (who were I, my father and my mother) (the  sub-narrator is in doubt whether &#8216;Abdur-Rahman said, &#8220;My wife and my servant who was  common for both my house and Abu Bakr&#8217;s house.&#8221;) Abu Bakr took his supper with the  Prophet and stayed there till he offered the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayers. He returned and stayed till  Allah&#8217;s Apostle took his supper. After a part of the night had passed, he returned to his  house. His wife said to him, &#8220;What has detained you from your guests?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Have you served supper to them?&#8221; She said, &#8220;They refused to take supper)  until you come. They (i.e. some members of the household) presented the meal to them but  they refused (to eat)&#8221; I went to hide myself and he said, &#8220;O Ghunthar!&#8221; He  invoked Allah to cause my ears to be cut and he rebuked me. He then said (to them): Please  eat!&#8221; and added, I will never eat the meal.&#8221; By Allah, whenever we took a  handful of the meal, the meal grew from underneath more than that handful till everybody  ate to his satisfaction; yet the remaining food was more than the original meal. Abu Bakr  saw that the food was as much or more than the original amount. He called his wife,  &#8220;O sister of Bani Firas!&#8221; She said, &#8220;O pleasure of my eyes. The food has  been tripled in quantity.&#8221; Abu Bakr then started eating thereof and said, &#8220;It  (i.e. my oath not to eat) was because of Sa all.&#8221; He took a handful from it, and  carried the rest to the Prophet. SO that food was with the Prophet . There was a treaty  between us and some people, and when the period of that treaty had elapsed, he divided US  into twelve groups, each being headed by a man. Allah knows how many men were under the  command of each leader. Anyhow, the Prophet surely sent a leader with each group. Then all  of them ate of that meal. </font></p>

Will you  invoke Allah to bless us with rain?&#8221; The Prophet lifted both his hands and invoked.  The sky at that time was as clear as glass. Suddenly a wind blew, raising clouds that  gathered together, and it started raining heavily. We came out (of the Mosque) wading  through the flowing water till we reached our homes. It went on raining till the next  Friday, when the same man or some other man stood up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  The houses have collapsed; please invoke Allah to withhold the rain.&#8221; On that the  Prophet smiled and said, &#8220;O Allah, (let it rain) around us and not on us.&#8221; I  then looked at the clouds to see them separating forming a sort of a crown round Medina. </font></p>

The date-palm  cried like a child! The Prophet descended (the pulpit) and embraced it while it continued  moaning like a child being quietened.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab said, said, &#8220;Who amongst you  remembers the statement of Allah&#8217;s Apostle regarding the afflictions?&#8221; Hudhaifa  replied, &#8220;I remember what he said exactly.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said. &#8220;Tell (us), you are  really a daring man!&#8221; Hudhaifa said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;A man&#8217;s afflictions  (i.e. wrong deeds) concerning his relation to his family, his property and his neighbors  are expiated by his prayers, giving in charity and enjoining what is good and forbidding  what is evil.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t mean these afflictions but the afflictions  that will be heaving up and down like waves of the sea.&#8221; Hudhaifa replied, &#8220;O  chief of the believers! You need not fear those (afflictions) as there is a closed door  between you and them.&#8221; &#8216;Umar asked, &#8220;Will that door be opened or broken?&#8221;  Hudhaifa replied, &#8220;No, it will be broken.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Then it is very  likely that the door will not be closed again.&#8221; Later on the people asked Hudhaifa,  &#8220;Did &#8216;Umar know what that door meant?&#8221; He said. &#8220;Yes, &#8216;Umar knew it as  everyone knows that there will be night before the tomorrow morning. I narrated to &#8216;Umar  an authentic narration, not lies.&#8221; We dared not ask Hudhaifa; therefore we requested  Masruq who asked him, &#8220;What does the door stand for?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Umar.&#8221;  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The Hour will not be established  till you fight a nation wearing hairy shoes, and till you fight the Turks, who will have  small eyes, red faces and flat noses; and their faces will be like flat shields. And you  will find that the best people are those who hate responsibility of ruling most of all  till they are chosen to be the rulers. And the people are of different natures: The best  in the pre-lslamic period are the best in Islam. A time will come when any of you will  love to see me rather than to have his family and property doubled.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Adi bin Hatim: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was in the city of the Prophet, a man came and  complained to him (the Prophet, ) of destitution and poverty. Then another man came and  complained of robbery (by highwaymen). The Prophet said, &#8220;Adi! Have you been to  Al-Hira?&#8221; I said, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t been to it, but I was informed about it.&#8221; He  said, &#8220;If you should live for a long time, you will certainly see that a lady in a  Howdah traveling from Al-Hira will (safely reach Mecca and) perform the Tawaf of the  Ka&#8217;ba, fearing none but Allah.&#8221; I said to myself, &#8220;What will happen to the  robbers of the tribe of Tai who have spread evil through out the country?&#8221; The  Prophet further said. &#8220;If you should live long, the treasures of Khosrau will be  opened (and taken as spoils).&#8221; I asked, &#8220;You mean Khosrau, son of Hurmuz?&#8221;  He said, &#8220;Khosrau, son of Hurmuz; and if you should live long, you will see that one  will carry a handful of gold or silver and go out looking for a person to accept it from  him, but will find none to accept it from him. And any of you, when meeting Allah, will  meet Him without needing an interpreter between him and Allah to interpret for him, and  Allah will say to him: &#8216;Didn&#8217;t I send a messenger to teach you?&#8217; He will say: &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Allah  will say: &#8216;Didn&#8217;t I give you wealth and do you favors?&#8217; He will say: &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Then he will  look to his right and see nothing but Hell, and look to his left and see nothing but  Hell.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Adi further said: I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;Save  yourself from the (Hell) Fire even with half a date (to be given in charity) and if you do  not find a half date, then with a good pleasant word.&#8221; &#8216;Adi added: (later on) I saw a  lady in a Howdah traveling from Al-Hira till she performed the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, fearing  none but Allah. And I was one of those who opened (conquered) the treasures of Khosrau,  son of Hurmuz. If you should live long, you will see what the Prophet Abu-l-Qasim had  said: &#8216;A person will come out with a handful. of gold&#8230;etc. </font></p>

Woe to the Arabs because of evil that  has come near. Today a hole has been made in the wall of Gog and Magog as large as  this.&#8221; pointing with two of his fingers making a circle. Zainab said, &#8220;I said,  &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall we be destroyed though amongst us there are pious people? &#8216; He  said, &#8216;Yes, if evil increases.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Um Salama: The Prophet woke up and said,  &#8220;Glorified be Allah: What great (how many) treasures have been sent down, and what  great (how many ) afflictions have been sent down!&#8221; </font></p>

And  whoever will look towards those afflictions, they will overtake him, and whoever will find  a refuge or a shelter, should take refuge in it.&#8221; The same narration is reported by  Abu Bakr, with the addition, &#8220;(The Prophet said), &#8216;Among the prayers there is a  prayer the missing of which will be to one like losing one&#8217;s family and property.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people used to ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle about good, but I  used to ask him about evil for fear that it might overtake me. Once I said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We were in ignorance and in evil and Allah has bestowed upon us the  present good; will there by any evil after this good?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; I  asked, &#8220;Will there be good after that evil?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, but it would be  tained with Dakhan (i.e. Little evil).&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What will its Dakhan be?&#8221;  He said, &#8220;There will be some people who will lead (people) according to principles  other than my tradition. You will see their actions and disapprove of them.&#8221; I said,  &#8220;Will there by any evil after that good?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, there will be some  people who will invite others to the doors of Hell, and whoever accepts their invitation  to it will be thrown in it (by them).&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Describe  those people to us.&#8221; He said, &#8220;They will belong to us and speak our  language&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What do you order me to do if such a thing should take place  in my life?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Adhere to the group of Muslims and their Chief.&#8221; I  asked, &#8220;If there is neither a group (of Muslims) nor a chief (what shall I do)?&#8221;  He said, &#8220;Keep away from all those different sects, even if you had to bite (i.e.  eat) the root of a tree, till you meet Allah while you are still in that state.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While we were with Allah&#8217;s Apostle who was distributing  (i.e. some property), there came Dhu-l-Khuwaisira, a man from the tribe of Bani Tamim and  said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Do Justice.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Woe to you! Who  could do justice if I did not? I would be a desperate loser if I did not do justice.&#8221;  &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allow me to chop his head off.&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;Leave him, for he has companions who pray and fast in such a way that you will  consider your fasting negligible in comparison to theirs. They recite Qur&#8217;an but it does  not go beyond their throats (i.e. they do not act on it) and they will desert Islam as an  arrow goes through a victim&#8217;s body, so that the hunter, on looking at the arrow&#8217;s blade,  would see nothing on it; he would look at its Risaf and see nothing: he would look at its  Na,di and see nothing, and he would look at its Qudhadh ( 1 ) and see nothing (neither  meat nor blood), for the arrow has been too fast even for the blood and excretions to  smear. The sign by which they will be recognized is that among them there will be a black  man, one of whose arms will resemble a woman&#8217;s breast or a lump of meat moving loosely.  Those people will appear when there will be differences amongst the people.&#8221; I  testify that I heard this narration from Allah&#8217;s Apostle and I testify that &#8216;Ali bin Abi  Talib fought with such people, and I was in his company. He ordered that the man  (described by the Prophet ) should be looked for. The man was brought and I looked at him  and noticed that he looked exactly as the Prophet had described him. </font></p>

Would you pray to Allah for us?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Among the nations before you a  (believing) man would be put in a ditch that was dug for him, and a saw would be put over  his head and he would be cut into two pieces; yet that (torture) would not make him give  up his religion. His body would be combed with iron combs that would remove his flesh from  the bones and nerves, yet that would not make him abandon his religion. By Allah, this  religion (i.e. Islam) will prevail till a traveler from Sana (in Yemen) to Hadrarmaut will  fear none but Allah, or a wolf as regards his sheep, but you (people) are hasty. </font></p>

He asked Thabit, &#8220;What&#8217;s the  matter?&#8221; Thabit replied, &#8220;An evil situation: A man used to raise his voice over  the voice of the Prophet and so all his good deeds have been annulled and he is from the  people of Hell.&#8221; The man went back and told the Prophet that Thabit had said  so-and-so. (The sub-narrator, Musa bin Anas said, &#8220;The man went to Thabit again with  glad tidings).&#8221; The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Go and say to Thabit: &#8216;You are not  from the people of Fire, but from the people of Paradise.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Bakr came to my father who was at home and purchased a  saddle from him. He said to &#8216;Azib. &#8220;Tell your son to carry it with me.&#8221; So I  carried it with him and my father followed us so as to take the price (of the saddle). My  father said, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! Tell me what happened to you on your night journey with  Allah&#8217;s Apostle (during Migration).&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, we travelled the whole night  and also the next day till midday. when nobody could be seen on the way ( because of the  severe heat) . Then there appeared a long rock having shade beneath it, and the sunshine  had not come to it yet. So we dismounted there and I levelled a place and covered it with  an animal hide or dry grass for the Prophet to sleep on (for a while). I then said,  &#8216;Sleep, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and I will guard you.&#8217; So he slept and I went out to guard him.  Suddenly I saw a shepherd coming with his sheep to that rock with the same intention we  had when we came to it. I asked (him). &#8216;To whom do you belong, O boy?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;I  belong to a man from Medina or Mecca.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Do your sheep have milk?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217;  I said, &#8216;Will you milk for us?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; He caught hold of a sheep and I asked him  to clean its teat from dust, hairs and dirt. (The sub-narrator said that he saw Al-Bara&#8217;  striking one of his hands with the other, demonstrating how the shepherd removed the  dust.) The shepherd milked a little milk in a wooden container and I had a leather  container which I carried for the Prophet to drink and perform the ablution from. I went  to the Prophet, hating to wake him up, but when I reached there, the Prophet had already  awakened; so I poured water over the middle part of the milk container, till the milk was  cold. Then I said, &#8216;Drink, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8217; He drank till I was pleased. Then he asked,  &#8216;Has the time for our departure come?&#8217; I said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; So we departed after midday. Suraqa  bin Malik followed us and I said, &#8216;We have been discovered, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8217; He said,  Don&#8217;t grieve for Allah is with us.&#8217; The Prophet invoked evil on him (i.e. Suraqa) and so  the legs of his horse sank into the earth up to its belly. (The subnarrator, Zuhair is not  sure whether Abu Bakr said, &#8220;(It sank) into solid earth.&#8221;) Suraqa said, &#8216;I see  that you have invoked evil on me. Please invoke good on me, and by Allah, I will cause  those who are seeking after you to return.&#8217; The Prophet invoked good on him and he was  saved. Then, whenever he met somebody on the way, he would say, &#8216;I have looked for him  here in vain.&#8217; So he caused whomever he met to return. Thus Suraqa fulfilled his  promise.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet paid a visit to a sick bedouin. The Prophet  when visiting a patient used to say, &#8220;No harm will befall you! May Allah cure you!  May Allah cure you!&#8221; So the Prophet said to the bedouin. &#8220;No harm will befall  you. May Allah cure you!&#8221; The bedouin said, &#8220;You say, may Allah cure me? No, for  it is a fever which boils in (the body of) an old man, and will lead him to the  grave.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes, then may it be as you say.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>There was a Christian who embraced Islam and read  Surat-al-Baqara and Al-Imran, and he used to write (the revelations) for the Prophet.  Later on he returned to Christianity again and he used to say: &#8220;Muhammad knows  nothing but what I have written for him.&#8221; Then Allah caused him to die, and the  people buried him, but in the morning they saw that the earth had thrown his body out.  They said, &#8220;This is the act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our  companion and took his body out of it because he had run away from them.&#8221; They again  dug the grave deeply for him, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown  his body out. They said, &#8220;This is an act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the  grave of our companion and threw his body outside it, for he had run away from them.&#8221;  They dug the grave for him as deep as they could, but in the morning they again saw that  the earth had thrown his body out. So they believed that what had befallen him was not  done by human beings and had to leave him thrown (on the ground). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Musailama-al-Kadhdhab (i.e. the liar) came in the life-time  of Allah&#8217;s Apostle with many of his people (to Medina) and said, &#8220;If Muhammad makes  me his successor, I will follow him.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle went up to him with Thabit bin  Qais bin Shams; and Allah&#8217;s Apostle was carrying a piece of a date-palm leaf in his hand.  He stood before Musailama (and his companions) and said, &#8220;If you asked me even this  piece (of a leaf), I would not give it to you. You cannot avoid the fate you are destined  to, by Allah. If you reject Islam, Allah will destroy you. I think that you are most  probably the same person whom I have seen in the dream.&#8221; Abu Huraira told me that  Allah&#8217;s Apostle; said, &#8220;While I was sleeping, I saw (in a dream) two gold bracelets  round my arm, and that worried me too much. Then I was instructed divinely in my dream, to  blow them off and so I blew them off, and they flew away. I interpreted the two bracelets  as symbols of two liars who would appear after me. And so one of them was Al-Ansi and the  other was Musailama Al-Kadhdhab from Al-Yamama.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;In a dream I saw myself migrating  from Mecca to a place having plenty of date trees. I thought that it was Al-Yamama or  Hajar, but it came to be Medina i.e. Yathrib. In the same dream I saw myself moving a  sword and its blade got broken. It came to symbolize the defeat which the Muslims suffered  from, on the Day of Uhud. I moved the sword again, and it became normal as before, and  that was the symbol of the victory Allah bestowed upon Muslims and their gathering  together. I saw cows in my dream, and by Allah, that was a blessing, and they symbolized  the believers on the Day of Uhud. And the blessing was the good Allah bestowed upon us and  the reward of true belief which Allah gave us after the day of Badr. </font></p>

The Prophet said, &#8220;Welcome, O my daughter!&#8221; Then he made her sit  on his right or on his left side, and then he told her a secret and she started weeping. I  asked her, &#8220;Why are you weeping?&#8221; He again told her a secret and she started  laughing. I said, &#8220;I never saw happiness so near to sadness as I saw today.&#8221; I  asked her what the Prophet had told her. She said, &#8220;I would never disclose the secret  of Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221; When the Prophet died, I asked her about it. She replied.  &#8220;The Prophet said.) &#8216;Every year Gabriel used to revise the Qur&#8217;an with me once only,  but this year he has done so twice. I think this portends my death, and you will be the  first of my family to follow me.&#8217; So I started weeping.

So, if any of you should take over the authority by which he can  either benefit some people or harm some others, he should accept the goodness of their  good people (i.e. Ansar) and excuse the faults of their wrong-doers.&#8221; That was the  last gathering which the Prophet attended. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Sa&#8217;d bin Mu&#8217;adh came to Mecca with the intention of  performing &#8216;Umra, and stayed at the house of Umaiya bin Khalaf Abi Safwan, for Umaiya  himself used to stay at Sa&#8217;d&#8217;s house when he passed by Medina on his way to Sham. Umaiya  said to Sad, &#8220;Will you wait till midday when the people are (at their homes), then  you may go and perform the Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba?&#8221; So, while Sad was going around the  Ka&#8217;ba, Abu Jahl came and asked, &#8220;Who is that who is performing Tawaf?&#8221; Sad  replied, &#8220;I am Sad.&#8221; Abu Jahl said, &#8220;Are you circumambulating the Ka&#8217;ba  safely although you have given refuge to Muhammad and his companions?&#8221; Sad said,  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; and they started quarreling. Umaiya said to Sad, &#8220;Don&#8217;t shout at  Abi-l-Hakam (i.e. Abu Jahl), for he is chief of the valley (of Mecca).&#8221; Sad then said  (to Abu Jahl). &#8216;By Allah, if you prevent me from performing the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, I will  spoil your trade with Sham.&#8221; Umaiya kept on saying to Sad, &#8220;Don&#8217;t raise your  voice.&#8221; and kept on taking hold of him. Sad became furious and said, (to Umaiya),  &#8220;Be away from me, for I have heard Muhammad saying that he will kill you.&#8221;  Umaiiya said, &#8220;Will he kill me?&#8221; Sad said, &#8220;Yes,.&#8221; Umaiya said,  &#8220;By Allah! When Muhammad says a thing, he never tells a lie.&#8221; Umaiya went to his  wife and said to her, &#8220;Do you know what my brother from Yathrib (i.e. Medina) has  said to me?&#8221; She said, &#8220;What has he said?&#8221; He said, &#8220;He claims that he  has heard Muhammad claiming that he will kill me.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>She said, By Allah! Muhammad never tells a lie.&#8221; So  when the infidels started to proceed for Badr (Battle) and declared war (against the  Muslims), his wife said to him, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember what your brother from Yathrib  told you?&#8221; Umaiya decided not to go but Abu Jahl said to him, &#8220;You are from the  nobles of the valley of Mecca), so you should accompany us for a day or two.&#8221; He went  with them and thus Allah got him killed. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;A horse may be kept for one of  three purposes: for a man it may be a source of reward; for another it may be a means of  living; and for a third it may be a burden (a source of committing sins). As for the one  for whom it is a source of reward, he is the one who keeps his horse for the sake of Jihad  in Allah&#8217;s Cause; he ties it with a long rope on a pasture or in a garden. So whatever its  rope allows it to eat, will be regarded as good rewardable deeds (for its owner). And if  it breaks off its rope and jumps over one or two hillocks, even its dung will be  considered amongst his good deeds. And if it passes by a river and drinks water from it,  that will be considered as good deeds for his benefit) even if he has had no intention of  watering it. A horse is a shelter for the one who keeps it so that he may earn his living  honestly and takes it as a refuge to keep him from following illegal ways (of gaining  money), and does not forget the rights of Allah (i.e. paying the Zakat and allowing others  to use it for Allah&#8217;s Sake). But a horse is a burden (and a source of committing sins for  him who keeps it out of pride and pretense and with the intention of harming the  Muslims.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet was asked about donkeys. He replied,  &#8220;Nothing has been revealed to be concerning them except this comprehensive Verse  (which covers everything) :&#8211;&#8216;Then whosoever has done good equal to the weight of an atom  (or a small ant), Shall see it (its reward) And whosoever has done evil equal to the  weight of an atom (or a small ) ant), Shall see it (Its punishment).&#8221; (99.7-8) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle reached Khaibar in the early morning and  the people of Khaibar came out with their spades, and when they saw the Prophet they said,  &#8220;Muhammad and his army!&#8221; and returned hurriedly to take refuge in the fort. The  Prophet raised his hands and said, &#8220;Allah is Greater! Khaibar is ruined ! If we  approach a nation, then miserable is the morning of those who are warned.&#8221; </font></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Book of Medicine of his Sahih, <strong>Al-Bukhari</strong> recorded that `A&#8217;ishah said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah was bewitched until he thought that he had relations with his wives, but he had not had relations with them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyan said, &#8220;This is the worst form of magic when it reaches this stage.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O `A&#8217;ishah! Do you know that Allah has answered me concerning that which I asked Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Two men came to me and one of them sat by my head while the other sat by my feet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who was sitting by my head said to the other one, `What is wrong with this man&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other replied, `He is bewitched.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first one said, `Who bewitched him&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other replied, `Labid bin A`sam. He is a man from the tribe of Banu Zurayq who is an ally of the Jews, and a hypocrite.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first one asked, `With what (did he bewitch him)&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other replied, `With a comb and hair from the comb.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first one asked, `Where (is the comb)&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other answered, `In the dried bark of a male date palm under a rock in a well called Dharwan.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`A&#8217;ishah said, &#8220;So he went to the well to remove it (the comb with the hair).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the well that I saw. It was as if its water had henna soaked in it and its palm trees were like the heads of devils.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he removed it (of the well). Then I (`A&#8217;ishah) said, `Will you not make this public&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied, (Allah has cured me and I hate to spread (the news of) wickedness to any of the people.)&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>
<p><strong>How come that the Messenger of Allah was bewitched? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q 6: <span style="color:#993300;">How come that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) was bewitched when Allah addresses him saying: <span style="color:#008000;">Allâh will protect you from mankind</span>. How could he suffer the influence of magic at the time when he was responsible for conveying the Divine Revelation to the Muslims? Kindly explain the statement of the Mushriks (one who associates others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) in the Qur&#8217;an: <span style="color:#008000;">You follow none but a bewitched man</span>. Please, clarify and answer the misconceptions! </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A 6: According to an authentic Hadith, this incident of bewitching took place in Al-Madinah. When the Prophet (peace be upon him) started to receive Divine Revelation regularly, proofs of the truthfulness of his prophethood were established and Allah&#8217;s victory was granted to him over the disbelievers who felt disgraced. At that time, a man from the Jews called Labid ibn Al-A`sam bewitched him by sticking one of the Prophet&#8217;s hairs to a comb. The Prophet (peace be upon him) started imagining that he had done a thing, which in fact he had not done. Despite being affected by magic, the Prophet (peace be upon him) was conscious of every single word he spoke to people. He would speak the words inspired to him by Allah (Exalted be He). However, the spell that was cast on him affected his intimate relation with his wives. `Aishah (may Allah be please with her) said: <span style="color:#008000;">Once the Prophet was bewitched so that he began to imagine that he had done a thing which in fact he had not done</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was only when Jibril (Gabriel) (peace be upon him) told him about what had happened to him that the Prophet (peace be upon him) sent someone to bring the spell out from a well belonging to one of the Al-Ansar (the Helpers, inhabitants of Madinah who supported the Prophet). When he was rid of it, the spell was broken by Allah&#8217;s grace. <strong>It was then that Allah (Exalted be He) revealed the two Surahs, which came to be known as Al-Mu`awwidhatayn (Surahs Al-Falaq and Al-Nas)</strong>. When the Prophet (peace be upon him) recited them, he was cured. Praising these two Surahs, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:<strong> <span style="color:#008000;">No one can use anything that is equal to these two Surahs in seeking refuge in Allah</span></strong>. The fact that the Prophet (peace be upon him) was bewitched did not affect his conveying of the Islamic Message nor were the people around him affected by that. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) protected him from failing to convey the Message of Islam to people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Like all other prophets, Muhammad (peace be upon him) suffered several types of physical pain. For example, in the battle of Uhud, his face was wounded by the rings of his helmet that pierced his temples, his lower lip bled, and one of his teeth was broken. He also fell into a pit. The disbelievers also tightened a net around him in Makkah. He suffered pain like all the prophets who preceded him. Allah (Exalted be He) raised him to greater ranks and doubled his reward for his patient endurance of suffering and oppression at the hands of the disbelievers. Regarding the Ayah which reads: (<strong>Allâh will protect you from mankind&#8230;</strong>), it means that Allah (Exalted be He) will protect the Prophet (peace be upon him) from the disbelievers&#8217; conspiracy to kill him and from their attempt to prevent him from conveying the Message of Islam.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Thirteenth and Fourteenth Pillar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Muhammadin wa &#8216;alaa Muhammadin kamaa Salayta &#8216;alaa ibraaheema wa &#8216;alaa Aali ibraaheema Innaka Hameedun Majeed&#8221;</span> [O Allaah, send your praises upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad as you sent praises upon Ibraaheem and the family of Ibraaheem. Verily, You are Most-Praiseworthy, Most Glorified]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This version of the tashahhud is well known. There are other forms of it as well.You may memorize whichever wording of the tashahhud that you like. However, choose one that is agreed upon. And if you hear someone using a tashahhud that varies from this one, do not condemn him.Tha same could be said about sending Salaat on the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) if you have memorized the version mentioned here by the author. There are other ways of saying it as well. And we have stated many times that there exists many ways of doing it. Perhaps all of these ways (of sending salaat on the Prophet) have been gathered together by the great Scholar Ibn Al-Qavvim in his book which is unique in its subject: Jalaa-ul-Afhaam fis-Salaati &#8216;alaa Khair-il-Anaam.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Salaat mentioned here (i.e. above) is known as the Abrahamic Salaat. The most comprehensive form of it is the one that has been agreed upon, which is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Muhammadin wa &#8216;alaa Aali Muhammad kamaa salaita &#8216;alaa Ibraaheema wa &#8216;alaa Aali Ibraaheem. Innaka Hameedun Majeed. Wa Baarik Muhammadin wa &#8216;alaa Aali Muhammad kamaa baarakta &#8216;alaa Ibraaheema wa &#8216;alaa Aali Ibraaheem. Innaka Hameedun Majeed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This manner of saying it is agreed upon. And there are many other ways. However you should take note that none of the versions of the Abrahamic Salaat that have been recorded by Ibn Al-Qayyim in his afore-mentioned book contain an mention of the word &#8220;Sayyidinaa&#8221; our master) such as: &#8220;Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Sayyidinaa Muhammad.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">Many of our sensitive Muslim brothers, if you don&#8217;t say &#8220;<strong>Sayyidinaa</strong>&#8221; when sending Salaat and just say &#8220;Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Muhammad&#8221; , will perhaps think bad thoughts about you and say: &#8220;This person doesn&#8217;t have any respect for Allaah&#8217;s Messenger!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">In fact, this very thing actually did happen, for one time a Moroccan man on Hajj told me: &#8220;0 Shaikh! I have attended your lessons from the first class till now while traveling. But I notice about you that when you send Salaat on the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam), you say &#8216; Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Muhammad&#8217; and I never heard you once say: &#8216; Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Sayyidinaa Muhammad.&#8217; Why is this O Shaikh?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">He asked a good question and I clarified the matter to him, thus reducing the irritation found in him since he would become very annoyed whenever he would hear someone send Salaat on the Prophet and not say: &#8220;Allaahumma Salli Sayyidinaa Muhammad.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">The Muslim common-folk do not make any distinction in matters. Perhaps they think that someone who leaves out the word &#8220;Sayyidinaa&#8221; does not respect the Prophet and does not love him in the manner that he deserves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">The reply: This is ignorance. It may even be called compound ignorance. Compound ignorance is when someone is ignorant and he doesn&#8217;t know that he is ignorant. If you don&#8217;t know that you don&#8217;t know something then this is ignorance on top of ignorance. So what is it that someone with ignorance attached to him knows? Nothing!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point is that Muhammad, the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) is our leader (Sayyid). He is the leader of all of mankind &#8211; all of the descendants of Aadam. This is what I worship Allaah with. We must believe this, in accordance with what he has informed us: &#8220;I am the Sayyid (leader) of mankind on the Day of Judgement. I am the Sayyid (leader) of the children of Aadam, and I do not say this to boast&#8221; We are obligated to believe that he is the Sayyid (leader) of all of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But in spite of this, when he (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) taught the Companions how to send Salaat on him and when he dictated the Abrahamic Salaat to them during the revelation of the ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily Allaah and His Angels send Salaat (praises) on the Prophet. O you who believe, send your praises (Salaat) and greetings (Salaam) on him&#8221;</span> [Surah Al-Ahzaab: 56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When this ayah was revealed, the Companions asked: &#8220;0 Messenger of Allaah(Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam), you have already taught us how to send greetings (of Salaam) upon you, but we have been ordered to (also) send praises (Salaat) upon you, so how do we send Salaat on you?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is possible that this sort of questioning occurred in several different gatherings based on the fact that there are numerous manners of sending Salaat on the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam). The Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) taught his Companions to say it like this: &#8220;Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Muhammad.&#8221; This does not mean that he (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) revoked his status of leadership and that he was no longer a Sayyid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You have noted that at times the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) would condemn people in certain circumstances who would make statements that were understood to contain exaggeration and extremism with regard to himself. He (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) would condemn the one who said: &#8220;You are our Sayyid (leader), son of our Sayyid. And you are the best among us, son of the best among us&#8221; even though he really is the Sayyid (leader) of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, he did this because he feared that this man was being afflicted with extremism. Going to extremes with regard to the righteous people is one of the main causes of others being worshipped besides Allaah. So in order to protect the sanctuary of Tawheed, he told him no. He forbade him from (saying) that, saying: &#8220;I am only a slave, so say: &#8216;The slave and messenger of Alhall.'&#8221; This was even in spite of his prior statement in which he announced that he was the Sayyid (leader) of the children of Aadam. However, there is no contradiction between this statement and that statement since each situation warrants its own statement depending on its circumstances.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The situation in which the Prophet condemned the man was a situation that warranted such a condemnation and warning, whereas the situation in which he (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) announced he was the Sayyid (of mankind) was due to the fact that he was talking about his (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) intercession. So he was clarifying its reality the reality that he is the Sayyid (leader) of all of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point we are trying to make here is: Sending Salaat on the Prophet should be done by using one of the versions that have been reported in the texts. You should not add the phrase Sayyidina (our leader) to it even though the Prophet is our Sayyid. I hope that this point is understood. Furthermore, after making this point clear, I would like to reiterate that we must believe and affirm, in accordance with his report, that the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) is our Sayyid (leader). However, when sending Salaat upon him, we should not say: &#8220;Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Sayyidinaa.&#8221; Rather we should just say: &#8220;Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Muhammad&#8221; since this would be following his example, implementing his teachings, and carrying out his instructions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This statement stuns some people, which is why I must say again that the scholars have unanimously agreed that it is not permissible for a Muslim who wants to worship Allaah through words of supplication that have been reported in the texts to add, subtract, change or replace any of those words.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars of Hadeeth, with their intricate memory and understanding of the texts, use as evidence one single report, which others perhaps are not aware of the basis of proof found in it. This report is about the time when the Prophet taught one of his Companions the supplication one should make when going to bed. The supplication contains the following words:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8220;Aamantu bi-Kitaabik aladhee anzalta wa Nabee&#8217;ik aladhee arsalta.&#8221;<br />
I believe in Your Book that You revealed and in Your Prophet that You sent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Companion began to repeat this supplication in order to memorize it, but then on one occasion, said: &#8220;&#8230;wa Rasoolik aladhee arsalta&#8221; , i.e. &#8220;&#8230;in Your Messenger that You sent.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What did he do? He replaced the word &#8220;Nabee&#8221; (Prophet) with the word &#8220;Rasool&#8221; (Messenger). This Companion then narrated that: &#8220;The Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam), tapped my chest and said: &#8220;No, say: Wa Nabee&#8217;ik aladhee arsalta.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is clear proof that it is not proper for a person who wishes to follow Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) and abide by his teachings to add, subtract, change or replace (these supplications) based on his own accord. The &#8220;Messenger&#8221; and &#8220;Prophet&#8221; are two valid titles for Prophet Muhammad. However, we cannot change the supplication from the manner in which it was reported since that is the way the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) stated it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) does not speak from his own desire. So these were revealed to the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) through revelation from Allaah. Meaning: The legislation of these words of remembrance that are to be said at the time of sleeping came down from the heavrns. So if something was revealed to the Prophet(Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) and he conveyed it to his, Companions in the same manner in which it was sent down, it would not be proper for the Companions to change that. And we should follow their example, and Allaah knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Dream of the Prophet Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sahih Bukhari</strong> Volume 9, Book 87, Number 171: [<small>Interpretation of Dreams ]</small> : <span style="line-height:1.5em;">Narrated Samura bin Jundub</span><strong style="line-height:1.5em;">:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah’s Apostle very often used to ask his companions, “Did anyone of you see a dream?” So dreams would be narrated to him by those whom Allah wished to tell.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One morning the Prophet said,</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>“Last night two persons came to me (in a dream) and woke me up and said to me, ‘Proceed!’</p>
<p>I set out with them and we came across a man Lying down, and behold, another man was standing over his head, holding a big rock. Behold, he was throwing the rock at the man’s head, injuring it. The rock rolled away and the thrower followed it and took it back. By the time he reached the man, his head returned to the normal state. The thrower then did the same as he had done before. I said to my two companions, ‘Subhan Allah! Who are these two persons?’ They said, ‘Proceed!’</p>
<p>So we proceeded and came to a man Lying flat on his back and another man standing over his head with an iron hook, and behold, he would put the hook in one side of the man’s mouth and tear off that side of his face to the back (of the neck) and similarly tear his nose from front to back and his eye from front to back. Then he turned to the other side of the man’s face and did just as he had done with the other side. He hardly completed this side when the other side returned to its normal state. Then he returned to it to repeat what he had done before. I said to my two companions, ‘Subhan Allah! Who are these two persons?’ They said to me, ‘Proceed!’</p>
<p>So we proceeded and came across something like a Tannur (a kind of baking oven, a pit usually clay-lined for baking bread).” I think the Prophet said, “In that oven there was much noise and voices.” The Prophet added, “We looked into it and found naked men and women, and behold, a flame of fire was reaching to them from underneath, and when it reached them, they cried loudly. I asked them, ‘Who are these?’ They said to me, ‘Proceed!’</p>
<p>And so we proceeded and came across a river.” I think he said, “…. red like blood.” The Prophet added, “And behold, in the river there was a man swimming, and on the bank there was a man who had collected many stones. Behold. while the other man was swimming, he went near him. The former opened his mouth and the latter (on the bank) threw a stone into his mouth whereupon he went swimming again. He returned and every time the performance was repeated, I asked my two companions, ‘Who are these (two) persons?’ They replied, ‘Proceed! Proceed!’</p>
<p>And we proceeded till we came to a man with a repulsive appearance, the most repulsive appearance, you ever saw a man having! Beside him there was a fire and he was kindling it and running around it. I asked my companions, ‘Who is this (man)?’ They said to me, ‘Proceed! Proceed!’</p>
<p>So we proceeded till we reached a garden of deep green dense vegetation, having all sorts of spring colors. In the midst of the garden there was a very tall man and I could hardly see his head because of his great height, and around him there were children in such a large number as I have never seen. I said to my companions, ‘Who is this?’ They replied, ‘Proceed! Proceed!’</p>
<p>So we proceeded till we came to a majestic huge garden, greater and better than I have ever seen! My two companions said to me, ‘Go up and I went up’ The Prophet added, “So we ascended till we reached a city built of gold and silver bricks and we went to its gate and asked (the gatekeeper) to open the gate, and it was opened and we entered the city and found in it, men with one side of their bodies as handsome as the handsomest person you have ever seen, and the other side as ugly as the ugliest person you have ever seen. My two companions ordered those men to throw themselves into the river. Behold, there was a river flowing across (the city), and its water was like milk in whiteness. Those men went and threw themselves in it and then returned to us after the ugliness (of their bodies) had disappeared and they became in the best shape.” The Prophet further added, “My two companions (angels) said to me, ‘This place is the Eden Paradise, and that is your place.’ I raised up my sight, and behold, there I saw a palace like a white cloud! My two companions said to me, ‘That (palace) is your place.’ I said to them, ‘May Allah bless you both! Let me enter it.’ They replied, ‘As for now, you will not enter it, but you shall enter it (one day)</p>
<p>I said to them, ‘I have seen many wonders tonight. What does all that mean which I have seen?’<br />
They replied, ‘We will inform you:</p>
<p>As for the first man you came upon whose head was being injured with the rock, he is the symbol of the one who studies the Quran and then neither recites it nor acts on its orders, and sleeps, neglecting the enjoined prayers.</p>
<p>As for the man you came upon whose sides of mouth, nostrils and eyes were torn off from front to back, he is the symbol of the man who goes out of his house in the morning and tells so many lies that it spreads all over the world. And</p>
<p>those naked men and women whom you saw in a construction resembling an oven, they are the adulterers and the adulteresses;,</p>
<p>and the man whom you saw swimming in the river and given a stone to swallow, is the eater of usury (Riba) and</p>
<p>the bad looking man whom you saw near the fire kindling it and going round it, is Malik, the gatekeeper of Hell and</p>
<p>the tall man whom you saw in the garden, is Abraham and the children around him are those children who die with Al-Fitra (the Islamic Faith).”</p>
<p>The narrator added: Some Muslims asked the Prophet, “O Allah’s Apostle! What about the children of pagans?” The Prophet replied, “And also the children of pagans.”</p>
<p>The Prophet added, “My two companions added,</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<div>
<p>‘The men you saw half handsome and half ugly were those persons who had mixed an act that was good with another that was bad, but Allah forgave them.’”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">By the Shaykh &#8211; the noble Scholar &#8211; &#8216;Abdul-Azeez bin Baaz [1]<br />
Al-Istiqaamah Issue No.3 &#8211; Rabî&#8217;ul-Awwal 1417H / August 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah and the blessing of Allaah and His peace be upon the Messenger, and upon his Family, his Companions and all those who follow his guidance. After that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible to celebrate <i>Milaadun-Nabee</i> (the birthday of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>), nor the birthday of anyone else, since this is from the acts of <i>bid&#8217;ah</i> (innovations) that have been newly-invented into the religion. 2 Neither did Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, nor the Rightly-Guided <i>Khaleefahs</i> (Successors), nor the Companions, may Allaah be please with them all, nor any of their followers from the first three excellent generations, celebrate this day &#8211; and they were the most knowledgeable of people concerning the <i>Sunnah</i> (the Prophetic guidance), and had the greatest love for Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and were the foremost in following his <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i> (Prescribed Laws).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been authentically established from the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> that he said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever introduces into this affair of ours, that which is not part of it, will have it rejected.&#8221;</i> 3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another authentic narration, he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Hold fast to my Sunnah (guidance) and the way of the Rightly-Guided Khaleefahs after me, cling to it tightly. And beware of newly-invented matters, for every newly-invented matter is an innovation, and every innovation is misguidance.&#8221;</i> 4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these two narrations contain a strong warning against innovations in the religion, and acting upon them. This is why Allaah &#8211; the One free of all defects &#8211; says in His Clear Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And whatever the Messenger gives you, take it. Whatever he forbids you from, then keep away from it.&#8221; </b>[Soorah al-Hadeed 59:7].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Let those beware who withstand the command of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, unless some trials and afflictions befall them, or unless they are afflicted with a painful punishment.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Noor 24:63].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And the first to embrace Islaam from the <i>Muhaajirs</i> and the <i>Ansaar</i>, and those who followed them in goodness, beliefs and actions. Allaah is well-pleased with them, and they are well-pleased with Him. He has prepared for them Gardens of Paradise, beneath which rivers flow, to live therein forever. That is the supreme achievement.&#8221;</b> [Soorah at-Tawbah 9:100].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen Islaam as your way of life.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:3].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The verses with this meaning are plenty. So to accept this celebration, or any other newly-invented act of worship, implies that Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; did not complete and perfect the religion for this Ummah, and that the Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> did not completely convey to his Ummah what was necessary regarding their duties, until the advent of those who came later and innovated in the religion of Allaah that for which they had no permission, claiming that they would draw closer to Allaah by such innovations. And this &#8211; without doubt &#8211; is a great danger and amounts to criticising Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; and His Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. For Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects &#8211; has indeed perfected this religion for His servants, and has completed His favour upon them. And the Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> has clearly conveyed the Message, not leaving any way that leads to Paradise, nor any way that distances a person from the Fire, except that he explained it to his Ummah. This has been established in an authentic narration, from &#8216;Abdullaah ibn &#8216;Amr <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i>, in which Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Allaah did not send any Prophet except that it was his duty to inform his Ummah of the good that he knew, and to warn them about the evils that he knew.&#8221;</i> 5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is known that our Prophet <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> is the best of all the Prophets and the last of them and the most perfect of them with regards to conveying the Message and advising the people. So if celebrating his <i> milaad</i> (birthday) was a part of the religion that Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect chose, then the Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> would have most certainly explained it to his Ummah, or he would have celebrated it himself, or his noble Companions <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhum</i> would have celebrated it. However, since nothing like this happened, then we know that the celebration of <i> milaad</i> has nothing to do with Islaam whatsoever. Rather, it is from those innovations which the Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> warned his Ummah from, as has been shown in the preceding narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is another authentic narration similar in meaning to the two preceding ones, and it is his <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s</i> saying in his <i> Jumu&#8217;ah khutbah</i> (Friday sermon):<i> &#8220;Indeed the best speech is the Book of Allaah, and the best guidance and example is that of Muhammad sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam. And the worst affairs are the newly-invented ones, and every newly-invented matter is an innovation, and every innovation is misguidance.&#8221;</i> 6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this, a group of the Scholars rejected the practice of <i>milaad</i> and warned against it, acting upon the aforementioned proofs, and their like. However, some of the later Scholars differed, in that they have allowed such a practice, providing it does not entail any sinful and evil matters; such as exaggerating in the praise of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, or free-mixing between men and women, or the playing of musical instruments and singing, and other such matters which are rejected by the pure <i> Sharee&#8217;ah</i> (Prescribed Law). They think that such a practice is a <i> bid&#8217;ah hasanah</i> (a good innovation in the religion). 7 However, the <i> Sharee&#8217;ah</i> principle is: whenever any dispute arises amongst the people, then the issue should be referred back to the Book of Allaah and to the Sunnah of His Messenger, Muhammad <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;O you who believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger and those in authority amongst you. If you differ in anything amongst yourselves, then refer it back for judgment to Allaah and His Messenger, if you do truly believe in Allaah and the Last Day. That is better and more befitting for final determination.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:59].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And in whatever you differ, the judgement is with Allaah.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ash-Shooraa 42:10].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if we refer this issue &#8211; about the validity of celebrating <i> milaad</i> &#8211; back to the Book of Allaah, we find that the Book (i.e. the Qur&#8217;aan) commands us to follow the Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> in that which he brought, and it warns us against that which he prohibited. It also informs us that Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; has perfected the religion of Islaam for this Ummah. Thus, from this angle, there is nothing in what the Messenger came with concerning this celebration, and therefore it cannot be part of the religion which Allaah perfected for us and ordered us to adhere to by following the Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then if we turn to the <i> Sunnah</i> of the Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> we do not find in it that he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> celebrated his own birthday, nor ordered its celebration, nor do we find any of the Companions <i> radiallaahu &#8216;anhum</i> celebrating it! Therefore, it will be absolutely clear to anyone who has the slightest insight and is desirous of truth and justice, that the practice of celebrating the <i> Milaadun-Nabee</i> (the birthday of the Prophet) is not part of t he religion, rather it is a <i> bid&#8217;ah</i> (innovation) which we have been warned against and ordered to abandon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also a form of blind imitation of the Jews and Christians in their festivals. Therefore, the sensible person should not be deceived by the large number of people, from the various lands, who practice this, since the truth is not known by mere numbers, but the truth is known by the <i> Sharee&#8217;ah</i> proofs. Allaah &#8211; the Most High said concerning the Jews and the Christians:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And they say: None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian! These are their own desires. Say to them: Bring your proof if you are indeed truthful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:111].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And if you were to obey most of those on earth, they would mislead you far away from Allaah&#8217;s path.&#8221; </b>[Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:116].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most of these <i>milaad</i> celebrations &#8211; as well as being an innovation &#8211; involve other types of evils as well; such as the free-mixing between men and women, singing and playing musical instruments, and the drinking and smoking of intoxicants. There are in such celebrations, something which is worse than all this, and it is the greater form of shirk (associating partners in the worship of Allaah), through exaggerating about Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, or the dead awliyaa (pious servants of Allaah), by supplicating to them, seeking their aid and help, or by believing that they have the knowledge of the <i> ghayb</i> (hidden Unseen), and other such matters of <i>kufr</i> (disbelief). Whereas it is authentically related from Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> that he said: <i> &#8220;Beware of ghuloo (exaggeration) in the religion. For indeed those who came before you were destroyed due to their exaggerating in the religion.&#8221;</i> 8 And he <i>&#8216;alayhis-salaatu was-salaam</i> also said:<i> &#8220;Do not over-elevate me as the Christians over-elevated Jesus, Son of Mary, but rather I am just a slave of Allaah. So call me the slave of Allaah and His Messenger.&#8221;</i> 9</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the strangest matters is that a great number of people who actively participate in this innovated celebration, and who defend it vigorously, do not take care of fulfilling those matters which Allaah has made obligatory upon them, such as praying the five daily Prayers, and this does not even bother many of them at all. Indeed many of them do not even think that they are committing a great sin! There is no doubt that this is due to their weak <i> eemaan</i> (faith) and their short sightedness and the Fact that their hearts are covered with the filth of sins and disobedience. We ask Allaah to protect and forgive us and all of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the strangest matters also is that some of them believe that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> is actually present at their <i> milaad</i> celebrations, so consequently the participants stand to greet and welcome him. However, this is from the greatest of lies and the worst form of ignorance, because the Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> shall neither come out of his grave before the Day of Judgement, nor will he meet anyone, nor attend their gatherings. Rather, he shall remain in his grave until the Day of Judgement, whilst his noble <i>rooh</i> (soul) resides in the highest of places with his Lord in the home of the exalted, as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Then you shall surely die, then you shall be raised-up again on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Mu&#8217;minoon 23:15-16].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said: &#8220;I will be the leader of the children of Aadam on the Day of Resurrection, and I will be the first for whom the earth will split open, and will be the first to intercede and the first whose intercession will be accepted.&#8221; 10</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this noble <i> aayah</i> (verse) and this noble <i> hadeeth</i> &#8211; and those verses and <i> ahaadeeth</i> with a similar meaning &#8211; prove that the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and others that have also died, will only come out of their graves on the Day of Resurrection. And this is a matter about which there is an agreement amongst the Muslim Scholars, there being no difference between them. So it is a must upon every Muslim, to carefully consider these matters and to beware of those innovations and deviations that have been introduced by the ignorant ones and their like, for which Allaah has not sent down any authority. It is Allaah&#8217;s help that is sought, and He alone is relied upon, and there is no might, nor any power, except with Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for sending the <i> salaah</i> and the <i> salaam</i> (invoking praises and blessings of peace) upon Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, then this is from one of the best ways of drawing closer to Allaah and from those actions which are righteous. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed Allaah sends His <i>salaah</i> upon the Prophet (i.e. Allaah praises the Prophet to the angels), as do the angels (by supplicating for forgiveness for him) O you who Believe! Send your <i> salaah</i> upon him and invoke the best <i> salaam</i> (blessings of peace) for him.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:56].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said</i>: &#8220;Whosoever sends a single blessing upon me, then Allaah will send upon him ten blessings.&#8221; 11 So this is prescribed at all times, particularly at the end of every Prayer. Rather, a group from the people of Knowledge actually consider it obligatory in the final sitting of every Prayer, and consider it highly recommended at other times, such as after the <i> adhaan</i> (call to Prayer), and after mentioning the Prophet, <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s</i> name, and also on the day of <i>Jumu&#8217;ah</i> (Friday), as is proven by the various authentic narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah help us and all the Muslims to attain a sound understanding of the religion, and that He favours us all by causing us to cling to the <i> Sunnah</i> and causing us to beware of <i>bid&#8217;ah</i> (innovations in the religion). Indeed He is the Most Generous, the Most Kind. And may the <i>salaah</i> and <i> salaam</i> (Allaah&#8217;s praises and blessings of peace) be upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his Family, his Companions and his followers.</p>

But be upon the Straight Path and upon the Sunnah of your Prophet sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam and that which his Companions were upon and beware of these innovations because they cause hatred and enmity amongst you. But stick to the original state of affairs which was there before they divided.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/translations/al-istiqaamah/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Al-Istiqaamah</strong></a> Issue No.3 &#8211; Rabî&#8217;ul-Awwal 1417H / August 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>THE YEAR OF HIS NOBLE BIRTH</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to the most correct opinion of the Scholars, the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was born in the city of Makkah in the year of the Elephant (in the year 570 or 571CE), in the month of Rabee&#8217;ul-Awwal. [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>THE DAY OF HIS NOBLE BIRTH</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is an agreement amongst the Scholars that the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was born on a Monday, since he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was asked about fasting on a Monday, and he said: <i>&#8220;On that day I was born and on that day Revelation descended upon me.&#8221; </i>[2] However, as regards the exact date of his birth, then the Scholars have differed about this, although the majority of Scholars say that he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was born on the 12th of Rabee&#8217;ul-Awwal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam an-Nawawee (d.676H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i>&#8211; said: &#8220;There is on agreement that he was born on Monday in the month of Rabee&#8217;ul-Awwal. There is a difference of opinion whether this day was the 2nd, 8th, 10th or 12th day of the month &#8211; and these ore the four most well-known opinions concerning this.&#8221; [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>EVENTS AT THE TIME OF HIS BIRTH</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Certain miraculous events are reported to have occurred at the time that the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was born. However, most of them are not authentically related, rather they are <i>da&#8217;eef</i> (week) or <i>mawdoo&#8217;</i> (fabricated) and therefore cannot be relied upon as decisive proof; such as the narration which relates that some of the galleries of Kisraa&#8217;s palace broke-up and collapsed, that the sacred-fire of the Magians died-out and that some of the churches on Lake Saawah collapsed and sank down.[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, it is authentically related that the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayi wa sallam</i> said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>I am a result of the supplication of my father Ibraaheem and the glad-tidings brought by &#8216;Eesaa <i>&#8216;alayhimus salaam</i>. And my mother &#8211; when she bore me &#8211; saw that a light shone out from her, which lit up the palaces in Syria &#8230;</strong> &#8221; [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>CELEBRATING THE DAY OF HIS NOBLE BIRTH</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Faakihaanee (d.734H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> -said: [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Celebrating his birthday has no basis in the Book nor the Sunnah, nor is this action recorded from any one of the Scholars of this Ummah; those who are taken as examples to be followed and who cling to the narrations. Rather it is a <em>bid&#8217;ah</em> (innovotion), which was introduced by the (deviated) <em>Battaaloon</em> sect.[7]&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards to the origins of this newly-invented celebration, then some of the research Scholars have stated that the first person to innovate this practice was &#8216;Umar ibn Muhammad al-Mulaa in the city of Mawsil in Iraaq, during the fourth century, as is mentioned by the Imaam Abu Shaamah (d.665H).[8] He was followed in this by the likes of Abul-Khattaab &#8216;Umar ibn Dihyaa: &#8220;who was employed in the west, then traveled to Syria, then he traveled to the city of Irbil in &#8216;Iraaq, during the fourth century, where he found its king Mudhaffarud-Deen ibn Zaynud-Deen showing a keen interest in the milaad (birthday) of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. So he composed a book for him called <i>at-Tanweer fi Mawlidis-Siraajil-Muneer</i>; so he recited this to the king who then rewarded him with one thousand deenaars.&#8221; [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Maalik (d.179H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Whosoever introduces into Islaam an innovation, and holds it to be something good, has indeed alleged that Muhammad <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> has betrayed his message. Read the saying of Allaah &#8211; the Most Blessed, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you and I have chosen for you Islaam as your religion.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:3].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So that which was not part of the religion at that time, cannot be part of the religion today. And the last part of this Ummah cannot be rectified, except by that which rectified its first part.&#8221; [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, had the practice of celebrating <i>milaadun-Nabee</i> (the birthday of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) been something praiseworthy then: &#8220;the <i>Salaf</i> (the Pious Predecessors) &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with them all &#8211; would have instituted it. For they were the ones having a greater love and honour for Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and a greater zeal for doing good. Indeed, the most perfect expression of love and honour for him is by following him, obeying him, carrying out his commands, upholding and reviving his Sunnah (guidance and example) &#8211; both inwardly and outwardly &#8211; and in spreading his message and striving in this, with the heart, the hand and the tongue. Such was the path of the Companions and those who followed them in goodness (i.e. beliefs and actions).&#8221; [11]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ar-Raheeq al-Makhtoom</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Start of the Disease</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On Monday the twenty-ninth of Safar in the eleventh year of al-Hijra, he participated in funeral rites in al-Baqee&#8217;. On the way back he had a headache, his temperature rose so high that the heat effect could be felt over his headband. He led the Muslims in prayer for eleven days though he was sick. The total number of his sick days were either thirteen of fourteen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Last Week</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When his sickness grew severe he asked his wives: &#8220;Where shall I stay tomorrow?&#8221; &#8220;Where shall I stay?&#8221; They understood what he wanted. So they allowed him to stay wherever he wished. He moved to &#8216;Aishah&#8217;s room leaning &#8211; while he was walking &#8211; on al-Fadl bin al-&#8216;Abbas and &#8216;Alî bin Abî Tâlib. Head banded as he was, he dragged his feet till he came into her abode. It was there that he spent the last week of his life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During that period, &#8216;Aishah used to recite al-Mu&#8217;awwidhat (Chapters 113 and 114 of the Qur&#8217;ân) and other supplications which he has already taught her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Five days before death</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On Wednesday, five days before he died the Prophet&#8217;s temperature rose so high signalling the severness of his disease. He fainted and suffered from pain. &#8220;Pour out on me seven Qirab (water skin pots) of various water wells so that I may go out to meet people and talk to them.&#8221; So they seated him in a container (usually used for washing) and poured out water on him till he said: &#8220;That is enough. That is enough.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he felt well enough to enter the Mosque. He entered it band-headed, sat on the pulpit and made a speech to the people who were gathering together around him. He said: <em> &#8220;The curse of Allâh falls upon the Jews and Christians for they have made their Prophets’ tombs places of worship.&#8221;</em> [Sahîh al-Bukhârî, 1/62; Muatta&#8217; Imâm Malik, p.360] Then he said: &#8220;Do not make my tomb a worshipped idol.&#8221; [Muatta&#8217; Imâm Malik, p.65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he offered himself and invited the people to repay any injuries he might have inflicted on them, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;He whom I have ever lashed his back, I offer him my back so that he may avenge himself on me. He whom I have ever blasphemed his honour, here I am offering my honour so that he may avenge himself.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he descended, and performed the noon prayer. Again he returned to the pulpit and sat on it. He resumed his first speech about enmity and some other things. A man then said: &#8220;You owe me three Dirhams.&#8221; The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said: &#8220;Fadl, pay him the money.&#8221; He went on saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em> &#8220;I admonish you to be good to Al-Ansar (the Helpers). They are my family and with them I found shelter. They have acquitted themselves credibly of the responsibility that fell upon them and now there remains what you have to do. You should fully acknowledge and appreciate the favour that they have shown, and should overlook their faults.&#8221; </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another version: <em> &#8220;The number of believers would increase, but the number of Helpers would decrease to the extent that they would be among men as salt in the food. So he who from among you occupies a position of responsibility and is powerful enough to do harm or good to the people, he should frilly acknowledge and appreciate the favour that these benefactors have shown and overlook their faults.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And said: &#8220;Allâh, the Great, has given a slave of His the opportunity to make a choice between whatever he desires of Allâh’s provisions in this world, and what He keeps for him in the world, but he has opted for the latter.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abû Sa’id Al-Khudri said: &#8220;Upon hearing that, Abû Bakr cried and said: ‘We sacrifice our fathers and mothers for your sake.’ We wondered why Abû Bakr said such a thing. People said: ‘Look at that old man! The Messenger of Allâh says about a slave of Allâh who was granted the right between the best fortunes of this world and the bounty of Allâh in the Hereafter, but he says: We sacrifice our fathers and mothers for your sake!’ It was later on that we realized what he had aimed at. The Messenger of Allâh was the slave informed to choose. We also acknowledged that Abû Bakr was the most learned among us.&#8221; [Mishkat Al-Masabih, 2/546]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Messenger of Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em> &#8220;The fellow I feel most secure in his company is Abû Bakr. If I were to make friendship with any other one than Allah, I would have Abû Bakr a bosom friend of mine. For him I feel affection and brotherhood of Islam. No gate shall be kept open in the Mosque except that of Abû Bakr’s.&#8221;</em> [Sahîh al-Bukhârî, 1/22,429,449, 2/638; Misbkat Al-Masabih, 2/548]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Four days before his death</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On Thursday, four days before the death of the Messenger of Allâh he said to people — though he was suffering from a severe pain:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Come here. I will cause you to write something so that you will never fall into error.&#8221; Upon this ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab said: &#8220;The Prophet of Allâh is suffering from acute pain and you have the Qur’an with you; the Book of Allâh is sufficient unto you.&#8221; Others however wanted the writing to be made. When Muhammad heard them debating over it, he ordered them to go away and leave him alone. [Sahîh al-Bukhârî, 2/637]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That day he recommended three things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Jews, Christians and polytheists should be expelled out of Arabia .<br />
2. He recommended that delegations should be honoured and entertained, in a way similar to the one he used to do.<br />
3. As for the third — the narrator said that he had forgotten it. It could have been adherence to the Holy Book and the Sunnah. It was likely to be the accomplishment and the mobilization of Osamah’s army, or it could have been performance of prayers and being attentive to slaves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In spite of the strain of disease and suffering from pain, the Prophet used to lead all the prayers till that Thursday — four days before he died. On that day he led the sunset prayer and recited:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;By the winds (or angels or the Messengers of Allah) sent forth one after another.&#8221;</strong> [77:1] [Misbkat Al-Masabih, 1/102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the evening he grew so sick that he could not overcome the strain of disease or go out to enter the Mosque. ‘Aishah said: The Prophet asked: &#8220;Have the people performed the prayer?&#8221; &#8220;No. They haven’t. They are waiting for you.&#8221; &#8220;Put some water in the washing pot.&#8221; Said he. We did what he ordered. So he washed and wanted to stand up, but he fainted. When he came round he asked again &#8220;Have the people prayed?&#8221; Then the sequence of events took place again and again for the second and the third times from the time he washed to the time he fainted after his attempts to stand up. Therefore he sent to Abû Bakr to lead the prayer himself. Abû Bakr then led the prayer during those days [Sahîh al-Bukhârî, 1/99]. They were seventeen prayers in the lifetime of Muhammad sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Three or four times ‘Aishah talked to the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam to exempt Abû Bakr from leadership in prayer lest people should despair of him, but he refused and said: <em> &#8220;You (women) are like the women who tried to entice Joseph (Yusuf) into immorality. Convey my request to Abû Bakr to lead the prayer.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> A Day or Two prior to Death</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On Saturday or on Sunday, the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam felt that he was well enough to perform the prayer; so he went out leaning on two men in order to perform the noon prayer. Abû Bakr, who was then about to lead the prayer withdrew when he saw him coming; but the Prophet made him a gesture to stay where he was and said: &#8220;Seat me next to him.&#8221; They seated him on the left hand side of Abû Bakr. The Prophet led the prayer, and Abû Bakr followed him and raised his voice at every &#8216;Allâhu Akbar&#8217; (i.e. Allâh is the Greatest) the Prophet said, so that the people may hear clearly. [Sahîh al-Bukhârî 1/98,99]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> A Day before his Death</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On Sunday, a day before he died, the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam set his slaves free, paid as a charity the seven Dinars he owned and gave his weapons as a present to the Muslims. So when night fell ‘Aishah had to borrow some oil from her neighbour to light her oil-lantern. Even his armour was mortgaged as a security with a Jew for thirty Sa’ (a cubic measure) of barley.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Last Day Alive</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In a narration by Anas bin Malik, he said: &#8220;While the Muslims were performing the dawn prayer on Monday — led by Abû Bakr, they were surprised to see the Messenger of Allâh raising the curtain of ‘Aishah’s room. He looked at them while they were praying aligned properly and smiled cheerfully. Seeing him, Abû Bakr withdrew to join the lines and give way to him to lead the prayer. For he thought that the Prophet wanted to go out and pray.&#8221; Anas said: &#8220;The Muslims, who were praying, were so delighted that they were almost too enraptured at their prayers. The Messenger of Allâh made them a gesture to continue their prayer, went into the room and drew down the curtain.&#8221; [ibid. 21640]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allâh sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam did not live for the next prayer time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When it was daytime, the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam called Fatimah and told her something in a secret voice that made her cry. Then he whispered to her something else which made her laugh. ‘Aishah enquired from her after the Prophet’s death, as to this weeping and laughing to which Fatimah replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The first time he disclosed to me that he would not recover from his illness and I wept. Then he told me that I would be the first of his family to join him, so I laughed.&#8221; [Sahîh al-Bukhârî, 2/638]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He gave Fatimah glad tidings that she would become the lady of all women of the world [Rahmat-ul-lil’alameen, 1/282]. Fatimah witnessed the great pain that afflicted her father. So she said: &#8220;What great pain my father is in!&#8221;. To these words, the Prophet remarked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em> &#8220;He will not suffer any more when today is over.&#8221;</em> [Sahîh al-Bukhârî, 2/641]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He asked that Al-Hasan and Al-Husain be brought to him. He kissed them and recommended that they be looked after. He asked to see his wives. They were brought to him. He preached them and told them to remember Allah. Pain grew so much severe that the trace of poison he had at Khaibar came to light. It was so sore that he said to ‘Aishah: <em> &#8220;I still feel the painful effect of that food I tasted at Khaibar. I feel as if death is approaching.&#8221;</em> [ibid, 2/637] He ordered the people to perform the prayers and be attentive to slaves. He repeated it several times. [ibid. 2/637]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam breathes his last</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the pangs of death started, ‘Aishah leant him against her. She used to say: One of Allah’s bounties upon me is that the Messenger of Allâh died in my house, while I am still alive. He died between my chest and neck while he was leaning against me. Allâh has mixed his saliva with mine at his death. For ‘Abdur Rahman &#8211; the son of Abû Bakr &#8211; came in with a Siwak (i.e. the root of a desert plant used for brushing teeth) in his hand, while I was leaning the Messenger of Allâh against me. I noticed that he was looking at the Siwak, so I asked him &#8211; for I knew that he wanted it — &#8220;Would you like me to take it for you?&#8221; He nodded in agreement. I took it and gave it to him. As it was too hard for him, I asked him &#8220;Shall I soften it for you?&#8221; He nodded in agreement. So I softened it with my saliva and he passed it (on his teeth).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another version it is said: &#8220;So he brushed (Istanna) his teeth as nice as he could.&#8221; There was a water container (Rakwa) available at his hand with some water in. He put his hand in it and wiped his face with it and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em> &#8220;There is no god but Allah. Death is full of agonies.&#8221;</em> [Sahîh al-Bukhârî, 2/640]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As soon as he had finished his Siwak, brushing, he raised his hand or finger up, looked upwards to the ceiling and moved his lips. So ‘Aishah listened to him. She heard him say: &#8220;With those on whom You have bestowed Your Grace with the Prophets and the Truthful ones (As-Siddeeqeen), the martyrs and the good doers. O Allâh, forgive me and have mercy upon me and join me to the Companionship on high.&#8221; [ibid, 2/638-641] Then at intervals he uttered these words: &#8220;The most exalted Companionship on high. To Allâh we turn and to Him we turn back for help and last abode.&#8221; This event took place at high morning time on Monday, the twelfth of Rabi’ al-Awwal, in the eleventh year of Al-Hijrah. He was sixty-three years and four days old when he died.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Companions’ concern over the Prophet’s Death</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great (loss) news was soon known by everybody in Madinah. Dark grief spread on all areas and hoirizons of Madinah. Anas said: &#8220;I have never witnessed a day better or brighter than that day on which the Messenger of Allâh sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam came to us; and I have never witnessed a more awful or darker day than that one on which the Messenger of Allâh died on.&#8221; [Mishkat-ul-Masabih, 2/547]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he died, Fatimah said: &#8220;O Father, whom his Lord responded to his supplication! O Father, whose abode is Paradise . O Father, whom I announce his death to Gabriel.&#8221; [Sahîh al-Bukhârî, 2/641]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em> ‘Umar’s Attitude</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Umar, who was so stunned that he almost lost consciousness and stood before people addressing them: &#8220;Some of the hypocrites claim that the Messenger of Allâh sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam died. The Messenger of Allâh did not die, but went to his Lord in the same way as Moses bin ‘Imran did. He stayed away for forty nights, but finally came back though they said he had been dead. By Allah, the Messenger of Allâh will come back and he will cut of the hands and legs of those who claim his death.&#8221; [Ibn Hisham, 2/655]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em> Abû Bakr’s Attitude</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abû Bakr left his house at As-Sunh and came forth to the Mosque on a mare-back. At the Mosque, he dismounted and entered. He talked to nobody but went on till he entered ‘Aishah’s abode, and went directly to where the Messenger of Allâh sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam was. The Prophet was covered with a Yemeni mantle. He uncovered his face and tended down, kissed him and cried. Then he said: &#8220;I sacrifice my father and mother for your sake. Allah, verily, will not cause you to die twice. You have just experienced the death that Allâh had ordained.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he went out and found ‘Umar talking to people. He said: &#8220;‘Umar, be seated.&#8221; ‘Umar refused to do so. People parted ‘Umar and came towards Abû Bakr, who started a speech saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And now, he who worships Muhammad sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, Muhammad is dead now. But he who worships Allah, He is Ever Living and He never dies. Allâh says: <em><strong> ‘Muhammad sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam is no more than a Messenger, and indeed (many) Messengers have passed away before him. If he dies or is killed, will you then turn back on your heels (as disbelievers)? And he who turns back on his heels, not the least harm will he do to Allâh, and Allâh will give reward to those who are grateful.’</strong> &#8221; [3:144] </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Abbas said: &#8220;By Allâh it sounded as if people had never heard such a Qur’aanic verse till Abû Bakr recited it as a reminder. So people started reciting it till there was no man who did not recite it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Al-Musaiyab said that ‘Umar had said: &#8220;By Allâh as soon as I heard Abû Bakr say it, I fell down to the ground. I felt as if my legs had been unable to carry me so I collapsed when I heard him say it. Only then did I realize that Muhammad sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam had really died.&#8221; [Sahîh al-Bukhârî, 2/640,641]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Burial and Farewell Preparations to his Honourable Body</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dispute about who would succeed him broke out even before having the Messenger of Allah’s body prepared for burial. Lots of arguments, discussions, dialogues took place between the Helpers and Emigrants in the roofed passage (portico) of Barn Sa’ida. Finally they acknowledged Abû Bakr (RA) as a caliph. They spent the whole Monday there till it was night. People were so busy with their arguments that it was late night — just about dawn of Tuesday — yet his blessed body was still lying on his bed covered with an inked-garment. He was locked in the room.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On Tuesday, his body was washed with his clothes on. He was washed by Al-’Abbas, &#8216;Alî, Al-Fadl and Qathm — the two sons of Al-’Abbas, as well as Shaqran — the Messenger’s freed slave, Osamah bin Zaid and Aws bin Khauli. Al-’Abbas, Al-Fadi and Qathm turned his body round, whereas Osamah and Shaqran poured out water. &#8216;Alî washed him and Aws leant him against his chest.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They shrouded him in three white Sahooli cotton cloth which had neither a headcloth [Sahîh al-Bukhârî, 1/169, Sahîh Muslim, 1/306] nor a casing and inserted him in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A sort of disagreement arose with regard to a burial place. Abû Bakr said: &#8220;I heard the Messenger of Allâh say:<em> ‘A dead Prophet is buried where he dies.’</em>&#8221; So Abû Talhah lifted the bed on which he died, dug underneath and cut the ground to make the tomb.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People entered the room ten by ten. They prayed for the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam. The first to pray for him were people of his clan. Then the Emigrants, then the Helpers. Women prayed for him after men. The young were the last to pray.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This process took Tuesday long and Wednesday night (i.e. the night which precedes Wednesday morning). ‘Aishah said: &#8220;We did not know that the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam was being buried till we heard the sound of tools digging the ground at the depth of Wednesday night.&#8221; [Mukhtasar Seerat Ar-Rasool, p.471; Ibn Hisham, 2/649-665; Talqeeh Fuhoom Ahl M-Athar, p. 38, 39; Rahmat-ul-lil&#8217;alameen 1/277-286]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation of the Meanings of the Names of the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) &#8211; Taken from &#8216;Zaad al-Ma`aad&#8217; (1/88-97) of ibn al-Qayyim, rahimahullaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillaahir-Rahmaanir-Raheem</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) has been called by many names and titles in the Qur`aan and Sunnah, each one of them describing a special quality of this exalted personality. And in understanding them and reflecting upon them, we can, by the permission of Allaah, increase in our love and following of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam). This discussion is taken from &#8216;Zaad al-Ma`aad&#8217; (1/88-97) of ibn al-Qayyim, rahimahullaah, summarised.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The names of the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) are of two types:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Those names that are specific to him and none of the Messengers before him had these names, like Muhammad, Ahmad, al-Aaqib, al-Haashir, al-Muqaffee, Nabi al-Malhama.</li>
<li>Those names and qualities that are not specific to him, and were shared by the Messengers before him, but are found in him in the most complete and perfect forms. Like: Messenger of Allaah, His Prophet, His Servant, Prophet of Mercy etc.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What follows is an explanation of some of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Muhammad</strong>: is a passive participle, whosoever is praised, possessing many praiseworthy qualities then he is muhammad. And Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) is praised more than any other person, and this is why &#8211; and Allaah knows best &#8211; he was called by this name in the Torah, due to the many praiseworthy qualities which he, his religion, and his nation possess such that even Moses wished that he would be from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ahmad</strong>: Derived, as is Muhammad, from the noun hamd (praise). A group of scholars said that it is a passive participle, meaning: his praising of Allaah is more than any other person&#8217;s praise of him, and therefore he is the most deserving of being praised and the first. So in meaning Ahmad is similar to Muhammad except that the distinction is that he is Muhammad due to his possessing many praiseworthy qualities, and he is Ahmad due to his being praised in a more excellent way than the praise of any other. And this is the most complete meaning of this word, and the most extensive in commending him (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also these two names stem from his character, and the praiseworthy qualities specific to him, and it is because of these that he is called Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and Ahmad. And he is the one who is praised by the People of the Heaven, the People of the earth, the People of the world and the People of the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Mutawakkil</strong>: (The One who puts his trust in Allaah). In the Saheeh of Bukhaaree from the hadeeth of Abdullaah bin Umru who said, &#8220;I read the description of the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) in the Torah: Muhammad is Messenger of Allaah, My servant and Messenger, I have called him al-Mutawakkil. He is neither rude nor harsh and he does not shout in the markets, and he does not return an evil for an evil, rather he overlooks and forgives. And I will not make him to die until I make firm the nation through him, causing them to say: there is none worthy of worship except Allaah.&#8221; {1}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) is the most deserving of this name, because the trust he put in Allaah to establish the religion was a trust unequalled by any other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Maahee</strong>: (the destroyer/effacer). This has been explained in the hadeeth of Jubair bin Mut`am: &#8220;al-Maahee: the one through whom Allaah destroys and effaces unbelief.&#8221; {2}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Disbelief was not destroyed and removed by any single person as completely as was done by the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam). For indeed he was sent, and all of the inhabitants of the earth were in disbelief, except for some remnants of the People of the Book. Consisting of the worshippers of idols, the Jews who had the Anger of Allaah on them, the Christians who had been misguided, the atheist Saabi`een, the worshippers of the stars and the fire, and the philosophers who did not acknowledge the laws of the Prophets. And Allaah effaced them all through His Messenger until He established His religion and made it supreme over all others, and made it spread to the extent that the night and day spreads, and made his call as the rays of the sun in the various lands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Haashir</strong>: (the Gatherer). He is the one who gathered and united the people at his feet, and therefore it was as if he had been sent for this purpose.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Aaqib</strong>: (The Last). He is the one who came at the end of the line of Prophets, and there is no prophet after him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Muqaffee</strong>: (). He is the one who was sent with the characteristics of the Messengers that had preceded him, and was their seal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Nabi at-Tawba</strong>: (the Prophet of Repentance). It was by him that Allaah opened the door of repentance for the inhabitants of the earth [by them accepting his message], and Allaah forgave them with a forgiveness that was not given to the people before him. {3}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) was the one who sought forgiveness from Allaah the most, to the extent that he would say, &#8220;My Lord forgive me and turn toward me, You are The Oft-Forgiving, The Oft-Returning&#8221; {4}, 100 times in a single sitting. And he used to say, &#8220;O people repent to Allaah, your Lord, for indeed I repent to Allaah 100 times in a day&#8221;. {5}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise the repentance of his (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) nation is more complete than the repentance of all the other nations, the most quickest in being answered, and the easiest to be obtained. For the repentance of the previous nations was of the most difficult matters, to the extent that the repentance for the worshippers of the cow amongst the People of Israa`eel was to kill those worshippers. {6} But as for this nation, then from the Kindness of Allaah to it is that he has made repentance dependant upon sorrow and abstaining (from the sin in question).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Nabi al-Malhama</strong>: (The Prophet of Slaughter). He was the one who was sent with Jihaad to the enemies of Allaah, and no prophet before him did Jihaad to the extent that the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and his nation fought Jihaad. And the like of the large wars that took place between him and the disbelievers were not seen before him. For his nation fought the disbelievers in lands to the ends of the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Nabi ar-Rahma</strong>: (The Prophet of Mercy). He was the one whom Allaah sent as a Mercy for the universe. And Allaah was Merciful to all the people of the earth through him, both the believers and the disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Faatih</strong>: (the opener/conqueror). It was through him that Allaah opened the door of guidance after it had been closed, and opened closed eyes and deaf ears and sealed hearts. And through him Allaah conquered the lands of the disbelievers, and opened the doors of Paradise, and opened through him the ways of acquiring beneficial knowledge and righteous actions. And He opened through him both the doors of this world and the hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Ameen</strong>: (the Trustworthy). He is the most deserving out of all creation for this name. For he is the trustee of Allaah of His revelation and religion. And he is the trusted one in the Heaven and in the earth. And this is why he was called al-Ameen before his Prophethood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Basheer</strong>: (the Bearer of glad tidings). He is the bearer of glad tidings for the one who obeys him of reward, and he is the Warner (an-Nadheer) of the one who disobeys him of punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah called him his <strong>servant (Abd)</strong> in many places in His Book for example, &#8216;Blessed be He who revealed the Furqaan to His servant&#8217;. {7}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is established that he (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;I am the <strong>Master (sayyid) of the children of Aadam</strong> [on the Day of Judgement] and I am not being arrogant.&#8221; {8}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah called him an <strong>Illuminating Lamp (Siraaj Muneer)</strong>. And all praise is due to Allaah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from the “The Sealed Nectar” book</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 1. Khadijah Bint Khuwailid:</strong> In Makkah — prior to Hijra — the Prophet’s household comprised him (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) and his wife Khadijah bint Khuwailid. He was twenty-five and she was forty when they got married. She was the first woman he married. She was the only wife he had till she died. He had sons and daughters with her. None of their sons lived long. They all died. Their daughters were Zainab, Ruqaiya, Umm Kulthum and Fatimah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zainab was married to her maternal cousin Abu Al-‘As bin Al-Rabi‘ and that was before Al-Hijra. Ruqaiya and Umm Kulthum were both married to ‘Uthman bin ‘Affan &#8211; may Allah be pleased with him &#8211; successively (i.e. he married one after the death of her sister). Fatimah was married to ‘Ali bin Abi Talib; and that was in the period between Badr and Uhud battles. The sons and daughters that Fatimah and ‘Ali had were Al-Hasan, Al-Husain, Zainab and Umm Kulthum.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is well-known that the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) was exceptionally authorized to have more than four wives for various reasons. The wives he married were thirteen. Nine of them outlived him. Two died in his lifetime: Khadijah and the Mother of the poor (<em>Umm Al-Masakeen</em>) — Zainab bint Khuzaima, besides two others with whom he did not consummate his marriage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2. Sawdah bint Zam‘a:</strong> He married her in Shawwal, in the tenth year of Prophethood, a few days after the death of Khadijah. Prior to that, she was married to a paternal cousin of hers called As-Sakran bin ‘Amr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 3. ‘Aishah bint Abu Bakr:</strong> He married her in the eleventh year of Prophethood, a year after his marriage to Sawdah, and two years and five months before Al-Hijra. She was six years old when he married her. However, he did not consummate the marriage with her till Shawwal seven months after Al-Hijra, and that was in Madinah. She was nine then. She was the only virgin he married, and the most beloved creature to him. As a woman she was the most learnèd woman in jurisprudence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 4. Hafsah bint ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab:</strong> She was <em>Aiyim</em> (i.e. husbandless). Her ex-husband was Khunais bin Hudhafa As-Sahmi in the period between Badr and Uhud battles. The Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) married her in the third year of Al-Hijra.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 5. Zainab bint Khuzaimah:</strong> She was from Bani Hilal bin ‘Amir bin Sa‘sa‘a. Was nicknamed <em>Umm Al-Masakeen</em>, because of her kindness and care towards them. She used to be the wife of ‘Abdullah bin Jahsh, who was martyred at Uhud, was married to the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) in the fourth year of Al-Hijra, but she died two or three months after her marriage to the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 6. Umm Salamah Hind bint Abi Omaiyah:</strong> She used to be the wife of Abu Salamah, who died in Jumada Al-Akhir, in the fourth year of Al-Hijra. The Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) married her in Shawwal of the same year.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 7. Zainab bint Jahsh bin Riyab:</strong> She was from Bani Asad bin Khuzaimah and was the Messenger’s paternal cousin. She was married to Zaid bin Haritha — who was then considered son of the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) . However, Zaid divorced her. Allâh sent down some Qur’ânic verses with this respect:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;So when Zaid had accomplished his desire from her (i.e., divorced her), We gave her to you in marriage.&#8221; [33:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">About her, Allâh has sent down some verses of <em>Al-Ahzab</em> Chapter that discussed the adoption of children in detail — anyway we will discuss this later. The Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) married her in Dhul-Qa‘dah, the fifth year of Al-Hijra.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>8. Juwairiyah bint Al-Harith: </strong> Al-Harith was the head of Bani Al-Mustaliq of Khuza‘ah. Juwairiyah was among the booty that fell to the Muslims from Bani Al-Mustaliq. She was a portion of Thabit bin Qais bin Shammas’ share. He made her a covenant to set her free at a certain time. The Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) accomplished the covenant and married her in Sha‘ban in the sixth year of Al-Hijra.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 9. Umm Habibah:</strong> Ramlah, the daughter of Abu Sufyan. She was married to ‘Ubaidullah bin Jahsh. She migrated with him to Abyssinia ( Ethiopia). When ‘Ubaidullah apostatized and became a Christian, she stoodfast to her religion and refused to convert. However ‘Ubaidullah died there in Abyssinia ( Ethiopia). The Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) dispatched ‘Amr bin Omaiyah Ad-Damri with a letter to Negus, the king, asking him for Umm Habibah’s hand — that was in Muharram, in the seventh year of Al-Hijra. Negus agreed and sent her to the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) in the company of Sharhabeel bin Hasnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 10. Safiyah bint Huyai bin Akhtab:</strong> From the Children of Israel, she was among the booty taken at Khaibar battle. The Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) took her for himself. He set her free and married her after that conquest in the seventh year of Al-Hijra.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 11. Maimunah bint Al-Harith:</strong> The daughter of Al-Harith, and the sister of Umm Al-Fadl Lubabah bint Al-Harith. The Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) married her after the Compensatory <em>‘Umrah</em> (Lesser Pilgrimage). That was in Dhul-Qa‘dah in the seventh year of Al-Hijra.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those were the eleven women that the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) had married and consummated marriage with them. He outlived two of them — Khadijah and Zainab, the <em>Umm Al-Masakeen.</em> Whereas the other nine wives outlived him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The two wives that he did not consummate marriage with were, one from Bani Kilab and the other from Kindah and this was the one called Al-Jauniyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Besides these, he had two concubines. The first was Mariyah, the Coptic (an Egyptian Christian), a present gift from Al-Muqauqis, vicegerent of Egypt — she gave birth to his son Ibrâhim, who died in Madinah while still a little child, on the28 th or29 th of Shawwal in the year 10A.H., i.e.27 th January, 632 A.D. The second one was Raihanah bint Zaid An-Nadriyah or Quraziyah, a captive from Bani Quraiza. Some people say she was one of his wives. However, Ibn Al-Qaiyim gives more weight to the first version. Abu ‘Ubaidah spoke of two more concubines, Jameelah, a captive, and another one, a bondwoman granted to him by Zainab bint Jahsh.[]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whosoever meditates on the life of the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) , will conceive that his marriage to this great number of women in the late years of his lifetime, after he had almost spent thirty years of his best days of youth sufficing himself to one old wife — Khadijah and later on to Sawdah, was in no way an overwhelming lustful desire to be satisfied through such a number of wives. These marriages were in fact motivated by aims and purposes much more glorious and greater than what normal marriages usually aim at.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tendency of the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) towards establishing a relationship by marriage with both Abu Bakr and ‘Umar and his marriage to ‘Aishah and Hafsah — and getting his daughter Fatimah married to ‘Ali bin Abi Talib, and the marriage of his two daughters, Ruqaiyah and Umm Kulthum to ‘Uthman — indicate clearly that he aimed at confirming the relationship among the four men — whose sacrifices and great achievements in the cause of Islam are well-known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Besides this, there was that tradition of the Arabs to honour the in-law relations. For them a son or a daughter-in-law was a means by which they sought the consolidation of relationship and affection with various phratries. Hostility and fights against alliances and affinities would bring an unforgettable shame, disgrace and degradation to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By marrying the Mothers of believers, the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) wanted to demolish or break down the Arab tribes’ enmity to Islam and extinguish their intense hatred. Umm Salamah was from Bani Makhzum — the clan of Abu Jahl and Khalid bin Al-Waleed. Her marriage to the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) produced good results. Khalid’s deliberately undecisive attitude at Uhud — for instance — was due to the Messenger’s marriage to Umm Salamah. Khalid went even further than that, in a short time he willingly became a keen obedient Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the Messenger of Allâh’s marriage to Umm Habibah, Abu Sufyan, her father, did not encounter him with any sort of hostility. Similarly his marriage to Juwairiyah and Safiyah made the two tribes stop all sorts of provocation, aggression or hostility against Islam. Better still, Juwairiyah, herself, was one of the greatest sources of blessing to her own people. On the occasion of her marriage to the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) , his Companions set a hundred families of her people free. They said: &#8220;It is for their affinity with the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) .&#8221; No need to say what great good impression this gratitude had on everybody’s soul. One of the greatest motives of all is Allâh’s bidding his Prophet to educate and purify the souls of people who had known nothing whatsoever about courtesy, education and culture. He had to teach them to comply with the necessities of civilization and to contribute to the solidification and the establishment of a new Islamic society.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An essential fundamental rule of the Muslim society is to prohibit mixing of men and women. Providing direct education for women, though highly compelling, is impossible in the light of this Islamic norm. Therefore, the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) had to select some women of different ages and talents, and indoctrinate them systematically in order to educate she-bedouins and townswomen, old and young, and thus furnish them with the instruments of propagating the true faith. The Mothers of believers (i.e. wives of the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) ) were in such a convenient position that they could convey the state of the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) and his affairs to people (men and women). Being educated and taught the teachings and rules of Islam, his wives, especially those who outlived him, played a very important role in conveying Prophetic traditions <em>Ahadith</em> to the Muslims. ‘Aishah, for instance, related a large number of the Prophet’s deeds and statements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His marriage to his paternal cousin Zainab bint Jahsh was a peculiar case which aimed at eradicating a deeply rooted pre-Islamic tradition — i.e. the adoption of children. In <em>Al-Jahiliyah</em> the Arabs used to consider an adopted person exactly like a real son or daughter as far as rights and sanctities are concerned. That <em>Jahiliyah</em> tradition had been so deeply rooted in their hearts that it was not easy to remove or uproot it. This tradition in fact affronts the basic principles of Islam; especially those concerned with marriage, divorce and inheritance and some other cases, and brought about lots of corruptions and indecencies. Naturally Islam stands against such deeds, and attempts to remove them from the Islamic society.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For the eradication of this tradition, Allâh, the Exalted, bid His Messenger (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) to marry his cousin Zainab bint Jahsh, who was an ex-wife to Zaid. She was at variance with Zaid to an extent that he intended to divorce her — that was at the time when the Confederates (<em>Al-Ahzab</em>) were making an evil alliance against the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) and against the Muslims. The Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) feared that the hypocrites, the idolaters, and the Jews would make a propaganda out of it and try to influence some Muslims of weak hearts. That was why he urged Zaid not to divorce her, in order not to get involved into that trial.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Undoubtedly this hesitation and partiality were alien to the character of the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) . They did not apply to the power of determination and will with which he had been sent. Allâh, the Exalted, blamed him for that by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> &#8220;And (remember) when you said to him (Zaid bin Haritha may Allah be pleased with him &#8211; — the freed slave of the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) on whom Allâh has bestowed grace (by guiding him to Islam) and you (O Muhammad (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) too) have done favour (by manumitting him), ‘Keep your wife to yourself, and fear Allâh.’ But you did hide in yourself (i.e. what Allâh has already made known to you that He will give her to you in marriage) that which Allâh will make manifest, you did fear the people (i.e. Muhammad (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) married the divorced wife of his manumitted slave) whereas Allâh had a better right that you should fear him.&#8221; [33:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally Zaid divorced Zainab and the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) married her at the time he laid siege to Bani Quraiza. That was after she had finished her <em>Iddat</em> (i.e. period during which a widow or a divorcee may not remarry). Allâh Himself had already ordained it, and so gave him no other alternative. Allâh had even started the marriage Himself by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> &#8220;So when Zaid had accomplished his desire from her (i.e. divorced her), We gave her to you in marriage, so that (in future) there may be no difficulty to the believers in respect of (the marriage of) the wives of their adopted sons when the latter have no desire to keep them (i.e. they have divorced them).&#8221; [33:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that was in order to break down the tradition of child adoption in practice after He had done it in words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> &#8220;Call them (adopted sons) by (the names of) their fathers, that is more just near Allâh.&#8221; [33:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Muhammad ( saw) is not the father of any man among you, but he is the Messenger of Allâh, and the last (end) of the Prophets.&#8221; [33:40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Lots of deeply-rooted traditions cannot be uprooted or demolished or even adjusted by mere words. They must be matched and associated with the action of the advocate of the Message himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This could be perceived through the deeds practised by the Muslims at Al-Hudaibiyah <em>‘Umrah</em> (Lesser Pilgrimage) during which ‘Urwah bin Mas‘ud Al-Thaqafi saw certain Muslims tend to pick up any expectoration that fell down from the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) . He also saw them race to the water of his ablution and they almost quarrelled for it. There were others who competed to pledge allegiance to death and some others pledged not to flee from (the battlefield). Among those people, were eminent Companions like ‘Umar and Abu Bakr, who although dedicated all their lives to the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) and to the cause of Islam, but refused to carry out the Messenger’s ordres with respect to slaughtering sacrificial animals after the ratification of Al-Hudaibiyah Peace Treaty, the thing that perturbed and caused the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) to feel anxious. However, when Umm Salamah &#8211; may Allah be pleased with her &#8211; advised that he take the initiative and sacrifice his animals, his followers raced to follow his example; a clear evidence in support of the saying: Actions speak louder than words, in the process of exterminating a deeply-established tradition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hypocrites aroused a lot of suspicions and made a broad false propaganda against that marriage. Their acts and talks about that marriage had ill-effects on those Muslims whose Faith was still weak, particularly that Zainab was the fifth wife — and the Noble Qur’ân limited the number up to four only; Zaid was traditionally his son, and so a father marrying his son’s divorcee was a heinous sin in the eyes of the Arabians.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em> Al-AhzabSurah</em> was revealed to shed full light on the two issues, i.e. Islam does not recognize adoption of children, and the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) is given (by Allâh) more freedom as regards the number of wives he can hold than other Muslims in order to achieve noble and honourable purposes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the treatment of the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) to his wives was of honourable, noble, and superb nature. His wives were on tops in respect of honour, satisfaction, patience, modesty, and service (that is to say the performance of housework and marriage duties). Although the Messenger’s house-life was hard and unbearable, none of his wives complained. Anas said about the Prophet’s life: &#8220;According to my knowledge, the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) has never tasted a thin flattened loaf in all his lifetime, nor has he ever seen with his own eyes roasted mutton.&#8221;[]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Aishah said: &#8220;Over two months have elapsed — during which we have seen three crescents — and yet no fire has been kindled in the houses of the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) (i.e. they did not cook food).&#8221; &#8220;What did you eat to sustain yourselves?&#8221; ‘Urwah asked. She said &#8220;The two blacks: dates and water&#8221;[]. Lots of information about the hard life of the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) were told.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In spite of these hardships, straits and adversity of life in the house of the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam), none of his wives uttered a word of complaint worthy of reproach — but once. This exception was required by human instinctive inclinations. However, it was not so important and consequently it did not require the decree of a legislative rule. Allâh has given them an opportunity to choose between two things, as clearly stated in the following verses:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> &#8220;O Prophet (Muhammad (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam)! Say to your wives: ‘If you desire the life of this world, and its glitter, — then come! I will make a provision for you and set you free in a handsome manner (divorce). But if you desire Allâh and His Messenger, and the Home of the Hereafter, then verily, Allâh has prepared for <em>Al-Muhsinat</em> (good doers) amongst you an enormous reward.’&#8221; [33:28,29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They were so noble and honest that none of them preferred ‘the life of this world and its glitter’ to the abode in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Although they were many in number, nothing of the dispute occurrences that normally happen among co-wives, took place in their houses. Very few cases could be the only exception; but they were quite normal. Allâh reproached them for that, so they ceased to do such a thing. This incident is mentioned in <em>At-Tahreem</em> Chapter:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> &#8220;O Prophet! Why do you ban (for yourself) that which Allâh has made lawful to you …&#8221; [66:1] (to the end of the fifth verse).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Discussing polygamy — in my opinion — is not a necessity; since a person who is familiar with the Europeans, and indecent practices, sufferings, wickedness, their sorrows and distresses, the horrible crimes they commit in this respect as well as the trials, the disasters that they are involved in, and which emanate directly from their disregard of the principle of polygamy form a good reason (to justify the soundness of polygamy). The distorted picture of life in Europe with the ill-practices featuring it, could truthfully justify the existence and practice of polygamy. In this, there are Divine signs for all people possessed of lucid mind.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">By al-Haafidh Ibn Rajab al-Hanbalee<br />
Excerpt from the last chapter of Ibn Rajab&#8217;s famous book: al-Khushoo&#8217; fis-Salaat</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Al-Ibaanah Issue No.3</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillaahir-Rahmaanir-Raheem</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) chose the station of al-’uboodiyyah (slavery and servitude) over and above the station of kingship. Once &#8211; on the day of the conquest of Makkah &#8211; a man stood-up (out of reverence) for the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam), who, being shocked, said to him, “Do not trouble yourself! Indeed, I am not a king. Rather, I am merely the son of a Qurayshee woman who eats dry meat.” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has also been authentically reported from the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) that he said, “Do not over praise me as the Christians over-praised ’Eesaa, son of Maryam. Indeed, I am only a slave. So call me the Slave of Allaah and His Messenger.” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad (d.241H) &#8211; rahimahullaahu ta’aalaa &#8211; reports from Muhammad Ibn Fudayl, from ’Ammaarah, from Aboo Zur’ah who said: I do not know this except from Aboo Hurayrah &#8211; radiyallaahu ’anhu &#8211; who said: Jibreel was sitting with the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) looking towards the sky, when he saw an angel. So Jibreel &#8211; ’alayhis-salaam &#8211; said to him: Indeed, this angel has never descended before today. So when the angel had descended, he said: O Muhammad! I have been sent by your Lord (to inquire) whether He should make you a Prophet-King or a Slave-Messenger. [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in a mursal narration from Yahyaa Ibn Katheer &#8211; rahimahullaah that the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, “I eat as a slave eats, and I sit as a slave sits. Since indeed I am a slave.” [5] This has been related by Ibn Sa’d in at-Tabaqaat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also a narration related by Aboo Ma’dhr from al-Maqburee from ’Aa‘ishah &#8211; radiyallaahu ’anhaa &#8211; that the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, “An angel came to me and said: Allaah sends blessings upon you and says: If you wish you may be a Prophet-King or a Slave-Messenger. So Jibeel &#8211; ’alayhis-salaam &#8211; indicated to me that I should humble myself: So I said: A Prophet-Slave.” So ’Aa‘ishah said: So after that day, the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) never ate whilst reclining, saying, “I eat like a slave eats and I sit like a slave sits.” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the mursal narrations of az-Zuhree &#8211; rahimahullaahu ta’aalaa &#8211; who said: we were informed that an angel came to the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam), who had never come to him before. Accompanying him was Jibreel &#8211; ’alayhis-salaam. So the angel spoke, and Jibreel &#8211; ’alayhis-salaam &#8211; remained silent, so he said: Your Lord inquires whether you wish to be a king or a Prophet-Slave. So the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) looked towards Jibreel &#8211; ’alayhis-salaam &#8211; as if he was seeking his advice. So Jibreel indicated that he should be humble. So Allaah’s Messenger (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, “A Prophet-Slave.” Az-Zuhree said: So it is said that from that day onwards, the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) never ate whilst reclining, until he departed from this world. [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is related in the Musnad, or in the Sunan of at-Tirmidhee, from Aboo Hurayrah radiyallaahu ’anhu), from the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) who said, “My Lord &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; gave me the choice that the valley of Makkah be filled with gold, but I said: No! O Lord. However, grant food to me one day, and hunger the day after. So when I am hungry I humble myself before You and remember You, and when I am full, I am grateful to You.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the knowledgeable people have said: Whoever claims al-’uboodiyyah (slavery and servitude to Allaah), but desires still remain with him, then he is lying in his claim. Indeed, al-’uboodiyyah will only be true for the one who annihilates his desires and establishes the will of his Master, where his name is what He called him (i.e. ’ibaadur-Rahmaan: the Slaves of the Most Merciful).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Aboo Nu’aym &#8211; rahimahullaahu ta’aalaa &#8211; relates in the book: Asmaa‘us-Sabaabah, by way of Shaykh Aboo Sulaymaan ad-Daraanee (d.215H) &#8211; rahimahullaahu ta’aalaa &#8211; who related from ’Alqamah Ibnul-Haarith al-Azdee, from his father, from his grandfather who mentioned the saying of Luqmaan the wise when he said to his son, “I have gathered my wisdom for you in six sentences: Work for this world in proportion to how long you shall remain in it, and work for the Hereafter in proportion to how long you shall remain in it. Commit acts of sin in proportion to how much you can endure it. Act for Allaah in accordance to how much you are in need of Him. Commit acts of disobedience in accordance to how much you can endure the punishment. Do not ask except from the One who is in need of no one. And when you intend to commit a sin against Allaah, then do it in a place where He cannot see you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibraaheem al-Khawwaas &#8211; rahimahullaahu ta’aalaa – said, “The cure for the hearts is in five things: reciting the Qur‘aan with reflection and contemplation; emptying the stomach (i.e. frequent fasting); praying at night; humbling oneself in the early hours of the morning; and being in the company of the saaliheen (righteous).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibraaheem Ibn Adham (d.160H) &#8211; rahimahullaahu ta’aalaa &#8211; said in an admonition, when he was asked (by some people) about the saying of Allaah &#8211; the Most High -:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Call upon Me and I will respond to you.” [Soorah Ghaafir 40:60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(They said): We call upon Him, but He does not respond to us. So he said to them, “You know Allaah, yet you do not obey Him. You recite the Qur‘aan, but you do not act according to it. You know Shaytaan, but still agree with him. You claim to love Allaah’s Messenger (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam), yet you abandon his Sunnah. You claim to love Paradise, yet you do not work for it. You claim to fear the Fire, yet you do not stop sinning. You say: Indeed death is true, yet you have not prepared for it. You busy yourselves with the faults of others, but you do not look at your own faults. You eat the sustenance that Allaah provides for you, yet you are not grateful to Him. You bury your dead, but you have not heeded its lesson.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah to grant us the ability to please Him and to bestow upon us His mercy.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] He is the Imaam, the haafidh, the zaahid (abstainer from this world), the admonisher Abul-Faraj ’Abdur-Rahmaan Ibn Ahmad Rajab as-Salamee better known as Ibn Rajab al-Hanbalee. Ibn Fahd said about him, “The Imaam, the haafidh, the hujjah (proof), the knowledgeable Scholar, the dependable one. He was one of the Scholars who shunned the world, and one of the Imaams and worshippers. He was an instructive Scholar from the Scholars of Hadeeth &#8211; and an admonisher of the Muslims.” Ibn Fahd also said, “He &#8211; rahimahullaahu ta’aalaa &#8211; was a pious Imaam who shunned the world. Hearts inclined towards him with love, and the different sects accepted him. His sittings for advising the general people were of great benefit and used to open up the hearts.” As-Suyootee said about him, “The Imaam, the haafidh, the Scholar of Hadeeth, the admonisher ’Abdur-Rahmaan&#8230;” He learnt from some of the major Scholars of his time, such as Ibnul-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah, al-Haafidh al-’Iraaqee, Ibnun-Naqeeb and others. He authored many books in the field of tafseer, hadeeth, biography and history, raqaa‘iq (heart-affecting matters) and also in fiqh. He is enumerated as one of the great scholars of Fiqh of the Hanbalee madbhab &#8211; as is proven by his excellent book: al-Qawaa’idul-Kubraa fil-Furoo’ &#8211; about which Ibn Muflih said, “It is a proof about his complete knowledge of the madhhab.” And al-Haafidh Ibn Hajar also spoke with similar praises about the book. He &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; died in the year 795H.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;line-height:1.5em;">Source : </span>Sahih Bukhari</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A number of miracles were bestowed upon and performed by Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) to establish the proof of his prophethood. The greatest miracle bestowed upon him was the revelation of the Qur&#8217;an. The Qur&#8217;an is miraculous in a number of aspects: Its linguistic perfection and inimitability, its validation by recent historical, archaeological, and scientific discoveries, its prophecies and so on. Unlike the miracles of other prophets before him, the miracle of the Qur&#8217;an is eternal. Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) also provided us with a number of true prophecies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Below are accounts of the some of the other miracles of Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) . Before reading these, it helps to know something about the Science of Traditions (Arabic: <i>Ahadith</i>), an exacting and comprehensive system developed by early Muslim scholars to verify the chain of transmission of these accounts, as well as investigating the trustworthiness and capability of every narrator at every level of the chain. This thorough authentication process ensures that these accounts are real, validated narrations of the sayings, actions, and tacit approvals of the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Traditions mentioned below are all from Sahih al-Bukhari, the most authentic collection of ahadith.</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Splitting of the Moon</li>
<li>Food Multiplication</li>
<li>Water Multiplication</li>
<li>Supplication for Rain</li>
<li>Lights to guide Companions</li>
<li>Crying of the stem of the Date-palm Tree</li>
<li>Glorification of Allah by the Prophet&#8217;s meals</li>
<li>The explusion of a liar&#8217;s corpse by the Earth</li>
<li>The Speech of the Wolf</li>
<li>The Prophet&#8217;s Night Journey to Jerusalem and Ascent to the Heavens</li>
</ol>
<h4 style="text-align:justify;"><a><strong>Splitting</strong></a><strong> of the Moon </strong></h4>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder&#8221; </i>[Qur&#8217;an 54:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Volume 6, Book 60, Number 388:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The moon was cleft asunder while we were in the company of the Prophet, and it became two parts. The Prophet said, Witness, witness (this miracle).&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><a><strong>Food</strong></a><strong> Multiplication</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 780:</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My father had died in debt. So I came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;My father (died) leaving unpaid debts, and I have nothing except the yield of his date palms; and their yield for many years will not cover his debts. So please come with me, so that the creditors may not misbehave with me.&#8221; The Prophet went round one of the heaps of dates and invoked (Allah), and then did the same with another heap and sat on it and said, &#8220;Measure (for them).&#8221; He paid them their rights and what remained was as much as had been paid to them.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><a><strong>Water</strong></a><strong> Multiplication</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 779:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We used to consider miracles as Allah&#8217;s Blessings, but you people consider them to be a warning. Once we were with Allah&#8217;s Apostle on a journey, and we ran short of water. He said, &#8220;Bring the water remaining with you.&#8221; The people brought a utensil containing a little water. He placed his hand in it and said, &#8220;Come to the blessed water, and the Blessing is from Allah.&#8221; I saw the water flowing from among the fingers of Allah&#8217;s Apostle , and no doubt, we heard the meal glorifying Allah, when it was being eaten (by him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 777:</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were one-thousand-and-four-hundred persons on the day of Al-Hudaibiya (Treaty), and (at) Al-Hudaibiya (there) was a well. We drew out its water not leaving even a single drop. The Prophet sat at the edge of the well and asked for some water with which he rinsed his mouth and then he threw it out into the well. We stayed for a short while and then drew water from the well and quenched our thirst, and even our riding animals drank water to their satisfaction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Volume 1, Book 7, Number 340:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Imran:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once we were traveling with the Prophet and we carried on traveling till the last part of the night and then we (halted at a place) and slept (deeply). There is nothing sweeter than sleep for a traveler in the last part of the night. So it was only the heat of the sun that made us to wake up and the first to wake up was so and so, then so and so and then so and so (the narrator &#8216;Auf said that Abu Raja&#8217; had told him their names but he had forgotten them) and the fourth person to wake up was &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab. And whenever the Prophet used to sleep, nobody would wake him up till he himself used to get up as we did not know what was happening (being revealed) to him in his sleep. So, &#8216;Umar got up and saw the condition of the people, and he was a strict man, so he said, &#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8221; and raised his voice with <i>Takbir</i>, and kept on saying it loudly till the Prophet got up because of it. When he got up, the people informed him about what had happened to them. He said, &#8220;There is no harm (or it will not be harmful). Depart!&#8221; So they departed from that place, and after covering some distance the Prophet stopped and asked for some water to perform the ablution. So he performed the ablution and the call for the prayer was pronounced and he led the people in prayer. After he finished from the prayer, he saw a man sitting aloof who had not prayed with the people. He asked, &#8220;O so and so! What has prevented you from praying with us?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I am <i>junub</i> and there is no water. &#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Perform <i>tayammum</i> with (clean) earth and that is sufficient for you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Prophet proceeded on and the people complained to him of thirst. Thereupon he got down and called a person (the narrator &#8216;Auf added that Abu Raja&#8217; had named him but he had forgotten) and &#8216;Ali, and ordered them to go and bring water. So they went in search of water and met a woman who was sitting on her camel between two bags of water. They asked, &#8220;Where can we find water?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;I was there (at the place of water) this hour yesterday and my people are behind me.&#8221; They requested her to accompany them. She asked, &#8220;Where?&#8221; They said, &#8220;To Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221; She said, &#8220;Do you mean the man who is called the <i>Sabi&#8217;</i>, (with a new religion)?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Yes, the same person. So come along.&#8221; They brought her to the Prophet and narrated the whole story. He said, &#8220;Help her to dismount.&#8221; The Prophet asked for a pot, then he opened the mouths of the bags and poured some water into the pot. Then he closed the big openings of the bags and opened the small ones and the people were called upon to drink and water their animals. So they all watered their animals and they (too) all quenched their thirst and also gave water to others and last of all the Prophet gave a pot full of water to the person who was <i>junub</i> and told him to pour it over his body. The woman was standing and watching all that which they were doing with her water. By Allah, when her water bags were returned the looked like as if they were more full (of water) than they had been before (Miracle of Allah&#8217;s Apostle) Then the Prophet ordered us to collect something for her; so dates, flour and <i>sawiq</i> were collected which amounted to a good meal that was put in a piece of cloth. She was helped to ride on her camel and that cloth full of food-stuff was also placed in front of her and then the Prophet said to her, &#8220;We have not taken your water but Allah has given water to us.&#8221; She returned home late. Her relatives asked her: &#8220;O so and so what has delayed you?&#8221; She said, &#8220;A strange thing! Two men met me and took me to the man who is called the <i>Sabi</i>&#8216; and he did such and such a thing. By Allah, he is either the greatest magician between this and this (gesturing with her index and middle fingers raising them towards the sky indicating the heaven and the earth) or he is Allah&#8217;s true Apostle.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Afterwards the Muslims used to attack the pagans around her abode but never touched her village. One day she said to her people, &#8220;I think that these people leave you purposely. Have you got any inclination to Islam?&#8221; They obeyed her and all of them embraced Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu &#8216;Abdultah said: The word <i>saba&#8217;a </i>means &#8220;The one who has deserted his old religion and embraced a new religion.&#8221; Abul &#8216;Ailya said, &#8220;The <i>Sabis</i> are a sect of people of the Scripture who recite the Book of Psalms.&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Supplication for <a>Rain</a></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Volume 8, Book 73, Number 115:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to the Prophet on a Friday while he (the Prophet) was delivering a sermon at Medina, and said, &#8220;There is lack of rain, so please invoke your Lord to bless us with the rain.&#8221; The Prophet looked at the sky when no cloud could be detected. Then he invoked Allah for rain. Clouds started gathering together and it rained till the Medina valleys started flowing with water. It continued raining till the next Friday. Then that man (or some other man) stood up while the Prophet was delivering the Friday sermon, and said, &#8220;We are drowned; Please invoke your Lord to withhold it (rain) from us&#8221; The Prophet smiled and said twice or thrice, &#8220;O Allah! Please let it rain round about us and not upon us.&#8221; The clouds started dispersing over Medina to the right and to the left, and it rained round about Medina and not upon Medina. Allah showed them (the people) the miracle of His Prophet and His response to his invocation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><a><strong>Lights</strong></a><strong> to guide Companions</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Volume 1, Book 8, Number 454:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Two of the companions of the Prophet departed from him on a dark night and were led by two lights like lamps (going in front of them from Allah as a miracle) lighting the way in front of them, and when they parted, each of them was accompanied by one of these lights till he reached their (respective) houses.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><a><strong>Crying</strong></a><strong> of the stem of the Date-palm Tree</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 783:</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to deliver his sermons while standing beside a trunk of a datepalm. When he had the pulpit made, he used it instead. The trunk started crying and the Prophet went to it, rubbing his hand over it (to stop its crying).</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><a><strong>Glorification</strong></a><strong> of Allah by the Prophet&#8217;s meals</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 779:</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We used to consider miracles as Allah&#8217;s Blessings, but you people consider them to be a warning. Once we were with Allah&#8217;s Apostle on a journey, and we ran short of water. He said, &#8220;Bring the water remaining with you.&#8221; The people brought a utensil containing a little water. He placed his hand in it and said, &#8220;Come to the blessed water, and the Blessing is from Allah.&#8221; I saw the water flowing from among the fingers of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and no doubt, we heard the meal glorifying Allah, when it was being eaten (by him).</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The <a>expulsion</a> of a liar&#8217;s corpse by the Earth</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 814:</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a Christian who embraced Islam and read <i>Surat-al-Baqara</i> and <i>Al-Imran,</i> and he used to write (the revelations) for the Prophet. Later on he returned to Christianity again and he used to say: &#8220;Muhammad knows nothing but what I have written for him.&#8221; Then Allah caused him to die, and the people buried him, but in the morning they saw that the earth had thrown his body out. They said, &#8220;This is the act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our companion and took his body out of it because he had run away from them.&#8221; They again dug the grave deeply for him, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown his body out. They said, &#8220;This is an act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our companion and threw his body outside it, for he had run away from them.&#8221; They dug the grave for him as deep as they could, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown his body out. So they believed that what had befallen him was not done by human beings and had to leave him thrown (on the ground).</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">The Speech of the <a>Wolf</a></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 517:</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;While a man was riding a cow, it turned towards him and said, &#8216;I have not been created for this purpose (i.e. carrying), I have been created for sloughing.l&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;I, Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar believe in the story.&#8221; The Prophet went on, &#8220;A wolf caught a sheep, and when the shepherd chased it, the wolf said, &#8216;Who will be its guard on the day of wild beasts, when there will be no shepherd for it except me?&#8217; &#8220;After narrating it, the Prophet said, &#8220;I, Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar too believe it.&#8221; Abu Salama (a sub-narrator) said, &#8220;Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar were not present then.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been written that a wolf also spoke to one of the companions of the Prophet near Medina as narrated in <i>Fath-al-Bari</i>:Narrated Unais bin &#8216;Amr: Ahban bin Aus said, &#8220;I was amongst my sheep. Suddenly a wolf caught a sheep and I shouted at it. The wolf sat on its tail and addressed me, saying, &#8216;Who will look after it (i.e. the sheep) when you will be busy and not able to look after it? Do you forbid me the provision which Allah has provided me?&#8217; &#8221; Ahban added, &#8220;I clapped my hands and said, &#8216;By Allah, I have never seen anything more curious and wonderful than this!&#8217; On that the wolf said, &#8216;There is something (more curious) and wonderful than this; that is, Allah&#8217;s Apostle in those palm trees, inviting people to Allah (i.e. Islam).&#8217; &#8220;Unais bin &#8216;Amr further said, &#8220;Then Ahban went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and informed him what happened and embraced Islam.)&#8221; palm trees or other trees and share the fruits with me.&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Prophet&#8217;s <a>Night</a> Journey to Jerusalem</strong> (Arabic: <i>Israa</i>) <strong>and Ascent to the Heavens</strong> (Arabic: <i>Miraj</i>)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Volume 5, Book 58, Number 228: </i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the Statement of Allah&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;And We granted the vision (Ascension to the heavens) which We made you see (as an actual eye witness) was only made as a trial for the people.&#8221;</i> (17.60)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abbas added: The sights which Allah&#8217;s Apostle was shown on the Night Journey when he was taken to Bait-ul Maqdis (i.e. Jerusalem) were actual sights, (not dreams). And the Cursed Tree (mentioned) in the Quran is the tree of <i>Zaqqum</i> (itself) .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Volume 4, Book 54, Number 462:</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;On the night of my Ascent to the Heaven, I saw Moses who was a tall brown curly-haired man as if he was one of the men of Shan&#8217;awa tribe, and I saw Jesus, a man of medium height and moderate complexion inclined to the red and white colors and of lank hair. I also saw Malik, the gate-keeper of the (Hell) Fire and Ad-Dajjal amongst the signs which Allah showed me.&#8221; (The Prophet then recited the Holy Verse): &#8220;So be not you in doubt of meeting him&#8217; when you met Moses during the night of Mi&#8217;raj over the heavens&#8221; (32.23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas and Abu Bakra: &#8220;The Prophet said, &#8220;The angels will guard Medina from Ad-Dajjal (who will not be able to enter the city of Medina).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Volume 5, Book 58, Number 227:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abbas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Malik bin Sasaa said that Allah&#8217;s Apostle described to them his Night Journey saying, &#8220;While I was lying in Al-Hatim or Al-Hijr, suddenly someone came to me and cut my body open from here to here.&#8221; I asked Al-Jarud who was by my side, &#8220;What does he mean?&#8221; He said, &#8220;It means from his throat to his pubic area,&#8221; or said, &#8220;From the top of the chest.&#8221; The Prophet further said, &#8220;He then took out my heart. Then a gold tray of Belief was brought to me and my heart was washed and was filled (with Belief) and then returned to its original place. Then a white animal which was smaller than a mule and bigger than a donkey was brought to me.&#8221; (On this Al-Jarud asked, &#8220;Was it the Buraq, O Abu Hamza?&#8221; I (i.e. Anas) replied in the affirmative). The Prophet said, &#8220;The animal&#8217;s step (was so wide that it) reached the farthest point within the reach of the animal&#8217;s sight. I was carried on it, and Gabriel set out with me till we reached the nearest heaven.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he asked for the gate to be opened, it was asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel answered, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Who is accompanying you?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has Muhammad been called?&#8217; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said, &#8216;He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!&#8217; The gate was opened, and when I went over the first heaven, I saw Adam there. Gabriel said (to me). &#8216;This is your father, Adam; pay him your greetings.&#8217; So I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious son and pious Prophet.&#8217; Then Gabriel ascended with me till we reached the second heaven. Gabriel asked for the gate to be opened. It was asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel answered, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Who is accompanying you?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217; Gabriel answered in the affirmative. Then it was said, &#8216;He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!&#8217; The gate was opened.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I went over the second heaven, there I saw Yahya (i.e. John) and &#8216;Isa (i.e. Jesus) who were cousins of each other. Gabriel said (to me), &#8216;These are John and Jesus; pay them your greetings.&#8217; So I greeted them and both of them returned my greetings to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.&#8217; Then Gabriel ascended with me to the third heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Who is accompanying you?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said, &#8216;He is welcomed, what an excellent visit his is!&#8217; The gate was opened, and when I went over the third heaven there I saw Joseph. Gabriel said (to me), &#8216;This is Joseph; pay him your greetings.&#8217; So I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.&#8217; Then Gabriel ascended with me to the fourth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Gabriel&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Who is accompanying you?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said, &#8216;He is welcomed, what an excel lent visit his is!&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The gate was opened, and when I went over the fourth heaven, there I saw Idris. Gabriel said (to me), &#8216;This is Idris; pay him your greetings.&#8217; So I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.&#8217; Then Gabriel ascended with me to the fifth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It was asked. &#8216;Who is accompanying you?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said He is welcomed, what an excellent visit his is! So when I went over the fifth heaven, there I saw Harun (i.e. Aaron), Gabriel said, (to me). This is Aaron; pay him your greetings.&#8217; I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.&#8217; Then Gabriel ascended with me to the sixth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked. &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Who is accompanying you?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. It was said, &#8216;He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I went (over the sixth heaven), there I saw Moses. Gabriel said (to me),&#8217; This is Moses; pay him your greeting. So I greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.&#8217; When I left him (i.e. Moses) he wept. Someone asked him, &#8216;What makes you weep?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;I weep because after me there has been sent (as Prophet) a young man whose followers will enter Paradise in greater numbers than my followers.&#8217; Then Gabriel ascended with me to the seventh heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It was asked,&#8217; Who is accompanying you?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said, &#8216;He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when I went (over the seventh heaven), there I saw Abraham. Gabriel said (to me), &#8216;This is your father; pay your greetings to him.&#8217; So I greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious son and pious Prophet.&#8217; Then I was made to ascend to <i>Sidrat-ul-Muntaha</i> (i.e. the Lote Tree of the utmost boundary) Behold! Its fruits were like the jars of Hajr (i.e. a place near Medina) and its leaves were as big as the ears of elephants. Gabriel said, &#8216;This is the Lote Tree of the utmost boundary) . Behold ! There ran four rivers, two were hidden and two were visible, I asked, &#8216;What are these two kinds of rivers, O Gabriel?&#8217; He replied,&#8217; As for the hidden rivers, they are two rivers in Paradise and the visible rivers are the Nile and the Euphrates.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then <i>Al-Bait-ul-Ma&#8217;mur</i> (i.e. the Sacred House) was shown to me and a container full of wine and another full of milk and a third full of honey were brought to me. I took the milk. Gabriel remarked, &#8216;This is the Islamic religion which you and your followers are following.&#8217; Then the prayers were enjoined on me: They were fifty prayers a day. When I returned, I passed by Moses who asked (me), &#8216;What have you been ordered to do?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;I have been ordered to offer fifty prayers a day.&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;Your followers cannot bear fifty prayers a day, and by Allah, I have tested people before you, and I have tried my level best with Bani Israel (in vain). Go back to your Lord and ask for reduction to lessen your followers&#8217; burden.&#8217; So I went back, and Allah reduced ten prayers for me. Then again I came to Moses, but he repeated the same as he had said before. Then again I went back to Allah and He reduced ten more prayers. When I came back to Moses he said the same, I went back to Allah and He ordered me to observe ten prayers a day. When I came back to Moses, he repeated the same advice, so I went back to Allah and was ordered to observe five prayers a day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I came back to Moses, he said, &#8216;What have you been ordered?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;I have been ordered to observe five prayers a day.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Your followers cannot bear five prayers a day, and no doubt, I have got an experience of the people before you, and I have tried my level best with Bani Israel, so go back to your Lord and ask for reduction to lessen your follower&#8217;s burden.&#8217; I said, &#8216;I have requested so much of my Lord that I feel ashamed, but I am satisfied now and surrender to Allah&#8217;s Order.&#8217; When I left, I heard a voice saying, &#8216;I have passed My Order and have lessened the burden of My Worshippers.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From &#8220;Zâd al-Ma&#8217;âd fî Hadyi Khayri-l &#8216;Ibâd&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of the Prophet&#8217;s <i>Ghazwat</i>, <i> Bu&#8217;uth</i> and <i>Saraya</i> [1] occurred after the <i>Hijrah</i>, within a span of ten years. There were either twenty-seven <i>Ghazwat</i>, or twenty-five, or twenty-nine. The Prophet <i>sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> had to fight in nine battles, <i>Badr</i>, <i>&#8216;Uhud</i>, <i>al-Khandaqh</i>, <i>Quraidhah</i>, <i>al-Mustaliqh</i>, <i> Khaybar</i>,<i> al-Fath&#8217;</i> (Conquering of Makkah), <i>&#8216;Hunayn</i> and <i>Tâ&#8217;if</i>. It was said that the Prophet <i>sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> also fought against <i>Banî an-Nadhîr</i> (a Jewish tribe) and at <i>al-Ghabah</i> and <i>Wadi al-Qura</i>, which was a suburb of Khaybar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <i>Saraya</i> of the Prophet <i>sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and the armies he sent, they numbered close to sixty. There were seven major battles: <i>Badr</i>, <i>&#8216;Uhud</i>, <i>al-</i><i>Khandaqh</i>, <i>Khaybar</i>, <i>al-Fath&#8217;</i>, <i>&#8216;Hunayn</i> and <i>Tabuk</i>. [2] Several parts of the Qur&#8217;ân mentioned these major <i>Ghazwat</i>. For instance, Sûrah al-Anfâl (chapter 8) was revealed about <i>Ghazwat Badr</i>, while the last part of Sûrah ali-&#8216;Imrân (chapter 3) was about <i>Ghazwat &#8216;Uhud</i>, from Allâh&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And (remember) when you [Muhammad <i>sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i></b><b>] left your household in the morning to post the believers at their stations for the battle&#8221;</b> [3:121],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">until just before the end of the Sûrah. The beginning of Sûrah al-Ahzâb (chapter 33) was revealed about the battles of <i>al-Khandaqh</i>, <i>Quraydhah</i> and <i>Khaybar</i>. Sûrah al-&#8216;Hashr (59) was revealed about <i>Banî an-Nadhîr</i>, <i>al-Fath&#8217;</i> (48) about <i>al-&#8216;Hudaibiyyah</i> and the battle of <i>Khaybar</i>. The conquering of Makkah was mentioned indirectly in Sûrah al-Fath&#8217; and directly in Sûrah an-Nasr (110). He <i> sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was wounded during the battle of <i>&#8216;Uhud</i>. [3] The angels fought alongside the Prophet <i>sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> during the battles of <i>Badr</i> [4] and <i>&#8216;Hunayn</i>. They also descended during the battle of <i>al-Khandaqh</i> [5], where they shook the <i>Mushriks</i> [surrounding <i>Madînah</i>] and defeated them. During that battle, the Prophet <i>sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> threw a handful of sand at the faces of the <i>Mushriks</i> (Polytheists) and they fled [without a fight]. [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <i> sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> won decisively in two battles, <i>Badr</i> and <i>&#8216;Hunain</i>. He used <i>al-Manjaniq</i> (mongonel, or catapult) during on battle, <i>at-Tâ&#8217;if</i>, and took cover behind a trench during <i>Ghazwat al-Khandaqh</i>, also known as <i>Ghazwat al-Ahzâb</i>. Salmân al-Farsî <i>radiallâhu &#8216;anhu</i> suggested that the trench be dug in that battle.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Footnotes</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] &#8216;<i>Ghazwat</i>&#8216;, pl. for &#8216;<i>Ghazwah</i>&#8216;, means battles. The battles that the Prophet <i> sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> led himself were called, &#8216;<i>Ghazwat</i>&#8216;, whereas the armies and expeditions he sent while remaining behind are called, &#8216;<i>Bu&#8217;uth</i>&#8216;, pl. for, &#8216;<i>Ba&#8217;th</i>&#8216;, and &#8216;<i>Saraya</i>&#8216;, pl. for, &#8216;<i>Sariyyah</i>&#8216;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] All of which are mentioned in detail later on in, <i>Zâd al-Ma&#8217;âd</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Al-Bukhârî (3767) narrated that Sahl bin as-Sa&#8217;idi was asked about how the wound of the Prophet <i> sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was treated, and he replied, &#8220;&#8216;Alî used to bring water in his shield and Fâtimah (the Prophet&#8217;s daughter and &#8216;Alî&#8217;s wife) used to wash the blood off his face. Then straw mat was burnt and the wound was filled with it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Al-Bukhârî (3694) narrated that &#8216;Abdullâh ibn &#8216;Abbâs <i>radiallâhu &#8216;anhu</i> said that the Prophet <i> sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said on the day of <i>Badr</i>, &#8220;Here is Jibrîl, holding the head of his horse and wearing war armours.&#8221; Allâh sent the angels to strengthen their hearts of the believers and to aid them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Shaykh &#8216;Irfân said, &#8220;Allâh said in Sûrah al-Ahzâb (33:9), <b> &#8216;O you who believe! Remember Allâh&#8217;s Favour to you, when there came against you hosts, and We sent against them a wind and forces that you saw not [angels during the battle of Al-Ahzâb (the Confederates, <i>Ghazwat al-Khandaq</i> (in 5 AH)]. And Allâh is Ever All-Seer of what you do.&#8217; </b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] Al-Bukhârî (2716) and Muslim (3277) narrated that Allâh&#8217;s Apostle <i>sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> asked for Allâh&#8217;s wrath upon the <i> Ahzâb</i>, saying: <i>&#8220;O, Allâh, Revealer of the Holy Book, and the One swift at reckoning! O, Allâh, Defeat the confederates. O, Allâh, Defeat them and shake them.&#8221;</i></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong style="line-height:1.5em;">Question</strong><span style="line-height:1.5em;">:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most people think that things were created from the light of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and that his light was created from the light of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They narrate, “I am the light of Allaah and everything is from my light” and also, “The first thing that Allaah created was the light of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).” Is there any basis for this?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They also narrate “I am ‘Arab without (the letter) ‘ayn, i.e., Rabb, and I am Ahmad without (the letter) meem, i.e., Ahad.” Is there any basis for this?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has been described as being light from the light of Allaah. If what is meant by this is that he himself is from the light of Allaah, then this goes against the Qur’aan, which refers to his being human. If what is meant is that he is light in the sense that he brought the Revelation by which whoever Allah wills of His creation is guided, then this is correct. The committee has issued a fatwa concerning this matter, as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has light which is the light of the message and guidance from Allaah, through which Allaah guides whomsoever He will of His slaves. No doubt the light of the message and of guidance comes from Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It is not given to any human being that Allaah should speak to him unless (it be)by inspiration, or from behind a veil, or (that) He sends a Messenger to reveal what He wills by His Leave. Verily, He is Most High, Most Wise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And thus We have sent to you (O Muhammad) Roohan (an Inspiration, and a Mercy) of Our Command. You knew not what is the Book, nor what is Faith? But We have made it (this Qur’aan) a light wherewith We guide whosoever of Our slaves We will. And verily, you (O Muhammad) are indeed guiding (mankind) to the Straight Path (i.e., Allaah’s religion of Islamic monotheism), &#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The path of Allaah, to Whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. Verily, all the matters at the end go to Allaah (for decision).”[al-Shura 42:51-53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This light is not derived from the Seal of the Awliya’ as some heretics claim. The body of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was blood and flesh and bone, and so on. He was created from a father and a mother, and had no existence before he was born. The reports which say that the first thing created by Allaah was the light of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or that Allaah grasped a handful of the light from His Face and that this handful was Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then He looked at it and it formed drops, and from each of these drops He created a Prophet, or He created all of creation from the light of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) – all of these reports and the like are not saheeh, and nothing like this has been narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the fatwa quoted above, it is clear that this is a false belief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the report which says “I am ‘Arab without (the letter) ‘ayn, i.e., Rabb, and I am Ahmad without (the letter) meem, i.e., Ahad” – the attributes of Lordship (ruboobiyah, from Rabb meaning Lord) and Absolute Unity (Ahad meaning One) are attributes that belong uniquely to Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted. It is not permissible for any one of His creation to be described as “the Lord (Rabb)” or as being One (Ahad) in absolute terms. These are attributes that belong exclusively to Allaah, and are not used to describe the Messengers or any other human beings. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 1/310.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it said that Allaah created the heavens and earth for the purpose of creating the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)? What is the meaning of the words, “Were it not for you, the universe [lit. heavenly bodies] would not have been created”? Is there any basis for this hadeeth? Is it saheeh or not? Please give us the facts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The heavens and earth were not created for the sake of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). They were created for the reason mentioned by Allaah in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It is Allaah Who has created seven heavens and of the earth the like thereof (i.e., seven). His Command descends between them (heavens and earth), that you may know that Allaah has power over all things, and that Allaah surrounds (comprehends) all things in (His) Knowledge.”[al-Talaaq 65:12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the hadeeth mentioned, it is falsely attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and has no grounds for authenticity. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh &#8216;Abdul-Muhsin bin Hamad Al-&#8216;Abbaad<br />
His treatise &#8220;<i>Fadlus-Salaat &#8216;alaan-Nabee</i>&#8221; (pg. 11-15)<br />
Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Meaning of Salaat on the Prophet:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Salaat of Allaah upon His Prophet has been interpreted to mean His praising of him before the angels, while the Salaat of the angels upon him has been interpreted to mean their supplication for him. This is the way Abul-&#8216;Aaliyah (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) has defined it as mentioned by Al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh in the introduction of the chapter on <b>&#8220;Verily, Allaah and His angels send their Salaat upon the Prophet. O you who believe, send your Salaat upon him as well as Salaam.&#8221;</b> [Surah Al-Ahzaab: 56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the explanation of the angels&#8217; sending Salaat upon the Prophet, Al-Bukhaaree reported the following saying of Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>), after mentioning the (above) interpretation of Abul-&#8216;Aaliyah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;To &#8216;send their Salaat&#8217; </b>means to send their blessings.&#8221; Meaning: They supplicate for him to be blessed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Salaat of Allaah on the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) has also been explained as meaning His Forgiveness and Mercy on him. Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr quoted many narrations (from the Salaf) in his <i>Fat&#8217;h-ul-Baaree</i> concerning this. He afterward commented on the Salaat being defined as such, saying: &#8220;The most preferable and likely of these opinions (concerning the definition of Salaat) is that which was mentioned previously from Abul-&#8216;Aaliyah that the meaning of Allaah&#8217;s Salaat on His Prophet is His praising and honoring of him, while the Salaat of the angels, as well as everyone else, upon him means their requesting the same thing (i.e. praise and honor) for him from Allaah. However, what is intended here by their request is that of an increase in praise and honor and not the same amount as intended by the original Salaat.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh (Ibn Hajr) said: &#8220;Al-Haleemee said in <i>ash-Shu&#8217;ab</i>: &#8216;The meaning of Allaah&#8217;s Salaat on the Prophet is His extolling of him.&#8217; So what is meant by our statement: &#8216;<i>Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Muhammad&#8217;</i> is &#8216;O Allaah, Exalt Muhammad.&#8217; What is intended by this is: Extolling him in the worldly life with the highest form of remembrance, while manifesting his Religion and preserving his legislation. As regards to the Hereafter, what is intended by it is that he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) be given tremendous reward, granted the ability to intercede on behalf of his ummah and that his virtue be manifested in the praiseworthy station.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So based on this, what is meant by Allaah&#8217;s statement <b>&#8220;Send your Salaat upon him&#8221; </b>is: &#8220;Invoke your Lord to send His Salaat on him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great scholar, Ibn Al-Qayyim said in his book &#8220;<i>Jalaa-ul-Afhaam fis-Salaati was-Salaam &#8216;alaa Khair-il-Anaam</i>&#8221; while discussing the meaning of the Salaat of Allaah and His Angels on His Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) and His commanding the believing servants to send their Salaat on him, after refuting the claim that the meaning of Salaat is Mercy and Forgiveness:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Rather, the Salaat that the people were commanded with in it &#8211; i.e. the ayah in Surah Al-Ahzaab &#8211; is a request to Allaah that he implements what He has informed us about concerning His Salaat and the Salaat of the Angels, and that is: Praising him, manifesting his virtue and nobility, and seeking to honor and elevate him.&#8221; So it consists of a notification and a request. This asking and supplicating on our part was called &#8220;Salaat on him&#8221; for two reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>First: </b>It entails that when a person sends Salaat on him, he is praising him and extolling the mention of his virtue and nobility, as well as desiring and loving for Allaah that He do the same. So it consists of a notification (i.e. of a person&#8217;s praises) as well as a request (from Allaah that He send His praises).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Second: </b>Such an action was called Salaat from us due to the fact that we are asking Allaah to send His Salaat on him (i.e. the Prophet). So therefore, the meaning of Allaah&#8217;s Salaat on the Prophet is His praising of him in order to elevate his remembrance and rank with Allaah, while the meaning of our Salaat on the Prophet is: Asking Allaah to do that (i.e. the above) for him.&#8221; [End of Ibn Al-Qayyim&#8217;s words]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Meaning of Salaam on the Prophet:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the meaning of Salaam on the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>), Al-Majd Al-Fayrooz Abaadee said in his book <i>As-Silaatu wal-Bushr fis-Salaati &#8216;alaa Khair-il-Bashr</i>: &#8220;It means: As-Salaam &#8211; which is one of Allaah&#8217;s Names &#8211; be upon you. And the interpretation of that is: &#8216;May you not be void of goodness and blessing, and may you be safe from detestable and harmful things. This is since a Name of Allaah is only mentioned upon certain things in the hopes of gathering all of the meanings of good and blessing for those things, and to remove the occurrence of defects and corruption from those things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is befitting that the Salaam (here) take on the meaning of <i>Salaamah </i>(i.e. peace/safety). Meaning: May Allaah&#8217;s divine decree on you be that of peace and security &#8211; i.e. May you be safe and secure from blemishes and defects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if you say: &#8216;O Allaah, send your Salaam on Muhammad&#8217;, then what you intend from this is: &#8216;O Allaah, decree for Muhammad &#8211; with regard to his Call, ummah and remembrance &#8211; safety and absolvement from every defect. Thus throughout the passage of time, let his Call increase in status, his ummah in numbers, and his remembrance elevation.'&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Kaab Ibn Ujrah (radhi Allaahu anhu) relates that Rasulullah (peace be upon him) said Come near to the mimbar and we came near the mimbar. When He (peace be upon him) climbed the first step of the mimbar, He (peace be upon him) said &#8220;Aameen&#8221;, When He (peace be upon him) ascended the second step, He (peace be upon him) said &#8220;Aameen&#8221;, When He (peace be upon him) climbed the third step, He (peace be upon him) said &#8220;Aameen&#8221; When He (peace be upon him) came down, We said &#8220;O Rasool of Allah (peace be upon him), we have heard from you today something which we never heard before&#8221; He (peace be upon him) said When I climbed the first step, the angel Jibraeel (alaihi as-salam) appeared before me and said</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Destruction to him who found the blessed month of Ramdhan and let it pass by without gaining forgiveness&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">upon that I said &#8216;Aameen&#8217;. When I climbed the second step, he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Destruction to him before whom thy name is taken and then he does not make Dua for Allah&#8217;s blessing on me (by saying, for example , Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam).&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied &#8216;Aameen&#8217;. When I climbed the third step, he said</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Destruction unto him in whose lifetime his parents or either one of them reaches old age, and (through failure to serve them) he is not allowed to enter Jannah&#8221;.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said &#8216;Aameen&#8217;. (Hakim, Baihaqi)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Note In this Hadith, it appears that Jibraeel (alaihi as-salam) gave expression to three curses, upon which Rasulullah (peace be upon him) said Aameen every time. In al-Durr al-Mansoor it is reported that Jibraeel (alaihi as-salam) advised Rasulullah (peace be upon him) to say Aameen. Being an angel of such high mark, Jibraeel &#8216;s giving these curses is sure to be accepted. May Allah (Subhanahu wa Taala) in His infinite mercy grant us His help and save us from these three dangers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Mutawakkil : One Who depends upon Allah<br />
One of the names of Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ataa ibn Yasar who said: ‘I met Abdullaah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas and asked him, “Tell me about the description of Allaah’s Messenger which is mentioned in the Tawrah (i.e. Old Testament).” He replied, “Yes. By Allaah, he is described in the Tawrah with some of the qualities attributed to him in the Qur’aan as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O Prophet! We have sent you as a witness (for Allaah’s True Religion), and a giver of glad tidings (to the faithful believers), and a warner (to the unbelievers), and a guardian of the illiterates. You are My slave and My Messenger. I have named you <strong>“al-Mutawakkil” (who depends upon Allaah)</strong>. You are neither discourteous, harsh, nor a noise-maker in the markets, and you do not do evil to those who do evil to you, but you deal with them with forgiveness and kindness. Allaah will not let him (the Prophet) die until he makes straight the crooked people by making them say: “None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah,” with which will be opened blind eyes and deaf ears and enveloped hearts.”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">بسم الله والصلاة والسلام على رسول الله<br />
(In the name of Allaah, peace and salutations be upon His Prophet.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) said:<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8216;None of you truly believes until I am more beloved to him than his child, his father and all the people.&#8221;</em> </span>(Muslim: 44).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaamah Shaykh Dr. Saalih ibn Abd-Allaah ibn Fawzaan al-Fawzaan (may Allaah preserve him) highlights the significance, importance and correct way of loving the final messenger of Allaah, Muhammad, may Allaah send salutations and peace upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">IMPORTANT POINTS:</p>
<ol>
<li>Allaah, the Almighty, has to be loved more than anything and everything.</li>
<li>The prophet Muhammad, may Allaah send peace upon him and his family, has to be loved more than anything and everything, EXCEPT Allaah.</li>
<li>innovating into the perfect religion of Islaam, with the claim of love for Allaah or his messenger is a complete delusion and is misguidance</li>
</ol>

<p style="text-align:center;">Uploaded by <span style="color:#993300;">LearntoReadTheKuran</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The following is taken from Tafsir Ibn Kathir</strong>:</p>
<p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(1. The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder.) (2. And if they see an Ayah, they turn away and say: &#8220;This is magic, Mustamir.&#8221;) (3. They denied and followed their own lusts. And every matter will be settled.) (4. And indeed there has come to them news wherein there is Muzdajar.) (5. Perfect wisdom, but warners benefit them not.) <span style="color:#993300;">(Surah Qamar 1-4)</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas bin Malik said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The people of Makkah asked the Prophet for a miracle and the moon was split into two parts in Makkah. Allah said, (The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder.)&#8221; </span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim also collected this Hadith. Al-Bukhari recorded that Anas bin Malik said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The people of Makkah asked the Messenger of Allah to produce a miracle, and he showed them the splitting of the moon into two parts, until they saw (the mount of) Hira&#8217; between them.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs with various chains of narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that Jubayr bin Mut`im said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;The moon was split into two pieces during the time of Allah&#8217;s Prophet ; a part of the moon was over one mountain and another part over another mountain. So they said, `Muhammad has taken us by his magic.&#8217; They then said, `If he was able to take us by magic, he will not be able to do so with all people.&#8221;&#8217;</em> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Only Imam Ahmad recorded this Hadith with this chain of narration. Al-Bayhaqi used another chain of narration in a similar Hadith he collected in Ad-Dala&#8217;il.</p>
<p>Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;The moon was split during the time of the Prophet .&#8221; Al-Bukhari and Muslim collected this Hadith. Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah&#8217;s saying:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">(The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder. And if they see a sign, they turn away and say: &#8220;This is magic, Mustamir.&#8221;) &#8220;This occurred before the Hijrah; the moon was split and they saw it in two parts.&#8221;</span></em></p>

<p><span style="font-size:small;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Allah exalts the mention of His Messenger (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and His angels supplicate Him to do so.

<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>[4 minutes]</strong><br /><strong>Abu Talhah Dawood Burbank (<em>rahimahullaah</em>)</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Prophet Muhammad ﷺ</strong><br /><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/muhammad/">https://abdurrahman.org/muhammad/</a></p>



<p><strong><span style="color:#74312a;" class="has-inline-color">Transcribed Audio Text</span></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The authentic hadeeth that mentions that it has not been restricted to the day time of Jumuah but rather there is a authentic hadeeth reported by Anas radhiyallahu anhu, Allah’s messenger sallallahu alayhi wa sallam said “<strong>Be plentiful in sending salat upon me on the day of Jumuah and on the night of Jumu’ah i.e the night before Jumuah, so whoever sends a single salat upon me then Allah will send salat upon him ten times over</strong>”. Hadeeth reported by Bayhaqi. Declared as saheeh by sheikh albani in his saheeha no.1407.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">As for the explanation of Sheikh Muhammed Bin Salih al-Uthaymeen rahimahullah, then he said &#8211; as a regard to this hadeeth and from that which is specific to the day of Jumuah is sending abundant salat upon the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam and there is no doubt that the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam is the one after the whole creation who has the greatest of rights upon us. His rights upon us are greater than the rights of our own selves upon ourselves. And therefore, it is obligatory to give precedence to love him of our love of oneself and one’s child and one’s father and one’s mother and one’s wife and all of mankind. And it is not possible for your eman to be complete unless you give precedence to love of the messenger sallallahu alayhi wa sallam over love of everyone, every person</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And from his right upon you is that you should be abundant in sending salat and salam upon him. And he is not in actually any need of your salat and your salam but rather you are in need of the reward of the salat and salam because you if you send salat upon the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam a single time then Allah will send salat upon you on account of it ten times over. So, if you say “<strong>Allahumma salli ala Muhammad</strong>” “O Allah extol Muhammed and Allah will extol you ten times over”. So, you are the one in need of that and the messenger sallallahu alayhi wa sallam is not in need of it.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And he said: However, what is the meaning of salat upon the messenger? and we say “Allahumma salli alaa Muhammad” then many of us do not know the meaning of this phrase. What is the meaning of the saying “Allahumma salli ala Muhammad”? “O Allah send salat upon Muhammed.&nbsp;He said Abul-Aaliya rahimahullah mentions that he said that the salat of Allah upon his prophet means he’s praising him, he’s extoling him to the highest company of angels. He praises him saying “my servant so and so has such and such” and He mentions praiseworthy qualities. So, if you send salat upon the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam then Allah will extol you ten times over. So, it is upon you to be abundant and sending salat and salam upon Allah’s messenger sallallahu alayhi wa sallam on the day of Jumuah and at every time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) cannot by defended by oppression and misguidance</span><br />
</strong>Compiled by <strong>Aboo Sufyaan &#8216;Uthmaan Beecher<br />
<a href="http://salafiyyah-kuwait.blogspot.in/2012/09/the-prophet-cannot-by-defended-by.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://salafiyyah-kuwait.blogspot.in/</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Verily all praise is due to Allaah, and may peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, and upon his family and his Companions, one and all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No Muslim would ever agree with the mocking, ridicule, and blasphemous lies directed at our Deen and at our beloved Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم).  Rather the Imaams of Ahlus-Sunnah, the likes of Maalik, al-Layth, Ahmad, Ishaaq, and ash-Shaafi’ee, have agreed unanimously that the one who mocks, ridicules, and defames the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) has disbelieved, and that the prescribed punishment for the one who lives in the lands of the Muslims and does that is death, a punishment that falls under the authority of the Muslim ruler.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that these types of attacks on our Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) will cause anger and make the stomach of every Muslim turn due to his love for Allaah, His Messenger, and His Deen.  But the Muslim who is truthful, sincere, and just, he doesn’t allow himself to be overcome by emotion and respond to these attacks with a knee-jerk reaction that entails actions which Allaah and His Messenger have prohibited.  Rather, like in all matters, he is first and foremost patient, and then he takes those matters back to the Qur’aan and Sunnah and the understanding of the Companions, and those ‘Ulamaa’ who are firmly-grounded in knowledge.  So he is patient and he plants his feet squarely upon knowledge, and he submits to what Allaah and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) have decreed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“O you who believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger, and those of you who have been placed in authority (over you). (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it back to Allaah and His Messenger, if you truly believe in Allaah and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination.”</em></span> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And al-Haafith Ibn Katheer mentions that “those of you who have been placed in authority (over you)”, according to Ibn ‘Abbaas, Mujaahid,  ‘Ataa’ and others from the Salaf refers to the ‘Ulamaa’. And Ibn Katheer mentions that it is general to both the rulers and the ‘Ulamaa’.  And of course this means the ‘Ulamaa’ of Ahlus-Sunnah, not those who ahlul-bid’ah call scholars, the likes of al-Qaradaawee, al-‘Awdah, ‘Abdur-Rahmaan ‘Abdul-Khaaliq, and other than them from the callers to misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What has transpired over the past few days in the lands of the Muslims and other than them as a reaction to the film attacking Islaam and insulting our beloved Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) &#8211; contradicts the guidance and Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم).  One should remember that these types of attacks are not something new.  Indeed Allaah mentions throughout the Qur’aan that His messengers (عليهم الصلاة و السلام) were constantly mocked and defamed, that their people called them crazy, mad, and even labeled them as sorcerers, etc.  Allaah تعالى said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“Likewise, no Messenger came to those before them except that they said: &#8220;A sorcerer or a madman!&#8221;</span></em> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this happened with the Prophets and Messengers from Nooh (عليه السلام) up to His final Messenger, Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the lifetime of Allaah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) there were those who cursed and insulted him openly.  Ka’b bin al-Ashraf al-Yahoodee, in al-Madeenah, used to recite defamatory poetry about him and made explicit poetry about the women of the Muslims.  And there was ‘Abdullaah bin Khatal in Makkah, who had two female singers who he had sing songs making fun of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم).</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Ka’b bin al-Ashraf, when he returned from Makkah to al-Madeenah and began reciting his poetry insulting him, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) asked his Companions, “<em><strong>Who will deal with Ka’b bin al-Ashraf? For indeed he has harmed Allaah and His Messenger</strong></em>.”  And this was when the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) was in his dawlah in al-Madeenah and he was the ruler, and Ka’b bin al-Ashraf was living under his authority in al-Madeenah.  But the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) didn’t ask his Companions to punish his neighbors, companions, or even his family members for what Ka’b bin al-Ashraf did.  Nor did he punish the representatives of his tribe, Banu an-Nadeer, or randomly target the Jews of al-Madeenah nor did he boycott their businesses.   Any person of sound intellect would agree that this would be unjust and defies logic, not to mention the texts of the Book and the Sunnah.  Instead he (صلى الله عليه وسلم) -as the ruler &#8211; dealt with Ka’b bin al-Ashraf, the one who caused that harm specifically.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> ‘Abdullaah bin Khatal was in Makkah, and he had two female singers who he taught to sing songs making fun of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم).  And at that time, the Prophet was in al-Madeenah, and was the ruler (صلى الله عليه وسلم), and never did he attack anyone from the kuffaar in al-Madeenah or any other town or village as retribution for the defamation and insults of ‘Abdullaah bin Khatal towards him.  Nor did he command his Companions to attack Makkah or its people because of him. Rather he was patient (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and did not oppress, and did not transgress.  He was patient and he was just (صلى الله عليه وسلم). So when the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) conquered Makkah, and he entered Makkah with his armies, he ordered them not to harm anyone who did not fight them, except for a small group of people who he named by name (صلى الله عليه وسلم).  From them – and here the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) had conquered Makkah, and had might and capability (qudrah) – from them was ‘Abdullaah bin Khatal and his two songstresses.  He didn’t tell them to kill Ibn Khatal’s neighbors or his family members. He didn’t  destroy the property of the members of his tribe.  Rather he ordered them to kill ‘Abdullaah bin Khatal and his two songstresses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are just two examples of how the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) dealt with those who abused him in his lifetime.   He was aadil (just), and was saabir (patient) &#8211; (صلى الله عليه وسلم).  He did not oppress and was not unjust, and these people cursed him, abused him, mocked him, and insulted him <strong>during his lifetime</strong> &#8211; (صلى الله عليه وسلم)!!   So where are the actions of the jamaa’aat (political groups and parties) and the ignorant folk who’ve been affected by them from the actions and example of Allaah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم)?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Where do you find that the Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and his Companions went to another town and protested, or that they murdered the innocent, or destroyed or burnt their property to the ground because of what the likes of Ibn al-Ashraf and Ibn Khatal did in Makkah and al-Madeenah?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather he was patient and just (صلى الله عليه وسلم)!!  And ‘adl (justice) is to put everything in it’s proper place.  And what we see from these people in Egypt, Yemen, Libya, and other places in the Middle East, is oppression, injustice, and deviation from his Sunnah.  And Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“So warn those who oppose his command, lest some fitnah befall him or they afflicted with a painful punishment.”</span> </em>[3]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what further elucidates the distinction between the guidance of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and those Muslims who have been overtaken by emotion and misguidance, is the narration of ‘Aa’ishah (رضى الله عنها), collected by al-Bukhaaree, Muslim, Ahmad and others, when a group of Jews entered upon the Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and said “as-saamu ‘alaykum” (death be upon you).  So ‘Aa’ishah (رضى الله عنها) understood what they said, so she responded:  “wa ‘alaykum as-saam wal-la’nah” (and death and curses be upon you).  So the Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:  “<em><strong>Take it easy, O ‘Aa’ishah!  Verily Allaah loves rifq (gentleness and leniency) in all matters</strong></em>.”  So ‘Aa’ishah said: “O Messenger of Allaah! Didn’t you hear what they said?” So he (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said: “<em><strong>I already responded to them (by saying) ‘wa ‘alaykum’ (and upon you, too)</strong></em>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Deen is not based on emotion.  Rather the Muslim who truly and sincerely loves Allaah and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) will stick to his guidance and his Sunnah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“Say:  if you truly love Allaah, then follow me. (If you do) Allaah will love you and forgive you for your sins.  And Allaah is all-forgiving, most merciful.”</em></span> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Here are some points to consider and reflect upon</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; These protests which have spread throughout the Muslim lands, even to our beloved Kuwait, are a bid’ah, as the ‘Ulamaa’ of Ahlus-Sunnah like Shaykh Ibn Baaz, Shaykh al-Albaanee, and Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen have clarified. [5] They are an act of opposing and contending with the Muslim ruler and are from the way of the Khawaarij.  Of course the <strong>jamaa’aat as-siyaasiyyah</strong> allow them and promote them as they are means for them to contend with the Muslim rulers and reach rulership itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; We’ve seen how the emotionally charged youth have taken to the streets in these protests and clashed with the police, and caused damage to property &#8211; not just the property of the American Embassies &#8211; which is in itself an act of oppression &#8211; but the property of the Muslims as well!  And this is supposed to be defense of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم)??!    It cannot be that the Muslims defend the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) with oppression when Allaah has commanded us with justice (‘adl):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“O you who believe! Stand out firmly for Allaah and be just witnesses and don’t let the enmity and hatred of a people keep you from being just. Be just! That is closer to Taqwaa.”</span></em> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Haafith Ibn Katheer</strong> said:  “Don’t let hatred for a people cause you to abandon justice towards them.  Rather exercise justice with everyone, whether it be a close friend or an enemy.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah</strong>:  “for indeed the people did not dispute in the fact that the end result of thulm (oppression and injustice) is evil and harmful, and the end result of ‘adl (justice) is good and noble.  And for this it has been said:  Allaah will aid the nation that is just, even if it is a disbelieving nation, and He will not aid the nation that is unjust and oppressive, even if it is a believing nation.”  [Majmoo’ al-Fataawaa (28/63)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then know that punishing others for the crimes and offenses of another is not justice!  Allaah says:<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><em>“No person earns any (sin) except against himself (only), and no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another.”</em> </span>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; The jamaa’aat as-siyaasiyyah use these protests and these types of events as a forum and a podium to spread their doubts and their conspiracy theories amongst the people and to turn them against their rulers.  They spout out anti-American, anti-western, and anti-Israeli rhetoric and place the blame for the destruction we’ve seen over the past few days on everyone but themselves.  ‘Ali al-Deqbas,  head of the Arab Parliament, actually blamed “international Zionism of being behind the unrest and inciting sedition and hatred of Islam and Muslims in the Middle East in favor of the Zionist entity”.  And the misguided statements like this are many.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; These protests – which as the ‘Ulamaa’ have said is a bid’ah – were used as a cover for those upon the manhaj of the Khawaarij to murder a U.S. ambassador and three other members of his staff, the murder of non-Muslims who were given amn (an assurance of safety and protection) and were from a country that has treaties and agreements with the government of Libya.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said: “Whoever – from the Muslims &#8211; kills a person who is under an agreement or treaty (with the Muslims), he will not smell the Fragrance of Jannah, even though it’s fragrance can be smelled from the distance of 40 years away.” [al-Bukhaaree]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration he said:  &#8220;The assurance of protection of the Muslims is one, so whoever betrays the assurance of protection and safety of another Muslim, then upon him is the curse of Allaah, and (the curse) of the Angels, and (the curse) of all the people.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr (رحمه الله) explained:  &#8220;His saying &#8216;The assurance of protection of the Muslims is one&#8217;, means that their giving an assurance of safety and security is correct (and binding).  So if one of them gives amn to a kaafir, then it is haraam upon anyone else to harm him…&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those non-Muslims who live and work in the Muslim countries have been given <span style="color:#808000;"><a href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-1tC" target="_blank"><span style="color:#808000;">amn (an assurance of safety and protection)</span></a></span>, so by attacking them is contending with and opposing the Muslim ruler, and is an act of treachery and oppression.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Taariq as-Subay’ee</strong> explained that if even one of the Muslims gives amn to a non-Muslim, even if that Muslim is a man or a woman, a free man or a slave, and even if that is by a gesture, or if a person is given amn by the authorities of a Muslim land through diplomatic agreements or by giving him a visa to enter that land – that person has an assurance of safety and protection from every Muslim.  It is totally haraam for any Muslim to harm him. And the person, &#8211; the Muslim -, who does, falls under the curse of Allaah, the Angels, and all of the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; Look to those at the head of these protests and you’ll see that all of them are from the heads and supporters of the jamaa’aat as-siyaasiyyah.  And the fact that none of the ‘Ulamaa’ of Ahlus-Sunnah have anything to do with this should be another sign for the person of intellect, just as Ibn ‘Abbaas (رضى الله تعالى عنهما) brought as a proof against the Khawaarij the fact that none of the Companions were with them, when he said (رضى الله عنهما): Indeed I’ve come to you from the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and there is not a single one of them with you!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211;  We see the Muslims protesting, fighting with the police, destroying property and other than that, all in the name of defending the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) from this film produced by a man living in America.  <span style="color:#ff9900;">What is amazing is that no one is upset over the masaajid that have graves in them where other than Allaah are worshipped besides Allaah, like the masjid of al-Badawee, Zaynab, or al-Hussayn?!</span>  The greatest sin that one can commit is committed in the lands of the Muslims, and the people are tearing down the American embassy over something they don’t have the authority or ability to do anything about?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“Verily, Allaah does not forgive that partners should be set up with him in worship (shirk), but He forgives what is less than that (from sins) for whomever He wills, and whoever sets up partners with Allaah in worship, he has indeed invented a tremendous sin.” </span></em> [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these Muslims and these jamaa’aat want to defend Prophet Muhammad(صلى الله عليه وسلم) – by committing oppression and injustice – but where is the defense of Allaah and His Tawheed from the shirk committed by muslims in the lands of the muslims themselves?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So know that Allaah (تبارك و تعالى) has commanded us with patience and justice, and forbidden us from injustice and oppression.  And there is no justice in the actions we see from our brothers and sisters in Egypt, Yemen, Tunisia, Morocco, Sudan, and the other countries that this is happening in.  Rather what we see is ignorance, oppression, misguidance, and deviation from the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what benefit have they brought about?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The producer of this shoddy film lives in America, and America is a country that has it’s own laws that it governs it’s citizens by.  And America also has treaties and agreements with almost all of these lands that their embassies are being attacked in, proven by the fact that they have embassies there to begin with.  So then this affair is not in the hands of us common folk, and we don’t have the capability to do anything about it.  What is upon us then is to be patient and cling to the Sunnah of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم).  And this is a better defense of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) than what we see from the jamaa’aat and those infected by them!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff9900;">And it is important to note that our patience and our clinging to the Sunnah during situations like this, when we don’t have the ability to change them, is not a sign of weakness or deficiency.  Rather it is the people of misguidance from the jamaa’aat as-siyaasiyyah that have duped our youth into thinking that not having the ability to act is the same as not acting, and this is misguidance and deception.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas’ood narrated that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) was praying by the Ka’bah, and when he went into sajdah, one of the companions of Aboo Jahl put the entrails of a camel on the Prophet’s back (صلى الله عليه وسلم) while Ibn Mas’ood looked on.  And Ibn Mas’ood said:  “I was watching but couldn’t do anything about it. If only I had the strength and ability (to stop them).” [al-Bukhaaree]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This shows us that in situations when we don’t have the capability to act, due to physical weakness, lack of strength or capability, or there being something else that prevents us from doing that, there is no shame or deficiency in that, just as the Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) himself could not aid Yaasir, ‘Ammaar, and Umm ‘Ammaar (رضى الله تعالى عنهم) when he saw them being tortured for their Eemaan in Allaah.  So he said to them (صلى الله عليه وسلم):  “Patience, O Aal-Yaasir (O family of Yaasir)! For indeed you’ve been promised Jannah.”  [9]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>What we’ve written here is not a defense of this film</strong>.  We find it just as offensive, appalling, and insulting as everyone else.  Nor is it a defense of America, Israel, or any other country.  Rather it is meant to be a defense of the Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and our Deen from those who go beyond the bounds, and those who play on the emotions of the Muslims and the emotional, disenfranchised youth, and call them to deviation and misguidance.  It is a call to patience, justice, and sticking to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه وسلم).  And this what was needed to be said and clarified.  And Allaah knows best.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Ubaadah bin as-Saamit narrated:  “The Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) took an oath of allegiance from us to listen and obey (the ruler) in adversity and prosperity, in pleasure and displeasure (and even) when somebody is given preference over us, and to not dispute or contend the authority of those it belongs to, and that we speak the truth wherever we may be without fearing in the matter of Allaah the blame of the blamer.” [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, and upon his family and his Companions, one and all.  And All praise and thanks are due to Allaah, Lord of al-&#8216;Aalameen.</p>
