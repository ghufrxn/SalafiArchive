										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><strong>Imaam Ibn Khuzaymah said in his Saheeh:</strong></div>
<div><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Chapter: Virtues of the month of Ramadhaan – (only) if the Hadeeth is authentic</span></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>`Alee bin Hijr al-Sa`dee narrated to us that Yousuf bin Ziyaad narrated to him that Hammaam bin Yahyaa narrated on the authority of `Alee bin Zaid bin Jad`aan on the authority of Sa`eed bin al-Musayyib on the authority of Salmaan (al-Faarisee) that he said:</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم addressed us (i.e. the companions) on the last day of Sha`baan, saying, <strong>“Oh people! A great month has come over you; a blessed month; a month in which is a night better than a thousand months; a month in which Allaah has made it compulsory upon you to fast (by day), and voluntary to pray by night. Whoever draws nearer (to Allaah) by performing any of the (optional) good deeds in (this month) shall receive the same reward as performing an obligatory deed at any other time, and whoever discharges an obligatory deed in (this month) shall receive the reward of performing seventy obligations at any other time. It is the month of patience, and the reward of patience is Paradise. It is the month of charity, and a month in which a believer&#8217;s sustenance is increased. Whoever gives food to a fasting person to break his fast shall have his sins forgiven, and he will be saved from the Fire of Hell, and he shall have the same reward as the fasting person, without his reward being diminished at all”. </strong>They said: “Not all of us can find that which (we can provide to) the fasting person to break his fast.” He said: <strong>“Allaah </strong><strong>تعالى</strong><strong> gives this reward to anyone who helps the fasting person in breaking the fast even by a (single) date or provides him with water to drink or gives him milk. And it is a month the beginning of which is Mercy, its middle is Forgiveness, and its last is emancipation from the Fire.  Whoever reduces (the burden) on his slave, Allaah will forgive him and will emancipate him from the Fire. And increase in it the four things: Your Lord is pleased with two things, and with the (other) two He will enrich you. The two things with which your Lord is pleased are bearing witness that Laa ilaaha illallaah (there is no one worthy of being worshipped except Allaah) and that you seek His forgiveness. And the two things with which he will enrich you are when you ask for Paradise from Allaah and that you seek His refuge from the Hell. And whoever feeds a fasting person till he is satisfied, Allaah will give him the drink from my Cistern, the drink after which he will not feel thirsty till he enters the Paradise.”</strong> [Saheeh Ibn Khuzaimah (1887)]</div>
<p><a name="131ee2bf9a3d65b0_more"></a></p>
<div><strong>The verdict of the scholars about the weakness of this Hadeeth:</strong></div>
<div>Al-`Ainee said in &#8220;`Umdahtul-Qaaree&#8221;: The chain is not authentic.</div>
<div>Dhiyaa al-Maqdasee said in &#8220;al-Sunan wal-Ahkaam&#8221;: in its chain there is `Alee bin Zaid bin Jad`aan and a group of scholars spoke about him.</div>
<div>Ibn Hajar also graded it “Weak” in &#8220;al-Talkhees al-Habeer&#8221;.</div>
<div>Al-Mundhiree in &#8220;al-Targheeb wal-Tarheeb&#8221; affirmed its weakness.</div>
<div>Al-Albaanee graded it “Very Weak” in al-Mishkaat al-Masaabih (1906).</div>
<div>And he graded it “Munkar” (rejected) in al-Dha`eefah (871), and also in Dha`eef al-Targheeb (589).</div>
<div><strong>Shaikh al-Albaanee comments about this Hadeeth:</strong></div>
<div>(After mentioning the above Hadeeth he (Al-Albaanee) said): “Munkar” (Rejected).</div>
<div>It was reported by al-Muhaamalee in “al-Amaalee” (Vol. 5 No. 50); and by Ibn Khuzaimah in his “Saheeh” (1887) and he (Ibn Khuzaimah) said: “If it is authentic”; and by al-Waahidee in “al-Waseett” (1 / 640 / 1-2).</div>
<div>The narration of it is based on the authority of `Alee bin Zaid bin Jad`aan on the authority of Sa`eed bin al-Musayyib from Salman al-Faarisee that he said: The Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم addressed us on the last day of Sha`baan and he narrated the Hadeeth.</div>
<div>I (Al-Albaanee) say: “This chain of narration is weak because of `Alee bin Zaid bin Jad`aan, for he is weak as what (Imaam) Ahmad and others have said about him.</div>
<div>And Imaam Ibn Khuzaimah said the reason is: “He is not someone to be taken from because of his weak memory.”</div>
<div>And that is why when he (Ibn Khuzaimah) mentioned this Hadeeth in his “Saheeh” he pointed out (itsweakness) by saying: “(only) if the Hadeeth is authentic.”</div>
<div>And al-Mundhiree affirmed it in “al-Targhheb” (2/67) and said: “Al-Baihaqee reported with his chain of narration.””</div>
<div>I (al-Albaanee) say: The reason why Ibn Khuzaimah reported the likes of this Hadeeth in his “Saheeh” is to strongly point out that what is mentioned in it is not authentic according to him and to warn (the people about its weakness).</div>
<div>But some of the authors of “نصرة الخلفاء الراشدين والصحابة” were ignorant about this reality. They mention on the cover of their book: “The Hadeeth (of this book) were verified by the `Alim, the Faadhil, the custodian of the Hadeeth…”, but they say on page 34: “It was reported by Ibn Khuzaimah in his “Saheeh” and he authenticated it.”</div>
<div>They say it (in such a way) as if they did not know what Ibn Khuzaimah had said about the Hadeeth. But if they did know it, then they have openly lied upon Ibn Khuzaimah. And this is not strange from them, because as has preceded from them, their messages are full of slanders and lies without bounds. And it is not advisable to waste time on replying to them, because they do not take advice.</div>
<div>And about this Hadeeth, Ibn Abi Haatim reported from his father in “al-`ilal” (1/249) that it is “Munkar”.</div>
<p>&#8220;Whoever draws near to Allaah during it (Ramadaan) with a single characteristic from the characteristics of (voluntary) goodness, he is like whoever performs an obligatory act in other times. And whoever performs an obligatory act during it, he is like whoever performed seventy obligatory acts in other times.&#8221; – Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah, no. 1887.</p>
