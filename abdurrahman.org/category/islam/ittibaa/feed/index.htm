<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: </strong>What is the difference between<strong> Ittiba&#8221; </strong>(following one&#8217;s traditions; imitation) and <strong>Al Ibtidah </strong>(innovation)</span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">?</span> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Ittiba&#8217; is what we are required to do according to the Shari&#8217;ah (Islamic law), i.e. following what the Prophet (peace be upon him) has brought of orders and prohibitions. It is said &#8220;We should follow&#8221; because Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Follow what has been sent down unto you from your Lord</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (the Qur&#8217;an and Prophet Muhammad&#8217;s Sunnah)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, and follow not any Auliya&#8217;</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (protectors and helpers who order you to associate partners in worship with Allâh)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, besides Him </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Allâh)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(O Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">: &#8220;O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allâh &#8211; to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. Lâ ilâha illa Huwa </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(none has the right to be worshipped but He)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">. It is He Who gives life and causes death. So believe in Allâh and His Messenger</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, the Prophet who can neither read nor write </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(i.e. Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, who believes in Allâh and His Words [(this Qur&#8217;ân), the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"><em>(</em></span><span style="color:#008000;">Gospel)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> and also Allâh&#8217;s Word: &#8220;Be!&#8221; &#8211; and he was, i.e. &#8216;Isa </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Jesus)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> son of Maryam </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Mary)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, and follow him so that you may be quided.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are ordered to follow the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the Qur&#8217;an. Holding on to what has been revealed by Allah in the Qur&#8217;an and what the Prophet (peace be upon him) has said or done is Ittiba. It is to follow the example of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in what he ordered or prohibited. This is Ittiba, which is Wajib <em>(</em>obligatory) in matters which we are obliged to do, and it is Mustahab (desirable) in matters which we are desired to do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Ibtida&#8217;, it is innovation of something in the religion which Allah has not permitted, for example: worship in a way that Allah has not made lawful. This is called Ibtida&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: (&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Anyone who introduces anything into this matter of ours </strong>(Islam)<strong> that is not part of it will have it rejected</strong></span>.&#8221;) and he also said: (<strong><span style="color:#000000;">The most evil of matters are those which are newly introduced in religion</span></strong>), and every Bid&#8217;ah is a Dalalah (deviation from what is right).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a person was to perform more than five Prayers and said they would perform six Prayers, increasing one Prayer at any time of the day, is a Batil (null/void) and Bid&#8217;ah. It is prohibited to perform or to invite people to perform it with the intention that it is a Fard (obligatory, based on a definitive text). Or if someone said the two Sajdahs (prostrations) are not enough, lets make a third Sajdah in every Rak&#8217;ah (unit of Salah); this is Bid&#8217;ah, which if purposely done, will make the Prayer Batil. Likewise if a person decides to perform a second Ruku&#8217; (bowing) in Prayer, this is Bid&#8217;ah except for the eclipse Prayer. Also if someone says: lets allocate a night for worship and we shall pray ten or twenty Rak ahs on the Thursday or Friday night every week, this is Bid&#8217;ah for it is not something which Allah prescribed, as is the night of the Prophet&#8217;s (peace be upon him) birthday, or the night of the birth of Fatimah, Al-Husayn, Al Badawy, Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq, or &#8216;Umar, it is Bid&#8217;ah and the celebration where they pray, talk, perform Dhikr; this is all Bid&#8217;ah because neither Allah nor the Prophet made it lawful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore Ibtida&#8217; is to innovate a worship which Allah did not prescribe, whether it is a verbal or practical; all this is Bid&#8217;ah. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) has not prescribed it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Of such Bid&#8217;ah is the construction domes and Masjids (mosques) over the graves. People think that this is a way to get closer to Allah, and it is from the Din (religion). Rather it is Bid&#8217;ah because the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade construction over graves, because this could lead to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). Of such Shirk acts are to touch the graves with the intention of getting closer to Allah. This is Bid&#8217;ah and the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade building over the graves or plastering them, because this could lead to Shirk. This is also true for those who invoke the dead say &#8220;I invoke You (Allah) by (the intercession of) the dead of the graves&#8221;, &#8220;I invoke You (Allah) with the honor or sake of the Prophet&#8221;, or &#8220;with the honor or sake of the righteous people&#8221;; all this is Bid&#8217;ah. But if someone says: I invoke You (Allah) with my love for You, or with my belief in Your Messenger or with Your Noble Names; this is acceptable and lawful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bid&#8217;ah is what people have innovated in the religion and not sanctioned by Allah and His Prophet. Ittiba&#8217; is to follow the approach prescribed by Allah to His servants, and follow in the footsteps of the Prophet (peace be upon him).</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَمَنْ أَطَاعَهُ دَخَلَ الجَنَّةَ وَمَنْ عَصَاهُ دَخَلَ النَّارَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>So whoever obeys him will enter paradise, and whoever disobeys him will enter the fire.<sup>5</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih Al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>Whoever obeys him</strong>”: meaning in that which he commands, then he will enter paradise. And his saying, “<strong>And whoever disobeys him</strong>”: in that which he forbade, then he will enter the fire. This is something for which there is a great deal of confirmation in the Qur’aan. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَّن يُطِعِ الرَّسُولَ فَقَدْ أَطَاعَ اللَّهَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Whoever obeys the Messenger, then he has indeed obeyed Allaah. </strong></span>[4:80]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا أَرْسَلْنَا مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلَّا لِيُطَاعَ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We did not send any Messenger except that he should be obeyed by the permission of Allaah. </strong></span>[4:64]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِن تُطِيعُوهُ تَهْتَدُوا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And if you obey him </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the Prophet </span><span style="color:#008000;"><em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em></span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> you will be rightly guided</span>. </strong>[24:54]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> وَأَطِيعُوا الرَّسُولَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And obey the Messenger that you may be shown mercy. </strong></span>[24:56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever obeys him is guided, and will enter paradise, and whoever disobeys him will be astray and will enter the fire. He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">كلكم يدخل الجنة إلا من أبى ، قالوا : يا رسول الله ومن يأبى ؟ قال : من أطاعني دخل الجنة ومن عصاني فقد أبى</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“All of you will enter paradise except for those who refuse.” They said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, and who will refuse?’ He said, “Whoever obeys me enters paradise and whoever disobeys me has refused.”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong>So his <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> saying, “<strong>He has refused</strong>”: means he will have refused to enter paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لا يسمع بي يهودي ولا نصراني ثم لا يؤمن بالذي جئت به إلا دخل النار</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“No-one will hear of me, no Jew nor any Christian, and then not believe in that which I came with except that he will enter the fire.”<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever obeys him will enter paradise and whoever disobeys him will enter the fire, and this is the distinguishing factor between the true believer and between the disbeliever.</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّا أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَيْكُمْ رَسُولًا شَاهِدًا عَلَيْكُمْ كَمَا أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ رَسُولًا</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَعَصَىٰ فِرْعَوْنُ الرَّسُولَ فَأَخَذْنَاهُ أَخْذًا وَبِيلًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We sent a Messenger to you as a witness for or against you, just as we sent a Messenger to the Pharaoh. But the Pharaoh disobeyed the Messenger so we seized him with a severe punishment. </strong></span>[73:15-16] <span style="color:#993300;"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih Al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And the proof</strong>”: meaning for the sending of the Messenger is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">We sent a Messenger to you as a witness for or against you, just as we sent a Messenger to the Pharaoh. But the Pharaoh disobeyed the Messenger so we seized him with a severe punishment</span>. </strong>[73:15-16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High, “<em>Innaa</em>”, the pronoun here (meaning ‘We’) refers to Allaah the Perfect and Most High and this is a pronoun of one declaring his own greatness, because He is indeed Tremendous, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“We sent”, likewise this pronoun is to show greatness, and the meaning of, <em>“arsalnaa</em>”, is We sent him and sent revelation to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word, “<em>ilaykum</em>”, (to you people), meaning O two weighty species (mankind and the <em>jinn</em>). It is an address to the whole of mankind, because the <em>risaalah</em> (messengership) of this Messenger is universal to all of mankind until the Hour is established.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<em>Rasoolan</em>”, (a Messenger), he is Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam.</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the phrase:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> شَاهِدًا عَلَيْكُمْ كَمَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>As a witness upon you </strong></span>[73:15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: with Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, on the Day of Resurrection, a witness that he conveyed to you the message of Allaah, and that he established the proof upon you, just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">رُّسُلًا مُّبَشِّرِينَ وَمُنذِرِينَ لِئَلَّا يَكُونَ لِلنَّاسِ عَلَى اللَّهِ حُجَّةٌ بَعْدَ الرُّسُلِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah sent Messengers as bringers of glad tidings for the obedient ones, and as warners for the disobedient ones, so that no plea should remain with the people with Allaah, after the sending of the Messengers. </strong></span>[4:165]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So no-one on the Day of Resurrection will be able to say, “I did not know that I was created for worship, I did not know what was obligatory upon me, I did not know what was forbidden for me”. It will not be possible for someone to say this, because the Messengers <em>‘alaihimu<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> conveyed the message to them, and this nation of Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam, </em>it will bear witness against them. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَكَذَٰلِكَ جَعَلْنَاكُمْ أُمَّةً وَسَطًا لِّتَكُونُوا شُهَدَاءَ عَلَى النَّاسِ وَيَكُونَ الرَّسُولُ عَلَيْكُمْ شَهِيدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And likewise We made you the best and a justly balanced nation so that you should be witnesses against mankind, and the Messenger should be a witness upon you. </strong></span>[2:143]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this nation will bear witness against the previous nations on the Day of Resurrection that their Messengers conveyed the messages of Allaah to them, based upon what they find in the Book of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, because Allaah has narrated to us the news of the previous nations and of the Messengers and of what they said to their nations. All of this we know from the Book of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, which is not approached by falsehood from in front nor from behind, which is revelation sent down by the One who is All-Wise, the One Deserving of All Praise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the Messenger he will be … </strong></span>[2:143]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam, </em>he will be upon you, O nation of Mu<u>h</u>ammad, a witness, he will witness upon you with Allaah that he indeed established the proof upon you and that he conveyed the message to you and that he sincerely advised you for Allaah’s sake. So no proof will remain on the Day of Resurrection for a person to say, “Nothing reached me. No warner came to me”. Even the unbelievers, they will confess when they are thrown into the fire. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">كُلَّمَا أُلْقِيَ فِيهَا فَوْجٌ سَأَلَهُمْ خَزَنَتُهَا أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ نَذِيرٌ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قَالُوا بَلَىٰ قَدْ جَاءَنَا نَذِيرٌ فَكَذَّبْنَا وَقُلْنَا مَا نَزَّلَ اللَّهُ مِن شَيْءٍ إِنْ أَنتُمْ إِلَّا فِي ضَلَالٍ كَبِيرٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Whenever a crowd of them are thrown into the fire its keepers will ask them, “Did not a warner come to you?” They will say, “Yes indeed a warner came to us, but we denied, and we said Allaah did not send down anything, you are upon great misguidance.” </strong></span>[67:8-9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said to the Messengers, “You are upon misguidance.” So they denied the Messengers and they declared them to be upon misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the wisdom in the sending of the Messengers – to establish the proof upon the people, and to guide whomever Allaah wished to guide. The Messengers, Allaah guides through them whoever He wishes, and He establishes the proof upon those who obstinately refuse and deny and disbelieve.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">كَمَا أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ رَسُولًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Just as we sent a Messenger to Pharaoh</strong></span> [73:15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger here is Moosaa <em>‘alaihissalaatu wassalaam </em>and the Pharaoh, he was the tyrannical king in Egypt the one who claimed lordship for himself, and the Pharaoh was the title of every king of Egypt – he was called a Pharaoh. And what is meant by it here is the Pharaoh who claimed <em>ruboobiyyah</em> (lordship) for himself.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَقَالَ أَنَا رَبُّكُمُ الْأَعْلَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">That he said: “I am you highest lord.”</span> </strong>[79:24]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَعَصَىٰ فِرْعَوْنُ الرَّسُولَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So the Pharaoh disobeyed the Messenger </strong></span>[73:16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was Moosaa, Pharaoh disbelieved in him just as Allaah has narrated in His Book, narrating what occurred between Moosaa and the Pharaoh, and how the affair of the Pharaoh and his people ended up.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> فَأَخَذْنَاهُ أَخْذًا وَبِيلًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So we seized him with punishment</span> </strong>[73:16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: We seized Pharaoh with punishement and it was that Allaah drowned him, him and his people, in the ocean. Then he entered him into the fire.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مِّمَّا خَطِيئَاتِهِمْ أُغْرِقُوا فَأُدْخِلُوا نَارًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Because of their sins they were drowned, and they were entered into fire</span>. </strong>[71:25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he is in the fire in the <em>Barzakh</em> (the intermediate life after death and before the Day of Resurrection). He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">النَّارُ يُعْرَضُونَ عَلَيْهَا غُدُوًّا وَعَشِيًّا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The fire, they are exposed to it morning and evening </strong></span>[40:46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is in the <em>Barzakh</em> before the hereafter, they are exposed to the fire morning and evening, until the Hour is established, and this is a proof for <em>‘Adhaab-ul-Qabr</em> (punishment of the grave), and Allaah’s refuge is sought.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَيَوْمَ تَقُومُ السَّاعَةُ أَدْخِلُوا آلَ فِرْعَوْنَ أَشَدَّ الْعَذَابِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And on the Day when the Hour is established it will be said, “Enter the people of Pharaoh into the severest torment.</strong></span> [40:46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is three punishments:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: that Allaah drowned them and wiped them out, all of them in a simgle moment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: that they are being punished in the <em>Barzakh </em>until the hour is established.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly</strong>: that when they are raised up on the Day of Resurrection they will enter the severest torment, and Allaah’s refuge is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise will be the case with those who disobey Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam, </em>for his outcome will be more severe than the outcome of the people of Pharaoh, because Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the most excellent one of the Messengers. So whoever disobeys him, his punishment will be worse.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> أَخْذًا وَبِيلًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>With severe punishment </strong></span>[73:16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It means severe and strong with no leniency.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَكَذَٰلِكَ أَخْذُ رَبِّكَ إِذَا أَخَذَ الْقُرَىٰ وَهِيَ ظَالِمَةٌ ۚ إِنَّ أَخْذَهُ أَلِيمٌ شَدِيدٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And thus is the punishment of your Lord when He punishes the towns for their wrongdoing. His punishment is painful and severe</span>.</strong> [11:102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this <em>aayah</em> is a proof for Allaah’s bestowing favour upon us by the sending of the Messenger Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu‘alaihiwasallam </em>to us, and that the purpose behind his being sent is that he should make clear to us the way to worship. So whoever obeys him will enter paradise, and whoever disobeys him will enter the fire, just as the people of Pharoah entered the fire when the disobeyed their messenger Moosaa <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam.</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise the enemies of the Messengers, all of them, this is their way and their path.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lessons 38 : Point 52</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to make one’s deeds purely and sincerely for Allaah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F376132877&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Making one’s deeds purely and sincerely for Allaah such that there is no <em>shirk</em> in it for Allaah will not accept any action except that which is done purely and sincerely for His Face, having no <em>shirk</em> in it nor association of others along with Him in it. And this is one of the <strong>two conditions</strong> for an action to be acceptable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <strong>second condition</strong> is <em>al-mutaaba`ah</em> (following the example of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in doing that action) and acting upon the Sunnah such that the action is in conformity with the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> such that it does not contain <em>bid`ah</em> (innovation) because Allaah does not accept innovation. Rather, He punishes for them even if a person exhausted himself in doing deeds. If he did not make the deeds purely and sincerely for Allaah, then they will be scattered dust. And if a person exhausted himself in doing a deed which is not in conformity with the Sunnah then it will be rejected. And it will not be accepted except along with these two conditions that it is done purely and sincerely for Allaah alone and it’s done in conformity with the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>وَقَالُوا لَن يَدْخُلَ الْجَنَّةَ إِلَّا مَن كَانَ هُودًا أَوْ نَصَارَىٰ ۗ تِلْكَ أَمَانِيُّهُمْ ۗ قُلْ هَاتُوا بُرْهَانَكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ</strong> &#8211; 2:111</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong style="font-size:1rem;">And they (the People of the Book) said no-one will enter Paradise except for one who is a Jew or a Christian. That is their false hope. Say, “Bring your proof if you are speaking the truth.” </strong></span><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah </em><span style="font-size:1rem;">111)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, this is to refute what they are negating.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>بَلَىٰ مَنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ لِلَّهِ وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌ فَلَهُ أَجْرُهُ عِندَ رَبِّهِ وَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ</strong> &#8211; 2:112</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Rather it will be entered by whoever submits his face to Allaah and he is a doer of good then his reward will be with his Lord and there will be no fear upon them nor will they grieve.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>112)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Whoever submits his face to Allaah,” </strong>meaning he makes his deeds purely and sincerely for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“He is a doer of good,” </strong>meaning one who is following the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and this applies to everyone, the Jews and the Christians and the rest of the world, it must be with these two conditions; with purity and sincerity for Allaah and with following the Messenger.</p>

<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Continuation of Point 04 : </strong>The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“And know, may Allaah have mercy upon you, that the Religion is only what came from Allaah, the Exalted and Most High. It was not left to the intellects of men and to their opinions; and knowledge of it is what comes from Allaah and from His Messenger. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">So do not follow anything based upon your desires and therefore depart from the Religion and leave Islaam. There will be no excuse for you, since the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam explained the Sunnah to his nation, and he made it clear to his Companions and they are the Jamaa`ah, and they are the Main Body. And the Main Body is the Truth and its people. So whoever contradicts the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam in anything of the affairs of the Religion he has disbelieved.”</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“So do not follow anything based upon your desires”</strong> &#8211; do not follow anything based upon your desires and your personal wishes, but rather your desires and wishes should follow whatever comes from Allaah and His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. So that you do not desire except what came from Allaah and His Messenger and you do not wish for, except that which came from Allaah and his Messenger, this is the path of salvation. If you were to follow your desires, you would become one of those who follow their desires and who do not follow the Revelation which has been sent down. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So if they (the people of shirk) do not respond to you </span></strong>[01]<strong><span style="color:#008000;"> then know that they are merely following their desires. And who is more astray than one who follows his desires without guidance from Allaah. Allaah does not guide a people who are disobedient wrong-doers.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Qasas (28), aayah 50)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So pass judgement between them with that which Allaah sent down; and do not abandon acting upon that in favour of their desires, so that they lead you astray from the Truth that has come to you.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Maa·idah (5), aayah 48)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Then, after the previous Prophets, We have placed you upon a clear Way with regard to the Religion so follow it and do not follow the desires of those ignorant ones who do not know. They could be of no avail to you against Allaah at all. And the wrong-doers are just allies of each other; and Allaah is the Guardian Lord of those who are dutiful to Him.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Jaathiyah (45), ayaahs 18-19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore you are between two affairs, either you will follow the correct Religion or otherwise you will be following desires. There is no third case.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and therefore depart from the Religion and exit from Islaam.”</strong> Whoever follows his desires, then he departs from the Religion, even if it be something that occurs in the distant future. To begin with he is lax about disobedience and about desires. Then the following of desires grows in seriousness until he exits from the Religion, so that his religion comes to be just whatever he desires. Just as He, the Majestic and Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do you see the one who takes whatever he desires as his object of worship, and Allaah misguides him knowing that he will not be guided, and He seals his hearing and his heart and He places upon his sight a covering.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Jaathiyah (45), aayah 23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So al-hawaa, desires, this is another object of worship (ilaah), and shirk is not restricted to just the worship of an idol or an object that is worshipped. Rather there is something else, which is al-hawaa, desires. So a person may perhaps not worship the idols, and trees and rocks and not worship graves, however he follows his desires. So he is a slave and worshipper of his desires, so it is upon the person to beware and not to follow except that which conforms to the Book and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“</strong></span><strong>Because then there will be no excuse for you, since the Messenger of Allaah sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam explained the Sunnah to his nation, and he clarified it to his Companions</strong><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>.”</strong></span> There will be no excuse/plea/argument for the one who opposes and instead follows his desires, because he went astray after the affair has been made clear and after having knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do you see the one who takes whatever he desires as his object of worship and Allaah misguides him, knowing that if guidance were to come to him he would not follow it.</strong> </span>(Sooratul-Jaathiyah (45), aayah 23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is not an ignorant person, rather he knows and he is aware of the Book and the Sunnah, and he knows and he is aware of the sayings of the People of Knowledge; however they do not agree with his desires, so therefore he abandons them and instead he takes on whatever actually agrees with his desires. This is misguidance, and Allaah&#8217;s refuge is sought. So following desires is very dangerous, so therefore it is upon a person that he should beware of the following of desires. Allaah the Majestic and Most High said to his Prophet Daawood `alayhis-salaatu was-salaam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And do not follow your desires so that they lead you astray from the path of Allaah. Those who stray from the path of Allaah will have a severe punishment on the Day of Resurrection, because of their abandoning Allaah’s commands.</strong> (Soorah Saad (38), aayah 26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Ibnul-Jawzee rahimahullah has a book in a large volume which is entitled ThammulHawaa (The Blameworthiness of Desires) and in it he brought evidences and sayings of the People of Knowledge and wise sayings which warn against the following of desires. So what is obligatory upon the person is that he takes caution against his desires because he may be saved from the worship of idols and rocks and trees and graves and he may know towheed and know the Sunnah; however he may not be secure from the following of desires, and this is a tremendous calamity. So it is upon the Muslim that he should beware of the following of desires, and rather his desires should follow on from that which came from the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, just as occurs in the hadeeth that he sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said, “None of you truly believes until his desires follow on from that which I came with.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was declared saheeh (authentic) by an-Nawawi in al-Arba`een (the 40 hadeeth) and he said, “We have it narrated to us in the book al-Hujjah with an authentic chain of narration.” [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam did not leave anything except that he clearly explained it to his nation, to the extent that one of the Companions said, “<span style="color:#008080;"><strong>Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam did not pass away and there was a bird flapping its wings in the air, except that he had mentioned to us some knowledge concerning it</strong></span>.” [03] He did not leave anything from that which mankind have a need of, from that which will draw them closer to Allaah and distance them from disbelief and misguidance except that he made is clear. And he sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008080;"><strong>“I am leaving amongst you that which if you hold onto it, you will never go astray after me; the Book of Allaah and my Sunnah”</strong></span> [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He left his nation upon clear white evidence; its night is just like its day. And when Allaah had completed through him the Religion, and perfected the favour by means of him, then he moved on to his Lord after he had conveyed the clear Message, and clearly explained the Sunnah to his Companions. And <span style="color:#008080;"><strong>he said in the address of the Farewell Hajj, “Have I conveyed the Message?” So they said, “We bear witness that you have indeed conveyed the Message and have acted sincerely. He said, “O Allaah bear witness.”</strong></span> [05] (Sooratun-Ni0saa· (4) aayah 65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And they are the Jamaa`ah and they are the Main Body.”</strong> His Companions sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam they are the Jamaa`ah, meaning they are the foundation of the Jamaa`ah, then those who followed them, then those who followed them. Just as he sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008080;"><strong>“The best of you is my generation, then those who followed them, then those who followed them.”</strong></span> [06]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Companions and Taabi`oon and the Atbaa`ut-Taabi`een, and they are the most excellent generations, they are the Jamaa&#8217;ah. And whoever comes after them, then he follows on from them. They follow on from the foundation which the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam were upon. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the first and foremost ones from the Muhaajireen and the Ansaar and those who follow them upon goodness</strong></span>. (Sooratut-Towbah (9), aayah 100)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are the Jamaa&#8217;ah whom Allaah has commanded us to be with, and whom the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam commanded us that we should be with, and whom he forbade us from separating from. And they are as-<strong>Sawaadul-A`zam</strong>, the Main Body, who are upon the Truth and upon guidance. So those people who declare that the Salaf were ignorant or unaware and who belittle their status, and those who say, “They were men and we are men,” and who say, “There is nothing to prevent us from introducing new things, and we are not bound to follow the Salaf and the sayings of the Salaf,” &#8211; this is misguidance, and Allaah&#8217;s refuge is sought. This is to separate the later part of this ummah (nation) from its first part. And if its later part indeed becomes separate from its first part it will be destroyed; and they want that the nation should be destroyed, so they bring this trick, and it is the separation of the later people from the first part of the nation. There are to be found now, people who warn against the way of the Salaf and who warn against turning back to their sayings, and who say, “That was a time that has gone by.” So they warn against what the Salaf were upon, and encourage originating new things in the Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Religion is a matter depending upon texts, and it is <strong>ittibaa</strong>`, it is to follow, it is not to innovate or originate new things. Originating new things can only be in the field of manufacturing and of worldly benefits. But as for the Religion, then nothing may be newly introduced in it after the passing away of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam; because laying down Legislation came to an end with the passing away of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. So there is nothing upon us except al-ittibaa`, to follow, and that we do not introduce anything new from our selves and say, “This is what is fitting for this time.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Maalik rahimahullah said, “<strong>Nothing will rectify the latter part of this nation, except that which rectified its first part</strong>.” [07] That which rectified its first part was the Book and the Sunnah. So nothing will rectify the last part of this nation except for the Book and the Sunnah and following the guidance of the Salafus-Saalih (Pious Predecessors).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, <strong>“And the Main Body is the Truth and its people.”</strong> &#8211; As-Sawaad, the Main Body, they are the people of the Truth, and its people, those who cling onto it. And the meaning of as- Sawaadul-A`zam, the Main Body, it does not mean merely the majority of the people/a large number of people. The meaning of as-Sawaadul-A`zam, the Main Body, is those who are upon the Truth, even if they are few in number yet still they are as-Sawaadul-A`zam, the Main Body, even if they be a single man [08]. Whoever is upon the Truth he is the Main Body. We do not look to see where the majority of the people is (what they are upon), rather we look at what they are upon. So majority/a large number may be upon misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if you were to obey most of those people who are upon the earth, they will lead you away from the Path of Allaah.</strong></span> (Sooratul-An`aam (6) aayah 116)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And most of the people, no matter how eager you are, will not be Believers.</span></strong>  Soorah Yoosuf (12) aayah 103)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And we did not find most of them to be true to their covenant, of worshipping Allaah alone and obeying him, rather we found most of them to be disobedient sinners.</span></strong> (Sooratul-A&#8217;raaf (7) aayah 102)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And many of the people are disobedient ones.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Maa·idah (5) aayah 49)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So do not be fooled by a large number of people/the majority of people, and it is not to be followed unless it is upon the Truth. Whoever is upon the Truth then he/it is the Jamaa`ah whether they are few or many. So the discerning factor is: what they are upon; is it Truth or falsehood. So if it is the Truth, then they are the Jamaa&#8217;ah, even if there is only a single person upon it; and if it is falsehood (that they are upon) then it is misguidance, even if the majority or most of the people are upon it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And whoever opposes the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam in anything from the affair of the Religion then he has disbelieved.”</strong> &#8211; he has committed disbelief; this carries a possibility of referring to major disbelief, al-kufrul-akbar, (disbelief that he has left Islam); and it carries a possibility of referring to lesser disbelief al- kufrul-asghar (that which is called disbelief but it does not take a person outside the fold of Islam); in accordance with the level of his opposition. So his saying that he has committed disbelief, it doesn’t mean that he has committed kufr and left the Religion altogether always. This maybe the case, however it maybe lesser disbelief. What is important is that conflicting with the Salaf is kufr, disbelief. It may be major disbelief; it may be lesser disbelief in accordance with the level of the opposition to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or that what is meant is that if he opposes them at the beginning of his affair with something slight, then in gradual stages he becomes worse until he departs from the Religion altogether. So his affair leads him to disbelief, if his opposition continues, his affair leads to major disbelief, so that then he exits from the Religion altogether. (So that) Satan leads him gradually, and desires, and his soul that is prompted by evil, until he departs from the Religion altogether. [09]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] <strong>Translator’s Note:</strong> addressed to the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] Reported by Ibn Abee `Aasim in as-Sunnah, al-Hasan ibn Sufyaan in al-Arba`een and al-Bayhaqee in alMadkhal ilaa Sunanil-Kubraa and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> As for Shaykh al-Albaanee rahimahullaah then he said with regard to this hadeeth in his checking of as-Sunnah of Ibn Abee `Aasim and likewise in his checking of al-Mishkaat (no. 167), the chain of narration is da`eef . It contains Nu`aym ibn Hammaad and he was weak. And al-Haafiz ibn Rajab quoted other weaknesses for it disagreeing with an-Nawawee for his declaring it saheeh so refer to his book Jaami`ul-`Uloom wal-Hikam. Then some of them such as the grandson of Muhammad ibn `Abdil-Wahhab rahimahullaah, Sulaymaan ibn `Abdillaah, he said in regards to this narration, “This chain of narration is authentic as anNawawee said, however Ibn Rajab said declaring it saheeh is something far-fetched from many aspects which he mentioned, and some people criticised that.” He said (Sulaymaan ibn `Abdillaah), “I say that its meaning is authentic/correct for certain, even if its chain of narration is not authentic. And the origin of it occurs in the Qur·aan in many places. Then he quoted a number of aayahs in that regard, such as His saying, He, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;So no by your Lord they will not believe until they make you (Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) judge in whatever disputes occur between them.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] Wakee` reported this narration in az-Zuhd, Imaam Ahmad in the Musnad and Ibn Sa&#8217;d in Tabaqaat&#8230; (and others) from a narration of Aboo Tharr radiyAllaahu `anhu. Shaykh Sulaymaan ibn `Abdillaah said in TayseerulAzeezil-Hameed, “Its chain of narration is good.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh al-Albaanee said it was saheeh, authentic, in his checking of Ibn Hibbaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] This is reported by al-Haakim in al-Mustadrak `alas-Saheehayn and by al-Bayhaqee in as-Sunan al-Kubraa and by al-Aajurree in his book ash-Sharee`ah from a hadeeth of `Abdullaah ibn `Abbaas radiyAllaahu `anhumaa. Translator’s side point: The chain of narration of al-Haakim was hasan, sound, and Shaykh al-Albaanee mentioned that in his checking of al-Mishkaat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[05] Reported by al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh (no. 67) and Muslim (no. 1671) as a hadeeth of Aboo Bakrah radiyAllaahu `anhu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[06] Reported by al-Bukhaaree (no. 3450) and in Muslim (no. 2535), as a hadeeth of `Imraan ibnul-Husayn radiyAllaahu `anhu .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[07] This is reported from him by a number of people such ash-Shaatibee in al-I`tisaam and Ibn `Abdil-Haadee in Tanqeehit-Tahqeeq. And perhaps Imaam Maalik took this point of benefit from his teacher Wahb ibn Kaysaan, for indeed Ibn `Abdil Barr reports in at-Tamheed from Imaam Maalik that he (himself) said, “Wahb ibn Kaysaan used to sit for us, and he would never get up until he had said to us, “<strong>Know that nothing will rectify the latter part of this nation, except what rectified its first part</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[08] Aboo Nu`aym said in Hilyatul-Awliyaa· that a man asked Imaam Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh “<strong>Who is the Main Body (as-Sawaadul-A`zam)?</strong>” So he said, “Muhammad ibn Aslam (that is at-Toosee) and his Companions and whoever follows him.” Then he said, “A man asked Ibnul-Mubaarak, ‘O Aboo Abdir-Rahmaan! Who is the Main Body (as-Sawaadul-A`zam)?’ So he said, ‘Aboo Hamza as-Sukkaree.’” Then Ishaaq said, “Meaning at that time it was Aboo Hamza, and in our time it is Muhammad ibn Aslam, and whoever follows him.” Then Ishaaq said, “And if you were to ask the ignorant people, ‘Who are the Main Body?’ they would say, ‘(It means) the majority of the people.’ And they do not know that the Jamaa`ah is a scholar/Person of Knowledge, adhering to the narrations of Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and his way. So whoever is with him and follows him, then he is the Jamaa`ah, and whoever opposes him in that regard, he has left the Jamaa`ah.” Then Ishaaq said, “And I have not heard a scholar for fifty years who is more knowledgeable than Muhammad ibn Aslam.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[09] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee rahimahullaah said, “The like of this phrase occurs a number of times in the speech of the author rahimahullaah, and it is to be taken to have one of three meanings:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Either it is to be taken to mean, that he (the author) intends a person who denies something that is a fundamental point of the creed and belief of the Religion and he denies it. Then he has disbelieved,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Or he intended that his deeds may lead him into disbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Or that he intended disbelief which is lesser than major disbelief, meaning rejecting (Allaah&#8217;s) favour. And it is not the case that everyone who goes against something which the Companions of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam were upon departs altogether from the Religion, for this is not from the `aqeedah of the AhlusSunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah. For indeed Anas ibn Maalik said when he came to Madeenah at the end of his life, ‘I do not recognize anything from that which I reached except for the Prayer and you are spoiling that as well.’ (This narration was brought by Imaam al-Bukhaaree) and in one narration, ‘and have you not spoiled what you have spoiled from it?’ Meaning: you pray them out of their due times; however he did not declare them to be disbelievers. And no one takes this saying of his from the people of the Sunnah to mean that the people who were in his time had become disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore his saying, ‘Whoever contradicts the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam in anything from the affairs of the Religion has committed kufr,’ it is to be taken to have one of the meanings that we have already mentioned because the `aqeedah of the Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah is that they do not declare disbelievers any one from the Muslims based upon a sin, unless it is major shirk that he has committed, or that he has denied a ruling which is agreed upon, or that he has mocked the Religion or its people or the like of that, those things which are mentioned amongst those things that break a person&#8217;s Islaam. And they do not declare anyone to be a disbeliever based just upon a sin, even if it is a major sin, even if he persists upon it and dies upon it, because the texts of the Book and the Sunnah indicate this creed and belief.
