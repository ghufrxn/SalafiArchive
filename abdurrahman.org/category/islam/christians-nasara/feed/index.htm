<p><br /><strong>إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَٱلَّذِينَ هَادُوا۟ وَٱلنَّصَـٰرَىٰ وَٱلصَّـٰبِـِٔينَ مَنْ ءَامَنَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلْـَٔاخِرِ وَعَمِلَ صَـٰلِحًۭا فَلَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ </strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Verily! Those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians, whoever believes in Allâh and the Last Day and does righteous good deeds shall have their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve</strong> (Suratul Baqarah 2:62)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">English &#8211; Tafsir Ibn Kathir</h2>



<p>Faith and doing Righteous Deeds equals Salvation in all Times</p>



<p>Allah says;</p>



<p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ امَنُواْ وَالَّذِينَ هَادُواْ وَالنَّصَارَى وَالصَّابِيِينَ مَنْ امَنَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاخِرِ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحاً فَلَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ</p>



<p>Verily, those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians (Sabi&#8217;in), whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and does righteous good deeds shall have their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.</p>



<p>After Allah described the condition &#8211; and punishment &#8211; of those who defy His commands, fall into His prohibitions and transgress set limits by committing prohibited acts, He stated that the earlier nations who were righteous and obedient received the rewards for their good deeds. This shall be the case, until the Day of Judgment. Therefore, whoever follows the unlettered Messenger and Prophet shall acquire eternal happiness and shall neither fear from what will happen in the future nor become sad for what has been lost in the past.</p>



<p>Similarly, Allah said,</p>



<p>أَلا إِنَّ أَوْلِيَأءَ اللَّهِ لَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ</p>



<p>No doubt! Verily, the Awliya of Allah, no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve. (10:62)</p>



<p>The angels will proclaim to the dying believers, as mentioned,</p>



<p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ قَالُواْ رَبُّنَا اللَّهُ ثُمَّ اسْتَقَـمُواْ تَتَنَزَّلُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمَلَـيِكَةُ أَلاَّ تَخَافُواْ وَلَا تَحْزَنُواْ وَأَبْشِرُواْ بِالْجَنَّةِ الَّتِى كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ</p>



<p>Verily, those who say:&#8221;Our Lord is Allah (alone),&#8221; and then they stand firm, on them the angels will descend (at the time of their death) (saying):&#8221;Fear not, nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of Paradise which you have been promised!&#8221; (41:30)<br />The Meaning of Mu&#8217;min, or Believer</p>



<p>Ali bin Abi Talhah narrated from Ibn Abbas, about,<br /><br />إِنَّ الَّذِينَ امَنُواْ وَالَّذِينَ هَادُواْ وَالنَّصَارَى وَالصَّابِيِينَ مَنْ امَنَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاخِرِ<br />(Verily, those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day) that Allah revealed the following Ayah afterwards,</p>



<p>وَمَن يَبْتَغِ غَيْرَ الاِسْلَـمِ دِينًا فَلَن يُقْبَلَ مِنْهُ وَهُوَ فِى الاٌّخِرَةِ مِنَ الْخَـسِرِينَ</p>



<p><strong>And whoever seeks religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers. </strong>(3:85).</p>



<p><strong>This statement by Ibn Abbas indicates that Allah does not accept any deed or work from anyone, unless it conforms to the Law of Muhammad that is, after Allah sent Muhammad. Before that, every person who followed the guidance of his own Prophet was on the correct path, following the correct guidance and was saved.</strong><br /></p>



<p class="has-vivid-red-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-30806beb3e73bb9debf8cada81e8a833"><strong>Why the Jews were called `Yahud</strong></p>



<p>The Jews are the followers of Prophet Musa, who used to refer to the Tawrah for judgment. Yahud is a word that means,</p>



<p>`repenting&#8217;, just as Musa said,<br />إِنَّا هُدْنَـا إِلَيْكَ<br />(We have Hudna (we repent, go back and return) unto You), (7:156).</p>



<p class="has-vivid-red-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9bf0f6e8e47c6c89b003334d9c77acf6"><strong>Why the Christians were called Nasara</strong></p>



<p>Allah said;</p>



<p>مَنْ أَنصَارِى إِلَى اللَّهِ قَالَ الْحَوَارِيُّونَ نَحْنُ أَنْصَارُ اللَّهِ</p>



<p>&#8220;Who will be my helpers in Allah&#8217;s cause&#8221; Al-Hawariyyun said:&#8221;We are the helpers of Allah.&#8221; (61:14)</p>



<p>It was said that;</p>



<p>they were called `Nasara&#8217;, because they inhabited a land called An-Nasirah (Nazareth), as Qatadah, Ibn Jurayj and Ibn Abbas were reported to have said, Allah knows best.<br />Nasara is certainly plural for Nasran.</p>



<p>When Allah sent Muhammad as the Last and Final Prophet and Messenger to all of the Children of Adam, mankind was required to believe in him, obey him and refrain from what he prohibited them; those who do this are true believers. The Ummah of Muhammad was called `Mu&#8217;minin&#8217; (believers), because of the depth of their faith and certainty, and because they believe in all of the previous Prophets and matters of the Unseen.<br /></p>



<p class="has-vivid-red-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-7d09a938eb2a9ee1c36bd806243e374e"><strong>The Sabi&#8217;un or Sabians</strong></p>



<p>There is a difference of opinion over the identity of the Sabians.</p>



<p>Sufyan Ath-Thawri said that Layth bin Abu Sulaym said that Mujahid said that,</p>



<p>&#8220;The Sabians are between the Majus, the Jews and the Christians. They do not have a specific religion.&#8221;</p>



<p>Similar is reported from Ibn Abi Najih.</p>



<p>Similar statements were attributed to Ata and Sa`id bin Jubayr.</p>



<p>They (others) say that;</p>



<p>the Sabians are a sect among the People of the Book who used to read the Zabur (Psalms), others say that they are a people who worshipped the angels or the stars.</p>



<p>It appears that the closest opinion to the truth, and Allah knows best, is Mujahid&#8217;s statement and those who agree with him like Wahb bin Munabbih, that;</p>



<p>the Sabians are neither Jews nor Christians nor Majus nor polytheists. Rather, they did not have a specific religion that they followed and enforced, because they remained living according to their Fitrah (instinctual nature). This is why the idolators used to call whoever embraced Islam a `Sabi&#8217;, meaning, that he abandoned all religions that existed on the earth.</p>



<p>Some scholars stated that;</p>



<p>the Sabians are those who never received a message by any Prophet.</p>



<p>And Allah knows best</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَا إِكْرَاهَ فِي الدِّينِ ۖ قَد تَّبَيَّنَ الرُّشْدُ مِنَ الْغَيِّ ۚ فَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِالطَّاغُوتِ وَيُؤْمِن بِاللَّهِ فَقَدِ اسْتَمْسَكَ بِالْعُرْوَةِ الْوُثْقَىٰ لَا انفِصَامَ لَهَا ۗ وَاللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>No-one is to be compelled to enter the Religion, true guidance has been made clear and distinct from falsehood.  So whoever rejects <em>at Taaghoot</em> and truly believes in Allaah, then he has grasped the firmest handhold that will never break. And Allaah is All Hearing, All Knowing. </strong></span>[2:256]<span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>83</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">83</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Perfect and Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَا إِكْرَاهَ فِي الدِّينِ ۖ قَد تَّبَيَّنَ الرُّشْدُ مِنَ الْغَيِّ ۚ فَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِالطَّاغُوتِ وَيُؤْمِن بِاللَّهِ فَقَدِ اسْتَمْسَكَ بِالْعُرْوَةِ الْوُثْقَىٰ لَا انفِصَامَ لَهَا ۗ وَاللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>No one is to be compelled to enter the Religion, true guidance has been made clear and distinct from falsehood.  So whoever rejects at <em>Taaghoot</em> and truly believes in Allaah, then he has grasped the firmest handhold that will never break. And Allaah is All Hearing, All Seeing.</strong></span>[2:256]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>No one is to be compelled to enter the Religion…</strong><strong> : </strong>Meaning – no one is to be forced to enter into Islaam against his will, because entering into Islaam must occur as a result of being convinced and from believing in the heart. And no one is to be forced into it against his will – this is not possible because no one can act with regards to the hearts except Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. No one may force anyone to enter Islaam because we do not possess and own the hearts. Rather it is just Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, He is the One who owns them and acts with regards to them. However we should call to Islaam and encourage people upon it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We strive and fight in Allaah’s Cause against whoever disbelieves, for the spread of Islaam and to provide an opportunity to whoever wants to accept Islaam, and in order to subdue the enemies of Allaah. But as for guidance, then it is in the Hand of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. No one is to be forced upon eemaan and Islaam. Rather this is something which relates back to the person himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; قَد تَّبَيَّنَ الرُّشْدُ مِنَ الْغَيِّ &#8230;</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>…true guidance has been made clear and distinct from falsehood…</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Islaam, and all praise is for Allaah, does not contain anything which people have to be forced upon against their will. Rather all of it is beloved and desirable. Whereas kufr and shirk, all of it is evil and all of it is something detestable. So this has become clear from that. As <em>rushd</em> (guidance) – and it is the Truth – has become distinguished from <em>al-ghayy</em> – and it is falsehood. And a person has intellect and has the ability to think so that he can weigh and compare truth against falsehood. And his thinking, if it is sound and if it is free from desires and ulterior motives, then his sound thinking will guide him to acceptance of the truth without having to be forced. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>This is one saying</strong></span> with regards to the <em>aayah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the second saying</strong></span> is that this aayah came down with regard to the People of the Book; and that the People of the Book are not to be compelled to enter into Islaam. Rather if they want to remain upon their religion then they are to be left to do so with the condition that they hand over the <em>jizyah</em> to the Muslims and they (the People of the Book) are in a state of being humbled. And as for other than them from the disbelievers, then nothing will be accepted from them except Islaam or being killed because they have no religion; and idol worship is a false and futile religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">And the third saying</span></strong> is that this <em>aayah</em> was abrogated by the <em>aayah</em> commanding <em>jihaad</em>. So this was the case initially before <em>jihaad</em> was legislated, then <em>jihaad</em> was legislated and the <em>aayah</em> was abrogated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However the first (of the three sayings) is what is correct &#8211; that the <em>aayah</em> is not abrogated and that the religion cannot be entered into the hearts by force. Rather it can only enter through choice. However whoever does not accept the Religion, he will be dealt with in a manner that befits him, whether it be being killed or having the <em>jizyah</em> tax taken from him if he be from those regarding whom Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, has legislated that it be taken from.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; فَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِالطَّاغُوتِ وَيُؤْمِن بِاللَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So whoever rejects <em>at-Taaghoot</em> and truly believes in Allaah…</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>At-Taaghoot</em> – what is meant is all of the <em>Taaghoots</em> in worship, in following or in obedience because the word “<em>at-Taaghoot</em>” here is left general.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rejecting the <em>Taaghoot</em> was put before having <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah (in the <em>aayah</em>) because having <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah will not benefit except after rejection of the <em>Taaghoot</em>. So whoever believes in Allaah but does not reject the <em>Taaghoot</em>, then his eemaan will not benefit him. So the person who says that he is a believer and he prays and he fasts and gives the <em>Zakaat</em> and performs the <em>Hajj</em> and he performs the acts of obedience but he does not dissociate himself from <em>shirk</em> nor from the people of <em>shirk</em> and says, “<em>They are not my business</em>” – this person will not be counted as a Muslim because he has not rejected the <em>Taaghoot</em>. So there must be rejection of the <em>Taaghoot</em> and it is to reject the <em>Taaghoot</em> and to believe as creed in its (the <em>Taaghoot’s</em>) falsehood and to distance oneself from it and from its people – this is essential. So his <em>eemaan</em> will not be correct except after rejecting the <em>Taaghoot</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in the other <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِي كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولًا أَنِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُوا الطَّاغُوتَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We sent a messenger to every nation commanding, “Worship Allaah alone and avoid the <em>Taaghoot</em>!” </strong></span>[16:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the worship of Allaah will not be correct except through avoiding the <em>Taaghoot</em>. Two opposites cannot come together; <em>eemaan</em> and <em>kufr</em> cannot come together in the heart. <em>Eemaan</em> and major <em>kufr</em> cannot come together in the heart. As for the lesser <em>kufr</em> then it can come together (with <em>eemaan</em>).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ibn Taymiyyah rahimahullaah wrote a letter to the then Christian King of Cyprus inviting him to Islam and exposing the lies and corruption being committed by the priests and monks whilst they knew fully well that they were upon falsehood. After mentioning the devoutness of the King, his love for knowledge and good conduct towards the people, Ibn Taymiyyah then invited him to embrace Islam and adopt the correct belief. He did this in a gentle and exemplary manner addressing his intellect, and entrusted him to behave benevolently towards the Muslims in Cyprus, not to strive to change the religion of a single one of them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Below are some examples taken from your Gospels [11] that confirm and support what Muhammad came with from the Qur’aan and his teachings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the seventh verse of Chapter 4 of the Gospel of Mathew, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Jesus said to him: ‘Again it is written, You shall not tempt the Lord your God.’”</strong></span> [Matthew 4:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. In this same chapter, there occurs a story about Jesus and the Devil, in which the Devil ordered Jesus to prostrate to him. So the Messiah Jesus responded to him, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Be gone Satan, for it is written: &#8216;You shall worship (prostrate only to) the Lord your God and Him only shall you serve (i.e. worship).’”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what all the messengers came with and it is the argument that Jesus used against the Devil. So this clearly proves that all of the prophets including Jesus and Muhammad came to establish that God was One and that He was the Lord and only One deserving of being worshipped.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jesus relied on the previously revealed books (from God) as proof, which state that God is the only Lord and that He is the only One who has the right to be worshipped and prostrated to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, Allaah revealed to (Prophet) Muhammad: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And We indeed sent to every nation a messenger (saying to his people): ‘Worship Allaah alone and avoid the false deities.’ So amongst them were those whom Allaah guided and amongst them were those whose misguidance was justified.”</strong></span> [Qur’aan 16:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also revealed to him: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And We did not send any messenger before you except that We revealed to him: ‘There is no deity that has the right to be worshipped in truth, except Me, so worship Me alone.’”</strong></span> [Qur’aan 23:25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these statements that were revealed to Muhammad are in complete conformity with what Jesus stated in his reply to the Devil. It is also in conformity with what Jesus said when calling the Tribe of Israel:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Verily, Allaah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. This is the Straight Path.”</strong></span> [Qur’aan 19:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it agrees with what he will say on the Day of Judgement when his Lord will ask him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“O Jesus, son of Mary, did you tell the people: ‘Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allaah?’ He will reply: ‘Glory be to You! It was not for me to say what I had no right to say. If I had said such a thing, You would have surely known about it. You know what is in my inner self though I do not know what is in Your Self. Truly, only You are the All-Knowing of all that is hidden. I did not tell them anything except for what You commanded me to tell them, (which was): Worship Allaah, my Lord and your Lord. And I served as a witness for them for as long as I was with them. But when You took me up, You were the Watcher over them, and You are a Witness to all things.’”</span></strong> [Qur’aan 5:116-117]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. In Chapter 11 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 25, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“At that time Jesus declared: ‘I thank thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that Thou hast hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to babes (infants).’”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Jesus was one of God’s servants and messengers. He acknowledged the right of his Lord who created him and bestowed His blessings on him, and therefore turned to Him, in thanks and affirmation that He alone was the Lord of the heaven and earth. This is since He is the One who created these two creations (the heaven and the earth), as well as everything inside them, in between them and whatever lies below the ground. No one else had any part in this – neither Jesus or anyone else – nor can anyone rival Him in that matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. In Chapter 14 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 23, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And after he had dismissed the crowds, he (Jesus) went up on the mountain by himself to pray.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Prayer is one of the greatest acts of worship that can be performed to God, and no one engages in it except for a lowly servant who stands in need of the mercy of his Lord and Creator. This is as Allaah says in the Qur’aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“O mankind! It is you who stand in need of Allaah, whereas Allaah is Rich (free of all needs), Most Praiseworthy.”</span> </strong>[Qur’aan 35:15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The Messiah (Jesus) will never be too proud to reject being a servant of God, nor the angels who are the ones close (to Him). And whoever is too proud and rejects worshipping Him, then He will gather them all together unto Himself.”</strong> </span>[Qur’aan 4:172]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Jesus was a servant of God, and he was not nor will he ever be too proud to worship Him. This is his condition and the condition of all of the prophets and angels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. In Chapter 26 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 39, it states that the Messiah (Jesus):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“fell on his face and prayed, ‘My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as Thou wilt.’”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in this text, there is proof that Jesus was a servant (worshipper) of God who had no control over repelling harm from himself or bringing benefit to himself. And there is evidence in this text that he sought refuge in God during times of hardship, seeking His assistance and humbling himself before Him, in order to remove the harm and danger that was approaching him. So he fell prostrate with his face on the ground, seeking nearness to Him, lowering himself before Him, showing his need for Him and expressing the belief that no one has the ability to repel harm except Him. This is the state of all of the messengers, not to mention all of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. In Chapter 21 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 46, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“But when they tried to arrest him, they feared the multitudes, since they held him to be a prophet.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is proof in this verse that the masses of people who believed in God and in Jesus were monotheists with pure and sincere faith, and that they believed that Jesus was a messenger and a prophet. This proves that their prophet, Jesus, had taught them this and cultivated them to believe in that. So they did not used to believe that he was God or the son of God, since he would not teach the people these things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. In Chapter 23 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 10, it states that Jesus said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“Neither be called masters, for you, even the Messiah, has One master.”</span> </strong>[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This text resembles the Qur’anic text in which Allaah informs us that His messenger Jesus told the Tribe of Israel: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“And verily, Allaah is my Lord and your Lord.”</span></strong> [Qur’aan 3:51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah is the Lord of Jesus, as well as his Master, Nurturer and Owner. He is the Lord, Master and Owner of all mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslim scholar, Taqee-ud-Deen al-Hilaalee, pointed out in his treatise “Clear Evidences” that: Some translators have distorted this text, but that the English translation was saved from this corruption.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. In Chapter 17 of the Gospel of John, verse 3, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And this is the eternal life – that they know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This text confirms that which all of the messengers came with, which was that there is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and it confirms that Jesus was a messenger of God. This was during his time, and every nation had its own time and messenger, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“And We did not send any messenger before you except that We revealed to him: ‘There is no deity that has the right to be worshipped in truth, except Me, so worship Me alone.’”</span> </strong>[Qur’aan 21:25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“And We indeed sent to every nation a messenger (saying to his people): ‘Worship Allaah alone and avoid the false deities.’”</span></strong> [Qur’aan 16:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. In Chapter 12 of the Gospel of Mark, verses 28-30, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he (Jesus) answered them well, asked him, ‘Which commandment is the first of all?’ Jesus answered, ‘The first is: Hear, O Israel! The Lord our God, the Lord is One. And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.&#8217;”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the first commandment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in verse 32 of the same chapter, it states that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“The scribe said to him, ‘You are right, teacher. You have truly said that He is One, and there is no other but He.’”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then in verse 34 of the same chapter, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And when Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, ‘You are not far from the kingdom of God.’”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This first commandment mentioned by Jesus is the same commandment that Allaah prescribed to all of His messengers, including Jesus – and this was the commandment that the messengers passed on to their nations:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“He has ordained for you the same religion that He ordained for Noah and which We revealed to you (O Muhammad) and ordained for Abraham, Moses and Jesus – that you should establish the Religion and make no divisions in it. Intolerable for the polytheists is that which you call them to.”</span></strong> [Qur’aan 42:13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The religion that God ordained for them was the pure monotheistic Faith, which is represented in the statement: “There is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah.” He ordered all of his messengers to call to this, and it is that which the polytheists found difficult to accept and for which reason they fought against God’s messengers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the same thing that Abraham and Jacob, also known as Israel, commanded the people with, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“And remember when Abraham and (his son) Ishmael were raising the foundations of the House (Ka’bah at Makkah), saying: ‘Our Lord! Accept this from us. Verily, You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knower. Our Lord! Make us submissive unto You, and of our offspring, a nation submissive unto You. And show us how to perform the ceremonies required during the pilgrimage (to the Ka’bah), and accept our repentance. Truly, You are the One who accepts repentance, the Most Merciful. Our Lord! Send amongst them a messenger of their own (i.e. Muhammad), who shall recite unto them Your verses and teach them the Book and the Wisdom (Prophetic Teachings), and purify them. Verily, You are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.’ And who turns away from the religion of Abraham except for he who fools himself? Truly, We chose him in this world and in the Hereafter, he will be among the righteous. When his Lord said to him: ‘Submit yourself’, he said: ‘I have submitted myself (as a Muslim) to the Lord of all that exists.’ And this (submission to Allaah) was enjoined by Abraham upon his sons, and also by Jacob, saying: ‘O my sons! Allaah has chosen for you the (true) religion, so do not die except while you are Muslims (i.e. submitting to the Will of your Creator).’ Or were you witnesses when death approached Jacob? – When he said to his sons: ‘What will you worship after me?’ They said: ‘We shall worship your God, the God of your forefathers – Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac – One God and to Him we submit (as Muslims).’”</span></strong> [Qur’aan 2:127-133]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is truly a tremendous religion, in which they submitted their will to the Lord of all that exists, turned to Him in repentance and sought refuge in Him to make their offspring an offspring that submit themselves to God. And they invoked Him to send a messenger from amongst them to them who would recite His verses unto them, teach them the Book and the Wisdom and purify them – the purification and wisdom that would keep them far away from polytheism, foolishness and misguidance. And Allaah rules here that whoever turns away from this religion, which is pure monotheism, only fools himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point derived from this is that the call of all of the prophets was in harmony in that they were calls to Monotheism and to Submission (to God) and that there was no deity that had the right to be worshipped except Allaah. They called their nations to this and counseled those who came after them from their offspring to abide by this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second point we want to focus on here, was the counsel of Israel, who was also known as Jacob. The text of the Bible in this regard is in conformity with the text from the Qur’aan in that the Biblical text indicates we should have love for God. This is also part of Islaam. In fact, the Religion of Islaam also consists of many aspects and great deeds apart from love (for the Creator).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look at how Jesus responded and what his tremendous counsel was. And look at the faith of the scribe who had asked the question looking for an answer to benefit from, and his statement: “<strong>You are right Teacher. You have truly said that He is One, and there is no other but He.</strong>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And look at how the Messiah responded to him, saying <strong>“You are not far from the kingdom of God.”</strong> This, and Allaah knows best, is a promise from him that he will be in Paradise, and it indicates that anyone who doesn’t believe in the Oneness of God and that He alone should be worshipped will not be allowed entry into Paradise. This is similar to what Allaah says in the Qur’aan, relaying to us what Jesus said to the Tribe of Israel:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Worship Allaah, who is my Lord and your Lord. Verily, whoever ascribes partners to Allaah in worship, Allaah will surely make Paradise forbidden for him and his final abode will be the Hellfire. And the wrongdoers will not have any supporters (in Hell).”</span></strong> [Qur’aan 5:72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Note: According to the language of the Torah and the Gospels, every righteous and dutiful follower of God is called a son of God, so Jesus was not particularized with this expression of “son of God.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. In Chapter 5 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 9, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. And in verse 45 of Chapter 5 of the Gospel of Matthew, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“So that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. In verse 4 of the Gospel of Matthew, Chapter 5, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“You, therefore, must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. In Chapter 6 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 1, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“Beware of practicing your piety before men in order to be seen by them, for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. In Chapter 23 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 9, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven.”</strong></span> [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These verses show that use of the terms “father” and “son” to refer to the connection between the Lord and His servant was a practice established in the Bible for all people, so the Messiah, Jesus, was not specifically characterized with this apart from others. [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps all of this was from the behavior of some of the Jews and Christians, but God knows best. This is since Allaah says in the Qur’aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“The Jews and the Christians say: ‘We are the children of God and His beloved ones.’ Say: ‘Why then does He punish you for your sins?’ Nay, you are but human beings from those He has created. He forgives whom He wills and He punishes whom He wills. And to Allaah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them. And to Him is the final return.”</span></strong> [Qur’aan 5:18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Any fair and balanced person with sound intellect will realize that the Qur’anic texts we mentioned contain in them a tribute, honor, warm reception and high praise for Jesus. And they confirm that he was a prophet and a messenger, and that he was one of the greatest messengers who carried the banner of Monotheism, called mankind to this Monotheistic Faith, which means making all worship purely for God alone, fought against polytheism, and warned those who adhere to it (polytheism) that they would reside eternally in the Hellfire – what an evil destination!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These verses from the Qur’aan also show how God absolved Jesus and his mother from the slander that the Jews accused them of, how He raised the status of Jesus and his mother and made the statements of the Jews against him and his mother to be considered as disbelief and immense slander.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the texts of the Qur’aan and the Bible are in conformity with the fact that Jesus was a servant and messenger of God. This is a perfect state that no one can attain except for the great messengers amongst whom was Jesus. The teachings of Prophet Muhammad also professed the same beliefs and the Muslims believed in all of this. So what then is wrong with Islaam and the Muslims? There is nothing wrong with it at all, in the eyes of those with sound intellects and impartiality. Rather, the wrong is against God Himself, since the terrible statement (that Jesus is the son of God), due to which the heavens are ready to tear apart, the earth split asunder, and the mountains fall in ruins is the opposite of what is indicated in the Qur’aan, the teachings of Prophet Muhammad and what the Muslims adhere to, not to mention what the monotheistic texts still preserved in the Bible indicate.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] Translator’s Note: The translation used for Biblical quotes in this booklet are from the Revised Standard Version of the Bible, which can be accessed on-line at bible.com. It should be noted that currently there are many translations of the Gospels (New Testament) in the English Language. The average person can view the various translations and notice gross changes/alterations in the interpretation and translation of many verses of the Bible, not to mention some being left out completely. This is a further proof that the Bible has been distorted and altered as confirmed by God in His Final Revelation, the Qur’aan, which He guaranteed to protect and preserve in its original form. Allaah says: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Verily, We sent down the Reminder (the Qur’aan) and We will surely preserve it (from corruption).”</strong></span> [Qur’aan 15:9] The likes of this promise and guarantee from God was not made for His previous revelations, hence the obvious and noticeable contradictions in the present-day versions of these revealed Books of God – the Torah and the Gospels.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] Translator’s Note: The use of the relationship of Father and Son to refer to the connection between God and His righteous servants is not just limited to the New testament of the Bible, rather, there can be found proof for it in the Old Testament as well:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“The sons of God saw that the daughters of men were fair; and they took to wife such of them as they chose.”</span> [Genesis 6:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men that were of old, the men of renown.”</span> [Genesis 6:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of men, he fixed the bounds of the peoples according to the number of the sons of God.”</span> [Deuteronomy 32:8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came among them.”</span> [Job 1:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?”</span> [Job 38:7]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s Note:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further evidence from the New Testament that confirms this point that the use of the relationship between Father and Son as a substitute for the relationship between God and His servant is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“For they cannot die any more, because they are equal to angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.”</span> [Luke 20:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.”</span> [Romans 8: 14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“But to all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God.”</span> [John 1:12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“And not for the nation only, but to gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.”</span> [John 11:52]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“It is the Spirit himself bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of God.”</span> [Romans 8:16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“…because the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain the glorious liberty of the children of God.”</span> [Romans 8:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“That you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world.”</span> [Philippians 2:15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“See what love the Father has given us – that we should be called children of God; and so we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him.”</span> [1 John 3:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"> “By this it may be seen who are the children of God, and who are the children of the Devil, Whoever does not do right is not of God, nor he who does not love his brother.”</span> [1 John 3:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandment.”</span> [1 John 5:2]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily, the example of Jesus in the sight of Allaah is like the example of Adam – He created him from dust and then said to him ‘Be’ and he was. This is the truth from your Lord, so do not be from those who doubt. So whoever disputes with you concerning him (i.e. Jesus) after all this knowledge (about him) has come to you, say: ‘Come, let us summon our children and your children, our women and your women and ourselves and yourselves and then invoke God to send His curses on those of us who is lying.’ Verily, this is the true story (about Jesus). And there is no God that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah. And indeed Allaah is the All-Mighty, All-Wise.”</strong> [Qur’aan 3:59-62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This great example is a decisive proof that cancels out all the claims of the Christians. This is because if it is not possible or correct according to sound minds, religious doctrines, and innate natures to claim that Adam, whom God created from dust with His Hands and breathed into him his soul, is God or the son of God or part of a divine trinity, then it is for all the more reason that such cannot be claimed for Jesus. This is since the creation of Adam was more remarkable and amazing than that of Jesus, as he was created from dust and dust is not part of the human race.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, Jesus was created from a woman, who is part of the human race, and she carried him in her womb in the same manner that woman carry children, and gave birth to him in the same manner that women give birth to children. So this is from the greatest of proofs that invalidate the false claims and absurd misconceptions of the Christians.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a matter of fact, the angels were created from light without any fathers or mothers, and the Devil was created from fire without any parents. So this is something more remarkable and indicative of the great Ability of God, the Creator, Molder and Originator of the heavens and earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, the creation of Eve from the rib of Adam, without any mother, was more miraculous than the creation of Jesus, who was conceived, carried in the womb of a woman and given birth to just as normal women give birth to children. So there does not remain any connection for the Christians according to every person possessing intellect, religion and fairness. But in spite of all this, Jesus, in the eyes of Islaam and the Muslims is far more superior than Adam and many of the other prophets and messengers, according to the Qur’aan and the teachings of Prophet Muhammad. This is since Jesus is one of the five messengers possessing strong will and determination, according to Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So after all this has been said, what is it that will change between the Christians and Islaam, which is the true religion of God and the religion of Jesus and all of the prophets? Won’t they realize that the greatest form of misguidance and disbelief is to claim that God has a wife and a child, since this is the biggest insult and debasement that can be leveled against God, Lord of all that exists? And the greatest denial of Jesus is to disbelieve in the true message that he brought, such as by saying that he is the son of God, etc., even though he clearly stated from the very first day that he was a slave of God who gave him Revelation, made him a prophet, blessed him wherever he was and entrusted him with prayer and charity. These are characteristics that apply to a created being that is raised and nurtured and in need of his Lord, submitting himself to His Majesty and obedient to His commands.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allaah, the Beneficent, the Most Merciful</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;I begin to write:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah. We praise Him, and seek His help and forgiveness. We seek refuge in Allaah, Most High, from the evils of our own selves and from our wicked deeds. Whomever Allaah guides cannot be misguided, and whomever He leads astray cannot be guided. I testify that there is no true God worthy of being worshipped except Allaah, alone, without partner or associate. I further testify that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم).1 May Allaah’s salaah and salaam also be granted to the Prophet’s pure family and to all of his noble companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O you who believe! Fear Allaah [by doing all that He ordered and abstaining from all that He forbade] as He should be feared [obey Him, be thankful to Him, and remember Him always] and die not except in a state of Islaam&#8221;</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Aal-’Imraan (3:102)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">O mankind! Be dutiful to your Rabb [2] [Allaah], Who created you from a single person [Adam] and from him [Adam] He created his wife [Eve], and from them both He created many men and women. And fear Allaah through Whom you demand your mutual [rights] and [do not cut the relations of] the wombs [kinship]. Surely, Allaah is ever an All-Watcher over you.</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat An-Nisaa’ (4:1)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him, and speak [always] the truth. He will direct you to do righteous good deeds and will forgive you your sins. And whosoever obeys Allaah and His Messenger has indeed achieved a great success.</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Ahzaab (33:70-71)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most truthful speech is that of Allaah&#8217;s Book [the Qur’aan] and that the best of guidance is that of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم). The worst of evils are the muhdathaat (newly-invented matters [in the deen] [3], and every innovated matter (in the deen) is a bid’ah; every bid’ah is a dalaalah (misguidance), and every dalaalah is in the Fire of Hell.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We hear nowadays a strange call by organized groups involving some Christians, Jews, and “Muslim” intellectuals calling for <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>wahdatul adyaan</strong></span>. They claim that these three religions stand for the same belief that there is One God and should unite in their call for the implementation of great moral values. Some of those involved call for the establishment of centers containing churches, synagogues, and massaajid side by side, printing the Qur’aan, the Bible, and the Torah in one binding, etc. In the name of defending Islaam against political and media distortions in the West, some organizations are compromising the basics of the Isamic creed through what is called “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Bridging the Faiths</strong></span>.”[4] This is a very dangerous call because it mixes the truth with falsehood and thus practically implies the elimination of the truth perfected in the deen of Islaam. The Christians and Jews want the Muslims to be like them. That is why they support this deceptive call for “unity”. Allaah (Azza wa Jal) spoke of their attempts and called the Muslims to be aware of them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">They wish that you reject Faith, as they have rejected (Faith), and thus that you all become equal (like one another).</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat An-Nisaa’ (4:89)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the fundamental beliefs in Islaam is the kufr (unbelief) of the Christians and Jews because they reject the Qur’aan and the message of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to them. They have also altered their books in such a way that it permits or even enjoins worship of other than Allaah and (or) the association of partners with Him in worship. <strong><span style="color:#333300;">Any Muslim who doubts their kufr is a kaafir himself.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some Mulsims who do not understand certain texts from the Qur’aan and (or) authentic sunnah and may be easily deceived by the call for “unity of religions”. It is important to know that if certain texts are not clear to some they are clear to others from those who are firm in the knowledge of the deen.[5] Consequently, nothing stays unclear for those who are seeking the truth and not just following vain desires. For example, some may understand that the following text is evidence that the Jews and Christians are not kufaar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Verily! Those who believe and those Jews and Christians, and Sabians,[6] whoever believes in Allaah and the Last Day, and work righteousness shall have their reward with their Rabb [Allaah], on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.</em></span> [Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat Al-Baqarah (2:62)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh-ul-Islaam bin Taymeeyah said: “The aayah (above) tells about the followers of these four unaltered milal (Paths) before abrogation [by the advent of Prophet Muhammad’s complete message.].” [7] It, therefore, addresses those who believed in tawheed and followed the Path of Allaah as was known to them. Those who continued on this belief and did not alter the Scriptures must follow the Qur’aan and the Message of Islaam as explained by Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم). Furthermore, the order of the explained, رضي الله عنهما above aayah, as ibn ‘Abbaas was canceled by aayah 3:85, which states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever seeks a religion other than Islaam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.</span></em> [Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat Aal-’Imraan (3: 85)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Following the alterations in their religion, most of the People of the Book turned kufaar and few remained on the original teachings of the Torah and the Gospel. This is clear in the Qur’anic texts where Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And had the People of the Scriptures believed,[8] it would have been better for them; among them are some who have faith,[9] but most of them are al-Faasiqoon [Disobedient to Allaah and His Messenger, and rebellious against Allaah&#8217;s Command].</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Aal-’Imraan (3:110)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Following the above description, Allaah (Azza wa Jal) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Not all of them are alike; a party of the People of the Scripture stand for the right, they recite the aayaat of Allaah during the hours of the night, prostrating themselves in prayer. They believe in Allaah and the Last Day; they enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong, and they hasten in good works; and they are among the righteous</span></em>. [Qur’aan, Soorat Aal-’Imraan (3:112-114)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This party includes those who held to the original Scriptures before they were abrogated by Qur’aan and sunnah. They were on the right religion enjoining tawheed and forbidding shirk, just as Allaah described the believing followers of Mûsa (alaihis salam):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And of the people of Mûsa there is a community who lead [the men] with truth and establish justice [i.e. judge men with truth and justice].</span> </em>[Qur’aan, Soorat Al-A’raaf (7:159)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever held to these qualities amongst them (i.e. to the true revelations), prior to the advent of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم), was a believer. The believers from the People of the Book who accepted the Prophet&#8217;s Message of Islaam will receive a double reward:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And who believe in that which has been sent down [revealed] to you [Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم]10 and in that which was sent down before you [the Torah and the Gospel, etc.] and they believe with certainty in the Hereafter.</span> </em>[Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Baqarah (2:4)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And there are, certainly, among the People of the Scripture, those who believe in Allaah and in that which has been revealed to you, and that which has been revealed to them, humbling themselves before Allaah. They do not sell the aayaat of Allaah for a little price, for them is a reward with their Rabb [Allaah]. Surely, Allaah is Swift in account.</span></em>[11] [Qur’aan, Soorat Aal-’Imraan (3:199)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Those to whom We gave the Scripture [i.e. the Torah and the Injeel etc.] before it,—they believe in it [the Qur&#8217;aan]. And when it is recited to them, they say: “We believe in it. Verily, it is the truth from our Rabb. Indeed even before it we have been from those who submit themselves to Allaah in Islaam as Muslims [like ‘Abdullaah bin Saalam and Salmaan Al-Faarisee, etc.].”These will be given their reward twice over, because they are patient, and repel evil with good, and spend [in charity] out of what we have provided for them.</span> </em>[Qur’aan¸ Soorat Al-Qasas (28:52-54)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been confirmed that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“Three persons will get their reward twice [i.e. a double reward]. [One is] a person who has a slave girl and he educates her properly and teaches her good manners properly [without violence] and then manumits and marries her. Such a person will get a double reward. [Another is] a believer from the People of the Scriptures who has been a true believer [in his Prophet],* and then he believes in the Prophet [Muhammad-صلى الله عليه و سلم]. Such a person will receive a double reward. [The third is] a slave man who observes Allaah&#8217;s rights and is sincere to his master [and observes the rights of his master]*.”</em></span> [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur’aan also mentions the case of believing monks and priests who followed the true teachings of ‘Eessa (alaihis salam) and who believe in the revelation to Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and would love to be from the ummah of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, you will find the strongest among men in enmity to the believers [Muslims] the Jews and pagans; and you will find the nearest amongst them in love to the believers those who say: “We are Nassara (Christians).” [13] That is because amongst them there are priests and monks, and they are not proud. And when they [who call themselves Christians] listen to what has been sent down to the Messenger [(صلى الله عليه و سلم)], you see their eyes overflowing with tears because of the truth they have recognized. They say: “Our Rabb! We believe, so write us down among the witnesses [Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and his nation]. And why should we not believe in Allaah and in that which has come to us of the Truth [tawheed]? And we wish that our Rabb will admit us [in al-Jannah on the Day of Resurrection] along with the righteous people [Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and his So, Allaah rewarded them .[رضي الله عنهم companions with Gardens under which rivers flow [in al-Jannah], they will abide therein forever, because of what they said. Such is the reward of good-doers.</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Maa’idah (5: 82)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The aayaat cited above are some of the qualities of the believing Christians, who believed in the true Message of Jesus (a’leihis-salaam). In our times, any “Christian” who holds to similar beliefs and hears of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) must accept him and accept that which he is entrusted with (i.e. Islaam). Then he is a believer. If they know about Islaam, they must declare their acceptance of it unless it will result in their death. They are called then to migrate to daarul-Islaam if they are able to.Otherwise they are called to exert that which they are able to, and Allaah knows best. [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in case he never heard of the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم), then his case rests with Allaah15 in light of Allaah’s saying: <em><span style="color:#008000;">“And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger.”</span></em> [Qur’aan, soorat al-Israa’, 17: 15].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Some Muslims say: “But Allaah (Azza wa Jal) had mentioned in the Qur’aan that there are churches, synagogues, and monasteries where the Name of Allaah is mentioned. So, how can we understand this in light of the above explanations about the People of the Book?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is due to Allaah. The aayah in the Qur’aan where the above places are mentioned is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Had it not been that Allaah checks one set of people by means of another, monasteries, churches, synagogues, and masaajid, wherein the Name of Allaah is mentioned much would assuredly have been pulled down.</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Hajj (22:40)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The masaajid are the places where the Name of Allaah was and still being mentioned. When they were on their original faith, the People of the Book mentioned the Name of Allaah in their places of worship. However, because of the alterations in their religions, shirk in worship was introduced, even though some of them may mention the Name of Allaah. Hence, their places of worship cannot be considered as boyoutullaah (Houses of Allaah), because they committed kufr and their places contain a wide range of blasphemous symbols (pictures, crosses, etc.).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam ibnul Qayyim</strong> said: [16] “Had it not been for Allaah&#8217;s checking of one set of people by means of another, these places (mentioned in the aayah) which were beloved to Allaah before Islaam (i.e. in its final and comprehensive form), would have been pulled down. After Islaam, these places are known to Allaah, but hated. Allaah, for example commanded special treatment to the People of the Book under the Islamic Rule, including their protection, yet He (Azza wa Jal) hates them. He commanded the defending of their places of worship, yet He hates them because other than He is being worshipped in such places&#8230;” [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Atiyyah said: “He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) checked them when they were on the Truth before the alterations and abrogation [i.e. of their religions].” [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Light of the Above, all the present nations of Jews, Christians, Sabians (if any are left), and those who worshipped Allaah based upon their fitrah,[19] must come to the Final Message from Allaah, and submit to Him alone in Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The People of the Book as they exist now accepted other than Allaah as deities. No doubt that they are kufaar as Allaah (صلى الله عليه و سلم) refers to them. When they according to ,عليهما السلام followed Mûsa and ‘Eessa the unaltered Torah and the original Gospel, respectively, they were Muslims then. Does a knowledgeable Muslim believe that those who think of ‘Eessa as Savior, a son of God, Three in One, etc. are believers?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Surely, in disbelief are they who say that Allaah is the Messiah, son of Mary!</span> </em>[Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Maa’idah (5:17)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Are those who believe in Trinity believers in tawheed? Allaah says about them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Surely, disbelievers are those who said: “Allaah is the third of the three [in a Trinity].” But there is no True God but One God [Allaah].</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Maa’idah (5:73)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They remain as people of the Book since a Book was revealed to their respective Prophets. Whoever says he is a believer in their Books, even in their altered forms, is from the People of the Book. Any Christian or Jew, who dissociates himself from his respective Book and denies it, cannot be considered as being from the People of the Book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, Allaah, the All-Wise and All-Just, legislated certain guidelines that define certain relationships between the Muslims and the People of the Book. Amongst such relations, is marriage to the ‘afeefah (chaste) women of them,[20] eating their lawfully slaughtered meat, etc. Such distinctions do not make them true believers in Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh-ul-Islaam ibn Taymeeyah commented on the following aayaat:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Those who disbelieve from among the People of the Scripture [Jews and Christians] and al-Mushrikeen,[21] were not to leave [their disbelief] until there came to them clear evidence.</span> </em>[Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Bayyinah (98:1)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And say to those who were given the Scriptures [Jews and Christians] and to those who are illiterates [Arab pagans]: “Do you [also] submit yourselves [to Allaah in Islaam]?” If they do, they are rightly guided,</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Aal-’Imraan (3:20)],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: “And other aayaat like those above address those who exist [i.e. from the Jews, Christians, and mushrikeen]. The Scripture that is referred to is the Book in their hands in which alterations and abrogation were carried out, and does not refer to those who held to the Scriptures before they were altered and abrogated, because they were not kufaar then. Also, they were not [the ones being addressed] by the Qur’aan as “you People of the Book,” because they died before the Qur’aan was revealed. So, all those who believe in the existing Books [altered and abrogated], are from the “People of the Book,” and they are kufaar because they hold to altered and abrogated Books, and they are, like all other kufaar, in Hell forever,[22] although Allaah, the Exalted, commanded that they pay jizyah [23] and made it permissible to eat their food and marry their women.” [24]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">In Conclusion:</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The only deen accepted to Allaah is Islaam.<br />
2. Islaam is the last and final message to all mankind (Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Hindus, etc.)<br />
3. Islaam abrogated all religions.<br />
4. The Qur’aan is the true Word of Allaah and it abrogated all of the previously-revealed Scriptures.<br />
5. The Torah and al-Injeel as they exist in the hands of the “People of the Book” are altered. Even if their original forms are to be found at any time, then they are still abrogated by the Qur’aan.<br />
6. Had their Prophets been alive they would all follow and abide by the teachings of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم). This is the Covenant which Allaah took upon all the Prophets. [25]<br />
7. Every believer should firmly believe that the Jews and Christians are kufaar and enemies of Allaah, His deen, the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم), and the Believers.<br />
8. The kufaar who die on kufr will dwell forever in the Hell of Fire. However we don’t judge that a particular kaafir is in Hell except when their is a specification from the Qur’aan and (or) authentic sunnah.[26]<br />
9. The call for “Unity of Religions,” sometimes misleadingly called a “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Comity of Religions</strong></span>,” aims at eliminating everything which distinguishes Islaam from kufr.<br />
10. Calling and supporting the concepts of the “Unity of Religion” is considered riddah (apostasy).[27]<br />
11. The above does not mean that the Muslim abandons calling the kufaar to Islaam.<br />
We are ordered to call them to the way of Allaah, and this is in the best of their interest and thus da’wah to Allaah is the best advice given to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the great ways of da’wah is to deal with them justly and to call them to Allaah in the best way which is based upon good knowledge.[28] This does not mean that the Muslim compromise the basics of his deen. It also does not mean that Muslims should indulge with the kufaar in an aimless dialogue such as: “Tell us how you pray and we will tell you how we pray,” as done by some people who engage in such dialogue. The most important thing is: Who deserves to be worshipped alone? [29] They worship idols, images, men, etc. We worship the true God of all creation. So we call them with the right knowledge to abandon shirk and to submit to Allaah in tawheed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The best methodology (manhaj) of da’wah is that exemplified by the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) when he sent Mu’aath ibn Jabal (radhi Allaahu anhu) to the “People of the Book” in Yemen. The first thing he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) commanded him to do is to call them to tawheed and belief in Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) as His Messenger.[30] Then he told him: “If they obey you to do so, then inform them that Allaah has enjoined upon them five salawaat [prayers] in every day and night [in twenty-four hours], and if they obey you and do so, then inform them that Allaah has made it obligatory for them to pay sadaqa [zakaat] from their properties and it is to be taken from the wealthy among them and given to poor among them.” [31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I wrote about this matter several years ago when some Muslim brothers started to engage in “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>dialogue</strong></span>” with the People of the Book. I cautioned our brothers to establish that the “dialogue” should transform into a way for da’wah and not “negotiations” because we cannot negotiate on shirk. Now with the call for “Unity of Religion,” I urge all the Muslims to advise each other about the dangers of this concept and to direct their respective communities to disassociate from this Path of kufr. May Allaah Who is the Most High, above everything, guide the misguided and preserve and protect our ummah from all afflictions and innovations in deen. Aameen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. The Muslim disassociates himself from all forms of kufr and shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. The believer distinguishes between the natural love he has for his father, mother, wife, husband, son, daughter, etc. from the unbelievers and enmity towards them because of their kufr. The natural love is something recognized by Islaam, otherwise Allaah would not have permitted marriage from chaste women of the People of the Book. This natural love of the kinsfolk and the just and good treatment of the thimmi,[32] non-harbi,[33] mu’aahad,[34] and the musta’min,[35] does not necessitate that we love them the love which obliges friendship and alliance. This kind of love is forbidden by Allaah because they oppose Allaah and His deen. The believer stands in a state of walaa’ (alliance and loyalty) and baraa’ (disassociation): alliance with the Believers who are obedient to Allaah and His Messenger, and enmity and disassociation from the unbelievers and those opposing Allaah and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم). Allaah (Azza wa Jal) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">You will not find a people who believe in Allaah and the Last Day, loving [by having friendship and alliance] with those who oppose Allaah and His Messenger [Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم], even though they were their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, or their kinsfolk. For such He has decreed true Faith in their hearts, and strengthened them with Rooh [proofs, light and true guidance] from Himself. And We will admit them into the gardens of [al-jannah] beneath whose trees rivers flow and they will dwell therein forever. Allaah is pleased with them and they with him. They are the party of Allaah. Indeed the party of Allaah are the successful.</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Mujaadalah (58:22)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This strengthening mentioned in the aayah applies to everyone who does not love the enemies of the Messengers, even though they may be one’s close relatives. This love is not the same as the natural (jibilli) love, but it is the love of nusrah which entails giving allegiance to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dealing justly with the non-combatant from the unbelievers is commanded by Allaah. Hence:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) The natural love is created by Allaah. He permitted it to occur.<br />
(b) The enmity towards the unbelievers because of their disbelief and rejection of Allaah is legislated by Allaah.<br />
(c) Dealing justly with the non-combatants from the unbelievers is commanded by Allaah. It is forbidden to harm them, especially if they are under the protection of a Muslims or in a Muslim land permitted by the Muslim ruler as the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“Whoever killed a mu’aahad shall not smell the fragrance of Paradise though its fragrance can be smelt at a distance of fourty years (of traveling).</span></em> [Al-Bukhaari, v. 9, no. 49].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this matter is not a “political” affair, rather it is from the Deen of Allaah. And the “evil of these actions, is that it causes the distortion of Islaam, since the enemies of Islam will capitalize on such occurrence in order to distort the reputation of Islam and to turn people away from it, although Islaam is innocent of such acts&#8230;” [36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why all believers in Allaah who love Islaam should disassociate themselves from these deviant paths even if they raise “attractive” banners, remembering that the early dissidents (al-Khawaarij) were foremost in worship of Allaah, yet they deviated from the true Path. Since the three matters are all from Allaah and since He (Azza wa Jal) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Allaah burdens not a person beyond his scope,</em></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Baqarah (2:286)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the three matters outlined above are within the scope of the believer and they are just and not contradictory:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Had it been from other than Allaah, they would surely have found therein much contradiction.</span> </em>[Qur’aan, Soorat An-Nisaa’ (4:82)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Path of the prophets. Contemplate about Prophet Nooh (alaihis salam) and His son when the just decree of Allaah (the Deluge) [37] came upon the kufaar from the people of Nooh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And Nooh [Noah] called out to his son, who had separated himself [apart], ‘O my son! Embark with us and be not with the unbelievers.’</em></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Hood (11:42)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His son chose the way of the unbelievers and thought that he will be saved from the water if he takes himself to a mountain. Nooh (alaihis salam) invoked Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And Nooh [Noah] called upon his Rabb [Allaah] and said, ‘O my Rabb! Verily my son is of my family! And certainly, Your Promise is true, and You are the Most Just of judges.’</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Hood (11:45)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Verily my son is of my family!” This is the natural relationship, the jibilli one. Allaah, Most High, reminded Nooh (alaihis salam) of His command of Legal disassociation (al-baraa’ ash-shar’i) from the kufaar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said: <span style="color:#008000;"><em>“O Nooh! Surely, he is not of your family [not from the believers of your family]; verily, his work is unrighteous, so ask not of Me that of which you have no knowledge! I admonish you, lest you be one of the ignorant.”</em></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Hood (11:46)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The immediate submission of Nooh was clear in his saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nooh said: <em><span style="color:#008000;">“O my Rabb! I seek refuge with You from asking You that which I have no knowledge. And unless You forgive me and have Mercy on me, I would indeed be one of the losers.”</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Hood (11:47)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a clear distinction between the jibilli and shar’i perspectives in the relationship between Nooh and his son. Contemplate also the relationship with parents:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And We have enjoined on man [to be dutiful and good] to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship, and his weaning is in two years—give thanks to Me and to your parents—unto Me is the final destination. But if they [both] strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not, yet deal with them justly and kindly in this life.</em></span> [Qur’aan, Sooart Luqmaan (31:14 &amp; 15)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Friendship and alliance and pleasing those who oppose Allaah are an indication of either lack of faith or its weakness in the heart of the believer. It is against reason that a person can have walaa’ for someone who is an enemy of the one he truly loves. You find those who have walaa’ for the unbelievers doing things which will earn the love and friendship of the unbelievers by any means. Those who know the truth regarding this matter must remind them of the command of Allaah that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe do not take as friends and protectors your fathers and your brothers if they choose unbelief to belief and whoever of you takes them as friends and protectors is one of the transgressors.</span></em> [Qur’aan, Sooart At-Tawbah (9:23)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Mighty and Majestic, set for us the example of Prophet Ibraaheem (alaihis salam) by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">There has been for you an example for you to follow in Ibraaheem and those with him, when they said to their unbelieving people: ‘We are free of you and whatever idols you worship besides Allaah, and we deny what you are upon and we reject you; and because of your disbelief in Allaah and your worship of others besides Him, enmity and hatred has arisen between us for ever, unless you believe truly in Allaah, and single Him out, and worship Him alone.’</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Mumtahinah (60:4)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The efforts to gain the friendship of the Jews and Christians are useless, as they will never be pleased with the Muslims until the Muslims follow their religion. Addressing Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم), the Imaam of the Muslims, Allaah, the Exalted, warned him that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Never will the Jews nor the Christians be pleased with you [O Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)] till you follow their religion.</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Baqarah (2:120)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, the command to abstain from following the paths of the Jews and Christians applies to the entire Ummah of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Verily, therein is indeed a reminder for him who has a heart or gives ear while he is heedful.</em> </span>[Qur’aan, Sooart Qaaf (50:37)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the salaah and salaam of Allaah be upon Muhammad, his family, his companions, and those who follow on their path in righteousness until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Seeking forgiveness from Allaah,<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi wa Sallam): The salaah and sa-laam of Allaah be upon His Prophet Muhammad. The salaah of Allaah upon Prophet Muhammad is His Praise of the Prophet before the angels who are close to (but below) Allaah, the Most High, who istawaa (ascended) His ‘arsh (Throne), which is above the seven heavens, in a manner that suits His Majesty. The angels also praise the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم). The salaam is Allaah’s safeguarding of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) from deficiencies and any kind of evil, and the protection of the Message with which he was entrusted. When the Muslim says صلى الله عليه و سلم (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), he invokes Allaah to grant His Praise and Security to Prophet Muhammad and the protection of the Message of Islaam which was revealed to him (صلى الله عليه و سلم). [See Ibnul Qayyim’s Jalaa’ul Afhaam fee Fadlis-Salaati-wa-Salaam ‘alaa Muhammadin Khairil Anaam, [Damascus, Syria: Daar ibn Katheer, and Al-Madeenah, KSA: Daarut-Turaath, 1408/1988], p.128.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Rabb: Allaah is Ar-Rabb. He is the One Who gave all things the power to grow, to move and to change, to Whom belongs the Creation and Commandment; the Master Who has no equal in His Sovereignty, Predominance, and Highness, The One Who Provides for and Sustains all that exists.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Deen: The practical and doctrinal aspects of deen are more comprehensive than the Western concept of religion. The deen of Islaam is the way of life prescribed by Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] So often one hear the following: “We are cousins of Jews and Christians. We worship the same God, follow the teachings of the same Prophets, and believe in the same books. We are all followers of Abraham.” This concept is in direct opposition to the teachings of the Qur’aan and authentic Sunnah. Those who associate partners with Allaah in worship and (or) worship Prophets are not believers in Allaah. The books of the Jews and Christians contain alterations and are completely abrogated by the Qur’aan. The Jews and Christians are not followers of the faith of tawheed of Ibraaheem (Abraham) for Ibraaheem was neither a Christian nor a Jew, he was a pure Muslim, as Allaah (Azza wa Jal) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Ibraaheem was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a true Muslim Haneefan (who worshipped none but Allaah Alone) and he was not of Al-Mushrikeen.</span> </em>[Qur’aan, Soorat Aal-’Imraan (3:67)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Had they been true followers of their Prophets, the Jews and Christians would believe in the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and his message of Islaam. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“By Him (Allaah) in Whose Hand Muhammad’s soul is, there is none from amongst the Jews and the Christians (of these present nations) who hears about me and then dies without believing in the Message with which I have been sent (i.e. tawheed), but he will be from the dwellers of the (Hell) Fire.”</span></em> [Reported by Muslim in his Saheeh (English Translation), vol. 1, no. 284].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The belief in the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the attestation with full acceptance and submission, not just mere attestation, that what he brought forth is the truth. That is why Abu Taalib (the uncle of the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not become a believer in the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم), despite his attestation to what the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) brought forth and his witness that it is the best of religions.The brother who uttered the aforementioned statement should repent to correct it, and declare the truth in the best ,تعالى Allaah possible way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Allaah (Azza wa Jal) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">If only they had referred it to the Messenger or to ulil-amr [learned scholars and those charged with authority] among them, the proper investigators would have understood it from them [directly].</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat An-Nisaa’ (4:83)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was the norm for the sahaabah to ask the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) in his life of what they did not know. Then after his death they asked the learned amongst them, and so did those who followed their path in righteousness. Asking the learned scholars, therefore, was the way of the salaf especially if something doubtful arose.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] A past nation who used to live in al-Mawsil (‘Iraq) and said, “La Ilaaha Illal-laah.” They were neither Jews nor Christians.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] Ibn Taymeeyah in Al-Jawaabus-Saheeh Liman Baddala Deenal-Maseeh (The Correct Response for those who Altered the Religion of ‘Eessa) [Riyaadh, KSA: Daarul ‘Aasimah, 1414/1993] vol. 2, pp. 212-213. As to whether Jews and Christians of our times are from the People of the Book or not, one first should understand what the term “People of the Book” means. It means that original Books were revealed to their prophets, Mûsa and ‘Eessa, respectively. When they held to the beliefs of ‘Eessa and Mûsa, they were not kufaar. However, when they continued to believe in the altered and abrogated forms of these Books and commit shirk, they became kufaar, even though they are still referred to as “People of the Book.” Allaah knew they would alter the Books and warned them against that. He (Azza wa Jal) still refers to them in the Qur’aan as “People of The Book,” and clearly states that they have committed kufr and deviated from the path of tawheed which their prophets called them to adhere to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] Like the belief of Muslims who accepted the Message of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] Includes those amongst them who had faith before Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was sent to mankind. The believers whom Allaah described:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And We ordained in the hearts of those who followed him [‘Eessa] compassion and Mercy&#8230;So, We gave those among them who believed their [due] reward, but many of them are Fassiqoon [rebellious, disobedient to Allaah]. [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Hadeed (57:27)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]The revelation includes the Qur’aan and the authentic sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] Ibn Taymeeyah explained that some of the sahaabah (e.g. Jaabir ibn ‘Abdullaah, ibn ‘Abbaas, and Anas ibn Maalik as well as most of the scholars mentioned that رضي الله عنهم the aayah (Qur’aan 3:199), was revealed concerning the faith of an-Najaashi, the king of Abasseenyah known as “as-hamah” (‘Atiyyah, in Arabic), who knew that the Message of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was the truth confirming that of ‘Eessa before him. He accepted Islaam but was unable to migrate to daarul-Islaam (where Islaam is the apparent and practiced deen), nor he was able to declare it amongst his Christian nation. After the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) knew of his death, he called upon the sahaabah and performed the funeral prayers in absentia on an-Najaashi, thus confirming his belief in Islaam. The aayah, therefore, may apply to anyone from the People of the Book or the mushrikeen who lives in daarul-harb (a land in which the kufaar are prevailing, or land of the kufaar between whom and the Muslims there is no peace) and who believes in Allaah and in Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) as Allaah&#8217;s Final Messenger, yet unable to declare his faith openly or unable to migrate to any Muslim country. He does what he is able to do from the acts of worship and as he knows them. [See ibn Taymeeyah’s Al-Jawaabus-Saheeh], pp. 202-210.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12] Collected by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. The text is as reported by al-Bukhaari in his saheeh, vol. 4, no. 255, p.158. The (*) refers to some parts of the text as reported by Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] Those who claim to be followers of ‘Eessa (alaihis salam) and the true Injeel (Gospel) should have a general love for Islaam and its people, because the teachings of ‘Eessa (alaihis salam) were based upon mercy and kindness:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And We ordained in the hearts of those who followed him compassion and Mercy. [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Hadeed (57:27)]. In fact they must submit to Allaah and His deen because the in ,عليهما الصلاة والسلام messages of ‘Eessa and Muhammad calling the people to the tawheed, are the same.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14] See Shaykh-ul-Islaam’s Al-Jawaabus-Saheeh, vol. 2, pp. 201-213.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15] This is correction of the original statement “in shaa’ Allaah, believers,” and which came in the first print as well as in the first print of “The Message and the Messengers.” And Allaah’s forgiveness is sought in case of any error.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[16] In Badaai’ At-Tafseer (The Unprecedented of Tafseer), which is a collection of explanations of certain aayaat of the Qur’aan, collected by Yusri as-Sayed Ahmad [Dammaam, Saudi Arabia: Daar ibnul Jawzi, 1414/1993], vol. 3, p. 214.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[17] Allaah willed them to exist, yet He hates the shirk practiced by them. He willed and created Iblees (the Devil) and He hates him. This is His Universal Will: al-iraadah al-kawniyyah. Allaah’s Judicial Will: al-iraadah ash-shar’iyyah is to protect their places of worship as long as they do not openly carry out their worship outside such places, and they conform to all of the rules regarding their interactions with Isamic Law.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[18] Quoted in Fathul-Bayaan fee Maqassidil-Qur’aan (The Eloquent Clarification to the Objectives of the Qur’aan), by Sidique Hassan al-Khanouji al-Bukhaari [Sidon, Beirut, Lebanon: ad-Daar al-’Assriyyah, 1412/1992], vol. 9, p. 57.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[19] Fitrah: natural inclination to worship Allaah alone. Every human is born on this state. That is why if someone reverts to Islam, then he/she returns to his initial state of submission to the only true God, Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[20] Certainly it is advised to marry the Muslim woman even if a chaste woman of the people of the Book offers herself for marriage to a Muslim. There are so many problems associated with marriage to women from the People of the Book in our times. The Muslim must be very careful about such a decision if it deems necessary.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[21]Mushrikeen: Those who commit shirk including pagans, polytheists, idolaters, and unbelievers in the Oneness of Allaah and in His Messenger Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[22] If they die on their beliefs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[23] Head-tax imposed by Islaam on the People of the Book and other people who have a revealed book when they live under Muslim rule, wherein they and their properties and wealth are protected.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[24] Quoted in Majmoo’ Al-Fataawaa, vol. 35, pp. 227-228.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[25] Allaah says (what means): And [remember] when Allaah took the Covenant of the Prophets, saying: ‘Take whatever I gave you from the Book and Hikmah [understanding of the Laws of Allaah], and afterwards there will come to you a Messenger [Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم] confirming what is with you; you must, then, believe in him and help him.’ Allaah said: ‘Do you agree [to it] and will you make up My Covenant [which I conclude with you]?’ They said: ‘We agree.’ He said: ‘Then bear witness, and I am with you among the witnesses [for this].’ [Qur’aan, Soorat Aal-’Imraan (3:81)]. Furthermore, in the hadeeth reported by Imaam Ahmad and others, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said (what means), “If Mûsa were alive and present among you, it would not be permissible for him to do anything but to follow me.” [Ash-Shaykh Al-Albaani stated that it is reported by Ahmad, Al-Bayhaqi, and Ad-Daarimee, Al-Laalkaa’ee, Al-Harawee and others, and that its degree of authenticity is hasan. See Mishkaatul-Masaabeeh, vol. 1, no. 177].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[26] Example Abu Taalib is in Hell, and Fir’awn is in Hell, as well as others specified in authentic texts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[27] This ruling has been published as a religious verdict (fatwa) by the Permanent Committee for Islamic and Educational Research in Saudi Arabia on the 25th of Muharram, 1418 (corresponding to 31-5-1997), no. 19402.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[28] The aayah in Soorat Al-’Ankaboot (29:46):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(which means), <em><span style="color:#008000;">“And do not argue with the People of the Scriptures (Jews and Christians), unless it be in [a way] that is better, except with such of them as do wrong, and say [to them]: “We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you; our Ilaah [God] and your Ilaah [God] is One [i.e. Allaah], and it is to Him we submit [in Islaam],”</span></em> calls the believers to argue with the People of the Book in a way that is better, i.e.inviting them to Allaah with His aayaat (verses, proofs, evidences, etc.) using the clearest indicative words which proves the objective and to avoid being harsh save with such of them as do wrong. [See Tafseer ibn Jareer At-Tabaree for this aayah as well ibnul Qayyim’s Madaarijus-Saalikeen (Beirut, Lebanon: Daarul-Fikr, checked by Muhammad Haamid Al-Fiqee, n.d.], vol. 1, pp. 445-446. It is not a call for interfaith dialogue. It is a call for a common word between them and us. This word has been defined by Allaah, Most High, in the following Aayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[which means]: <em><span style="color:#008000;">O People of the Scripture [Jews and Christians]: Come to a word that is just between us and you, that we worship none but Allah, and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take others as lords besides Allah. Then if they turn away, say: “Bear witness that we are Muslims.”</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Aal-‘Imraan (3:64)]. Certainly it is not a call for “comity” or “unity of religions.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[29] In the year 1415 (1995), I wrote a book as well as a short article entitled, “<strong>Who Deserves to be Worshipped Alone?</strong>” In shaa’ Allaah (Allaah Willing) it is helpful to address people from all religions. The article is available on the site: understand-islam.net.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[30] Not just the so-called “recognition” given by some theologians from the People of the Book in our times!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[31]The text is in Saheeh Al-Bukhaari (Arabic/English), vol. 2, no. 478. It is also reported by Muslim.<br />
[32] Thimmi: A non-Muslim living in a Muslim country and upon whom the jizyah applies. Those non-Muslims are under the protection of the Muslims.<br />
[33] The non-combatants from the unbelievers.<br />
[34] An unbeliever between whom and the Muslims a term of peace has been made for a definite time.<br />
[35] The unbeliever who is permitted into the Muslim land by the approval of the Muslim governor, e.g. visiting, business, etc.<br />
[36] From the fatwa of or Shayekh, Muhammad bin Salih al-‘Uthaimeen (may Allaah’s Mercy be upon him), concerning the bombings that took place in al-Khubar (Saudi Araia) in the year 1419. See al-Fataawaa ash-Shar’iyyah fil Qadaayaa al-Mua’aasirah (Legal Verdicts Regarding Current Issues), pp. 80-87, collected by Muhammad bin Fahd al-Husayyin, with an introductory by Shayekh Salih al-Fawzaan (may Allaah preserve him). Shayekh bin ‘Uthaimeen enumerated many other evil consequences of such actions, including spreading ciaos in the land, destruction of humans and their wealths, and more.<br />
[37] The great flood in the time of Nooh (alaihis salam).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Al-Jawab As-Sahih Li-man Baddala Dina Al-Masih</em><br />
Answering Those Who Altered The Religion Of Jesus Christ (peace be upon him)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Explanation of the classic book of Ibn Taymiyyah <em>rahimahullaah. This book is one of the most important Islamic books which gives right answers about Christianity.</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Jawab As-Sahih Li-man Baddala Dina Al-Masih</em> (Answering Those Who Altered the Religion of Jesus Christ) is a comprehensive study in which the author not only refutes the Christians&#8217; allegations about Islam but also raises the contradictions of some Christian beliefs and even refutes their creedal principles. The book gains its originality from the fact that it is one of the strongest compilations ever laid down on its topic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Through this Shaikhul-Islam Ibn Taimiyah responds to a letter from Cyprus from &#8216;Paul, The Monk; the Bishop of Sayda&#8217;, The letter was entitles &#8216;The Logically proven statement that expresses the right conviction and sound opinion&#8217;. The letter is comprised of all the excuses and pleas that Christian scholars and pious Christians use to defend their religion, in the past as well as in recent times, which are based on many rational and logical arguments. Upon that, Ibn Taimiyah stood up to confront and expose the falseness and corruption of such allegations, thereby, clarifying right from wrong in order that those with sound judgment can make use of it. He also aimed at outlining and clarifying the Books, Justice and Wisdom with which Allah sent His Messengers.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>CHAPTER ONE:</strong></span></p>
<p>Their claim that Muhammad (peace be upon him) was not sent to them but to the Arabs of the Pre-Islamic era. It will also contain their claim that the verses of the Qur’an support this very idea as does logical contemplation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Section One: The First Claim Of The Christians</strong>
<ol>
<li>The Claim of the Christians that Muhammad was not sent to them but he was only sent to the Arabs of the Pre-Islamic era.</li>
<li>Their plea that the Book with which Muhammad was sent is not written in their language.</li>
<li>Their saying, &#8220;We do not need to follow this Messenger because we were sent other Messengers before him.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Section Two: The Refuting The Claims Of The Christians</strong>
<ol>
<li>&#8211; Proofs that the Messenger Of Allah was sent to all Mankind</li>
<li>&#8211; Some Qur&#8217;anic verses that prove the prophethood Of Muhammad</li>
<li>&#8211; Refuting the Claim that the Qur&#8217;anic verses Contradict Each Other</li>
<li>&#8211; Glad tidings about the Coming of Prophets</li>
<li>&#8211; The Qur&#8217;an was Revealed in Arabic</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>CHAPTER TWO:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their claim that Muhammad (peace be upon him) praised their religion (in the Qur’an) to the extent that their religion and practices should motivate them to adhere more to it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Section One: The First Claim Of The Christians</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Christian Claim: Muhammad praised their religion, which they practice, in the Qur&#8217;an from the following aspects: (1). Glorifying Christ and his mother. (2). Glorifying the Bible. (3). Praising Synagogues. (4). Glorifying the Disciples, as they are messengers from Allah. (5). All that makes us hold fast to our religion and not follow any other man except Jesus Christ.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Section Two: The Refuting The Claims Of The Christians</strong>
<ol>
<li>&#8211; Divine and Human Entities United</li>
<li>&#8211; The Holy Spirit</li>
<li>&#8211; Invented Monasticism</li>
<li>&#8211; Misplaced Inference</li>
<li>&#8211; Remembering Allah in Monasteries, Synagogues and Mosques</li>
<li>&#8211; Praising Jesus Christ and His Followers</li>
<li>&#8211; Reasons Why the Christians Deviated</li>
<li>&#8211; The Book of Enlightenment</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>CHAPTER THREE:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their claim that the prophethood of the early Prophets and their Books, like the Torah, Psalms and the Gospel assert the truth of their beliefs, namely: the Hypostases, trinity, unification and so on. Thus, they should adhere to them, as it is not acceptable for them to desert their beliefs as long as they are not abrogated by a text or annulled by rational deduction.</p>
<ul>
<li>Section One: The Third Claim Of The Christians</li>
<li>Section Two: The Refuting The Claims Of The Christians
<ol>
<li>Distortion of the Torah and The Gospel</li>
<li>Invalidity Of the Comparison of their Books to the Qur&#8217;an</li>
<li>Who Speaks Seventy-Two Languages</li>
<li>Changes made in Torah and Gospel</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Section Three: The Claim Of The Christians Regarding The Prophets Books Supporting Them And Attributing Injustice To The Jews</li>
<li>Section Four: Refuting The Christians Claim</li>
<li>Sections Five: The Christians Claim That The Qur&#8217;an Regards All Religions On An Equal Footing</li>
<li>Section Six: Reputing The Christians Claim</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>CHAPTER FOUR:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It includes their claim that the Trinity is proven according to logic and according to the revealed laws (i.e. the Prophetic traditions and their revealed Books) and that it agrees with the laws of Divinely revealed Books and Prophetic traditions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Section One: The Claim Of The Christians</li>
<li>Section Two: The Refuting The Claims Of The Christians
<ol>
<li>Invalidity of the Three Entities Being One God</li>
<li>Baptizing in the Name of the Father and the Son</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>CHAPTER FIVE:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their claim that they are monotheists, justifying their words that imply polytheism, such as the hypostases, through claiming that they resemble the words in the Book of the Muslims which imply personification and incarnation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Section One: The Claim Of The Christians</li>
<li>Section Two: The Refuting The Claims Of The Christians
<ol>
<li>The Christians Claim that the Attributes Serve as Names</li>
<li>Their Claim Regarding Incarnation and Immanentism</li>
<li>Their Claim Regarding God&#8217;s Appearance in Jesus</li>
<li>The Difference Between Similarity and being Identical</li>
<li>Christians Claim regarding the Three Hypostases</li>
<li>The Invalidity of their Claim that they are Monotheists</li>
<li>Among Their Scholars: Al-Hasan bin Ayyub</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>CHAPTER SIX:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their claim that ‘Isa (Jesus, peace be upon him) was sent after Musa (Moses, peace be upon him) with a perfect religion (i.e. Christianity) and thus, there is no need for another religion (i.e. Islam) which aims at the same purposes and goals which have already been achieved. Thus, any religion after that of &#8216;Isa is invalid and therefore not acceptable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Section One: The Claim Of The Christians</li>
<li>Section Two: The Refuting The Claims Of The Christians</li>
<li>Section Three: The Prophets Prophesied The Advent Of Muhammad</li>
<li>The Scriptures&#8217; Witness For Muhammad (peace be upon him)
<ul>
<li>Sixteen Prophecies</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

Translated by: Abu az-Zubayr Harrison – <a href="http://www.authentic-translations.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">authentic-translations.com</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: We have read a verdict from you published in “al-Da’wah” magazine that one should not pray for the overall destruction of Jews and Christians. Hearing this, we were confused by the seemingly contrasting supplication of prophet Nūh (alaihissalam). We hope you will explain this verdict of yours with the evidence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source : Tafsir Ibn Kathir (Abridged)<br />
Ale Imraan Verses 3.65 and 3.67 © Darussalam 2000</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(65. O people of the Scripture! Why do you dispute about Ibrahim, while the Tawrah and the Injil were not revealed till after him Have you then no sense) (66. Verily, you are those who have disputed about that of which you have knowledge. Why do you then dispute concerning that of which you have no knowledge It is Allah Who knows, and you know not.) (67. Ibrahim was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a true Muslim Hanifa and he was not of the Mushrikin ) (68. Verily, among mankind who have the best claim to Ibrahim are those who followed him, and this Prophet and those who have believed. And Allah is the Wali (Protector and Helper) of the believers.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah censures the Jews and Christians for their dispute with Muslims over Ibrahim Al-Khalil and the claim each group made that he was one of them. Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar reported that Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;The Christians of Najran and Jewish rabbis gathered before the Messenger of Allah and disputed in front of him. The rabbis said, `Ibrahim was certainly Jewish.&#8217; The Christians said, `Certainly, Ibrahim was Christian.&#8217; So Allah sent down,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Why do you dispute about Ibrahim,) meaning, `How is it that you, Jews, claim that Ibrahim was Jew, although he lived before Allah sent down the Tawrah to Musa How is it that you, Christians, claim that Ibrahim was Christian, although Christianity came after his time&#8221; This is why Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Have you then no sense)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, you are those who have disputed about that of which you have knowledge. Why do you then dispute concerning that of which you have no knowledge)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah criticizes those who argue and dispute without knowledge, just as the Jews and Christians did concerning Ibrahim. Had they disputed about their religions, which they had knowledge of, and about the Law that was legislated for them until Muhammad was sent, it would have been better for them. Rather, they disputed about what they had no knowledge of, so Allah criticized them for this behavior. Allah commanded them to refer what they have no knowledge of to He Who knows the seen and unseen matters and Who knows the true reality of all things. This is why Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(It is Allah Who knows, and you know not.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Ibrahim was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a true Muslim Hanifa), shunning Shirk and living in Iman,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and he was not of the Mushrikin.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah is similar to the Ayah in Surat Al-Baqarah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And they say, &#8220;Be Jews or Christians, then you will be guided&#8230;&#8221;) 2:135</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, among mankind who have the best claim to Ibrahim are those who followed him, and this Prophet and those who have believed. And Allah is the Wali (Protector and Helper) of the believers.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah means, &#8220;The people who have the most right to be followers of Ibrahim are those who followed his religion and this Prophet, Muhammad , and his Companions from the Muhajirin, Ansar and those who followed their lead.&#8221; Sa`id bin Mansur recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Every Prophet had a Wali (supporter, best friend) from among the Prophets. My Wali among them is my father Ibrahim, the Khalil (intimate friend) of my Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet then recited,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, among mankind who have the best claim to Ibrahim are those who followed him&#8230;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And Allah is the Wali (Protector and Helper) of the believers.) means, Allah is the Protector of all those who believe in His Messengers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"><strong>Question</strong>: One of the preachers in one of the mosques in Europe claimed that it is not allowed to consider Jews and Christians disbelievers. You know &#8211; may Allaah preserve you &#8211; that most of the people who attend the mosques in Europe have very little knowledge. We fear that statements like this one will become widespread. Therefore, we request from you a complete and clear answer to this question.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: I say: The statement that came from that man is misguidance. In fact, it can be blasphemy. This is because Allaah has declared that Jews and Christians are disbelievers (kuffaar) in His Book. Allaah has said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And the Jews say, ‘Ezra is the son of Allaah,’ and the Christians say, ‘The Messiah is the son of Allaah.’ This is a saying from their mouths. They imitate the saying of the disbelievers of old. Allaah’s curse be on them, how they are deluded away from the truth. They took their rabbis and their monks as lords besides Allaah and [they also took as Lord] the Messiah, son of Mary. But they were commanded only to worship none but One God. Praise and Glory be to Him, [far above is He] from having the partners they associate with Him.&#8221;</span> [at-Taubah 9:30-31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That shows that they are polytheists who associate partners with Allaah. In other verses, Allaah has made it clear that they are disbelievers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Surely in disbelief are they who say that Allaah is the Messiah, son of Mary.&#8221;</span> [al-Maidah 5:17 and 72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Surely, disbelievers are those who said, ‘Allaah is the third of the three [in a Trinity].&#8221;</span> [al-Maidah 5:73]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Those among the Children of Israel who disbelieved were cursed by the tongue of David and Jesus, son of Mary.&#8221;</span> [al-Maidah 5:87]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Those who disbelieve among the People of the Book and the idolaters will abide in the Fire of Hell.&#8221;</span> [al-Bayyinah 98:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many verses and hadith express the same meaning. The one who rejects the idea that the Jews and the Christians who do not believe in Muhammad [peace be upon him] and deny him are disbelievers is, in fact, denying what Allaah has said. Denying what Allaah has said is blasphemy. <strong>If anyone has any doubt concerning them being disbelievers, then he himself is also a disbeliever.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Glory be to Allaah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How could that man be pleased to say that it is not allowed to say that they are disbelievers when they themselves say that Allaah is one of a Trinity? Their Creator Himself has declared that they are disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How could this man not be pleased to call them disbelievers when they actually say, &#8220;Jesus is the son of God&#8221; or &#8220;the hand of Allaah is tied,&#8221; and &#8220;Allaah is poor and we are rich&#8221;?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How could this man not be pleased to call them disbelievers and apply the word of disbelief (kufr) to them in general when they describe their Lord in such ways that are nothing but cursing and abusing Allaah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I call upon that man to repent to Allaah and to read Allaah’s words, <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;They wish that you should compromise (in religion out of courtesy) with them, so that they (too) would compromise with you.&#8221;</span> [al-Qalam (68):9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He should make it clear to everyone that they are disbelievers and that they are the inhabitants of the Hell-fire. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">&#8220;By the One in whose hand my soul is, no Jew or Christian of this community hears about me &#8211; that is from the community of people from the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him) until the Day of Judgment &#8211; and then does not follow me &#8211; or he said does not believe in what I brought &#8211; except that he is from the inhabitants of the Hell-fire.&#8221;</span> [Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who made such a statement must repent to his Lord because of this great falsehood he has stated. He must make a clear announcement that they are disbelievers and that they are inhabitants of the Hell-fire. He must also announce that it is obligatory upon them to follow the unlettered Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). he is the one that the Jews and the Christians know and they know him like they know their own sons. Allaah has stated,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Those who follow the Messenger, the illiterate Prophet whom they find written about with them in the Torah and the Gospel, he commands what is right and forbids what is evil. He allows them the good things and forbids for them disdainful things. He releases them from their heavy burdens and from the fetters that were upon them. So those who believe in him, honor him, help him, and follow the light which has been sent down with him, it is they who will be successful.&#8221;</span> [al-Araf 7:157]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is the one of whom Jesus, son of Mary (peace be upon him) gave glad tidings. Jesus said, as His Lord states in the Quran,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O Israel, I am the Messenger of Allaah for you confirming the Torah (which came) before me, and giving glad tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name is Ahmad [one of the names of the Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him]. But when he came to them with clear proofs, they said, ‘This is clear magic.’&#8221;</span> [as-Saff 61:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the one, Ahmad, who was promised came to them with clear signs, they said that it was nothing but magic. By this, we can refute those Christians who say that the one Jesus promised was named Ahmad and not Muhammad. We say to that that Allaah said, &#8220;When he came with clear proofs,&#8221; and none has come to you after Jesus except Muhammad (peace be upon him). Muhammad is Ahmad and Allaah inspired Jesus to call Muhammad Ahmad. This is because Ahmad is a name from the root meaning, &#8220;to praise,&#8221; and the name itself means, &#8220;One who praises Allaah more than others.&#8221; Therefore, [Muhammad (peace be upon him)] is the most praiseworthy of Allaah among all peoples&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I further say: If anyone claims that there is a religion on earth other than Islam that is acceptable to Allaah, then the person who made that claim is a disbeliever and there is no doubt about his disbelief. This is because Allaah has said in His Book, <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted from him and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.&#8221;</span> [ali-Imran 3:85]. Allaah has also said, <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Truly, the religion in the sight of Allaah is Islam&#8221;</span> [ali-Imran 3:19]. Another verse states, <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion&#8221;</span> [al-Maida 5:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Based on that &#8211; and I repeat it for a third time &#8211; the person who made that statement [mentioned in the question] must repent to Allaah, Most High. And he must also make it clear to all the people that those Jews and Christians are disbelievers. This is so because the proof has been established against them, they have received the message but they have refused to believe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jews have been described as those who have earned Allaah’s wrath. That is because they knew the truth and chose to go against it. The Christians have been described as those who have gone astray. This is because they sought the truth but were misled from it. Now, all of them have knowledge of the truth and recognize it. However, they go against it. Therefore, they all deserve to have the wrath of Allaah upon them. I call all those Jews and Christians to believe in Allaah and all of His Messengers. I call upon them to follow the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). This is what they have been ordered to do in their own books. Allaah states in the Quran,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;My Mercy embraces all things. That (Mercy) I shall ordain for those who are God-fearing and give zakat, and those who believe in Our revelations. Those who follow the Messenger, the illiterate Prophet whom they find written about with them in the Torah and the Gospel, he commands what is right and forbids what is evil. He allows them the good things and forbids for them disdainful things. He releases them from their heavy burdens and from the fetters that were upon them. So those who believe in him, honor him, help him, and follow the light which has been sent down with him, it is they who will be successful. Say (O Muhammad): O Mankind! Verily, I am sent to all of you as the Messenger of Allaah, to whom belongs the heavens and the earth. There is no true God but He. It is He who gives life and causes death. So believe in Allaah and His Messenger, the unlettered, who believes in Allaah and His Words. And follow him so that you may be guided.&#8221;</span> [al-Araf 7:156-158].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[By having such faith, those converts from Judaism and Christianity] shall receive their reward twice. The Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;There are three people who will receive their rewards twice: A person from the People of the Book [Jews and Christians] who believed in his prophet and believed in Muhammad&#8230;&#8221;</span> [al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have also found in the law book al-Iqna`, in the section on apostasy, where the author has stated,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;One who does not consider as a disbeliever one who follows a religion other than Islam, such as the Christians, or who has doubt about their disbelief or who approves of their way himself is a disbeliever.&#8221; </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he quotes Ibn Taimiya as saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;[The following is] a disbeliever: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Whoever believes that churches are the houses of Allaah in which he He is worshipped or who thinks that what the Jews and Christians do are valid acts of worship of Allaah and obedience to Him and His Messenger, or loves or approves of what they do, or aids them in having such places and establishing their religion, and he does so thinking that is a way of getting closer to Allaah or worshipping Allaah.&#8221; </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>He also stated, </strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;If someone believes that visiting the Jews and the Christians in their places of worship is an act that brings him closer to Allaah, then he is an apostate.&#8221;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These statements support what was stated in the text of the answer. This is a matter concerning which there is no room for doubt. And help is sought only with Allaah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 51</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What is the creed of the Muslims with regard to ‘Eesaa, son of Maryam? Also what is the ruling as to the saying that he was killed and crucified.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer by Shaykh ibn Uthaymeen</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The belief of the Muslims regarding ‘Eesaa, son of Maryam, may Allaah’s Salaah and Salaam be upon him, is that <strong><span style="color:#000000;">he is one of the noble Messengers</span></strong>. In fact he is one of the five Messengers foremost in their resolve. They are Muhammad (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam), Ibraaheem, Moosaa, Noah and ‘Eesaa (may Allaah’s Salaah and Salaam be upon them all). Allaah, The Most High, mentioned them in three places in His Noble Book. So, He Said in soorat al-Ahzaab :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And (remember) when We took from the Prophets their covenant, and from you (O Muhammad (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam), and from Noah, Ibraaheem (Abraham), Moosaa (Moses), and ‘Eesaa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary); We took from them a strong covenant.</span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-Ahzaab (33): 7].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in sooart ash-Shoora, Allaah Said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Your Rabb (Allaah) prescribed for Noah (Nooh), and that which We revealed to you (O Muhammad: Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam), and that which He prescribed for Ibraaheem, Moosaa, ‘Eesaa–that you should establish the Religion, acting upon what is prescribed, and not split into sects with regard to it</span>. [Qur’aan, soorat ash-Shooraa (42): 13].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We belieive that ‘Eesaa (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>is a human from the children of Adam created from a mother without a father, and that he is a slave-worshipper of Allaah</strong></span> and His Messenger. So he is a slave, one who is not to be worshipped, and a Messenger, not to be denied. And that he does not possess any of the qualities of Rubbobiyyah. Rather he is as Allaah has Said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>‘Eesaa is not but a slave of Ours whom We Granted Our Favour to him (blessed with guidance and Eemaan,) and We made him a sign to the children of Israel.</strong></span> [Qur’aan, soorat azZukhruf (43): 59].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that he (may Allaah’s Salaah and Salaam be upon him) did not command his people to appoint him and his mother as gods besides Allaah. In fact, he told that which Allaah has Commanded him with:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Worship Allaah, my Rabb and your Rabb.</span></strong> [Qur’aan, soorat alMaa’idah (5): 117].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that he, ‘Eesaa (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>was Created by the Word of Allaah (Be!)</strong> </span>as Allaah, The Most High, Says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Verily, the likeness of ‘Eesaa before Allaah, (in Allaah’s Sight,) is the likeness of Adam. He Created him from dust, then (He) Said to him: “Be”- and he was. </strong></span>[Qur’aan, soorat aal- ‘Imraan (3): 59].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that <strong><span style="color:#000000;">there is no Prophet between him (‘Eesaa) and Muhammad (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam)</span></strong>, as Allaah, The Most High, Says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And (remember) when ‘Eesaa, son of Maryam, said: ‘O Children of Israel! I am the Messenger of Allaah unto you, confirming the Torah (which came) before me, and giving glad tiding of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad.’ But when he (Ahmed, i.e. Muhammad Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) came to them with clear proofs, they said: “This is plain magic”. [Qur’aan, soorat as-Saf (61): 6].</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And no one’s faith will be complete until he believes that ‘Eesaa is Allaah’s slave and Messenger, and that he is free from and high above what the Jews described him with, – they said he was son of a prostitute conceived by way of fornication. We seek refuge in Allaah from this. Allaah, The Most High, cleared him of all of that. Also the Muslims disassociate themselves from the way of the Christians who went astray in their understanding of the reality with regard to ‘Eesaa, son of Maryam, since they have appointed him and his mother as gods besides Allaah. And some of them said: “He is the son of Allaah,” and others said: “Allaah is the third of three (Trinity).”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">As far as him (‘Eesaa) being killed and “crucified,”</span></strong> then Allaah, The One free from all imperfection and The Most High, categorically and decisively denied that he was killed or crucified. So He, The Most Mighty and Most Magnificent, Said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">But they (the Jews) they killed him not, nor crucified him, but the resemblance of Jesus was put over another man (and they killed that man), and those who differ therein are full of doubts, they have no certain knowledge, they follow nothing but conjecture. For surely they killed him not. But Allaah raised him up (with his body and soul) unto Himself (and he is in the heavens). And Allaah is All-Powerful, AllWise. And there is none from the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), but must believe in him (i.e. ‘Eesaa, as a Messenger of Allaah and a human being) before his (‘Eesaa’s, or a Jew’s or a Christian’s) death. And on the Day of Resurrection, he (‘Eesaa) will be a witness against them.”</span></strong> [Qur’aan, soorat an-Nisaa’ (4): 157-159].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore anyone who believes that ‘Eessa, son of Maryam, may Allaah’s Salaah and Salaam be upon him, was killed and crucifixion then he has denied the Qur’aan. And anyone who denies the Qur’aan is an unbeliever. So we believe that ‘Eessa (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) was neither killed nor crucified. But we say that the Jews drew on themselves the sin of killing and crucifixion, since they claimed that they killed ‘Eesaa, son of Mary, the Messenger of Allaah, while in reality they killed him not. Rather they killed someone who was put there to resemble him, because Allaah put the resemblance of ‘Eesaa over a man from amongst them, and they killed and crucified that man. And then they said that they killed ‘Eesaa, son of Mary, the Messenger of Allaah. Thus the Jews drew upon themselves the sin of killing and that of crucifixion in their testimony concerning themselves. And as to ‘Eessa, son of Maryam, Allaah, The Most High, cleared him of that, and protected him and raised him up unto Himself in the heavens.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And he shall descend to earth at the end of time</strong></span> (before the establishment of the Hour), and he will judge by the Sharee’ah of Muhammad (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam), then he will die on earth and will be buried in it; then he will be raised (ascend) just like the rest of the children of Aadam, since Allaah, The Most High, Says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Thereof (the earth) We Created you, and into it We shall return you, and from it We shall bring you out once again.</span></strong> [Qur’aan, soorat Taahaa (20): 55].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Allaah) Said: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">Therein (the earth) you will live, and therein you shall die, and from it you shall be brought out (i.e. resurrected).</span> </strong>[Qur’aan, soorat al-A’raaf (7): 25].</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Employees of the Banque Saudi Fransi wish the Saudi people a merry year. Respected shaykh, it undoubtedly hurts every Muslim to find things like this common in the land of Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah/monotheism) and Al-Haramayn Al-Sharifayn (the Two Sacred Mosques, the Sacred Mosque in Makkah and the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque in Madinah).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">I hope that Your Honor will clarify the ruling of Islam on this matter.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A Muslim is prohibited to congratulate the disbelievers, Christians, Jews or whomever, on their distinctive occasions. This involves a sort of agreeing with them on their falsehood and being loyal to them. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Similarly, a Muslim is prohibited to congratulate his Muslim brother on the feasts and celebrations of the disbelievers. By doing so, a Muslim imitates them.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslims must resent disbelievers, dissociate themselves from them and hate their disbelief and disobedience to Allah, as Allah (Exalted be He) states,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />It was authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><strong>Anyone who imitates a people becomes one of them</strong>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph">the Shaykh of Islam Ibn Taymiyyah </span>commented on this Hadith saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>This Hadith at least implies that it is prohibited for a Muslim to imitate the disbelievers though it apparently signifies the disbelief of the imitator</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) states,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;and if any amongst you takes them as Auliyâ’, then surely he is one of them</span>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">You (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will not find any people who believe in Allâh and the Last Day, making friendship with those who oppose Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم)</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) states,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5: 51" target="_blank" rel="nofollow' id=" name="Oyouwhobelieve!Takenotthe"></a><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Auliyâ’ (friends, protectors, helpers), they are but Auliyâ’ of each other. And if any amongst you takes them as Auliyâ’, then surely he is one of them. Verily, Allâh guides not those people who are the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers and unjust)</span>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, <span style="color:#ff0000;">Muslims are not permitted to express joy or congratulate disbelievers on their festive occasions, whether by word of mouth, posters, newspapers, magazines, cards or the like</span>. The legal authorities must remove these notices.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success . May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">The Status of Jesus in Islam  &#8211; by Shaykh Rabee bin Hadee Al-Madkhalee</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a short essay <b>“Makaanatu ‘Eesaa fil-Islaam”</b> (The Status of Jesus in Islaam) written by Dr. Rabee’ bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee, a Muslim religious scholar from Saudi Arabia. The source used for this translation was the on-line version of the book, which can be found on <a href="http://www.rabee.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.rabee.net</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since the book, for the most part, is geared towards non-Muslim readers, particularly Christians, names of prophets and other righteous believers of the past are presented here in their standard English version, even though, they are pronounced differently in Arabic by Muslims. This was done to make it easier for the non-Muslim audience, who are not accustomed to the Arabic versions of these names, to read the treatise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, in many instances, the word “Allaah” was translated as God, in order to assist non-Muslim readers understand the subject at hand more clearly. However, the proper name of God, Allaah, was left as is in other parts where deemed appropriate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is hoped that this treatise may serve as a means to invite and call the Christian community to develop an understanding of how Jesus is viewed in the eyes of the Muslims and what we believe concerning him, as revealed to us by Allaah in the Qur’aan and the teachings of Prophet Muhammad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The story of Mary begins with this great connection of mentioning those whom God chose over mankind, which included the family of ‘Imraan, who were the parents of Mary. This is done in order to make it clear that Mary came from a righteous and noble family, and that she was part of the offspring of chosen prophets, and that her mother was a pious woman. An example of her piety and righteousness was that she vowed to offer what was in her womb to the services of God. She was hoping that it would be a boy, but instead she gave birth to a girl. So she returned this matter back to God, seeking His pardon and asking Him to protect her daughter and her offspring from the outcast Devil. So her Lord answered her supplication and warmly accepted Mary, causing her to be raised in a good manner and placing a righteous and merciful prophet, Zachariah, in charge of caring for her. This shows that the mother of Jesus had a tremendous upbringing.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“God is not in need of begetting a son. Attributing a child to Him is from the greatest forms of disbelief and misguidance, since it constitutes the highest level of insult and deficiency being ascribed to His Honor, Greatness and Lordship. This is since everything apart from God (the Creator) can only be one of His creations, and all of His creations submit themselves to His Honor and Grandness and are mandated to worship Him, whereas God is divine and free of begetting a child. This is why Allaah says to those who ascribe a child to Him, and His speech is the truth: <b>‘You have indeed brought forth something very terrible (i.e. an evil statement) – due to which the heavens are ready to tear apart, the earth split asunder, and the mountains fall in ruins. It is that they ascribe a child to the Most Merciful (i.e. God). However, it is not befitting for the (Majesty of the) Most Merciful that he should beget a child. There is none in the heavens and the earth except that he comes unto the Most Merciful as a servant. Verily, He knows each one of them, and has counted them a full counting. And each one of them will come to Him on the Day of Resurrection alone (and without any helpers).’</b>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<b>6.</b> In Chapter 21 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 46, it states: <b>‘But when they tried to arrest him, they feared the multitudes, since they held him to be a prophet.’</b>There is proof in this verse that the masses of people who believed in God and in Jesus were monotheists with pure and sincere faith, and that they believed that Jesus was a messenger and a prophet. This proves that their prophet, Jesus, had taught them this and cultivated them to believe in that. So they did not used to believe that he was God or the son of God, since he would not teach the people these things.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Has not the time come for the Christians, after hearing all of this, to hasten and rush to Islaam, especially the intellectual, educated and free thinking ones amongst them? We call them again to stand up before God in pairs and individually, then to reflect on this tremendous matter – of which there is no matter greater than it – with firm determination and impartiality and earnestly seeking to attain the truth and the reality, for it is indeed a crucial matter, which can either lead one to Paradise, the size of which spans the heavens and the earth, or to the Hellfire, whose fuel will be men and stones and which is prepared for those who disbelieve to reside therein forever. This is a matter that all of the messengers agreed on and which is contained in their revealed books, including Jesus, the servant and messenger of God. At this point, it is appropriate for us to honestly tell you: <b>‘O People of the Scripture! Come to a word that is just between us and you – that we worship none but God alone and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take others as lords besides God.’ Then if they turn away, say: ‘Bear witness that we are Muslims.’</b>”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Jesus and  Muhammad (peace be upon them) in the BIBLE and the QUR&#8217;AN</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Biblical evidence of Jesus being a servant of God and having no share in Divinity</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">by Dr. M. Taqi-ud-Din al-Hilali, Ph.D.<br />
Professor of Islamic Faith and Teachings, Islamic University, Al-Madina</p>
<hr width="100%" />
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to the One to Whom all Dignity, Honour and Glory are due; the Unique with perfect attributes, Who begets not, nor is He begotten. He has no equal but He is the Almighty, Omnipotent. He sent His Messengers and Prophets to guide humanity towards monotheism; to worship Him Alone, the only One Worthy of worship, and to warn them of the eternal dire consequences of polytheism; associating partners with One Allah and the worship of creatures.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon all the Prophets and Messengers, especially on Muhammad, the last of the Prophets, and on all who follow him in righteousness until the Day of Recompense.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTIANITY: MEN WITHOUT RELIGION </strong></p>
<p><strong>ISLAM: RELIGION WITHOUT MEN</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Muslim never lacks proofs about the purity and truthfulness of his religion, but what he lacks are those truthful brothers who stand for Allah and His Prophet <tt>SAW</tt> testifying to the truth. Indeed, in this age, Islam is a religion without men (custodians and propagators) whereas Christianity is men without a religion; yet, by their endeavour, adventurous spirit, patience and monetary contributions they are able to falsify truth and make falsehood appear true. In this materialistic age most of humanity have become slaves to wealth, fashions, and mansions.</p>
<p>There is none worthy of worship but Allah and in Him (Alone) do I put my trust, and towards Him am I destined.</p>
<p><strong>JESUS AND THE DEVIL IN THE BIBLE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the New Testament of the Bible, in the fourth chapter of the Gospel according to Matthew, the sixth and seventh verses clearly indicate that Jesus is an obedient mortal and God is the Master and Lord according to his saying in the seventh verse:</p>
<p>&#8220;It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord, thy God.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this chapter we read that the Devil actually carried the Messiah, and took him from place to place. How can the Devil carry God? Glory be to Allah; He is above such blasphemy!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Devil orders him to prostrate before him and worship him, even tempting him with worldly possessions. How can the Devil even dare such an audacity with God? When the Devil wanted Jesus to comply with his orders, he (Jesus) replied by saying that it was written (in the previous Books):</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou shalt worship the Lord, thy God; And Him only shalt thou serve.&#8221; Matthew 4:10.</p>
<p><strong>CHILDREN OF GOD</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jesus never called himself <em>Son of God</em> as far as I know but he used to call himself the &#8216;Son of Man&#8217; (ref. Mark 2:10) although he heard himself being called by that name he did not object as assumed in the Bible and did not consider the title exclusively for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to the Biblical term in the Old and New Testaments, every God- fearing righteous person is called &#8216;Son of God&#8217;. In Matthew 5:9 we read:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Blessed are the peace-makers, for they shall be called the children of God.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Matthew 5:45 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;That ye may be children of your Father which is in heaven&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>GOD THE FATHER</strong></p>
<p>In Matthew 5:48 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Matthew 6:1 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.&#8221;</p>
<p>Matthew 7:21 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not every one that sayeth unto me (Jesus), Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven: but he that doeth the will of my Father, which is in heaven.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>N.B. </strong>The word &#8216;Lord&#8217; here was translated as <em>Rabb</em> in the Arabic version of the Bible so that people may be convinced that Jesus is God! But if one studies the rest of the verse, one will note that the verse bears testimony to the subservience (to God&#8217;s Will) of the Messiah (Jesus). Therefore the correct translation should be:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Not every one that sayeth to me, O my Master, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obvious from the above readings from the Bible that the term &#8216;Father&#8217; is used for God in numerous places in the Bible. It is never used exclusively for the Messiah (Jesus).</p>
<p>Matthew 11:25 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;At that time Jesus answered and said, &#8216;I thank Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes.'&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>JESUS THE WORSHIPPER </strong></p>
<p>Matthew 14:23 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray&#8230;..&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: If he (Jesus) is God or a part of God then why did he pray? In fact, prayer is always from a submitting, needy and dependent one for the Mercy of Almighty Allah as mentioned in the Qur&#8217;ân. (V. 35:15):-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O mankind! it is you who stand in need of Allah but Allah is Rich (Free of all wants and needs), Worthy of all praise&#8221; (35:15).</p>
<p>And in (V. 19:93) of Qur&#8217;ân:-</p>
<p>&#8220;There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto the Most Beneficent (Allah) as a slave.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>A BIBLICAL STORY </strong></p>
<p>Matthew 15:22-28 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts and cried unto him, saying, &#8216;Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David: my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.&#8217; But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying; &#8216;Send her away, for she crieth after us.&#8217; But he answered and said, &#8216;I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then came she and worshipped him, saying, &#8216;Lord, help me.&#8217; But he answered and said, &#8216;It is not meet to take the children&#8217;s bread and to cast it to dogs.&#8217;</p>
<p>And she said, &#8216;Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters&#8217; table.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Jesus answered and said unto her, &#8216;O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<p>In this story about a woman from Canaan there are noteworthy points:</p>
<p>(1) Lack of mercy and love charged against Jesus (if the incident is reported correctly).</p>
<p>(2) Degraded discrimination in regard to the uplifting of his tribe and not for the others.</p>
<p>(3) Tribal pride of descendance and prejudice against others and calling them dogs.</p>
<p>(4) An ignorant polytheist woman debated with him and won him over.</p>
<p><strong>JESUS: A PROPHET OF ALLAH.</strong></p>
<p>Matthew 19:16-17 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And behold, one came and said unto him, &#8216;Good master, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?&#8217; And he said unto him, &#8216;Why callest thou me good? (There is) none good but one, (i.e.) God, but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<p>In the above verses we note this acknowledgment of his submissiveness (to Allah&#8217;s Will).</p>
<p>Matthew 21:45-46 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And when the chief priests and pharisees had heard his parable, they perceived that he spoke of them. But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude because they took him for a Prophet.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here it is proved that all those who believed in Jesus during his life-time did not believe in him being God or the Son of God or one in the doctrine of Trinity; but they believed in him as being a Prophet only. This is indeed one of the strongest points of evidence against those who believe in the Divinity of Jesus (Incarnation of God) if only they pondered.</p>
<p><strong>JESUS: A SERVANT OF ALLAH.</strong></p>
<p>Matthew 23:8 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8216;But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your master, even Jesus, and all ye are brethern.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here it is clearly proved that Jesus was servant of Allah, and that there is only One Master and He is Allah. In the Arabic version of the Bible this verse has been translated so that Jesus is meant to be the master whereas the English rendering is nearer the original sense.</p>
<p>Matthew 23:9 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father which is in heaven.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this you will note that fatherhood and sonship is meant to be the relationship between the Lord and His servants: it is meant in a general sense and not specifically for Jesus.</p>
<p>Matthew 24:36 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a definite proof that the Final Hour is unknown to any but Allah, thus Jesus&#8217; knowledge is imperfect like all other men; Allah Alone is All-Knowing, Omniscient.</p>
<p>Matthew 26:39 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And he (Jesus) went a little farther, and fell on his face and prayed, saying, &#8216;O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We note here that the person speaking is unaware of Allah&#8217;s Will and realizes the fact that he is a servant of Allah. He (Allah) Alone can cause the change.</p>
<p><strong>THE COMPILATION OF THE BIBLE</strong></p>
<p>Matthew 27:7-8 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And they took counsel and bought with them the potter&#8217;s field to bury strangers in. Wherefore that field was called the Field of Blood, unto this day.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From these verses we understand that the Bible (the New Testament) was not written during Jesus&#8217; life-time but long after the occurrence of the events described, having been retained in the memory of the people.</p>
<p>Matthew 27:46 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, &#8216;Eli,Eli, lama sabachthani? (My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me?&#8217;)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is according to their (Christians&#8217;) assumption that Jesus cried in a loud voice saying the above words while he was being crucified. This is a great insult as such words could only come from unbelievers in Allah. Further, it is incredible that such words should come out from a Prophet of Allah because Allah never breaks His Promise and His Prophets never complained against His Promise.</p>
<p><strong>JESUS: PREACHER OF MONOTHEISM (<em><strong>TAUHID</strong></em></strong><strong>)</strong></p>
<p>In John 17:3 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And this is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Mark 12:28-30 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, &#8216;Which is the first commandment of all?&#8217; And Jesus answered him: &#8216;The first of all the commandments is; hear O Israel, the Lord thy God is One Lord: and thou shalt love the Lord, thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<p>In Mark 12:32 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And the scribe said unto him, &#8216;Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is One God; and there is none other but He.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<p>In Mark 12:34 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;he (Jesus) said unto him, &#8216;Thou art not far from the kingdom of God&#8230;&#8217; &#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In these verses, Jesus (peace be upon him) himself had testified that Allah is the One God, there is none other than Him, and that whoever believes in His Oneness, he is near the Kingdom of Allah. Therefore whoever associates partners with Allah or believes in the Trinity is far away from the Kingdom of Allah, and whoever is far away from the Kingdom of Allah he is the enemy of Allah.</p>
<p>In Matthew 24:36 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of the heaven, but my Father only.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: A similar text was quoted from S.Matthew which is exactly as proclaimed by the Qur&#8217;ân in that none knows when the Hour will come except Allah. This establishes the fact that Jesus was subservient to Allah and that he had no share in Divinity: that he was an incarnation of God, was an innovation by the people of Canaan.</p>
<p>In John 20:16 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Jesus said unto her, &#8216;Mary&#8217;. She turned herself, and sayeth unto him, &#8216;Rabboni&#8217;, which is to say, Master, Jesus saith unto her, &#8216;Touch me not: For I am not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father; and to my God and your God.&#8217; Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she has seen the Lord, and that He had spoken these things unto her.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the above narrative Jesus clearly testified that Allah is his God and their God, making no difference between him and them in the worship of the One Allah. Whoever believes that Jesus is God has indeed blasphemed against Allah and betrayed the Messiah (Jesus) and all the Prophets and Messengers of Allah.</p>

<p><strong>BIBLICAL PROPHECY ON THE ADVENT OF MUHAMMAD (peace be upon him)</strong>John 14:15-16 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If you love me, keep my commandments. And I will pray the Father and He shall give you another Comforter that he may abide with you forever.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim theologians have said that &#8220;another Comforter&#8221; is Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah; and him to &#8220;abide forever&#8221; means the perpetuity of his laws and way of life (<em>Sharia&#8217;</em>) and the Book (Qur&#8217;ân) which was revaled to him.</p>
<p>John 15:26-27 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me: And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.&#8221;</p>
<p>John 16:5-8 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;But now I go my way to Him that sent me and none of you asketh me &#8216;Whither goest thou?&#8217; But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart. Nevertheless I tell you the truth; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and approve righteousness and judgment.&#8221;</p>
<p>John 16:12-14 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I have yet many things to say unto you, but you cannot bear them now. How be it when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak; and he will shew you things to come. He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and he shall shew it unto you.&#8221;</p>
<p>John 16:16 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;A little while and ye shall not see me: and again a little while, ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim theologians have stated that the person who is described by Jesus to come after him in the above verses does not comply with any other person but Muhammad (peace be upon him) the Messenger of Allah. This &#8216;person&#8217; whom Jesus prophesied will come after him is called in the Bible &#8216;Parqaleeta&#8217; This word was deleted by later interpreters and translators and changed at times to &#8216;Spirit of Truth&#8217;, and at other times, to &#8216;Comforter&#8217; and sometimes to &#8216;Holy Spirit&#8217;. The original word is Greek and its meaning is &#8216;one whom people praise exceedingly.&#8217; The sense of the word is applicable to the word &#8216;Muhammad&#8217; (in Arabic).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>FINALITY ON PROOFS ON THE FABRICATION </strong><strong>OF THE STORY OF THE CROSS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) The Bible testifies to the fact that Jesus was known among the Jews; he used to preach and deliver sermons in the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem. It was therefore, unnecessary to hire a Jew for thirty pieces of silver to direct them to him as related in S. Matthew.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) It is related that one of the twelve disciples named Judas Iscariot was hired to direct the Jews to Jesus. They then sentenced him after which Judas was greatly ashamed and dissociated himself from their act and then committed suicide. All this took place within twenty four hours. The contradictions are obvious.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) The clearest proof which alone is sufficient to discredit this story is when the Jews passed the sentence of death against Jesus and intended to get the approval of the governor, Pontious Pilate.</p>
<p>Matthew 27:11-14 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And Jesus stood before the governor: The governor asked him, saying, &#8216;Art thou the king of the Jews!&#8217; And Jesus said unto him, &#8216;Thou sayeth (sayest)&#8217;: And when he was accused of (by) the chief priests and elders. He answered nothing. Then said Pilate unto him, &#8216;Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?&#8217; And he answered him never (to) a word&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Christians will interpret the above verse to mean that Jesus wanted to die on the Cross for the redemption of mankind and for the forgiveness of their sins: if so, then why did he ask to turn away that cup from him (i.e. death)? Why did he cry out while on the Cross (as they assume): &#8220;O Lord, why hast thou forsaken me?&#8221; How could he have remained silent when the truth was being challenged? He was known for his soul-inspiring sermons challenging the learned Jewish <em>Rabbis.</em> No sane person can believe in this. If the story of the Cross is disproved then the very foundation on which Christianity is based, will be demolished.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslims believe that Jesus was not crucified by the Jews as revealed in the Holy Qur&#8217;ân by Allah in a crystal clear manner: V. 4:157,158.-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And because of their saying (in boast): &#8216;We killed Messiah Jesus, son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah&#8217;; &#8211; but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but the resemblance of Jesus was put over another man (and they killed that man), and those who differ therein are full of doubts. They have no (certain) knowledge, they follow nothing but conjecture. For surely, they killed him not (i.e., Jesus, son of Mary). But Allah raised him (Jesus) up (with his body and soul) unto Himself (and he <tt>alai-hiss-salaam</tt> is in the heavens).. And Allah is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jews themselves, together with the entire Christian world, believe that he was crucified. As proofs against their views and to prove the truth of the Muslim verdict through the Bible, I prepared the following set of questions based on the Book of S. Matthew in the New Testament of Bible. (Chapters 26 and 27):</p>
<p>(1) Did those who captured Jesus (according to their assumption) know him in person? or did they not know him?</p>
<p>S. Matthew testifies that they did not know him.</p>
<p>(2) Was it during the day or night that he was captured?</p>
<p>S.Matthew says it was during the night.</p>
<p>(3) Who was the one that directed them to him?</p>
<p>S. Matthew says: He was one of his twelve disciples called Judas lscariot.</p>
<p>(4) Did he direct them free of charge or for a fixed reward which they specified, for him?</p>
<p>S. Matthew says: He directed them to him for a fixed reward of thirty pieces of silver.</p>
<p>(5) What was the condition of Jesus during that night?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">S. Matthew says: He was fearful and prostrated in prayer saying: &#8220;O God, if it is possible for You to let this cup pass from me, then let it pass.&#8221; It is incredible that such words could come from a believer in God, let alone a Prophet of God, because all believers believe that God has power over all things.</p>
<p>(6) What was the condition of his eleven disciples?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">S. Matthew says: Sleep overcame them that night together with their teacher (according to their assumption) out of fear.</p>
<p>(7) Was Jesus contented with their condition?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">S. Matthew says (verses 40-46): He was not satisfied. He used to come to them to wake them up saying: &#8220;Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak.&#8221; Then he would come again to find them asleep and he would again wake them up and say the same thing. This weakness could not have been spoken of righteous pupils even if they were pupils of an ordinary pious teacher, let alone the disciples of Jesus, son of Mary.</p>
<p>(8) Did they help him when those ruffians captured him?</p>
<p>S. Matthew says: They forsook him and fled.</p>
<p>(9) Did Jesus have confidence in his disciples that night?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">S. Matthew says: Jesus informed them that they will all forsake him. Then Jesus said unto them: &#8220;Verily I say unto thee that this night before the cock crows, thou shall deny me thrice.&#8221; Peter said unto him, &#8220;Although I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee.&#8221; Likewise also said all the disciples. And so it happened.</p>
<p>(10) How did those ruffians capture him?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">S. Matthew says: They came to him with swords and staves after they were directed to him by a Jew, then they captured him as described in verse 57:</p>
<p>&#8220;And they that had laid hold on Jesus, led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the elders were assembled.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There they passed the sentence of death on him. The ruffians then took him away, spat on his face and struck him with their hands after which they stripped him of his clothes and clad him in scarlet robes, then placed a crown of thorns on his head and took him about, teasing and mocking him. They said to him: &#8216;You are the king of Israel according to your claim.&#8217; They severely degraded him.</p>
<p>(11) Who finally decided to pass the death sentence against him?</p>
<p>S. Matthew says: He was Pontious Pilate, a Greek Roman, who was at that time the governor of Palestine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(12) When the ruffians brought that man before the governor and informed him that the priest of the Jews passed the sentence of death by crucifixion according to their law (Torah), did he believe in them without investigation?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">S. Matthew says: He did not believe them but asked that man: &#8220;Is it true what they have said?&#8221; He remained silent. The question was repeated and he continued to remain silent. He remained silent in view of the truth; it was essential for him even if he was not a Prophet to clarify the truth and deny the false accusation of the Jews. The governor&#8217;s wife went to the governor and she said to him: &#8220;Have thou nothing to do with that just man? for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Bible states that Jesus delivered lengthy speeches to the Jews rebuking and warning them which amounted to defaming them. Then why was he silent that day? The governor&#8217;s intention for asking him was to stand for the truth.</p>
<p>(13) How was he crucified according to their assumption?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">S. Matthew says: They crucified him between two thieves both of whom abused him by saying to him, &#8220;If you are truthful then save yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>(14) This was a great calamity. What did he say while on the cross (according to their assumption)?</p>
<p>S. Matthew says (27:46):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, &#8220;Eli, Eli, Iama sabachthani? (that is to say,) my God, my God, why has Thou forsaken me?&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a blatant declaration of disbelief according to all theological authorities. Whoever relates it to a Prophet is a disbeliever according to the revealed religions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Almighty Allah, in the Qur&#8217;ân warns, the Jews and the Christians against their blasphemy; that Jesus is an incarnation of God (Allah) or the son of God (Allah) or in rejecting him totally; and that they must believe in him as a Messenger of Allah only:</p>
<p>&#8220;And there is none of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), but must believe in him (Jesus, son of Mary, as only a Messenger of Allah and a human being), before his (Jesus <tt>alai-hiss-salaam </tt> or a Jew&#8217;s or a Christian&#8217;s) death (at the time of the appearance of the angel of death). And on the Day of Resurrection, he (Jesus) will be a witness against them.&#8221; (V.4:159).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">This Book is for everyone who is searching within himself for answers about many questions: Who am I? Is there a purpose for my existence? Who is the True God? What is the True Road for Salvation? Is It Islam? If I become a Muslim what does it mean to me, my family and the society at large?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Today many realize that all of the materialistic and secular progress produced a spiritual vacuum that led to social, economical, political and psychological problems. That is why people who used to say: &#8220;let us live this life and enjoy it.&#8221; or &#8220;hey! We don&#8217;t want to know about God&#8221;, are in search again</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#008000;">Q &amp; A&#8217;s Concerning the Ideological Attack</span></span><br />
Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez bin Baaz , Al-Istiqaamah Magazine</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">[Q3]: What are the means which the west uses in order to spread their ideas and thoughts?</span><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A3]: The means that the west employs in order to spread their thoughts and ideas are many, from them:-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: The attempt <span style="color:#993300;">to conquer the minds of the Muslim children</span>. They do this by infusing in them western values and concepts so that they then believe that the best way to adopt in any matter is that of the west &#8211; whether it is with regards to what religion or sect they believe, or with regards to the languages that they speak, or the manners, customs and values with which they clothe themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Custody of a large group of the children of the Muslims in every country,</span> concern for them and bringing them up, so that when they <span style="color:#993300;">absorb western thoughts</span>, they return to their countries with a halo of praise and compliment, until they acquire position and authority in their countries by which they circulate western ideologies and establish learning centres conforming to western curricula or are directly influenced by them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly</strong>: Their active drive towards <span style="color:#993300;">promoting the learning of western languages in the Muslim lands</span>, making them compete with the Muslims&#8217; languages, especially the Arabic language, which is language of the Qur&#8217;aan &#8211; by which this Book was sent and by which the Muslims worship their Lord;in their Salaah (Prayer), their rites of Hajj (Pilgrimage), their forms of remembrances and glorifications, etc. From this is the <span style="color:#993300;">encouragement of destructive propaganda that fights against [the usage and learning] of [pure and classical] Arabic Language</span> and attempt to weaken the conformity to it in the Muslim lands. They do this by calling to using colloquialism, and by arranging numerous studies that intend to &#8216;develop&#8217; grammar in order to corrupt it; as well as formalising folk literature and and matters of national heritage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourthly</strong>: Development of <span style="color:#993300;">western universities and missionary schools in Muslim countries</span> and also initiating the role of kindergarten and playschools, hospitals and clinics which they make as dens and nests for their evil aims. They encourage the higher classes to study in them (western and missionary schools and universities) and after them help in acquire leadership posts and great position until they become an aid for their masters in following their plots in the Muslim lands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifthly</strong>: The attempt <span style="color:#993300;">to control education curricula in Muslim lands</span> and drawing out their politics, either directly; as occurred in some Muslim countries when the priest Dunlop undertook that task there, or by indirect methods. When the task was undertaken, most of the successful students who studied in Dunlop&#8217;s schools and graduated in them, arose as a destructive pickaxe in their country, or as one of the enemies most lethal weapons. [Such students] strive hard to influence the educational curriculum and steer it towards secularism &#8211; an ideology which does not centre around having eemaan (faith) in Allaah and His Messenger; but rather steers in the direction of atheism, or towards immorality and corruption.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sixthly</strong>: The large number of individuals amongst the <span style="color:#993300;">jews and christians</span> who have undertaken the study of Islam, Arabic Language, compiling books, and <span style="color:#993300;">taking positions of teaching in universities; until they created an ideological turmoil</span> and confusion amongst the educated Muslims, which they hurl at those that they are teaching, or with which they fill their books &#8211; until some of those books became sources which writers and researchers refer to in matters of ideology or history. Many people who were responsible for creating some of these fitnahs (trials and turmoil) in the Muslim countries, were actually Muslims who graduated at the hands of the people. The praise and awe which surrounded such graduates helped them to achieve this, as well as achieve their post and positions; such as important posts in teaching and leadership. So they completed what their teachers had initiated [of corruption and destruction] and fulfilled what they couldn&#8217;t achieve, because they were of Muslim offspring and from the same skin, ascribing themselves to them and speaking their tongue &#8211; so we ask and seek Allaah&#8217;s help.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Seventhly</strong>: A large number of <span style="color:#993300;">missionary workers calling to christianity</span> have proceeded between the Muslims that they have performed their work on. [This missionary activity is done upon] well studied principles, and upon a large scale; employing hundreds of thousands of men and women. Huge financial budgets are put aside for this task, and [they are aided in such a way that] their task is made easier for them and obstacles are removed for them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;They want to extinguish the Light (i.e, the Religion) of Allaah with their mouths, but Allaah will bring His Light to perfection and completion, even though the disbelievers hate it.&#8221; </span>[Soorah as-Saff 61:8].</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as the efforts of the missionaries are set up and aimed mostly at the common levels; then the efforts of the orientalist are directed to the educated &#8211; as I previously mentioned. The missionaries take on huge hardships in their work in the African Countries, and in the remote villages of the far extreme Muslim lands; in eastern Asia. After that, every so often, they hold conferences in order to review their accounts and their plans; then they analyse, adjust and implement. They met in Cairo in 1906, in Edinburgh in 1910, in Lucknow (India) in 1911, and in Jerusalem in 1935, and they continue to hold such assemblies, seminars and conferences &#8211; so glory be to the One in Whose Hand is the sole sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, and to Him return all affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Eighthly</strong>: Spreading corruption in the Muslim societies; belittling the with regards to their role in life, making her transgress the limits set by Allaah for her, creating in her a satisfaction in abstaining from the [correct] Path. They do this by <span style="color:#993300;">spreading propaganda amongst the Muslims in various ways and manners, so that women freely mix with men, and so that women work in the places of men</span>. By this, they aim to corrupt the Muslim society, and to put an end to the chastity and purity which is found therein. Additionally, by bringing up imaginary issues and false propaganda &#8211; [claiming] that Islaam oppresses women, and that Muslim women have very little rights &#8211; they want to take her out of her home, and put her wherever they may want; even though the limits that Allaah has set [in the Qur&#8217;aan] are clear; as are His commands [concerning these matters], and as is the Sunnah (Guidance) of His Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the Believing women to draw their jilbaabs (cloaks) over their entire body. That will be better, that they should be known (as free and respectable women), so as not to be harassed, And Allaah is Ever-Forgiving, Most-Merciful.&#8221;</span> [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:59].</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And &#8211; the Most High &#8211; says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And let the Believing women draw their khimaars (head-scarves) over their faces, necks and chests, and not to display their beauty, except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husband&#8217;s fathers, or their sons, or their husband&#8217;s sons &#8230;&#8221;</span> [Soorah an-Noor 24:31].</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And when you ask them for something, ask them from behind a screen; that is purer for your hearts and their hearts.&#8221; </span>[Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:53].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And stay in your houses, and do not display yourselves like that of the times of jaahiliyyah (pre-lslaamic ignorance).&#8221;</span> [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:33].</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said:<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;Beware of entering into the company of women.&#8221;</em> </span>A man from the Ansaar said: O Messenger of Allaah, what about the husband&#8217;s brothers and relatives! He replied: <em>&#8220;The husband&#8217;s brothers and relatives are death!&#8221; </em>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam also said:<br />
<em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;A man must not be alone in the company of a women, for indeed the third of them is shaytaan.&#8221;</span> </em>[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ninthly</strong>: The <span style="color:#993300;">Building of churches and temples in the Muslim lands</span> and spending great amounts of wealth on them; beautifying them, making them very conspicuous and noticeable, and building them in the largest and best of places.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tenthly</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Radio stations set up solely for the purpose of calling to christianity and communism</span>, spreading their [false] objectives. They intend to misguide, through such false ideas, the children of the innocent and naive Muslims &#8211; who neither understand, nor did they receive a sufficient Islaamic education. This is the case, in particular, in Africa where the Bible is published and distributed in plenty of hotels, etc. [They also] send missionary publications and false preaching to many of the Muslim children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are some of the means utilised by the enemies of Islaam today &#8211; from east and the west &#8211; in waging war against the Muslim&#8217;s thought, [intending by this ideological attack] to put an end to correct righteous thought, so that they are replaced by [false and] foreign ideas; whether eastern or western.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And &#8211; O noble reader &#8211; as you can see, these means involve tremendous efforts, enormous amounts of money and a multitude of soldiers. All of this is done in order to take the Muslims away from Islaam, even if they do not actually embrace christianity, judaism or marxism. Since their primary goal in doing this is to take the Muslims away from Islaam, so that when this stage is achieved, then whatever [misguidance] follows becomes far easier to implement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, despite all this we say: that Allaah will frustrate them in their hopes, and will nullify their plans &#8211; but only if the Muslims are sincere in their fight against them, cautious and alert to their plans, and obedient and upright upon their Religion; as Allaah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;But if you remain patient and become pious and obedient to Allaah, their plots will not harm you in the least. Indeed, Allah encompasses all that they do.&#8221; </span>[Soorah Aal-lmraan 3:120].</p>
</blockquote>
