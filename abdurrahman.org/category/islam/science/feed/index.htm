Amma ba&#8217;d</p>
<p><strong>Delving into the Sciences of the World to prove Islaam </strong></p>
<p><strong>Excerpts</strong> from Shaikh &#8216;Ubaid al-Jabiree (hafidhahullaah):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was not known at the times of the Salaf, nor was it known by the Companions of the Prophet Muhammad sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, or the imams of the Tabi&#8217;een (the Successors) or those who followed after them. This idea of researching the sciences behind the creation didn&#8217;t appear until about thirty years or so ago&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This idea of proving Islam through the Sciences is a bid&#8217;ah (an innovation). This type of study keeps us away from learning the true religion. My sincere advice to you my sister in Egypt, and other sisters of the Sunnah in Egypt, is that you shouldn&#8217;t listen to this and must not busy yourselves with this knowledge but rather you should focus on the knowledge of the Sharee&#8217;ah which is the knowledge of the Qur`aan and the Sunnah upon the understanding of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sunnah is a way of happiness and tranquillity in this life because the Prophet sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said: Whoever Allaah wants good for, He gives him understanding of the religion. So from this, we understand that whoever Allaah does not want good for, He does not give him understanding of the religion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='715' height='402' src='https://video.wordpress.com/embed/333bGmbA?hd=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1&amp;loop=0&amp;preloadContent=metadata&amp;muted=0&amp;playsinline=0&amp;controls=1&amp;cover=1' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen  allow='clipboard-write' ></iframe><script src='https://v0.wordpress.com/js/next/videopress-iframe.js?m=1739540970'></script></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Uploaded by LearnToReadTheKuran</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Prophet Muhummed (sallallaahu `alayhi wa sallaam) said: <span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;If a housefly falls in the drink of anyone of you, he should dip it (in the drink), for one of its wings has a disease and the other has the cure for the disease.&#8221;</em></span> (Al-Bukhari)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Ibn Maj&#8217;ah narrated that the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu `alayhi wa sallaam) said: <em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;One of the fly&#8217;s wings carries poison while the other carries antidote. When it falls in the food, dip it, for the sake of Allah, for verily He (Allah) makes the poison (take effect) first and He makes the cure come last.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Hadith contains two areas of interest, Fiqh (Islamic Jurisprudence) and medicinal. As for the Fiqh part, the Hadith states that when a fly falls in water or fluids, it does not make it impure, according to the majority of the scholars. None among the early generations contradicted this ruling.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu `alayhi wa sallaam) ordered the fly that falls on the food be dipped in it, thus killing the fly, especially if the food is hot. If the fly&#8217;s death inside the food would make the food impure, the Prophet (sallallaahu `alayhi wa sallaam) would have ordered us to discard the food. On the contrary, the Prophet sought to salvage the food.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the medicinal value contained in the Hadith, Abu &#8216;Ubaidah (may Allah be pleased with him) said that the purpose behind dipping the fly (in the drink) is to extract the antidote from (its other wing) just as the poison was extracted from (the wing that fell on the food).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Houseflies carry poisonous materials as evidenced by the effect of their bite, such as rash and infection, and this poison is the fly&#8217;s weapon of defense. When the fly falls into what harms it, it tries to defend itself with the available weapons.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu `alayhi wa sallaam) ordered that we neutralize the poisonous substances produced by the fly with the antidote that Allah has kept on its other wing. The fly should then be submerged in the water or the food so that the antidote could neutralize the effect of the poison. This is a remedy that the best medical minds would never be able to discover on their own, because it is coming from Prophetic knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The doctors who have good knowledge and comprehension submit to this Prophetic remedy and admit that he who was sent with it, is indeed the perfect human being who is supported by divine revelation that is beyond human power.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[From: The Medicine of the Prophet| By: Ibn Qayyim is an 8th century (Hijri) Islamic scholar whose writings are popular in the Islamic world even today]</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Scholar: Imâm Muhammad Nâsir-ud-Dîn al-Albânî<br />
Source: Silsilat-ul-Hudâ wan-Nûr 435 &amp; 436<br />
Reference and translation by our brothers at: alalbaany com, asaheeha translations.<br />
aFatwa.com (site is down)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: &#8220;Is the earth round or flat?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Albaani</strong>: It is round,[1] and the issue of the earth being round or flat is not an affair related to actions nor faith, such that it is obligatory for the Muslim to know the Islamically legislated ruling about it if it is related to actions in order to worship Allaah by it like the rest of the acts of worship, or for him to believe in it in the depth of his heart and soul if it is a belief that every Muslim is commanded to believe in. Rather, it is an issue that can be understood upon two (different) ways from the explanation of some aayaat in the noble Qur&#8217;aan. And no doubt &#8212; as is the case with most issues &#8212; one of the views will be correct and the other will be wrong. Thus, whoever makes ijtihaad[2] while he is qualified to do so &#8212; and the first condition for this qualification is knowledge of the Arabic language &#8212; then whether he is right or wrong, as (the questioner) himself knows, whoever is right has two rewards and whoever errs has one reward.[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And these aayaat that have come with regard to the earth, about whether it is moving, round or whether it is stationary &#8212; there isn&#8217;t a decisive text that would support either of the two different views. Therefore, we said that this is not an affair related to belief about which there must be a united opinion as we believe to the case with the &#8216;aqeedah (belief) of the salaf (righteous predecessors). It could be understood from some of the aayaat from the noble Qur&#8217;aan related to this subject that the earth is stationary and flat, and it could be understood from some other (aayaat) that it is moving and orbiting. And this (latter) opinion is that which carries more weight in our view and agrees with the natural reality which every individual from the people perceives (to be true), whether he is a Muslim or a disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is sufficient for us to know that there isn&#8217;t a decisive proof about this issue with those who insist on opposing that which is established scientifically today: that the earth moves and that it orbits around the sun. It is sufficient, for knowing that there isn&#8217;t a clear text contradicting this idea or this astronomical view, that many of the Muslim scholars whose knowledge and excellence all of the Muslims acknowledge &#8212; especially us Salafis[4] who believe in the leadership of Shaykh ul-Islaam ibn Taimiyyah in knowledge of the Book and the Sunnah, and Ibn Qayyim az-Jawziyyah, let alone other than them &#8212; used to believe the opposite of what is being spread now based on some apparent indications of the Qur&#8217;aan, such as the aayah {And the mountains He has fixed firmly}[5] for example, {And after that He spread the earth}[6] and similar aayaat. They did not understand (and deduce) this opposing rigid opinion from (these aayaat), firstly due to the apparent indications of other (Qur&#8217;aanic) texts, and secondly due to astronomical, scientific fact. And the like of the aayah that describes the mountains with respect to the earth to be like anchors with respect to ships does not necessitate linguistically that the earth does not move at all, but rather it negates a disordered movement.[7] And similar to this aayah is the aayah: {And the mountains [We have made] as pegs},[8] because we know by observation that the peg with respect to the animal does not prevent it from moving [i.e, when you tie the animal to the peg], but rather the peg prevents it from moving chaotically such that it would flee and go off however it wants &#8212; no, our Lord has arranged the orbiting of the earth like the circulating of the horse around the peg. Hence, Him making the mountains as pegs is contrary to what they claim; it (actually) confirms the movement of the earth, but it confirms a scientific movement that is well-known today to be organized and very precise throughout the year such that it does not change by a single second. Likewise, the anchors don&#8217;t prevent the ship from moving.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>The Qur&#8217;an and Noah&#8217;s Ark</strong></span><br />
Source: The Observer (by Martin Wroe)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Martin Wroe, LONDON &#8211; Noah&#8217;s Ark has been found on the Turkish-Iranian border, 32 kilometres from Mount Ararat, according to the leader of a team of scientists that has been investigating the site for six years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Turkish government is so convinced by the findings that, after years of intransigence, it has designated the site one of special archaeological interest and agreed to its excavation next summer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The remote site contains a buried, ship-like object, resting an altitude of 2,300 metres. At 170 metres long and 45 metres wide, it conforms almost exactly to the 300 cubit by 50 cubit boat that God told Noah to build, according to Genesis 6 in the Bible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On surrounding terrain, the American and Middle Eastern scientists have identified huge stones with holes carved at one end, which they believe are &#8220;drogue-stones,&#8221; dragged behind ships in the ancient world to stabilise them. Radar soundings indicate unusual levels of iron-oxide distribution.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Salih Bayraktutan, head of geology at Turkey&#8217;s Ataturk University, estimates the age of the &#8216;vessel&#8217; at more than 100,000 years. &#8220;It is a man-made structure and for sure it is Noah&#8217;s Ark.&#8221; The site is directly below the mountain of Al Judi, named in the Koran as the Ark&#8217;s resting place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">David Fasold, an American shipwreck specialist with no religious affiliation, has led the investigation. He says subsurface radar surveys of the site have produced &#8220;very good pictures.&#8221; &#8220;The radar imagery at about 25 metres down from the stern is so clear that you can count the floorboards between the walls.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He believes the team has found the fossilised remains of the upper deck and that the original reed substructure has disappeared. But the findings have infuriated the scores of Christian Ark-hunters who travel to Turkey, convinced the Ark will only be found on Mount Ararat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fasold, who calls himself an &#8220;Arkologist,&#8221; also argues that it was not a great flood that pushed the Ark into the mountains. He says it was &#8220;an astronomical event causing a tectonic upheaval, a tidal bore causing gravitational pull in the ocean waters that forced the boat into the mountains.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of Fasold&#8217;s team of geophysicists and geologists are reserving final judgement until the excavation and carbon-dating. But in a British TV series on the environment next month, team member Vendyl Jones, a Middle East archaeologist and inspiration for film character Indiana Jones, says it is &#8220;between maybe and probably&#8221; that they have found Noah&#8217;s Ark.</p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Observer newspaper, 16 January 1994</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Prologue</strong>: The Quranic verse detailing about the resting place of the Noah&#8217;s Ark is found in Chapter Hood, verse 44 (Qur.aan 11:44). The verse says:</p>
<blockquote><p>{When the word went forth: &#8220;O earth! swallow up thy water and O sky! withhold (thy rain)!&#8221; and the water abated and the matter was ended. The Ark rested on Mount Judi and the word went forth: &#8220;Away with those who do wrong!&#8221;}</p></blockquote>
<p>The 49th verse of the same Chapter says:</p>
<blockquote><p>{Such are some of the stories of the Unseen which We have revealed unto you: before this neither you nor your people knew them. So persevere patiently: for the end is for those who are righteous}</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Fatwas of Nur `Ala Al-Darb&gt;Volume 1&gt;Chapter on `Aqidah&gt;Chapter on Tawhid-related topics&gt;Claiming that humans evolved from apes is a false claim</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: I have read a lot about the theory that humans evolved from an apelike ancestor. The theory proposes that humans went through several stages until they developed into the modern man. Is this true? Are the organs of apes similar to those of humans? Please advise us, may Allah reward you with the best!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This statement is false, unacceptable, and contradictory to the Book of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He), the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) as well as the Ijma` (consensus) of the Salaf (righteous predecessors). This theory which was introduced by Darwin is proven to be a lie, for modern humans originated from a human ancestry, not from an ape or anything else. Allah created our father Adam (peace be upon him) from clay.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states, And indeed We created man (Adam) out of an extract of clay (water and earth). Allah created Adam from clay and molded him in His Image. Adam was sixty cubits tall, but people have been decreasing in stature since then. He was created in the form and shape of today humans. His children were created in his image; they have ears, eyes, minds, and the same shape of today human. They stand upright, they speak, hear and see, and they can use their hands. They do not have the form of apes and do not share apes the same organs. Human beings are of a special origin as are apes, pigs, dogs, donkeys, cats, etc. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states, There is not a moving (living) creature on earth, nor a bird that flies with its two wings, but are communities like you. We have neglected nothing in the Book, then unto their Lord they (all) shall be gathered. These communities will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection to have the scores among them settled and it will be said to them, &#8216;Be dust.&#8217; On the other hand, Jinn and mankind will be called to account and will be rewarded according to their deeds; whoever obeys Allah will enter Jannah (Paradise) and whoever disbelieves in Him will enter the Hellfire. These communities are distinct species; apes are a species that have their own nature, form, and characteristics, and so are the pigs, dogs, donkeys, camels, cows, sheep, etc. Each of these species has its own shape and characteristics which Allah (Exalted be He) molded. He is the All-Wise and All-Knowing of the minute details and formation of each species.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A servant of Allah must believe that the creation of Adam differs from the creation of apes and the form of Adam is the same as that of today&#8217;s man and not as apes or anything else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The claim that man descended from an apelike ancestor is false and unacceptable. Therefore, <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>it is correct to assume that anyone who espouses this theory is a Kafir (disbeliever). The most correct view is that whoever believes this theory while knowing the ruling of Shari`ah in this regard is a Kafir</strong></span> and such a person then belie Allah, His Messenger and the Qur&#8217;an which gives a clear description of the creation of Adam .</p>
