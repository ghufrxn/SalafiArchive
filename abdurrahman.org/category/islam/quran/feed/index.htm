<p>The Softening of the Heart in Ramadhan | Shaykh Abdussalam al-Shuway&#8217;ir حفظه الله [Video | En subtitles] &#8211; <a href="https://youtu.be/AqHUQX3cJAc">https://youtu.be/AqHUQX3cJAc</a> [3:43 min]</p>



<p>From the tremendous characteristics acquired during this month is what is related to the softening of the heart. Indeed, this month is a means for the softening of the heart. And the softness of the heart is from the characteristics of the believer. And from the effects of the softness of the heart is that it brings about tears.</p>



<p>Indeed, if the heart softens, the eyes flow with tears.</p>



<p>And it comes down out of the fear of Allah ﷻ. Due to this, our Lord said in Al-Ma&#8217;idah:83:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-small-font-size">When they listen to what has been sent down to the Messenger you see their eyes overflowing with tears…</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If an individual reads the Speech of Allah abundantly, and contemplates over its meanings. Indeed, his heart will soften, and his eyes will relent. The greatest month wherein the Qur&#8217;an is read is the month of Ramadhan.</p>



<p>Due to this, Allah coupled the Qur&#8217;an with this month. He said in Al-Baqarah:185:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-small-font-size">The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Qur&#8217;an, a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the criterion.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the Sahih from the Hadith of Ibn Abbas رضي الله عنه, who said that the Prophet ﷺ was the most generous of people. And the most generous he would be was during Ramadhan when Jibril would come to him and study the Qur&#8217;an with him. Jibril would study the Qur&#8217;an with the Prophet. He would read the Qur&#8217;an once every Ramadhan, except the year he passed away, wherein he studied it with Jibril twice.</p>



<p>Therefore, this month is the month of the Qur&#8217;an. The Qur&#8217;an is read and recited in this month. And in it, the greatest stories are mentioned. And in it, the greatest narrations are mentioned, in reading the beginning of the Book of Allah. </p>



<p>Muhammad Nasr al-Marwazi spoke extensively about the narrations of the Salaf in their recitation of the Qur&#8217;an in this month specifically. And the scholars recommend that the month of Ramadhan should not be devoid of a completion of the Qur&#8217;an. And that the Tarawih prayers should not be devoid of a completion of the Qur&#8217;an.</p>



<p>Whoever reads the Qur&#8217;an in the month of Ramadhan and his heart is not softened, and tears don&#8217;t come down from his eyes, then it is feared that he has a hard heart. Therefore, Hasan al-Basri رَحِمَهُ ٱللَّٰهُ said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-small-font-size">The people continue to cry when they remember Allah and when they read the Qur&#8217;an.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>What he meant by: &#8216;The people&#8217; are the companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Therefore, this is one of the tremendous objectives, which is refining the character and softening the heart.</p>



<p>And the more an individual&#8217;s eyes flows with tears, the more of an effect it will have upon his heart, since there is a connection between the eyes and the heart. Listen to the Statement of Allah, Al-Ghafir:19:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-small-font-size">Allah knows the fraud of the eyes, and all that the breasts conceal </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Some of the people of knowledge derive from this that there is a connection between the eyes and the heart.  Verily, if the heart has fear, then the eyes will shed tears. And the affair of the heart is hidden and what the eyes see are hidden. And other than that which the people of knowledge derive from this tremendous verse.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1- Muslims who will enter Jannah without being called to account</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: Is it true that some Muslims will enter Jannah (Paradise) without being called to account?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Yes, it is true, The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(<strong>&#8220;All the nations were shown to me, and I saw a prophet accompanied by a small group of his followers, another with two or three people of his followers and a third not accompanied by any follower.&#8221;</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At the end of the Hadith, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Among my Ummah there are seventy thousand who would enter Jannah without being brought to account or being punished.&#8221;</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) asked who these people were, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;They are those who do not seek Ruqyah (recitation for healing or protection); they are those who do not get themselves cauterized; and they are those who do not believe in bad omens; rather, they put their trust in their Lord.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hadith implies that the Mu&#8217;min (believer), who continues obeying Allah&#8217;s commands and avoiding His prohibitions until death, will enter Jannah without being held accountable for their deeds and without suffering punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Falling under this category are the Mu&#8217;mins who do not ask others to recite Ruqyah over them. There is nothing wrong, however, if they themselves are accustomed to reciting Ruqyahs over other Muslims. This is because one who recites Ruqyah basically does a good deed by asking Allah (Exalted be He) to cure the illness of the person for whom they recite the Ruqyah. This is based on the authentic Hadith in which the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Whosoever among you is able to benefit his fellow believer, let him do so.)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Istirqa</strong></span>&#8216; means to ask others to recite Ruqyah for you. For example, you may ask a person to recite Rygyah for you. It is better not to ask others for Ruqyah unless one happens to be suffering from an ailment, In this case, it is not wrong to ask others to recite Ruqyah. It has been reported that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) asked Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) saying: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Seek healing through asking for Ruqyah</span></strong>) The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) ordered her to treat herself by means of asking others for Ruqyah, He also ordered Asma’ bint Umays to recite Ruqyah to the children of Jafar when they were under the influence of the evil eye. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is also reported to have said: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There is no Ruqyah (reciting Qur&#8217;an and supplicating over the sick seeking healing) better than that which is said as a treatment for an evil eye or (a sting of) a venomous animal</strong></span>.&#8221; It is not wrong to seek treatment by means of Istirqa’ when necessary. However, it is better not to resort to such means if it is possible to cure oneself by means of some other kind of medicine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also better not to treat oneself by means of <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>cauterization</strong> </span>if another means of treatment is available. This is based on the Hadith in which the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The best of all remedies are three; cauterization, drinking honey, and cupping, yet I hate to be cauterized.</strong></span>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another version it states: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">..and I forbid my Ummah (nation) from cauterization.</span></strong>) This denotes that cauterization should be used as a last resort when all other means prove unsuccessful. It is better to seek treatment by other means if possible. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have cauterized some of his Sahabah. However, cauterization may only be resorted to when necessary. It is, however, better to apply another means of treatment like drinking honey, cupping, or reciting the Qur&#8217;an, The Prophet&#8217;s (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) statement: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They are those who do not seek Ruqyah; they are those who do not get themselves cauterized&#8230;</strong></span>) does not denote that seeking Ruqyah or cauterization are prohibited; rather, it denotes that one may resort to other means of treatment in preference to these kinds. However, if one is forced by necessity to seek Ruqyah or cauterization, there is nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“T<strong><span style="color:#008000;">hey are these who do not believe in bad omens</span></strong>&#8220;: Believing in the occurrence of evil omens, a custom practiced by the pre-Islamic Arabs, constitutes an act of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among the characteristics of the seventy thousand Muslims who will enter Jannah without being called to account is that they avoid the prohibited practice of believing in bad omens and the reprehensible practice of seeking Ruqyah and cauterization when there is no need for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The statement &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">They put their trust in their Lord</span></strong>,&#8221; means that such Muslims avoid these things because they put their trust in Allah (Exalted be He) and seek to attain His Pleasure. The statement implies that they steadfastly obedient to Allah (Exalted be He) and they avoid not only what He has declared as prohibited but also some of what He has declared as permissible if there is something better than it. By doing so, they hope for Allah&#8217;s Reward and fear His Punishment. They draw near to Him through doing deeds that He loves and do so with their hearts filled with trust and confidence in Him (Glorified and Exalted be He),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to another similar Hadith, it was stated: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">An extra number of seventy thousand Muslims will enter Jannah with every thousand&#8230;)</span></strong> According to another Hadith: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allah promised to increase the number by as many as three Handfuls added by my Lord, Glorified be He.</span></strong>) This increase in number is known to none but Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To summarize, every upright Mu&#8217;min who avoids Allah&#8217;s Prohibitions and does not allow themselves to go beyond the limits set by Allah (Exalted be He) will be counted among the seventy thousand Muslims who will enter Jannah without Allah calling them to account or consigning them to punishment.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said that seventy thousand Muslims will enter Jannah without being called to account and without suffering punishment. When the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) inquired about their characteristics, the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) told them that they are those who do not seek Ruqyah, those who do not get themselves cauterized, and those who do not believe in bad omen. We ask Your Eminence to clarify these characteristics so that we may develop them.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said that <strong><span style="color:#008000;">seventy thousand people of his Ummah (nation) will enter Jannah without being called to account and without suffering punishment.</span></strong> In another Hadith, it was stated: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">An extra number of seventy thousand Muslims will enter Jannah with every thousand.,.</span></strong>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) was asked about their characteristics, he said: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">They are those who do not seek Ruqyah from others, those who do not get themselves cauterized, and those who do not believe in bad omens; rather, they put their trust in their Lord.</span></strong>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hadith refers to pious and faithful Muslims who adhere steadfastly to Allah&#8217;s Din (religion), those who worship Allah Alone, those who fulfill their religious duties, those who avoid His Prohibitions and strive hard to do good to the point that they decline to do what is permissible, yet undesirable, like seeking Ruqyah and cauterization. This perfects their Iman (faith). They do not ask others to make Ruqyah for them nor do they get themselves cauterized. It is better not to resort to seeking Ruqyah or cauterization unless under necessity. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) ordered ‘Aishah to treat herself by means of seeking Ruqyah. He also ordered Asma’ bint Umays to treat her children by means of seeking Ruqyah when they were under the influence of the evil eye. This indicates that seeking Ruqyah is permissible only when necessary. However, it is better not to treat oneself by means of Istirqa&#8217; or cauterization if another means of treatment is available, Some of the Sahabah were treated by means of cauterization. Khabbab ibn Al-Arat and other Sahabah were also treated by means of cauterization, The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is also reported to have used cauterization as a means of treating the sickness of some of his Sahabah. Having oneself cauterized does not necessarily mean that one will not be counted among the seventy thousand people who will enter Jannah without being held accountable for their deeds. However, one of their good characteristics includes their uprightness, truly obeying Allah (Exalted be He) and avoiding disobedience to Him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the meaning of the following Hadith: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) once asked his Sahabah: &#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221; They asked him about those people who will enter Jannah without being called to account. Whereupon the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: &#8220;They are those who do not seek Ruqyah, those who do not get themselves cauterized, and those who do not believe in bad omens; rather, they put their trust in their Lord.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This has been reported in the Hadith about the seventy thousand Muslims who are destined to enter Jannah without being called to account. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) told his Sahabah that his Ummah were displayed before him. Among them were seventy thousand people who are destined to enter Jannah without being called to account and without suffering punishment, Some people said; &#8220;The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) may be referring to those who were born Muslims.&#8221; Others said: &#8220;He may be referring to those who accompanied the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) during the early days of Islam and did not associate any partners with Allah.&#8221; When the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) entered upon them, he asked them about the topic they were discussing, When they told him that they were inquiring about the Muslims who will enter Jannah without being judged, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said; (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">They are those who do not seek Ruqyah, those who do not get themselves cauterized, and those who do not believe in bad omens; rather, they put their trust in their Lord</span></strong>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition to the characteristics mentioned in the above Hadith, they also fear Allah, believe in Him and hold steadfastly to His Din (religion).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><span style="color:#008000;">They are those who do not get themselves cauterized</span></strong>&#8221; means that they do not resort to cauterization when they are ill. Another great characteristic is that they put their trust in Allah (Exalted be He), However, it is permissible to treat sickness by means of cauterization or seeking Ruqyah as the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have permitted them both. He permitted “Aishah to treat herself by means of seeking Ruqyah. He also permitted the mother of Ja ‘far&#8217;s children to treat them by means of seeking Ruqyah. However, if another means of treatment is available, then it will be better not to resort to seeking Ruqyah or cauterization. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">The best of all remedies are three: cauterization, drinking honey, and cupping, yet I do not like to be cauterized</span></strong>. )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Believing in bad omens is prohibited because it leads to pessimism. There is a narration from Imam Muslim that states: &#8220;They do not recite Ruqyah to others,&#8221; but its status has been classified as weak. Some narrators have mistaken seeking Ruqyah for Ruqyah. There is nothing wrong if the Muslim recites Ruqyah for his fellow Muslim, The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing wrong with Ruqyahs as long as they do not contain formulas that bear the meaning of Shirk</span></strong>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have recited Ruqyah to his Sahabah, “Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) is also reported to have recited Ruqyah over the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) when he fell sick. The Sahabah are also on reported to have recited Ruqyah to each other. There is nothing wrong with reciting Ruqyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is better not to seek Ruqyah unless there is a necessity. This is based on the fact that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) ordered Aishah saying: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You may ask for someone to recite Ruqyah over you.</strong></span>&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) also said to the mother of the children of Ja ‘far &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">You may ask for someone to recite Ruqyah over them (her children).</span></strong>&#8221; There is nothing wrong to ask someone saying: “<strong>O so and so, recite the Qur&#8217;an over me so that Allah may cure my sickness. May Allah reward you greatly</strong>.&#8221; There is also nothing wrong to have oneself cauterized if there is need for that.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Who are the people who will enter Jannah without being held accountable for their deeds? Are they those who do not recite Ruqyah for themselves nor for others? Kindly explain this to us. May Allah reward you with the best.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Those who follow Allah&#8217;s Din, fulfill His religious duties, and avoid His Prohibitions are destined to enter Jannah without being called to account or suffering punishment. Among them are the seventy thousand who do not seek Ruqyah, have themselves cauterized or believe in bad omens, but put their trust in Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They also do not believe in bad omens because believing in them is prohibited. Moreover, they prefer to avoid cauterization as a form of treatment, This is because the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said that these are among the characteristics of the seventy thousand (who will enter Paradise without being called to account). It would be better to use another form of treatment instead of cauterization. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (The best of all remedies are three: cauterization, cupping, and drinking honey, yet I do not like to be cauterized, ) The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have cauterized some of his Sahabah, Therefore, it is better not to treat oneself by means of cauterization, especially when another means of treatment is available. If no other means is available, then there is nothing wrong to resort to this. That does not necessarily mean that they will not be accounted among the seventy thousand. This is because the seventy thousand are those who adhere to the Din of Allah, avoid His Prohibitions, and fulfill the duties He prescribed. Among their good characteristics is that they do not seek Ruqyah. However, seeking Ruqyah does not necessarily mean that they will not be included among the seventy thousand. Seeking Ruqyah is to ask others to recite Ruqyah for you. There is nothing wrong to ask for Ruqyah if there is need for that. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) ordered ‘Aishah to treat herself by means of seeking Ruqyah, He also ordered the mother of the children of Ja far to treat her children by means of seeking Ruqyah, so there is nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also nothing wrong to have oneself cauterized if there is a need for that. This is based on the Hadith in which the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (The best of all remedies are three things: cauterization, cupping, and drinking honey.) This Hadith denotes that though it is permissible to seek treatment by means of cauterization, it is preferable not to resort to it, especially when some other sort of medicine is available.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <strong><span style="color:#993300;">Is the Basmalah (بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ) an actual verse of Sūrah al-Fātiḥah or Not?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Uthaymeen:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars hold differing opinions about this issue. Some say that it is definitely a verse from al-Fātiḥah and it should be recited aloud in those prayers which are recited out-loud. They believe it is not correct unless the Basmalah is recited since it is part of the entire chapter of al-Fātiḥah. Other scholars say that it is not a verse of al-Fātiḥah, but it is a separate verse from the book of Allah. This latter opinion is the correct one and is proven by other texts as well as the context of the chapter itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the textual proof, Abū Hurayrah ( رضي الله عنه ) narrated a ḥadīth in which the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<p><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/I-have-divided-the-prayer-in-two-parts-between-myself-and-my-servant.png"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="53610" data-permalink="https://abdurrahman.org/2018/12/16/is-the-basmalah-an-actual-verse-of-surah-al-fati%e1%b8%a5ah-or-not/i-have-divided-the-prayer-in-two-parts-between-myself-and-my-servant/" data-orig-file="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/I-have-divided-the-prayer-in-two-parts-between-myself-and-my-servant.png" data-orig-size="761,329" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="I have divided the prayer in two parts between myself and my servant" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/I-have-divided-the-prayer-in-two-parts-between-myself-and-my-servant.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/I-have-divided-the-prayer-in-two-parts-between-myself-and-my-servant.png?w=715" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-53610" src="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/I-have-divided-the-prayer-in-two-parts-between-myself-and-my-servant.png" alt="I have divided the prayer in two parts between myself and my servant" width="550" height="238" srcset="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/I-have-divided-the-prayer-in-two-parts-between-myself-and-my-servant.png?w=550&amp;h=238 550w, https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/I-have-divided-the-prayer-in-two-parts-between-myself-and-my-servant.png?w=100&amp;h=43 100w, https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/I-have-divided-the-prayer-in-two-parts-between-myself-and-my-servant.png?w=300&amp;h=130 300w, https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/I-have-divided-the-prayer-in-two-parts-between-myself-and-my-servant.png 761w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah ( تَعَالَى ) says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“I have divided the prayer in two parts between myself and my servant.” When the servant recites, &#8220;All praise and thanks are to Allah, the lord of all creations&#8221;, Allah says, “My servant has praised me.” And when he recites, &#8220;The Most-Merciful, the Bestower of all mercy&#8221;, Allah says, “My servant has honored me.” When he recites, &#8220;The owner of the Day of Recompense&#8221;, Allah says, “My servant has glorified me.” When he recites, &#8220;You alone we worship and from you alone we seek help&#8221;, Allah replies, “This is two parts between my servant and I.” When he recites, &#8220;Guide us to the straight path…&#8221; until the end of the chapter, Allah replies, “This is for My servant and he will have what he asks for.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Recorded by Muslim (no. 395)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a textual proof that the <em>Basmalah</em> is not an actual verse of Sūrah al-Fātiḥah (because it was not the first statement the servant says as mentioned in this ḥadīth).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is another authentic statement of Anas ibn Mālik ( رضي الله عنه ) in “Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim” in which he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>I prayed behind the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ), Abū Bakr, and ‘Umar and none of them used to mention “In the name of Allah, the Most-Merciful, the Bestower of all mercy” at the beginning of their recitations (of Sūrah al-Fātiḥah) nor at the end of it.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Recorded by Muslim (no. 399)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is meant is that each of them used not to mention it aloud. The fact that there is a distinction between it not being recited aloud as the rest of al-Fātiḥah is recited indicates that it is not actually a part of the chapter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the proof from the context of the other verses’ meanings, Sūrah al-Fātiḥah consists of seven verses as is unanimously agreed upon. If you wanted to measure out seven verses as they pertain to the topics of the chapter, you will find that the middle verse is:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">You alone we worship and from you alone we seek help.</span> [Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, 1:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the same verse about which Allah says, “This is two parts between my servant and I” in the previous ḥadīth. This is because the first verse is:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">All praise and thanks are for Allah, the Lord of all creations</span>. [Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, 1:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second verse is:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيم</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Most Merciful, the Bestower of all mercy.</span> [Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, 1:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third verse:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The owner of the Day of Recompense.</span> [Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, 1:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These three previous verses are all about the rights of Allah (his attribute, actions, etc.).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the verse:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">You alone we worship, and from you alone we seek help.</span>[Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, 1:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the fourth verse and the half-way point and it too is even divided into two parts, one part for Allah (“You alone we worship…”) and one part for the servant (“…from you alone we seek help.”).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following verses are:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">اهْدِنَا الصِّرَاطَ الْمُسْتَقِيمَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Guide us to the straight path.</span> [Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, 1:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is for the servant.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">صِرَاطَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The path of those upon whom You bestowed Your grace.</span> [Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, 1:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is also for the servant.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلا الضَّالِّينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Not of those who earned anger upon themselves, nor of those who are astray.</span> [Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, 1:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And finally, this last verse is also for the servant.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, three verses are for Allah ( عزّ وجلّ ) and they are the first three. And three verses are for the servant and they are the last three. One verse is between both the servant and his lord and it is the fourth and middle verse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the proof from the context of the wordings, if we say that the <em>Basmalah</em> is a verse of Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, then the seventh verse would be very long – as long as two of the other verses (thus making the last and incomparably long verse, “The path of those upon whom you bestowed your grace, not of those who earned anger, nor of those who are astray.”). But it is known that the principle of the verses being similar to each other is also regarding their length.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">So, the correct opinion no doubt is that the <em>Basmalah</em> is not a verse of Sūrah al-Fātiḥah just as it is not a verse (at the beginning) of every other chapter in the Qur&#8217;an.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">This book is a complete translation of a treatise entitled “<strong>Kayfa Yajibu ‘alaynaa an Nufassir al-Qur’aan-al-Kareem</strong>” (How are we Obligated to Interpret the Noble Qur’aan).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The source used for the translation was the Al-Maktabah al-Islaamiyyah first edition published in 1421H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The foundation of this treatise is questions that were posed to the Shaikh, may Allaah have mercy on him, to which he responded in recorded format. These questions and answers were then transcribed, printed on paper and presented to the Shaikh who read them and commented on them in his own handwriting. The publishing house printed and distributed the book after the death of Imaam Al- Albaanee due to the great benefit found in the work since the author discusses several rules and principles related to interpreting the meanings of the Qur’aan, which every Muslim should follow when trying to understand the Book of Allaah.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Reciting the Noble Qur&#8217;aan and Contemplating on it</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is one of the greatest branches of knowledge that can lead to the increase, stability and strengthening of eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has revealed His lucid Book to His servants as a source of guidance; mercy, light and glad tidings and as a remembrance for those who remember.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَهَٰذَا كِتَابٌ أَنزَلْنَاهُ مُبَارَكٌ مُّصَدِّقُ الَّذِي بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;And this is a blessed Book that We have sent down, confirming that which came before it.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam (6):92]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">وَهَٰذَا كِتَابٌ أَنزَلْنَاهُ مُبَارَكٌ فَاتَّبِعُوهُ وَاتَّقُوا لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;And this is a blessed Book that We have sent down, so follow it and fear </b>(Allaah)<b>, that you may receive mercy.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam (6):155]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَلَقَدْ جِئْنَاهُم بِكِتَابٍ فَصَّلْنَاهُ عَلَىٰ عِلْمٍ هُدًى وَرَحْمَةً لِّقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Certainly, we have brought to them a Book, which we have explained in detail, upon knowledge, as a guidance and a mercy to a people who believe.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah al-A&#8217;raaf (7):52]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَنَزَّلْنَا عَلَيْكَ الْكِتَابَ تِبْيَانًا لِّكُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةً وَبُشْرَىٰ لِلْمُسْلِمِينَ&#8230;</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;And We have sent down to you the Book, as a clarification of everything, a guidance, a mercy and as glad tidings for the Muslims&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah an-Nahl (16):89]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>كِتَابٌ أَنزَلْنَاهُ إِلَيْكَ مُبَارَكٌ لِّيَدَّبَّرُوا آيَاتِهِ وَلِيَتَذَكَّرَ أُولُو الْأَلْبَابِ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;<em>(This is a)</em> Book that We have sent down to you, full of blessings, so that they may ponder over its <em>aayaat</em>, and that those of understanding may remember.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah Saad (38):29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِنَّ هَٰذَا الْقُرْآنَ يَهْدِي لِلَّتِي هِيَ أَقْوَمُ وَيُبَشِّرُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ الَّذِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ الصَّالِحَاتِ أَنَّ لَهُمْ أَجْرًا كَبِيرًا</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Verily, this Qur&#8217;aan guides to that which is most just and right, and gives glad tidings to the believers who work righteous deeds, that they shall have a great reward.&#8221;</b> </span>[Soorah al-Israa (17):9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">وَنُنَزِّلُ مِنَ الْقُرْآنِ مَا هُوَ شِفَاءٌ وَرَحْمَةٌ لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ ۙ وَلَا يَزِيدُ الظَّالِمِينَ إِلَّا خَسَارًا</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;And We send down of the Qur&#8217;aan that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe, and it increases the oppressors in nothing but loss.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah al-Israa (17):82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَذِكْرَىٰ لِمَن كَانَ لَهُ قَلْبٌ أَوْ أَلْقَى السَّمْعَ وَهُوَ شَهِيدٌ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Verily, therein is indeed a reminder for him who has a heart or gives ear while he is heedful.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah Qaaf (50):37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These noble aayaat contain mention of the excellence of the Noble Qur&#8217;aan, the Book of the Lord of the Worlds. The fact that Allaah made it blessed and a guidance for the worlds. He placed within it a cure for illnesses, especially, the illnesses and diseases of misconceptions and desires of the heart. He made it a source of glad tidings and mercy for the worlds and as a form of remembrance for those who remember. He made it a guide towards that which is most just and upright, and He mentioned aayaat and threats by which they may fear or would cause them to remember and reflect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, one who reads the Qur&#8217;aan, and ponders and reflects over its aayaat finds within it such knowledge and learning, which strengthen, increase and develop his eemaan. This is because he will come across within the discourse of the Qur&#8217;aan, a King, who possesses all dominion, for whom alone, is all praise. The reigns of all affairs are in His hand alone, they emanate from Him and return to Him. He has ascended above His throne and not a single secret in the regions of His dominion escapes Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is aware of what is in the souls of His slaves, fully cognizant of their hidden and public deeds. Solely, He disposes of the affairs of the Kingdom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He hears and sees, gives and withholds, rewards and punishes, and honors and abases. He creates and sustains, and gives life and causes death. He decrees, executes and disposes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He invites His servants and directs them towards what constitutes their happiness and success. He entices them towards this, and warns them of what will cause their ruin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He introduces Himself to them by His names and attributes. He woos them with His favors and blessings and reminds them of His favors upon them. He commands them with what entitles them to the completion of such favors and blessings and warns them of His vengeance. He reminds them of the honor He has prepared for them if they obey Him, and of the punishment He has prepared for them if they disobey Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He informs them of how He handles His awliyaa&#8217; and His enemies, and of the outcome of both. He praises His awliyaa&#8217; for their righteous actions and fine qualities. He censures His enemies for their bad deeds and distasteful characteristics.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He puts forward parables and provides numerous types of proofs and truths. He replies to the misconceptions of His enemies with the finest of answers. He gives credit to the truthful and denies the liar. He speaks the truth and guides towards the path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He invites to the abode of peace and safety (i.e., Paradise). He mentions its description, its beauty and its bliss. He warns against the abode of destruction (i.e., the Hellfire re). He mentions its torment, its ugliness and its pains.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He reminds His slaves of their necessity towards Him, their dire need of Him, and that they can never be independent of Him ever for the blink of an eyelid. He informs them that He can dispense of them and of all creation, and that He Himself is the Rich and is not dependent on anything, whereas, everything besides Him is inherently in need of Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He makes known to them, that no one attains an atom&#8217;s worth or more of good except by His Favor and Mercy, and that no one attains an atom&#8217;s worth or more of bad except by His justice and wisdom. One witnesses from His speech, His reproach of His beloved in the most gracious of ways and despite that, He dismisses their mistakes and forgives their slips. He accredits their excuses, rectifies their corruption, defends and protects them. He is their victor, their guardian over their welfare and the one who delivers them from all difficulties. He is the One who will keep His promise to them, He is their only patron and protector. He is their true patron and protector and their victor over their enemies. How fire a patron and victor He is!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, the servant never ceases to benefit from reflecting on the Book of Allaah. His heart bears witness to such types of knowledge that increase his eemaan and strengthen it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can this not be so? When he finds within the Qur&#8217;aan, a King who is glorious, merciful, generous and beautiful; this is His standing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how can he not love Him, compete to attain a nearness to Him or use up his energy in trying to show love for Him?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can He not be more beloved to him than anything else? How can he not prefer His pleasure to anyone else&#8217;s pleasure?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can he not be attached to His remembrance? How can his love for Him, his desire to meet Him and feeling close to Him not be his nourishment, strength and medicine, in that if he were to be bereft of this, he would become corrupt and ruined and would not benefit from his life? [Refer to al-Fawaa&#8217;id of Ibn al-Qayyim, pages 58-60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Aajurree, may Allaah have mercy upon him, said: &#8220;Whoever contemplates His words, will know the Lord and he will know of His great power and capability, His immense favor upon the believers, and of the obligation upon himself to worship Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, the person imposes this duty upon himself thereby being on his guard against that which his Generous Patron and Protector has warned of and coveting that which He has made desirous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever is of this description when reciting the Qur&#8217;aan or when listening to it when recited by another, the Qur&#8217;aan will be a cure for him. He becomes rich without money, he attains power and strength without kinsfolk and finds intimacy in that which others feel alienation towards.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His desire when opening a Soorah for recitation will be, ‘when will I accede to the admonition contained within what I recite?&#8217; and his desire will not be, ‘when will I complete this Soorah?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His aspiration is none other than, &#8216;When will I understand what Allaah is addressing me with? When will I restrain (from committing sins)? When will I take heed?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because reciting the Qur&#8217;aan is worship and it is not to be done so in a state of heedlessness, and Allaah is the one who grants the tawfeeq towards that?&#8221; [Akhlaaq Hamlah al-Qur&#8217;aan, by al-Aajurree, page 10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For this reason, Allaah, the Generous, orders His servants and encourages them to ponder over the Qur&#8217;aan, Allaah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>أَفَلَا يَتَدَبَّرُونَ الْقُرْآنَ ۚ وَلَوْ كَانَ مِنْ عِندِ غَيْرِ اللَّهِ لَوَجَدُوا فِيهِ اخْتِلَافًا كَثِيرًا</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Do they not then contemplate on the Qur&#8217;aan? Had it been from other than Allaah, they would surely have found therein much contradiction.&#8221;</b> </span>[Soorah an-Nisaa&#8217; (4):82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>أَفَلَا يَتَدَبَّرُونَ الْقُرْآنَ أَمْ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبٍ أَقْفَالُهَا</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Do they not then contemplate on the Qur&#8217;aan, or are there locks upon their hearts?&#8221;</b> </span>[Soorah Muhammad (47):24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah proclaims that He only revealed the Qur&#8217;aan so that its <em>aayaat</em> would be pondered over, He says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>كِتَابٌ أَنزَلْنَاهُ إِلَيْكَ مُبَارَكٌ لِّيَدَّبَّرُوا آيَاتِهِ وَلِيَتَذَكَّرَ أُولُو الْأَلْبَابِ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;(This is a) Book that We have sent down to you, full of blessings, so that they may ponder over its aayaat, and that those of understanding may remember.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah Saad (38):29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also explains that the reason behind the lack of guidance for the one who deviates from the straight path is his disregard for reflecting on the Qur&#8217;aan and being too proud to listen to it, He says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>قَدْ كَانَتْ آيَاتِي تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ فَكُنتُمْ عَلَىٰ أَعْقَابِكُمْ تَنكِصُونَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>مُسْتَكْبِرِينَ بِهِ سَامِرًا تَهْجُرُونَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>أَفَلَمْ يَدَّبَّرُوا الْقَوْلَ أَمْ جَاءَهُم مَّا لَمْ يَأْتِ آبَاءَهُمُ الْأَوَّلِينَ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Indeed, My aayaat used to be recited to you, but you used to turn back on your heels. With haughtiness, you talked evil about it (i.e., the Qur&#8217;aan) throughout the night. Have they not then pondered over the Word (i.e., the Qur&#8217;aan) or has there come to them what had not come to their fathers of old?&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah al-Mu&#8217;minoon (23):66-68]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He mentions of the Qur&#8217;aan that it increases the believers in eemaan if they read it and contemplate on its aayaat, Allaah says:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّمَا الْمُؤْمِنُونَ الَّذِينَ إِذَا ذُكِرَ اللَّهُ وَجِلَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَإِذَا تُلِيَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ آيَاتُهُ زَادَتْهُمْ إِيمَانًا وَعَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;The believers are none other than those whose hearts feel fear when Allaah is mentioned. When His aayaat are recited to them, they (i.e., the aayaat) increase them in their eemaan and upon their Lord (alone), they rely.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah al-Anfaal (8):2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah relates about the righteous amongst the Ahl al-Kitaab, that when the Qur&#8217;aan is recited to them they fall upon their faces in humble prostration and in a state of weeping, and that it increases them in humility, eemaan and submission. Allaah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>قُلْ آمِنُوا بِهِ أَوْ لَا تُؤْمِنُوا ۚ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْعِلْمَ مِن قَبْلِهِ إِذَا يُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ يَخِرُّونَ لِلْأَذْقَانِ سُجَّدًا </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَيَقُولُونَ سُبْحَانَ رَبِّنَا إِن كَانَ وَعْدُ رَبِّنَا لَمَفْعُولًا </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَيَخِرُّونَ لِلْأَذْقَانِ يَبْكُونَ وَيَزِيدُهُمْ خُشُوعًا</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Say, &#8216;Believe in it (i.e., the Qur&#8217;aan) or do not believe (in it). Verily, those who were given knowledge before it, when it is recited to them, they fall upon their faces in humble prostration, and they say:&#8221; How perfect is our Lord! Truly, the promise of our Lord will be fulfilled:&#8217; They fall upon their faces weeping and it adds to their humility.&#8221; </b></span>[Soorah al-Israa&#8217; (17): 107- 109]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also informs that if He were to send down the Glorious Qur&#8217;aan upon a mountain, it would humble itself and rupture because of the fear of Allaah. He made this as a parable for the people to demonstrate to them the greatness of the Qur&#8217;aan. He says:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">لَوْ أَنزَلْنَا هَٰذَا الْقُرْآنَ عَلَىٰ جَبَلٍ لَّرَأَيْتَهُ خَاشِعًا مُّتَصَدِّعًا مِّنْ خَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ ۚ وَتِلْكَ الْأَمْثَالُ نَضْرِبُهَا لِلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Had We sent down this Qur&#8217;aan on a mountain, you would surely have seen it humbling itself and rending asunder out of fear of Allaah. Such are the parables that We put forward to mankind that they may reflect.&#8221;</b></span>[Soorah al-Hashr (59):21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He described the Qur&#8217;aan as being the best of speech, parts of it resembling other parts and He repeated some of it so that it would be understood. He mentioned that the skins of the righteous shiver in fear and hope when they hear the Qur&#8217;aan. He says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>اللَّهُ نَزَّلَ أَحْسَنَ الْحَدِيثِ كِتَابًا مُّتَشَابِهًا مَّثَانِيَ تَقْشَعِرُّ مِنْهُ جُلُودُ الَّذِينَ يَخْشَوْنَ رَبَّهُمْ ثُمَّ تَلِينُ جُلُودُهُمْ وَقُلُوبُهُمْ إِلَىٰ ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ هُدَى اللَّهِ يَهْدِي بِهِ مَن يَشَاءُ ۚ وَمَن يُضْلِلِ اللَّهُ فَمَا لَهُ مِنْ هَادٍ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Allaah has sent down the best speech, a Book, its parts resembling each other in goodness and truth, oft repeated. The skins of those who fear their Lord shiver from it. Thereafter, their skin and hearts soften to the remembrance of Allaah. That is the guidance of Allaah. He guides with it whom He pleases and whomever Allaah sends astray, has no guide whatsoever.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah az-Zumar (39):23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah censures the believers for their lack of humility when listening to the Qur&#8217;aan and He cautions them to not resemble the disbelievers in this regard. He says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>أَلَمْ يَأْنِ لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَن تَخْشَعَ قُلُوبُهُمْ لِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ وَمَا نَزَلَ مِنَ الْحَقِّ وَلَا يَكُونُوا كَالَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ مِن قَبْلُ فَطَالَ عَلَيْهِمُ الْأَمَدُ فَقَسَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ ۖ وَكَثِيرٌ مِّنْهُمْ فَاسِقُونَ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">Has not the time come for the hearts of those who believe to be affected by Allaah&#8217;s reminder </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(i.e., the Qur&#8217;aan) </span><b><span style="color:#008000;">and of the truth that has been revealed, and not to be like those who had been given the Book before, whereby the term was lengthened for them and their hearts became hard and many of them are rebellious.</span>&#8220;</b> [Soorah al-Hadeed (57): 16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These aforementioned aayaat contain the clearest indication of the importance of the Qur&#8217;aan, the required attention that has to be paid to it, its powerful effect upon the hearts, and that it is the greatest matter that increases eemaan, especially, if the recitation is performed upon contemplation, reflection and on trying to understand its meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy upon him, says: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;In short, there is nothing more beneficial for the heart than reading the Qur&#8217;aan with contemplation and reflection. The Qur&#8217;aan encompasses all the levels of the travelers, the conditions of the workers, and stations of those possessing knowledge. It is the Qur&#8217;aan that generates love, desire, fear, hope, repentance, reliance, pleasure, entrustment, gratitude, patience and the rest of the different states that are life to the heart and perfection of it. Likewise, it repels all the rebuked characteristics and actions that cause the corruption and ruin of the heart.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If people were to possess a realization of what recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan with contemplation contains, they would devote themselves to it at the expense of anything else. When the person reads it with reflection and he comes across an aayah that he is in need of, for the cure of his heart, he repeats it, even if he does so a hundred times or the whole night. Hence, to recite a single aayah of the Qur&#8217;aan with contemplation and reflection is better than reciting the Qur&#8217;aan to completion without any contemplation or reflection. It is also more beneficial for the heart and more conducive to attaining eemaan and tasting the sweetness of the Qur&#8217;aan &#8230;</strong></span>&#8221; [Miftaah Daar as-Sa&#8217;aaadah, page 204]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad Rasheed Ridaa states: &#8220;Know that strength of religion and culmination of eemaan and certainty does not come about except by reading the Qur&#8217;aan very often and listening to it upon contemplation with the intention of being guided by it and to act on its commands and prohibitions. The correct and submissive eemaan increases, strengthens, develops and its effects such as righteous actions and abandonment of disobedience and corruption, all arise in pro-portion to the contemplation of the Qur&#8217;aan. It also decreases and weakens in proportion to not contemplating on the Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most of the Arabs only believed when they heard the Qur&#8217;aan and understood it. They did not conquer the lands, inhabit cities, nor did their population grow and their power become greater except because of the Qur&#8217;aan&#8217;s effective guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the nobles of Makkah who opposed and stood in enmity, strove against the Prophet and tried to prevent him from conveying the message of his Lord by stopping him from reciting the Qur&#8217;aan to the people:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا لَا تَسْمَعُوا لِهَٰذَا الْقُرْآنِ وَالْغَوْا فِيهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَغْلِبُونَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">And those who disbelieve say, &#8216;Do not listen to this Qur&#8217;aan and make noise in the midst of it (being recited) so that you may overcome …</span>&#8216;&#8221;</b> [Soorah Fussilat (41):26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The weakness of Islaam since the Middle ages up to the point where most of its empire disappeared is only so because of the abandonment of the contemplation of the Qur&#8217;aan, of reciting it and acting by it.&#8221; [Mukhtasar Tafseer al-Manaar, 3/170]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, the Noble Qur&#8217;aan is one of the greatest fortifiers of eemaan and the most beneficial reasons behind its increase.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It increases the eemaan of the slave in many diverse ways. Ibn as-Sa&#8217;dee says: &#8220;It increases it in many ways. Indeed, as for the believer, by simply reciting the aayaat of Allaah and becoming acquainted with the truthful information and fine rulings present within it, he attains an abundant goodness from the affairs of eemaan. How will it then be if he contemplates on it proficiently and understands its aims and secrets?&#8221; [At-Tawdeeh wa al-Bayaan li Shajarah al-Eemaan, Page 27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, one must know that the increase of eemaan that arises from the recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan does not happen unless one concentrates on understanding the Qur&#8217;aan, applying it and acting by it. The case is not that he simply reads it without understanding or contemplation, as many people who read the Qur&#8217;aan will find it to be their adversary and opponent on the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been affirmed on the Prophet &#8211; sallallahu alaihe wa-sallam &#8211; that he said: <i>&#8220;Verily, Allaah raises up a people with this Book and He abases others.&#8221;</i> [Related by Muslim, 1/559] It has also been affirmed that he (- sallallahu alaihe wa-sallam -) said: <i>&#8220;&#8230; and the Qur’aan is either a proof for you or against you.&#8221; </i>[Related by Muslim, 1/203]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is a proof for you and it increases your eemaan if you act by it or it is a proof against you and it decreases your eemaan if you neglect it and do not observe its boundaries.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qatadah stated: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Not a single person sits down with this Qur&#8217;aan except that he then rises with either some increase or decrease.&#8221;</strong></span> [Related by Ibn al-Mubaarak in az-Zuhd, page 272, al-Aajurree in Akhlaaq Hamlah al-Qur&#8217;aan, page 73, al-Marwazee in Qiyaam al-Layl, Page 77 of the concise version. Al-Baghawee mentioned it in his Tafseer, 3/133]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan al-Basree says in clarifying the meaning of contemplating the Qur&#8217;aan: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;&#8230; However, by Allaah, it is not by memorizing its letters and neglecting its boundaries. To the extent that one of them says, ‘I recited the whole Qur&#8217;aan and did not miss out a single letter!’ and by Allaah, he missed out the whole of the Qur&#8217;aan: no Qur&#8217;aan is seen in his character or deeds! To the point that one of them says, ‘Verily I can recite a Soorah with a single breath!’ By Allaah, these are not recites or scholars, they are not wise or pious. Whenever the recites are of this type, may Allaah not increase their like amongst the people!&#8221;</strong></span> [Related by &#8216;Abdur Razzaaq in his Musannaf 3/363, Ibn al-Mubaarak in az-Zuhd, page 274, al-Aajurree in Akhlaaq Hamlah al-Qur&#8217;aan, page 41, and al-Marwazee in Qiyaam al-Layl, Page 76 of the concise version]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah have mercy upon al-Hasan. I wonder as to what he would say if he witnessed the recites of our present time? Recites, who have been infatuated with being melodious, with correctly pronouncing the letters and flowering them, whilst they squander and neglect the limits.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In fact, the ears of the people when listening to the Qur&#8217;aan, also turn to the pronunciation of the words and the melody whilst neglecting to hearken or to contemplate on the word of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In any case, there is no objection whatsoever to the tajweed of the Qur&#8217;aan, to recite it slowly and melodiously, and to render it in a fine way. The objection however, is in over burdening oneself and being obstinate in pronouncing the letters without paying any regard or attention to establishing the commands that were the reason for the revelation of the Qur&#8217;aan. To the extent that you do not see in many of them the fear brought about by the limits of Allaah, indeed, nor do you see within them application of the Qur&#8217;aan in character or deed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You find a reciter amongst them, who has memorized the Qur&#8217;aan and who correctly pronounces the letters, shaving his beard or lengthening his lower garment. In fact, he may neglect performing prayer in its totality or in congregation, and other such sinful acts, to the extent that one of them &#8211; and Allaah&#8217;s help is sought &#8211; opened a music party for an immoral woman with aayaat of the Noble Qur&#8217;aan. He recited as an introduction to her singing, aayaat from the Noble Qur&#8217;aan!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The speech of our Lord is too great to be dishonored by the likes of such. It suffices me to repeat what al-Hasan, may Allaah have mercy upon him, said, &#8216;Whenever the reciters are of this type, may Allaah not increase their like amongst the people!&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-&#8216;Arabee mentioned, when describing the reciters of his time being preoccupied with reciting the words of the Qur&#8217;aan accurately while neglecting its rulings, and taking it up as a profession when the Qur&#8217;aan was only revealed to be acted by: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;&#8230; but when this recitation became a profession, they beautified it and vied with it, spent their life &#8211; without any need for them &#8211; on it. One of them dies and he was able to raise the Qur&#8217;aan in speech as a pot is raised but he broke its meanings as a vessel is broken. Thus, he was not consistent with any of its meanings.&#8221;</span></strong> [Al-&#8216;Awaasim min al-Qawaasim 2/486,within the book Aaraa&#8217; Abee Bakr Ibn al-&#8216;Arabee al-Kalaamiyyah by &#8216;Ammaar at-Taalibee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, the Muslim must learn how to derive benefit from the Qur&#8217;aan before he begins to recite it in order for its benefit to be achieved. Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy on him, mentioned in this respect a principle that is of great standing and enormous benefit. It is, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;if you want to attain benefit from the Qur&#8217;aan, bring your heart together upon reciting or listening to it, and divert your hearing to it, and be present in front of it, in the manner of one who is present and spoken to by the One who spoke it, How perfect He is&#8221; </strong></span>[Al-Fawaa&#8217;id, page 5. Also, refer to al-Fataawa of Ibn Taymiyyah, I 6/48-51 and 7/236-237]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever applies this principle and traverses upon this methodology when reciting the Qur&#8217;aan or when listening to it, will succeed with both knowledge and action. His eemaan will increase and it will establish itself like towering mountains, and Allaah is the One who is asked to give us the tawfeeq towards that and every good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, contemplation and reflection over the aayaat of Allaah are of two types: &#8220;Contemplation over it to arrive at the intended meaning of the Lord and contemplation over the meanings of what Allaah called His servants to reflect on. The first is contemplation over the Qur&#8217;aanic evidence and the second is contemplation over the witnessed evidence. The first is contemplation over His aayaat that are heard (i.e., the Qur&#8217;aan) and the second is contemplation over His aayaat that are witnessed (i.e., the universe and what it contains).&#8221; [Miftaah Daar as-Sa&#8217;aadah, page 204] This was stated by lbn al-Qayyim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The discussion mentioned here centers on the contemplation of Allaah&#8217;s aayaat that are heard. As for reflection on His aayaat that are  seen and witnessed, discussion on this will follow shortly by the will of Allaah.</p>

ABOO MUHAMMAD IBN HAZM &#8211;<em>rahimahullaah</em>&#8211; said in  ‘<em>al-Muhallaa</em>’ (1/77-80)<br />
[Translated by Aboo Talhah Dawud ibn Ronald Burbank <em>rahimahullaah</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“ISSUE (no. 116): <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And reciting the Qur&#8217;aan, and prostration during it, and touching the <em>Mus-haf</em>, and (words of) remembrance of Allaah-the Most High-are all permissible, whether upon <em>wudoo</em>· or without <em>wudoo</em>·, and for the ‘<em>junub</em>’ and for the menstruating woman</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof of that is that recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan, and prostration during it, and touching the <em>Mus-haf</em>, and the remembrance of Allaah-the Most High- are actions of good, and are recommended, and their doer is rewarded. So whoever claims that they are prohibited in some states, then he is required to bring proof.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">As for the recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan,</span></strong> then the present opponents agree with us about this matter with regard to the person who is not in a state of <em>wudoo</em>·, however they disagree regarding the <em>junub</em> and the menstruating woman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a group said: The menstruating woman and the <em>junub</em> may not recite anything from the Qur&#8217;aan; and it is a saying related from `Umar ibn al-Khattaab, `Alee ibn Abee Taalib-<em>radiyallaahu `anhumaa</em>-and from others besides them, such as: al-Hasan al-Basree, Qataadah, an-Nakha`ee, and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And a group said: As for the menstruating woman, then she may recite whatever she wishes from the Qur&#8217;aan; but as for the <em>junub</em>, then he may recite two <em>Aayahs</em> or the like; and it was the saying of Maalik; and some of them said: He should not read a complete <em>Aayah</em>; and it was the saying of Aboo Haneefah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So as for those who prevent the <em>junub</em> from recitation anything from the Qur&#8217;aan, then they use as evidence that which `Abdullaah ibn Salamah narrated from `Alee ibn Abee Taalib &#8211;<em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em>&#8211; “That nothing would prevent Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) from the Qur&#8217;aan, except from <em>janaabah</em>.” [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is no proof for them in this, since it does not contain a prohibition of the junub reciting the Qur&#8217;aan; rather it is just an action from him-<em>`alaihis-Salaam</em>&#8211; which does not make it something binding. Nor did he &#8211; `<em>alaihis-Salaam</em>-explain that he only withheld from reciting the Qur&#8217;aan on account of <em>janaabah</em>. So it may have been the case that he just happened to have left off reciting in that state, but not because of <em>Janaabah</em>. So he &#8211;<em>`alaihis-Salaam</em>-never fasted a whole month besides Ramaadaan; nor did he increase in its standing in Prayer upon thirteen rak`ahs; nor did he ever dine upon a small table; nor did he eat whilst reclining. So is it, therefore, forbidden to fast a whole month besides Ramaadaan, or that a person prays <em>tahajjud</em> with more than thirteen rak`ahs, or that he dines upon a small table, or that he eats whilst reclining? They do not say this, and there is much like this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also narrations occur prohibiting the <em>junub</em> and one who is not upon purification from reciting anything from the Qur&#8217;aan, but <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>nothing from them is authentic</strong></span>; and we have explained the weaknesses of their chains of narrations elsewhere; and if they had been authentic, then they would have been a proof against those who permit him to recite a complete <em>Aayah</em>, or part of an Aa<em>y</em>ah, since they all totally prohibit recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan for the <em>junub</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who say that the junub may recite an <em>Aayah</em> or so, or who say that he should not recite a whole <em>Aayah</em>; or who permit the menstruating woman and forbid the junub, then these are futile sayings because they are claims not supported by a proof: neither from the Qur&#8217;aan, nor from the Sunnah-neither from what is authentic nor from what is weak, nor from Consensus, nor by the saying of a Companion, nor by analogy, nor by sound opinion. So part of an <em>Aayah</em>, and one <em>Aayah</em> are Qur&#8217;aan, without a doubt, and there is no difference between permitting him to recite one <em>Aayah</em> and (permitting) another; not between preventing one <em>Aayah</em> and preventing another. And those who hold these sayings hold it to be reprehensible to oppose a Companion who is not known to have anyone who disagreed with him; yet they have opposed in this matter `Umar ibn al-Khattaab, `Alee ibn Abee Taalib, and Salmaan al- Faarisee -and no one from the Companions is known to have disagreed with them <em>radiyallaahu `anhum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also there are some <em>Aayahs</em> that comprise a single word, such as:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">وَالضُّحَىٰ</span></strong> &#8211; 93:1 [[Sooratud-Duhaa (93):1]], and:<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>مُدْهَامَّتَانِ</strong> </span>&#8211; 55:64 [[Sooratur-Rahmaan (55): 64]], and:<br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">وَالْعَصْرِ</span> </strong>&#8211; 103:1 [[Sooratul-`Asr (103):1]], and:<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>وَالْفَجْرِ</strong> </span>&#8211; 89:1 [[Sooratul-Fajr (89): 1]];</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and there are some that comprise many Words, such as the <em>Aayah</em> concerning a debt [[<em>Aayah</em> 282 of <em>Sooratul-Baqarah</em>]]. So when there is no doubt concerning this, then their permitting him to recite the <em>Aayah</em> of debt, and that which follows it, and <em>Aayatul-Kursee</em>, or part of it and not completing it, and their preventing him from reciting:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#008000;">وَالْفَجْرِ  وَلَيَالٍ عَشْرٍ وَالشَّفْعِ وَالْوَتْرِ </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Sooratul-Fajr (89):1-3]]; or their preventing him from completing:[[Sooratur-Rahmaan (55): 64]], is astonishing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise their making a distinction between the menstruating woman and the junub, based upon the fact that the affair of the menstruating woman is prolonged, then this is absurd; since if her reciting the Qur&#8217;aan is forbidden, then the length of her period will not make it lawful for her; and if that is lawful for her, then using as evidence the fact that her period is prolonged has no meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Muhammad ibn Sa`eed ibn Nabaat narrated to us: `Abdullaah ibn Nasr narrated to us: from Qaasim ibn Asbigh: from Muhammad ibn Waddaah: from Moosaa ibn Mu`aawiyah: Ibn Wahb narrated to us: from Yoonus ibn Yazeed: from Rabee`ah, who said: “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There is no harm in the junub reciting the Qur&#8217;aan</strong></span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-And with it to Moosaa ibn Mu`aawiyah: Yoosuf ibn Khaalid as-Samtee narrated to us: Idrees narrated to us: from Hammaad, who said: “I asked Sa`eed ibn al-Musayyib about the junub: should he recite the Qur&#8217;aan? So he said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>How should he not recite it, when it is retained inside him?</strong></span>!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-And with it, to Yoosuf as-Samtee: from Nasr al-Baahilee, who said: “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ibn `Abbaas used to recite al-Baqarah whilst he was junub</strong></span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Muhammad ibn Sa`eed ibn Nabaatah related to me: Ahmad ibn `Awnillaah narrated to us: Qaasim ibn Asbigh narrated to us: Muhammad ibn `Abdis-Salaam al- Khushanee narrated to us: Muhammad ibn Bashshaar narrated to us: Ghundar narrated to us: Shu`bah narrated to us: from Hammaad ibn Abee Sulaymaan, who said: <strong>“<span style="color:#000000;">I asked Sa`eed ibn Jubayr about the junub reciting, so he did not see any harm in it, and he said: Is the Qur&#8217;aan not within him?!</span>”</strong> And it is the saying of Daawood, and all of our Companions [2].</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">As for the prostration whilst reciting the Qur&#8217;aan</span></strong>, then it is not Prayer at all, because of what `Abdullaah ibn Rabee` narrated to us: Muhammad ibn Mu`aawiyah narrated to us: Ahmad ibn Shu`ayb narrated to us: Muhammad ibn Bashshaar narrated to us: `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Mahdee narrated to us, and Muhammad ibn Ja`far, both saying: Shu`bah narrated to us: from Ya`laa ibn `Ataa, that he heard `Alee al-Azdee-and he is `Alee ibn `Abdillaah al-Baariqee: reliable-that he heard Ibn `Umar say: from Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) that he said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Prayer of the night and the day is in pairs</strong> &gt;&gt; [3]; and it is authentic from him- <em>`alaihis-Salaam</em>-that he said: &lt;&lt; <strong>The Witr is a single rak`ah at the end of the night</strong>. &gt;&gt; [4] So it is correct that whatever is not a complete rak`ah or two rak`ah’s, or more, then it is not Prayer; and prostration whilst reciting the Qur&#8217;aan is not a rak`ah, nor two rak`ahs so it is not Prayer; and because it is not Prayer it is permissible without <em>wudoo</em>·, and for the <em>junub</em>, and for the menstruating woman, and towards other than the <em>qiblah</em>, just like the rest of the dhikr; and there is not difference since <em>wudoo</em>· is not binding except for the Prayer alone, as nothing occurs in the Qur&#8217;aan, the Sunnah, Consensus, or Analogy to make it obligatory for other than the Prayer. So if it is said that the prostration is a part of the Prayer, and a part of the Prayer is Prayer, then we say, and success is granted by Allaah, this is futile, because a part of the Prayer will not be Prayer unless it is completed in the manner in which the praying person has been commanded to perform it. So if a person were to say a <em>takbeer</em>, and then perform <em>rukoo</em>`, and then deliberately break off, then no one from the people of Islaam would say that he had prayed anything; rather they would all say that he had not prayed; but if he were to complete it as a <em>rak`ah</em> of the <em>witr</em>, or two <em>rak`ah’s</em> for the <em>Jumu`ah</em>, or the Dawn Prayer, or travelling, or optional Prayer, then he would have prayed without any disagreement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then we say to them: The standing is a part of the prayer, and the <em>takbeer</em> is a part of the Prayer, and the recitation of the Foundation of the Book is a part of the Prayer, and the Sitting is a part of the Prayer, and the Salutation is a part of the Prayer, so upon this basis it is essential that you do not permit anyone to stand, or to say <em>takbeer</em>, or to recite the Foundation of the Book, or to sit, or to give the Salutation except upon <em>wudoo</em>·. So this is something which they do not say, so their argument is nullified, and Allaah-the Most High-grants success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if they say: This is by Consensus [5], then,we say to them: Then you have assented to the correctness of a consensus which shows the futility of your argument, and the unsoundness of your reasoning, and Allaah-the Most High-grants success.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">As for touching the mus-haf</span></strong>, then the narrations used as evidence by those who do not permit the junub to touch it, then nothing from them is authentic, because they are either ‘<em>mursal</em>’, a manuscript which does not have a fully connected chain [6], something from an unknown person, or something from a weak narrator; and we have examined them in detail elsewhere.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for what is authentic, then it is just what `Abdullaah ibn Rabee` narrated to us, saying: Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Mufarraj narrated to us: Sa`eed ibn as-Sakan related to us: al-Firabree narrated to us: al-Bukhaaree narrated to us: al-Hakam ibn Naafi` narrated to us: Shu`ayb narrated to us: from az-Zuhree: `Ubaydullaah ibn `Abdillaah ibn `Utbah related to me: that Ibn `Abbaas informed him: that Aboo Sufyaan informed him that he was with Hiraql, and Hiraql called for the letter of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) with which he had sent Dihyah to the ruler of Busraa, so he gave it to Hiraql, and he read it, and it contained:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“In the name of Allaah, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy. From Muhammad, the slave of Allaah and His Messenger to Hiraql the ruler of the Byzantines. Peace be upon whoever follows the guidance. To proceed. Then I call you with the call of Islaam: accept Islaam and you shall be safe, and if you turn away then the sin of the common folk will be upon you; and:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ يَا أَهْلَ الْكِتَابِ تَعَالَوْا إِلَىٰ كَلِمَةٍ سَوَاءٍ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكُمْ أَلَّا نَعْبُدَ إِلَّا اللَّهَ وَلَا نُشْرِكَ بِهِ شَيْئًا وَلَا يَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُنَا بَعْضًا أَرْبَابًا مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ ۚ فَإِن تَوَلَّوْا فَقُولُوا اشْهَدُوا بِأَنَّا مُسْلِمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Soorah Aal-`Imraan (3): 64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;">O people of the Scripture! Come to a true and just word to which we should all adhere: that we single out Allaah with all worship, and we do not associate anything along with Him; and that none of us should take others as lords besides Allaah. So if they turn away, then say: Bear witness that we are Muslims, submitting to our Lord</span>.]].[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So here Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) sent this letter, containing an Aayah, to Christians, and he knew that they would certainly touch that letter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if they mentioned what `Abdullah ibn Rabee` narrated to us: Muhammad ibn Mu`aawiyah narrated to us: Ahmad ibn Shu`ayb narrated to us: Qutaybah ibn Sa`eed narrated to us: al-Layth narrated to us: from Naafi`: from Ibn `Umar who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) forbade travelling to the land of the enemies with the Qur&#8217;aan, for fear that the enemy would gain possession of it</strong>.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then this is true; it is binding to follow it; and it does not contain anything about the junub or the Disbeliever not touching the mus-haf, rather all that it contains is that the people of the land of war should not gain possession of the Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if they say: Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) only sent a single Aayah to Hiraql (Heraclius), then it is said to them: Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) did not prevent anything in addition to it; and you are people of analogy, and if you will not draw analogy between one <em>Aayah</em> and that which is more than it, then do not make analogy between this [particular] <em>Aayah</em> and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if they mention the Saying of Allaah -the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فِي كِتَابٍ مَّكْنُونٍ   لَّا يَمَسُّهُ إِلَّا الْمُطَهَّرُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;">In a well-guarded Book, which none touch but the purified ones</span>]] [Sooratul-Waaqi`ah (56):78-79]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">then there is no proof for them in it, since it does not contain a command; rather it is just a statement of fact, and Allaah-the Most High-does not speak except truth; and it is not permissible to divert the wording of a statement to the meaning of a command, except by the presence of a clear text or a certain Consensus. So when we see that the <em>mus-haf</em> is touched by those who are pure and those who are not pure, then we know that He-the Mighty and Majestic- <strong>did not mean the <em>mus-haf</em>, but rather He meant another Book,</strong> just as Muhammad ibn Sa`eed ibn Nabaatah related to us: Ahmad ibn `Abdil-Baseer narrated to us: Qaasim ibn Asbigh narrated to us: Muhammad ibn `Abdis-Salaam al-Khushanee narrated to us: Muhammad ibn al-Muthannaa narrated to us `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Mahdee narrated to us: Sufyaan ath-Thawree narrated to us: from Jaami` ibn Abee Raashid: from Sa`eed Ibn Jubayr, regarding the Saying of Allaah-the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَّا يَمَسُّهُ إِلَّا الْمُطَهَّرُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Sooratul-Waaqi`ah (56):79]<br />
[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;">None touch it except the purified</span>]], he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>The Angels who are in the Heavens</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Himmaam ibn Ahmad narrated to us: Ibn Mufarraj narrated to us: Ibnul-A`raabee to us: ad-Dabaree narrated to us: `Abdur-Razzaaq narrated to us: Yahyaa ibn al-`Alaa· narrated to us: from al-A`mash: from Ibraaheem an-Nakha`ee: from `Alqamah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>We went to Salmaan al-Faarisee, and he came out to us from a toilet of his, so we said to him: ‘If you were to perform wudoo·, O Aboo `Abdillaah, and then recite such and such Soorah to us.</strong>” So Salmaan said: “Allaah the Mighty and Majestic-only said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَّا يَمَسُّهُ إِلَّا الْمُطَهَّرُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Sooratul-Waaqi`ah (56):79]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;">In a well-guarded Book, which none touch but the purified ones</span>]], and it is the Reminder which is in the heavens: none touch it except the Angels.” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad ibn Sa`eed ibn Nabaat narrated to us: Ahmad ibn `Abdil-Baseer narrated to us: Qaasim ibn Asbigh narrated to us: Muhammad ibn `Abdis-Salaam al- Khushanee narrated to us: Muhammad ibn Bashshaar narrated to us: Muhammad ibn Ja`far narrated to us: Shu`bah narrated to us: Mansoor ibn al-Mu`tamir narrated to us: from Ibraaheem an-Nakha`ee: from `Alqamah ibn Qays: that <strong>when he wanted to take a mus-haf, he would order a Christian to transcribe it for him</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Aboo Haneefah said: “There is no harm in the junub carrying the mus-haf by its strap, and he may not carry it without a strap”, and the one who is not upon wudoo· is the same with them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Maalik said: “The junub, and the one who is not in a state of wudoo· may not carry the mus-haf: neither by its strap, nor upon a pillow; but if it is in a saddle-bag, or a box, then there is no harm in the Jew, the Christian, the junub, and the one who is not in a state of purification carrying it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Alee [[i.e. Ibn Hazm-rahimahullaah]] said: &#8220;<strong>There is no proof for the correctness of these distinctions; neither in the Qur&#8217;aan nor in the Sunnah-in what is authentic or what is weak, nor in Consensus, nor in analogy, nor in the saying of a Companion. So if the saddle-bag is a barrier between the carrier and the Qur&#8217;aan, then a book-cover and the back of a page should also be a barrier between the toucher and the Qur&#8217;aan, and there is no difference, and Allaah grants success</strong>.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Introduction to Tafseer – Ibn Taymiyyah (<em>rahimahullaah</em>)<br />
Taken from Tafseer Soorat-in-Naba’<br />
Compiled and translated by Abu Talhah (<em>rahimahullaah</em>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah. We praise Him, we seek His aid, and we ask for His forgiveness. We seek Allaah’s refuge from the evils of our selves and from the evil consequences of our deeds. Whomever Allaah guides then none can misguide him, and whomever He misguides then none can guide him. I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, alone, having no partner; and I testify that Muhammad is his Slave and His Messenger.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اتَّقُوا اللَّهَ حَقَّ تُقَاتِهِ وَلَا تَمُوتُنَّ إِلَّا وَأَنتُم مُّسْلِمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Meaning: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe in Allaah and His Messenger! Fear and be dutiful to Allaah, by obeying Him and avoiding disobedience to Him, as He deserves to be feared </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Obey Him and do not disobey Him; give thanks to Him and do not show ingratitude; remember Him and do not forget Him)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">; and do not die except as Muslims: obediently submitting to Him, and worshipping Him alone</span></strong>.] [Soorah Aali `Imraan (3): 102]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اتَّقُوا رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُم مِّن نَّفْسٍ وَاحِدَةٍ وَخَلَقَ مِنْهَا زَوْجَهَا وَبَثَّ مِنْهُمَا رِجَالًا كَثِيرًا وَنِسَاءً ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ الَّذِي تَسَاءَلُونَ بِهِ وَالْأَرْحَامَ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ عَلَيْكُمْ رَقِيبًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O Mankind! Fear and be dutiful to your Lord, Who alone created you from a single person</strong> (Aadam)<strong>, and from him He created his mate, and from these two He produced many men and women; and fear and be dutiful to Allaah through Whom you ask each other for your rights, and beware of cutting ties of kinship. Allaah is ever a Watcher over you</strong></span>.]] [Sooratun-Nisaa· (4): 1]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَقُولُوا قَوْلًا سَدِيدًا &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">يُصْلِحْ لَكُمْ أَعْمَالَكُمْ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ ذُنُوبَكُمْ ۗ وَمَن يُطِعِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَقَدْ فَازَ فَوْزًا عَظِيمًا </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you who believe in Allaah and His Messenger! Fear and be dutiful to Allaah and speak with truth and justice, and He will rectify your deeds for you and forgive your sins; and whoever obeys Allaah and His Messenger has attained tremendous success</strong></span>.]] [Sooratul-Ahzaab (33): 70-71]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>To proceed:</strong></span> Then the truest speech is the Book of Allaah -the Most High, and the best way is the way of Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم); and the worst of affairs are those things which are new introductions (into the Religion) and every new introduction is an innovation, and every innovation is misguidance, and all misguidance will be in the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Ummah (the Islamic nation) has a great and pressing need to understand the Qur·aan, which is the strong Rope of Allaah, and the wise Reminder; one who follows it will not be led astray by desires, and it will not become confused upon the tongues. It does not become dull through repetition, its wonders never cease, and the scholars can never have enough of it. Whoever speaks in accordance with it will speak the truth, whoever acts in accordance with it will be rewarded; whoever judges by it has judged justly, and whoever calls to it then he invites to the straight path. Whichever tyrant abandons it then Allaah will break him, and whoever seeks guidance in other than it then Allaah will misguide him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He -the Most High- said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَإِمَّا يَأْتِيَنَّكُم مِّنِّي هُدًى فَمَنِ اتَّبَعَ هُدَايَ فَلَا يَضِلُّ وَلَا يَشْقَىٰ &#8211; وَمَنْ أَعْرَضَ عَن ذِكْرِي فَإِنَّ لَهُ مَعِيشَةً ضَنكًا وَنَحْشُرُهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ أَعْمَىٰ &#8211; قَالَ رَبِّ لِمَ حَشَرْتَنِي أَعْمَىٰ وَقَدْ كُنتُ بَصِيرًا &#8211; قَالَ كَذَٰلِكَ أَتَتْكَ آيَاتُنَا فَنَسِيتَهَا ۖ وَكَذَٰلِكَ الْيَوْمَ تُنسَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then if guidance comes to you from Me, then whoever follows My Guidance shall not go astray and he shall not be wretched; but whoever turns away from My Reminder then he shall have a bleak and constricted life, and on the Day of Resurrection We shall raise him up blind. He will say: ‘O my Lord! Why have you raised me up blind when I used to have sight in the world?’ He will say: ‘Thus it is: Our signs came to you and you turned away from and abandoned them, and so this Day you shall be abandoned</strong></span>.]] [Soorah TaaHaa (20): 123-126]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He -the Most High- said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"> قَدْ جَاءَكُمْ رَسُولُنَا يُبَيِّنُ لَكُمْ كَثِيرًا مِّمَّا كُنتُمْ تُخْفُونَ مِنَ الْكِتَابِ وَيَعْفُو عَن كَثِيرٍ ۚ قَدْ جَاءَكُم مِّنَ اللَّهِ نُورٌ وَكِتَابٌ مُّبِينٌ &#8211;  يَهْدِي بِهِ اللَّهُ مَنِ اتَّبَعَ رِضْوَانَهُ سُبُلَ السَّلَامِ وَيُخْرِجُهُم مِّنَ الظُّلُمَاتِ إِلَى النُّورِ بِإِذْنِهِ وَيَهْدِيهِمْ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There has come to you Our Messenger Muhammad </strong>(صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)<strong>, explaining to you much of that which you used to hide from the Scripture, and overlooking much. There has come to you from Allaah a light and a clear Book. By it Allaah guides those who seek His Pleasure to the path which leads to safety and salvation; and He brings them out of darkness into the light, by His Permission, and He guides to the Straight Path</strong></span>.]] [Sooratul-Maa·idah (5): 15-16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He -the Most High- said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الر ۚ كِتَابٌ أَنزَلْنَاهُ إِلَيْكَ لِتُخْرِجَ النَّاسَ مِنَ الظُّلُمَاتِ إِلَى النُّورِ بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِمْ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطِ الْعَزِيزِ الْحَمِيدِ &#8211; اللَّهِ الَّذِي لَهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Alif Laam Raa. This is a book which We have sent down to you, in order that you might lead mankind out of darkness into light, by the permission of their Lord, to the path of the All-Mighty, the One worthy of all praise: Allaah, to Whom belongs everything that is in the heavens and in the earth</strong></span>.]] [Soorah Ibraaheem (14): 1-2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He -the Most High- said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَكَذَٰلِكَ أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ رُوحًا مِّنْ أَمْرِنَا ۚ مَا كُنتَ تَدْرِي مَا الْكِتَابُ وَلَا الْإِيمَانُ وَلَٰكِن جَعَلْنَاهُ نُورًا نَّهْدِي بِهِ مَن نَّشَاءُ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا ۚ وَإِنَّكَ لَتَهْدِي إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">صِرَاطِ اللَّهِ الَّذِي لَهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ ۗ أَلَا إِلَى اللَّهِ تَصِيرُ الْأُمُورُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And likewise We have revealed this Qur·aan to you, as a mercy, by Our Command. You did not know what the Book is, nor what is Faith. But We have made it a light by which We guide whomever We wish from Our servants. And you certainly guide Our servants towards the Straight Path: the Path of Allaah, to Whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. Certainly all affairs shall return to Allaah for judgement</strong></span>.]] [Sooratush-Shooraa (42): 52-53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230; It is binding that a person should know that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) explained the meaning of the Qur·aan to his Companions, just as he made clear to them its Words.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His Saying -He the Most High:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"> وَأَنزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ الذِّكْرَ لِتُبَيِّنَ لِلنَّاسِ مَا نُزِّلَ إِلَيْهِمْ </span></h3>
<p>[Sooratun-Nahl (16): 44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We sent down this Qur·aan to you, O Muhammad </strong>(صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)<strong>, as a reminder to them, so that you should then explain clearly to the people what has been sent down to them</strong></span>][1] includes both this and that [i.e. the Words and the meaning.]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Aboo `Abdir-Rahmaan as-Sulamee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Those who taught us the recitation of the Qur·aan, such as `Uthmaan ibn `Affaan, `Abdullah ibn Mas`ood, and others, when they had learned ten Aayahs from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), would not go beyond them until they had learned what they contained from knowledge and action. They said: So we learned the Qur·aan, and knowledge, and action, together.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore they used to remain for a period of time learning a Soorah, and Anas said: “<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>When a man had learned </strong>[Soorah] <strong>al-Baqarah and </strong>[Soorah] <strong>Aali `Imraan he attained stature in our eyes</strong></span>” [3], and Ibn `Umar took some years to learn al-Baqarah, it is said that it was eight years; Maalik mentioned it. [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that was because Allaah -the Most High- has said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">كِتَابٌ أَنزَلْنَاهُ إِلَيْكَ مُبَارَكٌ لِّيَدَّبَّرُوا آيَاتِهِ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>This Qur·aan is a Book which We have sent down to you, full of blessings, so that they may reflect upon its Aayahs</strong></span>.]] { [Soorah Saad (38): 29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَفَلَا يَتَدَبَّرُونَ الْقُرْآنَ ۚ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Will they not carefully reflect upon the Qur·aan?</strong></span>]]<br />
[Sooratun-Nisaa· (4): 82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَفَلَمْ يَدَّبَّرُوا الْقَوْلَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Have they not reflected upon the Qur·aan?</strong></span>]]<br />
[Sooratul-Mu·minoon (23): 68]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And carefully reflecting upon speech is not possible without understanding its meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise He -the Most High- said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّا أَنزَلْنَاهُ قُرْآنًا عَرَبِيًّا لَّعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ</span></h3>
<p>[Soorah Yoosuf (12): 2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur·aan, in order that you may comprehend its meaning]]</span></strong>, and comprehending speech includes understanding it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also known that what is intended from all speech is that its meaning be understood, not just its wording, so the Qur·aan has more right to that; and also the normal behaviour of the people prevents them from reading a book in any field of knowledge, be it medicine or mathematics, and then not seeking necessary explanation of it. So how about the Speech of Allaah, which is their essential safeguard, and through which they are to attain salvation and bliss, and by means of which their Religion and their worldly lives are correctly established?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why disagreement amongst the Companions with regard to the tafseer of the Qur·aan was extremely rare; and even though it occurred more amongst the Taabi`een (the Successors of the Companions) than it did amongst the Companions, then still it was little in comparison to what occurred with those who came after them. So the more excellent a time was, then the greater the unity, the harmony, the knowledge, and the clarity of understanding was in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from the Taabi`een there were those who learned the whole tafseer from the Companions, just as Mujaahid said: “<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>I went through the whole mus-haf with Ibn `Abbaas, stopping him at every Aayah and asking him about it</strong></span>.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore ath-Thawree said: “<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>If tafseer comes to you from Mujaahid, then it will suffice you</strong></span>.” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore his tafseer was relied upon by ash-Shaafi`ee, al-Bukhaaree, and others from the people of knowledge; and likewise Imaam Ahmad, and others who wrote works of tafseer, would repeatedly quote chains of narration from Mujaahid, more so than from others besides him. So what is intended is that the Taabi`een took the tafseer from the Companions, just as they took knowledge of the Sunnah from them&#8230;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Tafseer, then the people who were most knowledgeable about it were the people of Makkah, since they were the students of Ibn `Abbaas, such as: <strong>Mujaahid</strong>, `<strong>Ataa· ibn Abee Rabaah</strong>, `<strong>Ikrimah</strong>-the freed slave of Ibn `Abbaas, and others from the students of Ibn `Abbaas, such as: <strong>Taawoos</strong>, <strong>AbushSha`thaa</strong>·, <strong>Sa`eed ibn Jubayr</strong>, and their like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise the people of al-Koofah, from the students of Ibn Mas`ood, and they had distinction in some of that over others; and the scholars of tafseer from the people of al-Madeenah, such as Zayd ibn Aslam &#8211; whom Maalik took tafseer from, and likewise his [i.e. Zayd’s] son `Abdur-Rahmaan took it from him (also), and `Abdullaah ibn Wahb took it from `AbdurRahmaan&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in summary, whoever turns away from the positions of the Companions and the Taabi`een, and their tafseer, in favour of something contrary to that, then he is in error in doing that, indeed he is an innovator; unless if he is performing legitimate ijtihaad, in which case his error is forgiven&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if someone were to say: ‘<strong>What is the best approach with regard to Tafseer?</strong>’ Then the answer is that the most correct approach is to explain the Qur·aan with the Qur·aan. So what has been left unspecified at one place will be explained at another place, and what is mentioned briefly at one point will be detailed elsewhere&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if you become unable to do that, then take hold of the Sunnah, for the Sunnah explains and clarifies the Qur·aan&#8230;, and when we do not find the tafseer in the Qur·aan, nor in the Sunnah, then we refer back for that to the sayings of the Companions, for they knew best about it because of what they actually witnessed relating to the Qur·aan, and because of the circumstances particular to them, and because of their complete understanding, their correct knowledge, and their righteous deeds&#8230; And if you do not find the tafseer in the Qur·aan, nor in the Sunnah, nor do you find it from the Companions, then many of the imaams refer back in that case to the statements of the Taabi`een, such as Mujaahid ibn Jabr&#8230; and such as Sa`eed ibn Jubayr, `Ikrimah-the freed slave of Ibn `Abbaas, `Ataa· ibn Abee Rabaah, al-Hasan al-Basree, Masrooq ibn al-Ajda`, Sa`eed ibn alMusayyib, Abul-`Aaliyah, ar-Rabee` ibn Anas, Qataadah, ad-Dahhaak ibn Muzaahim, and others from the Taabi`een, and those who succeeded them, and those who came after them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So their sayings are mentioned with regard to an Aayah, and the wordings which they used may differ, and so one who has no knowledge may think that they are disagreements, when this is not actually the case. So some of them may refer to something by mentioning that which it necessitates, or by mentioning that which corresponds to it, and some of them may state the actual thing itself; and all of these actually have the same meaning, and this occurs in many places, so let the discerning person be alert to this; and Allaah is the One Who guides.” [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] as-Suyootee quoted in his ‘<em>Miftaahul-Jannah fil-I`tisaam bis-Sunnah</em>’ (p. 58): “Ibn Mas`ood said, as reported by Ibn Abee Haatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is nothing except that it has been made clear to us in the Qur·aan, however our understanding falls short of reaching it, so therefore He -the Most High- said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">بِالْبَيِّنَاتِ وَالزُّبُرِ ۗ وَأَنزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ الذِّكْرَ لِتُبَيِّنَ لِلنَّاسِ مَا نُزِّلَ إِلَيْهِمْ وَلَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So that you, O Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), should then explain clearly to the people what has been sent down to them</strong></span>]].’ { [Sooratun-Nahl (16): 44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] as-Suyootee quoted in his ‘<em>Miftaahul-Jannah fil-I`tisaam bis-Sunnah</em>’ (2/437): “at-Tabaree reported it in his ‘Tafseer’ (1/60), and as-Samarqandee in his ‘Tafseer’ (1/71) and Ibn Sa`d in ‘at-Tabaqaat’ (6/172), and Ibn Abee Shaybah in ‘al-Musannaf’:..6/117, and its chain of narration contains `Ataa· ibn as-Saa·ib:Sadooq (truthful), whose memory deteriorated; however the narrator from him is Hammaad ibn Zayd, as occurs in ‘as-Siyar’ (4/269), and his narrations from him are good&#8230;”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Reported by Imaam Ahmad (3/120). Shu`ayb al-Arnawoot said in his checking of the ‘Musnad’ (no. 12236): “Its chain of narration is ‘saheeh’ to the standard of the two Shaikhs.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Imaam Maalik stated in his ‘Muwatta·’ (1/205) that it had reached him (balaaghan) that `Abdullaah ibn `Umar had remained for eight years learning Sooratul-Baqarah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Fawwaaz Ahmad Zumarlee said in his checking of as-Suyootee’s ‘<em>al-Itqaan</em>’ (2/473): “It was reported in ‘al-Hilyah’ (3/280)..; and it was reported by at-Tabaree in his ‘Tafseer’(1/65), and Aboo Nu`aym in ‘al-Hilyah’ (3/279-280); and its chain of narration contains Muhammad ibn Ishaaq who narrated it with both of them with `an`anah (without stating that he had heard it directly from the narrator before him); however it has another chain of narration which supports it, since it was also reported by al-Qaasim ibn Sallaam in ‘Fadaa·ilul-Qur·aan’ (p. 216), and by Ahmad in ‘al-Fadaa·il’ (no. 1866), and its chain of narration contains Ibn Abee Najeeh, who reported a great amount from Mujaahid; but he would narrate from him things that he had not heard directly from him. Refer to ‘Tabaqaatul-Mudalliseen’ (p. 9).”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[2] Question: </b><span style="color:#993300;">Noble Shaikh, I try to read the Noble Qur’aan and I love the Book of Allaah greatly. However, the matter becomes difficult for me and I am not able to complete my recitation. What is the solution to this problem?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[2] Answer by Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The solution can be found in that which Allaah has instructed when He said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>فَإِذَا قَرَأْتَ الْقُرْآنَ فَاسْتَعِذْ بِاللَّهِ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِنَّهُ لَيْسَ لَهُ سُلْطَانٌ عَلَى الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِنَّمَا سُلْطَانُهُ عَلَى الَّذِينَ يَتَوَلَّوْنَهُ وَالَّذِينَ هُم بِهِ مُشْرِكُونَ</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“So when you recite the Qur’aan, seek refuge in Allaah from the outcast Devil. Verily, he has no power over those who believe and put their trust in their Lord (Allaah). His power is only over those who obey and follow him and those who associate partners in worship with Him (i.e. Allaah).”</b></span> [Surah An-Nahl: 16: 98-100]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has instructed us to seek refuge in Him from the outcast Devil before reciting the Qur’aan. This is so that Allaah can remove and distance this enemy from us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And you must also always reflect on the Qur’aan</strong></span>, since reflecting on it is one of the things that will cause you to be conscious about it and incite you towards the noble Qur’aan. All of your longing should not be geared towards just completing a surah or finishing up a juz and so on. Rather, your objective in reciting the Qur’aan should be to reflect and ponder upon the meaning of what you recite from the verses of Allaah. The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) would prolong his recitation during the Night Prayer, and he would not pass upon a verse related to Allaah’s Mercy except that he would stop and ask Allaah (for Mercy), nor would he pass upon a verse in which (Allaah’s) punishment was mentioned except that he would stop and seek refuge in Allaah (from that). All of this shows that he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) would recite the Qur’aan whilst reflecting on it and having a conscious and attentive heart.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah affirmed speech; <em>al-Kalaam</em> for Himself in many <em>aayahs</em>, from them is the saying; He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُل لَّوْ كَانَ الْبَحْرُ مِدَادًا لِّكَلِمَاتِ رَبِّي لَنَفِدَ الْبَحْرُ قَبْلَ أَن تَنفَدَ كَلِمَاتُ رَبِّي وَلَوْ جِئْنَا بِمِثْلِهِ مَدَدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “If the water of the ocean were ink to write down the words of My Lord then the ocean would be exhausted before the words of My Lord were finished&#8230;”</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Kahf (18), <em>aayah</em> 109)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, the words of Allaah with which He commands and forbids and manages the creation with. Who can then enumerate the words of Allaah, He, the Perfect and Most High? They could not be written down by the oceans nor by all of the pens.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the speech of Allaah, the <em>Kalaam</em> is as said by the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“With respect to its type; eternal, with respect to its individual instances, it newly comes about.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Qadeemun-Nau`</em> means that Allaah, the Most High has always had the attribute of speech. However, with regard to individual instances, for example, Allaah, the Most High speaking to Aadam or Allaah, the Most High speaking to Moosaa <em>`alayhissalaam</em> or Allaah, the Most High speaking to Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> or speaking to Jibreel with the <em>Qur·aan</em> then these individual instances of the speech of Allaah; they newly occur.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the <em>Qur</em>·<em>aan</em> is from the newly occurring instances of the speech of Allaah and some individual instances of the speech of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the speech of Allaah is confirmed by the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em> of His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.</em> And there is no doubt that sound intellect affirms speech for Allaah because it is <em><u>S</u>ifatul Kamaal</em> (hidden attribute of perfection) and negation of it is an attribute of deficiency.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> and they are the followers of Al-Jahm ibn Safwaan who was a foul person who appeared amongst the people and tried to cause them to doubt about the religion of Allaah and he commanded them with apostasy and disbelief. And from that is that he tried to cause them to doubt about the fact that Allaah speaks and he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The speech of Allaah which is present is something created; <em>makhlooq</em>. He created it in the Preserved Tablet or He created it in Jibreel or He created it in Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So it is therefore just an ascription of a created thing to its creator just like saying <em>Baitullaah</em> (the House of Allaah) or <em>Naaqatullaah</em> (the she camel of Allaah).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what he said  ̶ may Allaah disfigure him. He said Allaah does not speak and the ascription of speech to Him is just an ascription of a created thing to its Creator. This is from his <em>mathhab</em> (position). And he also had the position of <em>Al</em>&#8211;<em>Jabr</em> with regard to <em>Qadr</em> (predecree); that people are compelled to do their deeds, no free will. And he had the position of with regard to denying the names and attributes and he also had a position with regard to denying the Sunnah of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and denying the <em>Qur·aan</em> also. So he was a filthy apostate who appeared with the likes of this falsehood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this <em>mathhab</em> was derived from the Jews as was mentioned by Shaykh-ul-Islaam Ibnu Taymiyyah in the introduction to <em>Al-Hamawiyyah</em>. And Al-Jahm, he was not the one who began this <em>mathhab</em>. Before him, there was Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham; he is the one who initiated this repulsive saying. And he took it from <u>T</u>aaloot; the Jew and <u>T</u>aaloot took it from Labeed ibn al-`A`a<u>s</u>am, the Jew who did sorcery upon the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this saying is derived from the Jews, those who distort the speech of Allaah, away from its correct meaning, so this foul <em>mathhab</em> should not be considered something inexplicable when its source is known that it is from the Jews. They infiltrated it amongst the Muslims by means of this foul man Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham, the one who was killed by Khaalid al-Qasree on the Day of <em>Eid ul-A<u>d</u>haa</em> as Ibn-ul Qayyim mentioned.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span style="color:#ff0000;">[1]</span></a> So therefore Ibn-ul Qayyim said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>And on account of that, Khaalid Al–Qasree slaughtered </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>Ja`ad on the Day of the Sacrifice </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>Since he said Ibraaheem was not Allaah’s chosen beloved one</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>No, and nor was Moosaa one who He spoke to and drew close </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>So every person of Sunnah is thanked for that sacrifice</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808080;">What an excellent thing Allaah has brought about through the sacrifice of this brother</span> </em><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span style="color:#ff0000;">[2]</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This saying was taken from him by Al-Jahm ibn Safwaan and it became ascribed to him because he is the one who propagated it but he is not the one who initiated it.<span style="color:#ff0000;"><a style="color:#ff0000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the people of the Sunnah rebuked and criticized them severely (the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>). And they spoke sternly in that regard and this will follow inshaaAllaah, the part that comes after. However, with us now we have a part of this foul <em>mathhab</em>, which is negation of speech for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, a problem arose with the People of the <em>Sunnah</em>, should it be said, “My recital of the <em>Qur</em>·<em>aan</em> is created or is not created?” This is something which they introduced also amongst the Muslims. So should you say: “My recital of the <em>Qur·aan</em> is created or should you say my recital of the <em>Qur·aan</em> is not created or should you <em>tatawaqqaf</em> (withhold)? And say if what you mean is what is recited, that which is recited, then it is the speech of Allaah, it is not created. And if what is meant is a person’s own particular recital of the <em>Qur·aan</em> then his own recital is a created thing and his voice is created. So therefore it must be mentioned with detail and it must be given then with detail.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is the detail, which was stated by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad and Al-Bukhaariyy and a group of the verifiers. So do not say: my recital of the <em>Qur·aan</em> is created unrestricted and do not say it’s not created unrestrictedly and do not withhold. Rather, mention the answer with detail that <span style="color:#333399;">if what you mean is what I’m reciting then that is the speech of Allaah, that is not created or if what is meant is the person’s own particular recitation, his own particular voice then that is created. That is the detail</span>. <span style="color:#ff0000;"><a style="color:#ff0000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Translator’s side-point: And he quotes three famous lines from the Nooniyyah of Ibn-ul Qayyim, poem on `<em>aqeedah</em>, each line ending in <em>noon</em>, concerning this event that this man Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham that he was killed by Khaalid Al-Qasree.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Translator’s side-point: They mention this happened around the year 118 AH in Kufa that Khaalid Al-Qasree who was the governor in Iraq at that time that he slaughtered this evil person Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Translator’s side-point: Some of the people of Knowledge mention is that this saying that we heard was taken by Jahm from Al-Ja`ad and he took it from Taaloot and he took it from Labeed. Then this Labeed ibn al-`A`a<u>s</u>am was a Jew. As we heard he did sorcery upon the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his saying was taken from him by Taaloot; the Jew and from him, his student Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham took this saying, the saying of the Jahmiyyah. And from Al-Ja`ad was taken by his student Al-Jahm ibn Safwaan and each was executed. We saw Al-Ja`ad being executed here and likewise Al-Jahm ibn Safwaan, he was killed as well; his student but before that, each time before the person was executed or killed, he had a famous student who took the saying from him. So, Al-Jahm ibn Safwaan, this saying was taken from him by Bishr al-Marisee and then he, Bishr al-Marisee, he taught this to A<u>h</u>mad ibn Abee Du`aad, the one who was at the head of those who tortured Imaam A<u>h</u>mad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And just briefly with regard to the event; before the event that Khalid al-Qasree slaughtered Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham on the Day of Sacrifices. He gave a <em>khutbah</em> to the people on the `<em>Eid</em> and he said: May Allaah accept your sacrifices for indeed I am going to sacrifice Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham and he came down and he slaughtered Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Shaykh al-Albaaniyy said with regard to this report: “There’s some speech from the scholars, is it established or not? This is reported by a number of the scholars in their books Ad-Daarimee in <em>Ar-Radd `alal-Jahmiyyah</em> and Al-Bukhaariyy in his book <em>Khalq Af`alul-`Ibaad</em> and other books as well. Then Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy in <em>Mukhta<u>s</u>ar al-`Uluw</em>, Ath-Thahabee’s book <em>Al `Uluw</em>, the originate of it, Shaykh al-Albaaniyy comments, he mentions that the first chain of narration for this that there is weakness in it, there is unknown people in the chain. But then he said, however, the narration that comes after it, another narration with a different chain is better than it and perhaps therefore that is why the scholars state that this story definitely happened. Meaning, there is more than one chain of narration before it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> Translator’s side-point:  With regard to the explanation of Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad An-Najmee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> then he said after mentioning a number of evidences from the <em>Qur·aan</em> affirming that the <em>Qur·aan</em> is indeed the speech of Allaah, not created and the speech of Allaah is an attribute of His. Then he said: ‘And whoever says that anything from the attributes of Allaah is a created thing then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever). This is what the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em> have affirmed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Al-Laalikaa’ee referring to here Imaam Al–Laalikaa`ee in his book <em>Sharh Usool I`tiqaad Ahlus-Sunnah</em>; famous book of `<em>aqeedah</em> mentioned from 550 scholars from the <em>Salaf</em> that they said: ‘Whoever says that the <em>Qur·aan</em> is a created thing then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) and whoever says that his recitation of the <em>Qur·aan</em> is something created then he is an innovator, a <em>Jahmi</em> (he is astray). And likewise, one who remains silent and doesn’t say whether it’s created or not created, he is also a <em>Jahmi</em> (astray). So what Allaah has informed is very clear that the <em>Qur·aan</em> is the speech of Allaah and whoever will not say that then he has belied Allaah in what He has informed of.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Translator’s side point: Obviously the last part of the text here is taken from the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> that’s come a number of times, <strong><em>“Whoever lives long amongst you will see great differing</em></strong>…<strong>”</strong> and the rest of the point taken from the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of Al-Irbaa<u>d</u> Ibn Saariyah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em> reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad, Abu Daawood, At-Tirmithee and Ibn Maajah and declared authentic by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy, the famous <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> that’s come a number of times.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 47: Point 76</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And it is not permissible to withhold <em>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah </em>(sincere advice) from anyone from the Muslims, whether righteous or sinful in matters of the religion.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> So, whoever withholds it then he has acted deceitfully towards the Muslims and whoever acts deceitfully towards the Muslims then he has acted deceitfully towards the religion, and whoever acts deceitfully towards the religion then he has shown treachery towards Allaah, His Messenger and the believers.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F382959317&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/ad-deenu-an-naseehah-the-religion-is-sincerity" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying,<span style="color:#993300;"> “<strong>And it is not permissible for you to withhold <em>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincere advice) from anyone from the Muslims whether they be righteous or sinful,” </strong></span><em>An-<strong>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</strong></em> (sincerity) is to be pure and free of <strong><em>ghish</em> </strong>(deceit) and a thing that is <em>naa<u>s</u>i<u>h</u></em>; a thing that has its quality of <em>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em>, it is a thing that is <em>khaali<u>s</u></em> (pure). So, the believer, it is obligatory that he should be <em>naa<u>s</u>i<u>h</u></em> (sincere); meaning that he should be pure and free of hypocrisy; <em>nifaaq</em> and he should be pure and free of <em>ghish</em> (deceptiveness) and he should be pure and free of <em>khadee`ah</em> (cheating). His outward aspect and his inward aspect should be just the same with regard to truthfulness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity) is the religion just as the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The religion is an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</strong> <strong>(sincerity), the religion is sincerity, the religion is sincerity; an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah. We said, ‘Towards whom O Messenger of Allaah?’ So he said, ‘Towards Allaah and towards His Book and towards His Messenger and towards the rulers of the Muslims and their common folk.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what is meant by it (<em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em>) here is that a person is free of every blameworthy characteristic and that he adorns himself with all the noble and virtuous manners and characteristics. So, the man who is <em>naa<u>s</u>i<u>h</u></em> (has this quality of sincerity) is the one who is not deceptive, does not have any <em>ghish</em> (deceptive) towards anyone. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever deceives us is not from us.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the opposite of <em>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity) is <strong><em>al-ghish</em></strong> (deceptiveness). And the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> repeated his saying <em>ad-deenun</em> <em>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (the religion is sincerity) three times for emphasis and to stress its importance and he limited the religion; all of it to being <em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>An-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity) towards Allaah</strong> and His Messenger; this is with regard to <em>`aqeedah</em> (creed and belief). So, a person will not be a Muslim unless his `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) is sound and is free of <em>shirk</em> and his actions are free of innovations (<em>bid`ah)</em> and he is one who is following the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So, this person, he is the one who is <strong><em>an-naa<u>s</u>i<u>h</u></em></strong> (one who is sincere) towards Allaah and His Messenger, i.e the one whose deeds are free of <em>shirk</em> and free of innovations.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sincerity towards the Messenger</strong> <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is to truly believe; to have <em>eemaan</em> in his Messengership, and to love him, and to respect, and honour him <em>`alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam,</em> and to take him as an example to follow, and to give precedence to his saying over the saying of everyone, and to leave off innovations and new introductions, which are something that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> warned against, and to believe him regarding whatever he informed about regarding things of the unseen of the past and the future, and to avoid whatever he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> forbade. This is sincerity towards the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His (<em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saying, <strong><em>“…and towards His Book…”</em></strong> the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, it is the Qur&#8217;aan such that you have <em>eemaan</em> that it is the speech of Allaah sent down; not created, it is not the speech of anyone else as is said by the people of misguidance; and that you learn it, and teach it, and that you act upon it, and that you acquire understanding of its meanings, and that you reflect upon it. This is sincerity towards the Book of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High; learning, and teaching, and understanding, and acquiring knowledge of it, and acting upon it. And likewise, from sincerity towards the Book of Allaah is to be plentiful in its recitation and not to be neglectful with regard to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity)<strong><em> “…towards the rulers of the Muslims…”</em></strong> they are those who are in charge of the affairs, those in authority, that you obey them in that which is not disobedience to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. And that you do not remove your hand from obedience, and that you do not rebel against them, and that you do not seek out their mistakes and their hidden faults and expose them to the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from sincerity (<em>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah)</em> towards them is that if you have knowledge (`<em>ilm)</em> and you have the ability to sincerely advise them that you do so personally between yourself and them; you cause the advice to reach them and inform them about mistakes, which occur from them or from their subjects, you let them know about that but you do not speak about them in gatherings, for this will be a case of <em>ghish</em> (treachery). So, <em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity) is that you convey sincere advice from yourself to them. This is from sincerity towards the person in authority.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, from sincerity towards the person in authority is to carry out the duty that he puts you in charge of carrying out, whether it is a <em>wa<u>z</u>eefah</em> (duty or a post) or being placed in charge of something or other than that from the affairs of the religion and the worldly life, that you carry the duty out which the one in authority has entrusted you with in the best manner and that you do not miss anything of it out and if you see any deficiencies then you inform the one in authority between yourself and him. You inform him of the deficiencies so that he can remedy it. This is sincerity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from sincerity towards those in authority is to make <em>du`a</em> (supplication) for them that they be rectified since if they are sound and rectified, the subjects will be sound and rectified and that you make <em>du`a</em> (supplication) for them. So, if you see a man who is a student of knowledge who does not make supplication for them or who criticises making supplication for them then you should know that he is treacherous (<em>ghaash)</em> and he is not one who is sincere towards the person in authority.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And sincerity<strong><em> “…towards the common Muslims,” </em></strong>is that you direct them to what is correct; and you warn them against errors, and that you command the good and forbid the evil, and that you teach the one who is ignorant, and that you remind the person who is heedless, and that you love for him the good that you love for yourself, and to have compassion for the poor person, and you give charity (<em><u>s</u>adaqah)</em> for the needy. This is <em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, that he gives good advice to the person who consults him and he guards secrets for one who trusts him regarding something and to safeguard things which are entrusted with you. He should be sincere from all aspects. And sincerity is with regard to buying and selling such that he does not deceive and does not trick.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is <em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity) in brief. So, whoever is not like that then he is treacherous and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever deceives us then he is not from us.”</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, that occurs being reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad and Aboo Daawood and at-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee and others and at-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee said it is <em><u>h</u>a<u>s</u>an, <u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (good, authentic).</p>

<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And the Qur&#8217;aan is the Speech of Allaah, His Revelation and His Light. It is not created, because the Qur&#8217;aan is from Allaah and that which is from Allaah is not created. This is what was stated by Maalik ibn Anas and by Ahmad ibn Hanbal rahimahumAllaah and by the jurists who came before them and after them. And disputation concerning it is disbelief.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-quraan-is-the-speech-of-allaah-and-it-is-not-created" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And the Qur&#8217;aan is the Speech of Allaah, and His Revelation sent down and His Light. And it is not created”</strong>. From the creed and belief of AhlusSunnah wal-Jamaa`ah, the People of the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah is that the Qur&#8217;aan is the Speech of Allaah. He spoke with it in reality and Jibreel heard it from Him and he descended with it to Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. No one disagreed about this creed and belief, (no-one) from the people of knowledge who proceeded upon the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. The only ones who disagreed about it were the people of misguidance from the Jahmiyyah, the followers of Al-Jahm ibn Safwaan, and the offspring of the Jahmiyyah who are the Mu`tazilah and the Zaydiyyah and the Shee`ah. All of those people took up this matter from the Jahmiyyah. And likewise the Ibaadiyyah; all of them proceeded upon the methodology which contradicts the methodology of the Ahlus-Sunnah walJamaa`ah. And they held that the Qur&#8217;aan is something created because, in their view, Allaah is not to be described as speaking, just as He is not described with the Attribute of Hearing or Seeing or Knowing or Willing and other than that, in their view. Nor is he described as having a Face or having two Hands to other than that. And their intent in this is to corrupt the `aqeedah (creed and belief). Even if they try to make it seem that their intent is actually to declare Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, free from any resemblance to the created beings. And this is a false claim, because the Attributes of the Lord, the Perfect, do not resemble the attributes of the created beings. So the Lord, the Majestic and Most High, has Names (asmaa·) and Attributes (sifaat) which befit Him and His Greatness. And the created beings have names and attributes/characteristics which are appropriate for them and for their human nature. So there is no resemblance between the two types from the aspect of true reality, haqeeqah and of the ‘how’, kayfiyyah, even though they share in the meaning and the wording. And this is called al-mutawaati·, different things which are covered by a common word. However, they do not share in the reality and in how they are (kayfiyyah). This is the position of the Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah, and their proof for this is from the Book of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And if anyone from the people of shirk seeks that you grant him protection then grant him protection so that he can hear the Speech of Allaah</span></strong> (Sooratut-Towbah (9), aayah 6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He ascribed Speech to Himself, He the Perfect and Most High, and said with regard to the hypocrites:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They wish to alter the Speech of Allaah</strong></span> (Sooratul-Fat.h (48), aayah 15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He ascribed it to Himself. And the proofs from the Sunnah and the <em>ijmaa</em>` (consensus of this nation) are many for this matter. So it is a matter of certainty without there being any doubt. And the disagreement of the people of misguidance does not affect the fact that the Qur&#8217;aan is the Speech of Allaah. And it is one instance of His Speech, He the Perfect. So Allaah speaks and He continues to speak whenever He wishes, if He wishes, with whatever He wishes. He has the Attribute of <em>Kalaam</em> (Speech) and this Qur&#8217;aan is one of the instances of the Speech of Allaah. So He spoke with the Tawraah and (He spoke) with the Injeel and with the Zaboor. He speaks with commands and with prohibitions. He says to something <em>kun</em>, be, and it is.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">His </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Allaah&#8217;s)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> command, when He wills something, is just that He says to it be, and it is.</span></strong> (Soorah Yaaseen (36), aayah 82)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He affirmed for Himself qawl (Saying).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>When Allaah said O `Eesaa</strong> </span>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), aayah 55)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He spoke to Moosaa, with Speech which Moosaa heard when He sent him to Fir&#8217;awn (the Pharaoh). So Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, has the Attribute of Speech and from His Speech is the honourable Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the saying of the people of misguidance, that its being ascribed to Allaah is ascribing a created thing to its Creator, like the she-camel of Allaah or the House of Allaah; so we say this is a lie, and it is a deception. That which is ascribed to Allaah is of two categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first category</strong> is ascription of abstract things or Attributes (ma`aanin) &#8211;  i.e non-material objects</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second category</strong> is ascribing material objects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abstract things or Attributes which are ascribed to Allaah: then this is to ascribe an Attribute to the One who has the Attribute. And it is a <strong>true and real ascription</strong>. So this will be from His Attributes, such as Speech and Hearing and Seeing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ascribing objects, such as the she-camel and the House of Allaah (the Ka`bah) this is ascription of a created thing to the One who created it. And it is an <strong>ascription to show honour</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But those people (those who say the Speech of Allaah means the speech created by Allaah) they have mixed up these two matters and they do not make a distinction between this and this. And therefore the People of the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah state this matter in the Books of creed and beliefs to refute the people of misguidance. And if Allaah did not have Speech, as those people claim, then how does He command and prohibit? And the meaning of this would be that the Islamic rulings are nullified. And it undermines the main foundation and it is the Qur&#8217;aan. So if this fundamental is undermined, then Islaam would collapse. However they take cover under the claim of <strong><em>tanzeeh</em> </strong>(declaring Allaah free from resemblance to the creation). But this is not <em>tanzeeh</em>, rather it is <strong><em>ta`teel</em> </strong>(purely striping Him of Attributes). And there is a difference between <em>ta`teel</em> denying Attributes and between <em>tanzeeh</em> (declaring Him free from resemblance). <em>At-tanzeeh</em> is that which Allaah mentioned in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him</span> </strong>(Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do you know of anyone similar to Him?</span></strong> (Soorah Maryam (19), aayah 65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is tanzeeh, declaring the Creator free of resemblance to the creation, which is mentioned by Allaah. And it is to deny any resemblance between the creation and the Creator or that the creation is equal to the Creator. That is what Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, is declared free of. But as for denying the Attributes, then that is just ta`teel, pure denial and negation, which comes about as a result of <strong><em>tashbeeh</em> </strong>[01] . So they imagine resemblance initially and then they deny the Attributes secondly. And this is not tanzeeh, declaring the Creator free of resemblance. So there is a difference between tanzeeh, declaring the Creator free of resemblance and between ta`teel, denying the Attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Ash`arees came with something astonishing</strong>, even more astonishing than the saying of the Jahmiyyah. So they said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“The Speech of Allaah is divided into two categories: the meanings and the words. The meanings, this is the Speech of Allaah. And Allaah has the Attribute that He has Speech, and it is the meaning which has existed eternally in Himself. But as for Allaah speaking with letters and with a voice, then this is to be denied for Allaah in their view. And they say it (His Speech) is just a meaning existing in Himself, He the Most Perfect and Most High. As for the words, then it is the speech of a created being meaning it is from the speech of Jibreel or from the speech of Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they made the Qur&#8217;aan to be composed of two things, from something created and from something not created. So they did not come to be with the People of the Sunnah and say that the Qur&#8217;aan is not created. And they were not with the Jahmiyyah and said that the Qur&#8217;aan all of it is created. Rather they were <strong>waverers (neither here nor there)</strong>. Just like the saying of the Christians with regard to the Messiah, that he was composed of two things, of the divine and the human. And they say that the human and divine became as one. [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in summary this matter is very great. And do not be intimidated by the traitors, those who claim that they are from the People of the Sunnah, and those who say, “This matter does not warrant all of this arguing. And Imam Ahmad went beyond the limit when he refused to say that the Qur&#8217;aan is created. And this matter does not warrant all of this.” This is present in the writings of some of those who ascribe themselves to knowledge, and some who say, “What happened between Imam Ahmad and his opponents was just a political disagreement.” But if you carefully reflect, you will find that this matter is not something slight. Because if it is denied that the Qur&#8217;aan is the Speech of Allaah, then what remains with us? If the Lord has the Attribute of Speech removed from Him, then this will be a deficiency in the Lord, the Perfect. Because the one who does not speak is not an ilaah (is not one who is deserving of worship). And Allaah, the Perfect, He rebuked the Jews when they worshipped the calf and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do they not see that it (the calf) does not speak to them.</span></strong> (Sooratul- A`raaf (7), aayah 148)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it must be the case that the Lord speaks. And He controls and He commands and He forbids. So therefore if Speech is negated for Allaah, then it would be the case that He is not deserving of divinity and the right to worship. High and Exalted is Allaah above what they say. So this is a tremendous matter. Therefore Imaam Ahmad rahimahullaah took the stance that he took, the stance of the unshakable mountains, and he would not give in, and he did not make any exceptions for himself. And he had patience upon the trial and he had patience upon imprisonment and upon being lashed and upon being demeaned by three khaleefahs (Caliphs), al-Ma·moon, al-Mu`tasim and al-Waathiq. Each one of them followed on in succession upon torturing him. They wanted him to give in, but he refused rahimahullaah and he remained firm. At the end of the time of al-Waathiq (the last of the three), it is said that he turned back from this, when there was a debate between a scholar from the People of the Sunnah and between Bishr al-Mareesee and (Bishr) al-Mareesee was defeated, and at that point al-Waathiq turned back. [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in summary, this is a tremendous matter and it is very important and must not be treated lightly. And it may not be said, as some of the ignorant people and some of the writers and the intellectuals say, or the Ash`arees or those who follow their way, they say, “This is a matter which does not warrant all of this importance and all of these refutations.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Imam Ahmad used as a proof against them His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So that he may hear the Speech of Allaah.</span></strong> (Sooratut-Towbah (9), aayah 6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Thus did Allaah say before.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fath (48), aayah 15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah said,” so He affirmed for Himself Speech and Sayings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and His Revelation sent down,”</strong> meaning the Qur&#8217;aan. He sent it down to His Prophet Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam through the intermediary Jibreel, `alayhis-salaam. He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The Trustworthy Spirit </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Jibreel, `alayhis-salaam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> descended with it </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the Qur&#8217;aan)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> to your heart </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(heart of Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> so that you should be from the warners in a clear Arabic tongue </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(language)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">.</span> </strong>(Sooratush-Shu`araa· (26), aayaat 193-195)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is clear and very apparent. Yet despite this there are some who come and say, “The Qur&#8217;aan is a created thing, not something sent down, and Allaah did not speak with it and Allaah is not described with Speech.” High and Exalted is Allaah above what they say.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and it is His Light.”</strong> The Qur&#8217;aan is described as being Light. He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">But rather We made it a Light, by which We guide whomever We wish from our servants</span></strong> (Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 52)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is called Rooh, life or spirit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We revealed to you a Rooh </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Spirit/Life/Soul)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> from our Command</span></strong>. (Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 52)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rooh, a Spirit or Life, because the hearts come to life through it (the Qur&#8217;aan), just as the bodies come to life through a spirit/soul. So it is a Spirit/Soul for the hearts. And the well-known soul is a soul for the bodies. So therefore it (the Qur&#8217;aan) is Light, and it is a Spirit and it is Guidance, and it is a Reminder and it is Admonitions, and it has many names, which shows its greatness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“because the Qur&#8217;aan is from Allaah and that which is from Allaah is not created.”</strong> Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, along with His Names and His Attributes, is not created. So He is the Creator and everything besides Him is something created. And it cannot be said that the Names and Attributes are created, because they are from Allaah, and that which is from Allaah is not created, meaning Allaah has them as His Attributes. So Allaah with His Names and His Attributes is the Creator and whatever is besides Him is created.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And likewise Maalik ibn Anas and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, may Allaah have mercy upon them, said,”</strong> This is the saying of the Imaams. And from them was Maalik, the Imaam of the abode of Hijrah (al-Madeenah), and Imaam Ahmad, the one who was tortured for that and who was harmed, may Allaah have mercy upon him, and he had patience; and others besides them from the Imaams of AhlusSunnah. This was their saying. [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and whoever came before them from the jurists (the scholars of fiqh) and whoever came after them.”</strong> Meaning, Imaam Maalik and Imaam Ahmad were not alone in this saying. Rather it was said by those who came before them from the Companions and the taabi`een and the successors of the taabi`een. And whoever came after them from the Imaams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And disputation about it is disbelief.”</strong> [05] Disputing about the Qur&#8217;aan, whether it is something created or whether it is something not created or a person having doubts and saying, “I don’t know, there is disagreement about this matter,” as people say now. So a manifestation has now appeared where they say, “The matter is khilaafiyyah/there is disagreement about this matter”. So we say: When there is disagreement, then what is to be followed is the daleel, the proof. We were not given the duty in the Religion of having to follow the disagreements of the people and sayings of the people. We have being given the duty in the Religion of following the proof. So when there is disagreement we test the disagreement against the proof. And whatever that is found to be supported by the proof, then it is the Truth. And whatever is contrary to the proof, then it is false. And Allaah did not abandon us to opinions and sayings and disagreements. Rather He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So if you disagree in anything, then refer it back to Allaah and to the Messenger.</strong> </span>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), aayah 59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad said in his book, Usoolus-Sunnah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“And the Qur&#8217;aan is the Speech of Allaah and it is not created. And a person should not be too weak to say, ‘It is not created.’ Because the Speech of Allaah is not something separate from Him. And there is nothing from Him that is created.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whatever you disagree about, then its judgement is to be referred back to Allaah. That is Allaah my Lord. Upon Him I place my reliance and to Him I turn constantly.</span> </strong>(Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory to refer back to the Book of Allaah and to the Sunnah of His Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And whatever is supported by proof is to be taken, and whatever is contrary to the proof is to be left. And as for the person who takes a saying which conforms to his desires or his whims, even if it goes against the proof, then he is one who is astray; and this one is worshipping his own desires. As for the person who is worshipping Allaah, then he takes that which is supported by the proof from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] Transcriber’s note: meaning resemblance</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Imaam ath-Thahabee, in his book Siyar A`laamin-Nubalaa· in volume 11, in the biography of <strong>Ibn Kullaab (the founder of what is called the Ash`aree creed)</strong>, said, “Abul-`Abbaas al-Baghawee said, “Thaythoon the Christian said to me, ‘May Allaah have mercy upon `Abdullaah (Ibn Kullaab). He used to come to me in the church and he used to take things from me and if he had lived, we would have turned the Muslims into Christians.’ So it was said to this Christian man Thaythoon, ‘What do you say about the Messiah (`Eesaa)?’ He said, ‘What the people of your way said about the Qur&#8217;aan.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> That story is mentioned in a footnote from Siyar A`laamin-Nubalaa· by Imaam ath-Thahabee</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Al-Laalikaa·ee reports in his book, Usool I`tiqaad Ahlis-Sunnah, from Aboo Uways who said, “I heard my maternal uncle, Maalik ibn Anas, and a group of the scholars mention the Qur&#8217;aan and they said, ‘<em>It is the Speech of Allaah, and it is from Him and there is nothing from Him which is created.</em>’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[05] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> There is a hadeeth which directly states it reported by Aboo Daawood as hadeeth 4603 declared hasan saheeh, good authentic, by Shaykh al-Albaanee from Aboo Hurayrah, from the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, that he said: “<em>Disputation about the Qur&#8217;aan is disbelief</em>.”</p>

<p>The following Question and Answers are extracted from the Fatwa from The Permanent Commitee ( Link <strong><a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Tree&amp;NodeID=2195&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here</a>)&nbsp;</strong>&amp; Fatwa of Ibn Baz..

<p><span style="color: #993300"><b>What is&nbsp;the ruling on Sujud-ul-Tilawah (Prostration of Recitation)?</b></span></p>



<p>Sujud-ul-Tilawah is an act of Sunnah.</p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><b>When someone is reciting the Qur&#8217;an and does Sujud-ul-Tilawah (Prostration of Recitation), should they say Takbir (saying: &#8220;Allahu Akbar [Allah is the Greatest]&#8221;) when prostrating and when rising up from the Sujud (prostration) or just when prostrating?</b></span></p>



<p>They should say Takbir when prostrating, as&nbsp;related by<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">&nbsp;Abu Dawud&nbsp;</span>in his Sunan (Hadith compilation classified by jurisprudential themes) on the authority of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">&nbsp;Ibn `Umar&nbsp;</span>(may Allah be pleased with them) who said,&nbsp;<a name="TheMessengerofAllah(peacebe"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="1025" class="tip"></span><span style="color: #99cc00"><em>The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) used to recite the Qur&#8217;an to us. When he came upon Ayat-ul-Sujud (Qur’anic verses of Prostration), he would say Takbir and prostrate, and we would prostrate</em></span>.</span></p>



<p>A Muslim should not say Takbir when rising from the Sujud, as it was not confirmed that he (peace be upon him) did so. Sujud-ul-Tilawah is an act of worship and acts of worship are Tawqifiy (bound by a religious text and not amenable to personal opinion), they are limited to what was proved in the Shari`ah texts.</p>



<p>It was related that the Takbir is only said when going into Sujud-ul-Tilawah and not when rising from it, <strong>unless the Ayat-ul-Sujud are recited while offering Salah (prayer), then the Takbir is said when prostrating and when rising from the Sujud.</strong> There are many Sahih (authentic) Hadith that mention how the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to offer Salah, which report that he used to say Takbir when prostrating and when rising from prostration.</p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><b>Should Taslim (salutation of peace ending the Prayer) be made when Sujud-ul-Tilawah is performed during recitation of the Qur&#8217;an outside Salah (Prayer)?</b></span></p>



<p>There is no Nas (Islamic text from the Qur’an or the Sunnah) to support that Taslim should be made after performing it; therefore, no Taslim should follow Sujud.</p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><b>Should they recite the Tashahhud (a recitation in the sitting position in the second/ last unit of Prayer) and should they say the Taslim (salutation of peace ending the Prayer)?</b></span></p>



<p>The Tashahhud should not be said during Sujud-ul-Tilawah nor the Taslim, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) did not do so. Sujud-ul-Tilawah is an act of worship and acts of worship, as was mentioned, are Tawqifiy. So you should not resort to Qiyas (analogy) and include the Taslim or Tashahhud in the Sujud-ul-Tilawah as it is in Salah.</p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><b>If someone is offering Salah and one of Ayat-ul-Sujud (Qur&#8217;anic verses of Prostration) is recited at the end of the Surah (Qur&#8217;anic chapter), should they start to recite the next Surah after rising up from Sujud (prostration) or just proceed directly to Ruku` (bowing)?</b></span></p>



<p>It is not obligatory for someone who offers Salah and performs Sujud-ul-Tilawah at the end of Surahs such as Al-A`raf, Al-Najm, and Al-`Alaq, to recite more Qur&#8217;an after rising from Sujud-ul-Tilawah and before bending for Ruku`; but there is nothing wrong if they do.</p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><b>Some people believe that it is not a requirementto be in a state of Taharah (ritual purification) and face the Qiblah (Ka`bah-direction faced in Prayer)when performing Sujud-ul-Tilawah (Prostration of Recitation), while others say that it is. Which opinion is correct?</b></span></p>



<p>Some scholars consider Sujud-ul-Tilawah a Salah (Prayer) and, on the basis of this opinion, stipulate the conditions of Taharah, facing the Qiblah, Takbir (saying: &#8220;Allahu Akbar [Allah is the Greatest]&#8221;) when prostrating and upon rising from Sujud, and offering Taslim (salutation of peace ending the Prayer). Other scholars consider it an act of `Ibadah (worship), yet not similar to Salah, and therefore do not deem the abovementioned conditions &#8211; such as Taharah, facing the Qiblah, and the other conditions &#8211; necessary. This is the preponderant opinion, as we do not have any evidence supporting the necessity of meeting these conditions. However, whenever it is possible to face the Qiblah or be ritually pure when performing Sujud-ul-Tilawah, this is preferred, to avoid the divergent opinions of scholars.</p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><b>What is the Du`a&#8217; (supplication) that should be said in Sujud-ul-Tilawah?</b></span></p>



<p>The Du`a&#8217; that should be said is the same as that said in Sujud during Salah.</p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><b>Is it permissible for a menstruating woman to do the Sujud-ul-Tilawah (Prostration of Recitation) and the Sujud-ul-Shukr (Prostration of Thankfulness to Allah)?&nbsp;If it is not permissible, can she glorify Allah verbally (by saying: &#8220;Subhana Allah [Glory be to Allah]&#8221;) when hearing Ayat-ul-Sujud (Qur’anic verses of Prostration)?</b></span></p>



<p><b>Firstly:&nbsp;</b>When a woman is allowed to recite the Qur&#8217;an, she is permitted to do the Sujud-ul-Tilawah, whether she listens to it or recites it.The soundest opinion is that it is permissible for a woman to recite from memory, but not from the Mus-haf (copy of the Qur&#8217;an), and she is permitted to prostrate, because it is not a Salah (prayer), but a way of showing submissiveness to Allah and an act of worship, like Dhikr (Remembrance of Allah).</p>



<p><b style="font-size: 1rem">Secondly:&nbsp;</b><span style="font-size: 1rem">It is not conditional for a reciter or a listener to be in a state of Taharah (ritual purification) to perform Sujud-ul-Tilawah or Sujud-ul-Shukr, because they do not have the same ruling of Salah.</span></p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><b>Is it permissible for a woman reciting the Qur&#8217;an to prostrate upon coming across one of Ayat-ul-Sujud (Qur’anic verses of Prostration) while she is not wearing Khimar (veil covering to the waist)?</b></span></p>



<p>It is better that her head be covered when she prostrates, but hopefully it is not wrong if she performs Sujud-ul-Tilawah (Prostration of Recitation) without covering her head, because Sujud-ul-Tilawah does not have the same ruling as Salah (Prayer). Rather, Sujud-ul-Tilawah is a way of showing submission to Allah (Glorified be He) and a means of approach, similar to reciting Adhkar (invocations and remembrances said at certain times on a regular basis) and performing other righteous works.</p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><b>What is the ruling on passing in front of a worshiper who is performing Sujud-ul-Tilawah (Prostration of Recitation)?</b></span></p>



<p>There is nothing wrong in this.</p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><strong>Sajdatut-Tilawah is a Sunnah</strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><strong>Question</strong>:&nbsp;If I come across a Verse in which there is a prostration when I am reciting the Quran at my desk, or when I am teaching the students, or in any place, should I perform Sajdatut-Tilawah, or not? And is the prostration for the reciter and the listener both?</span></p>



<p><strong>Answer</strong>:&nbsp;Sajdatut-Tilawah is a Sunnah for the reciter and for the listener and it is not an obligation, nor is it prescribed for the listener except in following of the reciter.</p>



<p>So if you recite a Verse in which there is a prostration in your office or the place of instruction, it is lawful for you to make prostration and it is prescribed for the students to prostrate with you, because they are the listeners. And if you do not observe the prostration, there is no objection.</p>



<p>Shaykh `Abdul-`Azeez Bin Baz<br />Fatawa Islamiyah Vol. 2 Page 282, Darussalam English Publication</p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><b>Q: What are the Ayahs (Qur’anic verses) requiring prostration when recited and which of them are obligatory?&nbsp;( alifta Link&nbsp;<a href="http://www.alifta.net/fatawa/fatawaDetails.aspx?languagename=en&amp;BookID=14&amp;View=Page&amp;PageNo=1&amp;PageID=4882" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here</a>)</b></span></p>



<p><strong>Answer from Shaykh Ibn Baz:</strong></p>



<p>Any Sujud-ul-Tilawah (Prostration of Recitation) is Sunnah (supererogatory act of worship following the example of the Prophet) and is not obligatory.</p>



<p>There are <strong>fifteen prostrations of recitation in the Qur&#8217;an,</strong> according to the correct opinion of scholars: one at the end of Surah Al-A`raf, one in Surah Al-Ra`d, one in Surah Al-Nahl, one in Surah Al-Isra&#8217;, one in Surah Maryam, two in Surah Al-Hajj, one in Surah Al-Furqan, one in Surah Al-Naml, one in Surah Al-Sajdah, one in Surah Sad,&nbsp;one in Surah Fussilat, one at the end of Surah Al-Najm, one in Surah Al-Inshiqaq that begins with:&nbsp;<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0"/><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Inshiqaq, 84: 1" target="_blank" name="Whentheheavenissplitasunder"></a><span style="color: #99cc00">When the heaven is split asunder</span>,&nbsp;and the last one in Surah Al-`Alaq that begins with:&nbsp;<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0"/><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-`Alaq, 96: 1" target="_blank" name="Read!IntheNameofyourLord"></a><span style="color: #99cc00">Read! In the Name of your Lord</span>&nbsp;These are fifteen positions for prostration.</p>



<p>It is an act of the Sunnah to prostrate upon reciting them and if one does not prostrate, there is no sin, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) read Surah Al-Najm at times and did not offer Sujud (prostration). This indicated that Sujud-ul-Tilawah is not obligatory.<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">&nbsp;`Umar&nbsp;</span>(may Allah be pleased with him) also said: &#8220;<strong>Allah has not made Sujud-ul-Tilawah obligatory; only if we want to</strong>.&#8221; This shows that whoever prostrates is rewarded and whoever does not prostrate is absolved.</p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><strong>The Ruling on reciting the Verses of Prostration in the Quiet Prayers</strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><strong>Question</strong>:&nbsp;What is the ruling on reciting a Verse in which there is a prostration in the quiet prayers, such as Zuhr prayer or Asr prayer?</span></p>



<p>Answer:&nbsp;It is disliked for the Imam to recite a Verse of prostration in the quiet prayers, because he has no alternative in that case but either to prostrate for it or not. If he does not do so, he is abandoning a Sunnah, and if he does so, he will cause confusion in the minds of the worshippers. Therefore it is better to avoid the cause of such confusion. But if he does recite it, he should not prostrate, so as not to confuse the worshippers.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">[45] وأن القرآن كلام الله‏.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">[45]    And that the Qur.aan is the Speech of Allaah. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [45]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After you have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) in Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and you have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) in His Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam,</em> then, you have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) that the Qur.aan is the Speech of Allaah; because this is what the Messenger of Allaah <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> came with, and Allaah sent down the Qur.aan to him.  And this Qur.aan is not from the speech of Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> nor is it from the speech of Jibreel; rather, it is just the Speech of Allaah, the Mighty and the Majestic.  Allaah spoke with it, and Jibreel took it from Allaah, and the Prophet <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> took it from Jibreel <em>`alahis-salaam</em>, and the Ummah (this nation) took it from the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is the Speech of Allaah; it originated from Him, He the One free of all imperfections.  Jibreel did not take it from <em>Al-Law<u>h</u> Al-Ma<u>h</u>foo<u>z</u></em> (اللوح المحفوظ<em> – </em>the Preserved Tablet) as the people of misguidance say.  And it is not from the speech of Jibreel nor Mu<u>h</u>ammad; rather, it is from the Speech of the Lord of the whole of creation.  And as for Jibreel and Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em>`alayhima<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>, then those two were Messengers who conveyed from Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.  For speech is said by, and attributed to, the one who initially spoke it; not the one who said it only as one conveying and transmitting it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, those who say that Jibreel took it from the Preserved Tablet or who say that Allaah created it within something and then Jibreel took it from that thing, then whoever says this is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) in Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, who has disbelieved with <em>kufr</em> which takes them out of the Religion, as is the saying of the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> and the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> and those who follow their way.  So it (the Qur.aan) is the Speech of Allaah – its letters and its meanings; Allaah spoke with it as He wished.  So, we describe Allaah with the Attribute of His having spoken; and <em>Al-Kalaam</em> (Speech) is from Allaah’s Attributes which are actions (<em><u>s</u>ifaatihil-fi`liyyah</em>).  And the ‘how’ (<em>kayfiyyah</em>) or the manner in which He spoke with it, then in that regard we say, “Allaah knows best about that.” So, this is just like the rest of His Attributes, we have <em>eemaan</em> in them but we do not know how they are.  So the meaning is known but as for ‘how’, then that is unknown to us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>End of explanation of point [45]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">[46] منه بدأ بلا كيفية قولًا، وأنزله على رسوله وحيًا‏.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">[46]    It originated from Him as something spoken without us knowing how; and He sent it down to His Messenger as revelation.  </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [46]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: that the Qur.aan descended from Allaah; Allaah spoke with it and sent it down.  It did not descend from someone else besides Him, and it did not originate from someone other than Him.  It is not as they say, that it originated from Jibreel or from the Preserved Tablet or from somewhere in mid-air.  Rather, it began from Allaah and Jibreel heard it and he conveyed it to the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> as <em>wa<u>h</u>y</em> (revelation) and the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, he conveyed it to the people.  And if this Qur.aan had been from the speech of humans then someone from the people would have been able to bring a <em>soorah</em> the like of it.  So, since they are unable to do this, then this shows that it is indeed the Speech of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.  He the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And if you are in any doubt about that which We sent down to Our slave (Mu<u>h</u>ammad <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam), then bring a soorah like it and call your witnesses besides Allaah upon that, if you are truthful.  </em></span>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the One free from all imperfections and the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Or do they say, “He forged it”?  Say, “Then bring ten soorahs which are forged like it.” </span></em>(Soorah Hood (11), <em>aayah </em>13)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah rendered them incapable of doing that, even though they were Arabs and eloquent in the language.  And the Qur.aan is in the language of the Arabs and is in the letters which they spoke with, and they were eager to oppose the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam;</em> and if it was within their ability to resist and oppose this Qur.aan, they would not have saved any efforts to do so.  So when they were unable to do that, then this shows that it is indeed the Speech of Allaah, which is not approached by falsehood from in front nor from behind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>End of explanation of point [46]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">[47] وصدّقه المؤمنون على ذلك حقًا‏.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">[47]    And the believers attest to it as being the Truth upon that basis. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [47]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So those who have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) in Allaah and His Messenger, they believe that the Qur.aan is the Speech of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was just one who conveyed (the Message) from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the saying of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed, it is the Speech brought by an honourable Messenger (Jibreel `alayhis-salaam) possessing the strength to do whatever duty he is given; high in status with the Lord of the Tremendous Throne. </span></em>(Sooratut-Takweer (81), <em>aayaat </em>19-20)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is meant by its being ascribed to Jibreel, is from the aspect of conveying<em>;</em> since it is not possible that this Qur.aan is from the Speech of Allaah <em>and</em> from the speech of Jibreel.  Speech does not come except from one; so it is not possible to describe it as being the Speech of more than one.  And its being ascribed to Allaah is <em><u>h</u>aqeeqiyyah</em> (true and real) and as for its being ascribed to Jibreel, then (it is) from the aspect of conveying it (<em>tablee<u>gh</u></em> &#8211; تبليغ).  And in another <em>aayah</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed it is Speech conveyed by an honourable Messenger and it is not the speech of a poet; little it is that you believe.</span> </em>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>aaqqah (69), <em>aayaat </em>40-41)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.  So its being ascribed to him is an ascription of conveying (<em>tablee<u>gh</u></em>).  So He, the One free of all imperfections, sometimes ascribes it to Himself, and sometimes to Jibreel and sometimes to Mu<u>h</u>ammad (<em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>).  And one and the same speech cannot have been spoken by more than one.  So therefore, its being ascribed to Allaah is an ascription with regard to its origin and that it is His Speech, and its being ascribed to Jibreel and Mu<u>h</u>ammad is an ascription of conveying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [47] [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[1] Translator’s Side Point:</strong> In his larger explanation, Ibn Abil-`Izz goes into great detail in explaining these points and if you want to see the beauty of the saying of the people of Truth about the Qur.aan being the Speech of Allaah: that it originated from Him, He spoke with it and its Letters and Meanings are from His Speech; then if you read the explanation and his inclusion of eight (8) sayings of the people of deviation, then you will further see the beauty of this speech.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Points discussed in this excerpt include:</strong></span></p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>The Qur.aan is the Speech of Allaah and it originated from Him; it is not created.</li>
<li>One who says that Jibreel took it from the Preserved Tablet has disbelieved with <em>kufr</em> which takes him out of the religion.</li>
<li>It originated from Allaah as something spoken without us knowing how; and He sent it down to His Messenger as revelation.</li>
<li>If the Qur.aan was from the speech of humans then someone would have been able to bring a <em>soorah</em> the like of it. But they cannot; so this shows that it is indeed the Speech of Allaah.</li>
<li>Jibreel and Mu<u>h</u>ammad `<em>alayhimas-salaam</em> were just Messengers who conveyed the Message (Qur.aan) from Allaah.</li>
<li>The same speech cannot have been spoken by more than one.</li>
<li>When Allaah mentions: <strong>“…Speech brought by an honorable Messenger” </strong>and<strong> “…Speech conveyed by an honorable Messenger”</strong>, this ascription to Jibreel and Mu<u>h</u>ammad `<em>alayhimas-salaam</em> is an ascription of conveying and not of having originally spoken with the Speech.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taimiyyah, may Allāh have mercy on him, described a <strong>29 day schedule</strong> for completing recitation of the Qur&#8217;ān closer to the way the Companions did that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8220;&#8230;Division by complete surahs takes precedence over division by parts [based on letter count].&#8221; (412)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the great advantages of division by complete surahs, he mentioned (414):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">· Reciting speech whose parts are connected, one part with another;<br />
· Beginning [one&#8217;s daily recitation] with that which Allāh began a surah with;<br />
· Finishing with that which He finished with;<br />
· Completing what was intended [to be completed] from every surah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The chart in Arabic below [checked but not produced by me], shows Ibn Taimiyyah&#8217;s recommended schedule for a <strong>29 day</strong> completion.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Source for the Below</strong>: Tafseer ibn Kathir , Surah Al Imran , Darussalam eng Publication</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">It is He Who has sent down to you the Book. In it are verses that are entirely clear, they are the foundations of the Book; and others not entirely clear. So as for those in whose hearts there is a deviation (from the truth) they follow (only) that which is not entirely clear thereof, seeking Al-Fitnah, and seeking its Ta&#8217;wil, but none knows its Ta&#8217;wil except Allah. And those who are firmly grounded in knowledge say: &#8220;We believe in it; all of it is from our Lord.&#8221; And none receive admonition except men of understanding.)  (They say): &#8220;Our Lord! Let not our hearts deviate (from the truth) after You have guided us, and grant us mercy from You. Truly, You are the Bestower.&#8221; </span></em>(Surah Al Imran Verse 7-8)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Mutashabihat and Muhkamat Ayat </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah states that in the Qur&#8217;an, there are Ayat that are Muhkamat, entirely clear and plain, and these are the foundations of the Book which are plain for everyone. And there are Ayat in the Qur&#8217;an that are Mutashabihat not entirely clear for many, or some people. So those who refer to the Muhkam Ayat to understand the Mutashabih Ayat, will have acquired the correct guidance, and vice versa. This is why Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(They are the foundations of the Book),</strong> meaning, they are the basis of the Qur&#8217;an, and should be referred to for clarification, when warranted,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And others not entirely clear)</strong> as they have several meanings, some that agree with the Muhkam and some that carry other literal indications, although these meaning might not be desired.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muhkamat are the Ayat that explain the abrogating rulings, the allowed, prohibited, laws, limits, obligations and rulings that should be believed in and implemented. As for the Mutashabihat Ayat, they include the abrogated Ayat, parables, oaths, and what should be believed in, but not implemented.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar commented on,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(In it are verses that are entirely clear)</strong> as &#8220;Containing proof of the Lord, immunity for the servants and a refutation of opponents and of falsehood. They cannot be changed or altered from what they were meant for.&#8221; He also said, &#8220;As for the unclear Ayat, they can (but must not) be altered and changed, and this is a test from Allah to the servants, just as He tested them with the allowed and prohibited things. So these Ayat must not be altered to imply a false meaning or be distorted from the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(So as for those in whose hearts there is a deviation)</strong> meaning, those who are misguided and deviate from truth to falsehood,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(they follow that which is not entirely clear thereof)</strong> meaning, they refer to the Mutashabih, because they are able to alter its meanings to conform with their false interpretation since the wordings of the Mutashabihat encompass such a wide area of meanings. As for the Muhkam Ayat, they cannot be altered because they are clear and, thus, constitute unequivocal proof against the misguided people. This is why Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(seeking Al-Fitnah)</strong> meaning, they seek to misguide their following by pretending to prove their innovation by relying on the Qur&#8217;an &#8212; the Mutashabih of it &#8212; but, this is proof against and not for them. For instance, Christians might claim that ﴿`Isa is divine because﴾ the Qur&#8217;an states that he is Ruhullah and His Word, which He gave to Mary, all the while ignoring Allah&#8217;s statements,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">(He ﴿`Isa﴾ was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him.)</span></em> ﴿43:59﴾, and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">(Verily, the likeness of `Isa before Allah is the likeness of Adam. He created him from dust, then (He) said to him: &#8220;Be!&#8221; and he was.)</span></em> ﴿3:59﴾.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are other Ayat that clearly assert that `Isa is but one of Allah&#8217;s creatures and that he is the servant and Messenger of Allah, among other Messengers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And seeking for its Ta&#8217;wil,)</strong> to alter them as they desire. Imam Ahmad recorded that `A&#8217;ishah said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah recited,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(It is He Who has sent down to you the Book. In it are verses that are entirely clear, they are the foundations of the Book; and others not entirely clear,)</strong>, until,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Men of understanding)</strong> and he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(When you see those who argue in it (using the Mutashabihat), then they are those whom Allah meant. Therefore, beware of them.)&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari recorded a similar Hadith in the Tafsir of this Ayah ﴿3:7﴾, as did Muslim in the book of Qadar (the Divine Will) in his Sahih, and Abu Dawud in the Sunnah section of his Sunan, from `A&#8217;ishah; &#8220;The Messenger of Allah recited this Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(It is He Who has sent down to you the Book. In it are verses that are entirely clear,)</strong> until,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And none receive admonition except men of understanding.)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(When you see those who follow what is not so clear of the Qur&#8217;an, then they are those whom Allah described, so beware of them.)&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the wording recorded by Al-Bukhari.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Only Allah Knows the True Ta&#8217;wil (Interpretation) of the Mutashabihat </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(But none knows its Ta&#8217;wil except Allah.)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, as preceded in what has been reported from Ibn `Abbas, &#8220;Tafsir is of four types: Tafsir that the Arabs know in their language; Tafsir that no one is excused of being ignorant of; Tafsir that the scholars know; and Tafsir that only Allah knows.&#8221; Scholars of Qur&#8217;an recitation have different opinions about pausing at Allah&#8217;s Name in this Ayah. This stop was reported from `A&#8217;ishah, `Urwah, Abu Ash-Sha`tha&#8217; and Abu Nahik.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some pause after reciting,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And those who are firmly grounded in knowledge)</strong> saying that the Qur&#8217;an does not address the people with what they cannot understand. Ibn Abi Najih said that Mujahid said that Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;I am among those who are firmly grounded in its Ta&#8217;wil interpretation.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah supplicated for the benefit of Ibn `Abbas,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Allah! Bestow on him knowledge in the religion and teach him the Ta&#8217;wil (interpretation).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ta&#8217;wil has two meanings in the Qur&#8217;an, the true reality of things, and what they will turn out to be. For instance, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And he said: &#8220;O my father! This is the Ta&#8217;wil of my dream aforetime!&#8221;.) ﴿12:100﴾, and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Await they just for it&#8217;s Ta&#8217;wil On the Day (Day of Resurrection) it&#8217;s Ta&#8217;wil is finally fulfillled.)(7:53) refers to the true reality of Resurrection that they were told about. If this is the meaning desired in the Ayah above ﴿3:7﴾, then pausing after reciting Allah&#8217;s Name is warranted, because only Allah knows the true reality of things. In this case, Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And those who are firmly grounded in knowledge)</strong> is connected to His statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(say: &#8220;We believe in it&#8221;)</strong> If the word Ta&#8217;wil means the second meaning, that is, explaining and describing, such as what Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>((They said): &#8220;Inform us of the Ta&#8217;wil of this&#8221;)</strong> meaning its explanation, then pausing after reciting,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And those who are firmly grounded in knowledge)</strong> is warranted. This is because the scholars have general knowledge in, and understand what they were addressed with, even though they do not have knowledge of the true reality of things. Therefore, Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(say: &#8220;We believe in it&#8221;)</strong> describes the conduct of the scholars. Similarly, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">(And your Lord comes, and the angels, in rows.)</span></em> ﴿89:22﴾ means, your Lord will come, and the angels will come in rows.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement that the knowledgeable people proclaim,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(We believe in it)</strong> means, they believe in the Mutashabih.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(all of it is from our Lord)</strong> meaning, both the Muhkam and the Mutashabih are true and authentic, and each one of them testifies to the truth of the other. This is because they both are from Allah and nothing that comes from Allah is ever met by contradiction or discrepancy. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">(Do they not then consider the Qur&#8217;an carefully Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely have found therein many a contradiction.)</span></em> ﴿4:82﴾.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said in his Ayah ﴿3:7﴾,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And none receive admonition except men of understanding. )</strong> meaning, those who have good minds and sound comprehension, understand, contemplate and comprehend the meaning in the correct manner. Further, Ibn Al-Mundhir recorded in his Tafsir that Nafi` bin Yazid said, &#8220;Those firmly grounded in knowledge are those who are modest for Allah&#8217;s sake, humbly seek His pleasure, and do not exaggerate regarding those above them, or belittle those below them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said that they supplicate to their Lord,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Our Lord! Let not our hearts deviate (from the truth) after You have guided us.)</strong> meaning, &#8220;Do not deviate our hearts from the guidance after You allowed them to acquire it. Do not make us like those who have wickedness in their hearts, those who follow the Mutashabih in the Qur&#8217;an. Rather, make us remain firmly on Your straight path and true religion.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And grant us from Ladunka)</strong> meaning, from You,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Mercy)</strong> with which You make our hearts firm, and increase in our Faith and certainty,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Truly, You are the Bestower)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir recorded that Umm Salamah said that the Prophet used to supplicate,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O You Who changes the hearts, make my heart firm on Your religion.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then recited,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(&#8220;Our Lord! Let not our hearts deviate (from the truth) after You have guided us, and grant us mercy from You. Truly, You are the Bestower.&#8221;)</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Source</strong>: ad-Dawal ila-Allah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a very good reason why Ramadaan, out of all the months in the Islaamic calendar was chosen by Allaah to be the month of Fasting. That reason? It was in this month, on the Night of Decree (Laylatul-Qadr), that the Qur&#8217;aan was revealed to mankind.[1] Allaah, the Most High says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The month of Ramadaan in which was revealed the Qur&#8217;aan, a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the Furqaan (criterion) [between right and wrong]. So whoever of you sights [the crescent on the first night of] the month [of Ramadaan], he must fast that month.”</strong></span> [Soorah al-Baqarah (2):185]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah honoured this month by revealing the Qur&#8217;aan in it and it is because of this that He obligated fasting in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is also the month in which Jibreel (alayhi as-salaam) would come to meet the Prophet (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) every night in order to repeat the recitation of the Qur’aan with him. [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, the relationship between Ramadaan and the Qur’aan is very close, which is why Muslims worldwide turn to the Qur&#8217;aan with a heightened sense of vigour during this month.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Recitation Of The Qur’aan</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The main purpose of the Qur&#8217;aan is to be a source of guidance for mankind, leading those who cling to it from darkness into light, from misery to happiness and raising them from lowliness to a lofty station.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, another important feature of the Qur&#8217;aan is that its recitation is in itself a form of &#8216;ibadah&#8217; (worship). In fact the Qur&#8217;aan is defined as being the (uncreated) word of Allaah, sent down to Muhammad (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) the recitation of which is a form of worship” [3] a unique definition that can be applied to no other book, writing or statement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the very beginning of the Prophet’s Messenger-ship, great emphasis was placed on the recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan. The literal meaning of the word Qur&#8217;aan itself is &#8216;<strong>Reading</strong>&#8216; or &#8216;<strong>Recitation</strong>&#8216;. The first Ayah (verse) to be revealed on that momentous occasion where Jibreel (&#8216;alayhis salaam) came to Prophet Muhammad (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) whilst he was alone in the cave Hira was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Iqraa (Recite/Read), in the name of your lord who created you&#8230;”</strong></span> [Soorah al-Alaq (9): 1]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) himself strongly urged his companions to recite as much of the Qur&#8217;aan as possible. He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“whoever reads a single letter from Allah&#8217;s Book will receive a blessing (for each letter) and each blessing is worth ten times its value.”</strong></span> [4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the virtues and blessings of reciting the Book of Allaah are many. And by way of encouragement to all of us to spend time reciting and reflecting upon the Qur&#8217;aan, some of these virtues are listed below.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>1. It Will Come As An Intercessor On The Day Of Resurrection.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Recite the Qur&#8217;aan, for verily on the Day of Resurrection it will act as an intercessor for those who recite it”</span> </strong>[5]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the day when neither our family nor our wealth will be of any benefit to us, this Qur&#8217;aan will beseech Allaah on behalf of those who recite it frequently. Allaah will give it a speech and Allaah is able to do all things &#8211; and it will say to Allaah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I prevented him from sleep at night, so accept my intercession for him”</strong></span> [6]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And its intercession will be accepted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>2. Tranquility Descends.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al Baraa reported that a man was reciting Sooratul-Kahf and there was a horse tied with two ropes at his side, when a cloud overshadowed him. As it began to come nearer and nearer his horse began to take fright from it. He went and mentioned that to the Prophet (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) in the morning, who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“It was tranquility [as-Sakeenah] which came down at the recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan.”</strong></span> [7]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This shows us that the tranquility and the calmness which results from the recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan is not something abstract, but something very real which permeated the whole atmosphere so that even the animals can imbibe it. This &#8216;<strong>Sakeenah</strong>&#8216; (tranquility) which descends upon the reciter is accompanied by Angels who assemble to listen to the Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Companion Usaid ibn Hudair (Radiya ‘Llahu &#8216;anhu) mentioned to the Prophet (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) that once when he was reciting the Qur&#8217;aan at night while his horse was tied beside him. The horse suddenly became uneasy and started jumping. When he stopped reciting, the horse became quiet. When he resumed reciting, the horse became uneasy again. After repeating this a few times, he stopped reciting and looked up. He was amazed to see right above him something that looked like a big cloud of bright lamps rising up in the sky. The next morning, he told the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) about this, and the Prophet (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) explained to him that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Those were Angels who came to listen to your reading. Had you kept on reciting until morning, they would have remained visible for the people to see them!”</strong> </span>[8]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>3. It Will Be A Shade On The Day Of Resurrection.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Recite the two bright ones, Soorah al-Baqarah and Soorah Aal-e lmraan, for on the day of Resurrection they will come as two clouds, or two shades or two flocks of birds in ranks, pleading for those who recite them”</strong> </span>[9]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are well aware that on a hot summer’s day when we are out in a scorching sun, the thing we appreciate most is a tree or some sort of canopy, beneath which we can shade ourselves. Imagine how much more we will be pinning for a shade on the Day of Resurrection when&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“the people will be submerged in perspiration according to their deeds, some up to half of their knees, some up to the waist and some would have a bridle of perspiration up to their mouths”</strong></span> [10].</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We seek refuge in Allah from the terrors of this awful Day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are just some of the blessings awaiting those who recite the Qur&#8217;aan as it should be recited, bringing with them a receptive heart. [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, these blessings and rewards are only multiplied for those who struggle in their recitation, for the Prophet (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8221;One who is skilled in it, ‘the Qur&#8217;aan’ is associated with the noble upright, recording Angels, and he who falters when he recites the Qur&#8217;aan and finds it difficult, he will have a double reward.”</strong> </span>[12]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Of course it goes without saying, that although great emphasis and encouragement has been made to recite the Qur&#8217;aan, this is not the goal in itself. Recitation of the Book of Allaah is just a means through which we can absorb its message and act on whatever that messages entails. However, reciting with the meaning is superior to merely reading as the Prophet (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) explained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The example of a believer who recites the Qur&#8217;aan and acts on it, is like an orange which tastes nice and smells nice. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the example of the believer who does not recite the Qur&#8217;aan but acts on it is like a date that tastes sweet but has no smell. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the example of the hypocrite who recites the Qur&#8217;aan is like sweet Basil which smells good but tastes bitter. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the example of a hypocrite who does not recite the Qur&#8217;aan is like a Coelacanth which tastes bitter and has a bad smell”</strong></span>. [13]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Companion Of Life:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this month of Ramadaan, let us use it to habituate ourselves into spending a daily period with the Qur&#8217;aan &#8211; reciting, memorizing and acting upon it. Because we should know that no people are better and more worthy of our envy than the companions of the Qur&#8217;aan,[14] which is why the most striking and outstanding character of every pious person of knowledge is their love and attachment towards the Qur&#8217;aan. There is no man or woman who is considered to be righteous, except he or she is known to possess this noble quality. So when Aa’ishah was asked to describe the best of all mankind, the Prophet (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) she could find no more a suitable description other than to say that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“His character was the Qur&#8217;aan”.</span></strong> [15]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And among the inheritors of the Prophet (i.e. the scholars) We have the example of lmaam Maalik, whose sister was asked:<strong> “What did Maalik occupy himself with in his House?”</strong> She replied,<strong> “The Mushaf (i.e the Qur&#8217;aan), reciting.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dear readers, no person can afford to remain ignorant or neglectful of the Qur&#8217;aan. Reading it regularly, sincerely not ritualistically, to derive guidance from it and adopt the company of those who make mention of it in their gatherings. Make the Qur&#8217;aan your constant companion, not just for Ramadaan, but for life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Editors Note: There were two distinct revelations of the Qur’aan. The first is the one being alluded to here where Allaah caused the whole Qur’aan to descend at one time from the <strong>Protected Tablet (al-Lawh al-Mahfooth)</strong> on which it was written to a station in the lowest heaven referred to as <strong>“Bayt al-‘Izzah” (The House of Honour or Power)</strong>. This occurred in Lailatul-Qadr. The second is the continuous segmented revelation to the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) via Jibreel (‘Alayh is-Salam) up until just before his (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) death.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] There are many virtues attached to the recitation of certain parts of the Qur&#8217;aan, for example; <strong>Ayat-Al-Kursee [(2):225] is a protection against Shaitaan (Bukhari), Soorah al- Naas and Soorah al-Falaq protect against the evil eye and is a cure (Muslim).</strong></p>

The Prophet (Salla ’Llahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Do not wish for the likes of anyone except two: a man upon whom Allaah bestowed knowledge of the Book [the Qur’aan], who stands up [in salaah (prayer)] and recites it during the hours of the night, and a man upon whom Allaah bestowed wealth, and he spends it in charity during the hours of the night and the hours of the day.”</span> </strong>[Recorded by al-Bukhaaree in Kitaab Fadaa’il Al-Qur’aan (Book on the Virtues of the Qur’aan) no. 5025; also recorded by Muslim in Kitaab Salat Al-Musaafireen (Book on the Prayer of the Travellers) 815/266]</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333333;">مَّا فَرَّطْنَا فِي الْكِتَابِ مِن شَيْءٍ</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>“We have not neglected anything in the Book.”</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#333333;"> [Surah Al-An’aam: 38]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;">And the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <strong>“Verily this Qur’aan – part of it is in the Hand of Allaah and part of it is in your hands. So hold fast onto it, for you will never go astray nor will you ever be ruined after it.”</strong> [4]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;">We would like your comments on this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[2] Answer:</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Allaah’s saying: <strong>“We have not neglected anything in the Book”</strong>, what is meant by the word “<strong>Book</strong>” here is the Preserved Tablet and not the Noble Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for Allaah’s statement: <strong>“And We have explained everything in detail with a full explanation”</strong>, if you attach what was explained previously to the Noble Qur’aan, then it becomes certain that Allaah has indeed explained everything in detail, however with another provision. You are aware that an explanation may at times be general, such as when one places general rules under which exist many particulars the likes of which cannot be confined due to their large number. So by the Wise Legislator placing well known rules for these many particulars, the meaning of the noble ayah becomes apparent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The explanation may also be detailed, and this is what is obvious from this ayah as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“I have not left behind anything that Allaah commanded me with except that I have ordered you to do it. And I have not left behind anything that Allaah forbade me from except that I have forbidden you from it.”</strong> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the explanation may at times be with rules, which many particulars (and details) fall under. And at other times it may be in such detail in terms of the vocabulary of the acts of worship and laws that it does not require being referenced to any of these rules.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among the rules that numerous branches fall under – and which show the greatness of Islaam and the vast scope of Islaam in legislating – for example, are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet’s صلى الله عليه وسلم statement: <strong>“There is no harming (of oneself) or others.”</strong> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet’s صلى الله عليه وسلم statement: <strong>“Every intoxicant is alcohol and every alcohol is unlawful.”</strong> [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his صلى الله عليه وسلم statement: <strong>“Every innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance is in the Hellfire.”</strong> [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are rules and generalizations that do not exclude anything related to harming of one’s self or harming of one’s wealth, with respect to the first hadeeth, nor does it exclude anything related to that which intoxicates, with respect to the second hadeeth, whether the intoxicant is derived from grapes, which is the most popular form, or from corn or from any other substance. So long as the product is an intoxicant, it is unlawful (Haraam).</p>
<p><em><span style="color:#808080;">[<strong>Note</strong>: Read </span><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2016/07/16/the-need-for-the-sunnah-in-order-to-understand-the-quraan/">The Need for the Sunnah in order to Understand the Qur’aan </a><span style="color:#808080;">– Shaykh al Albaani]</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same goes for the third hadeeth – it is not possible to take into account the number of innovations due to their large amount. It is not possible to account for all of them. However in spite of this, this hadeeth – even though brief in size – states with all clarity: <strong>“Every innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance is in the Hellfire.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a detailed statement but with rules.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the laws that you are aware of, they are explained in detail by words that have been mentioned in the Sunnah in most cases and at times they are mentioned in the noble Qur’aan as is the case with the laws of inheritance, for example.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the hadeeth that was mentioned in the question, then it is an authentic hadeeth, and acting upon it is what we should try to adhere to as stated in the hadeeth in which the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <strong>“I have left two things amongst you by which you will never go astray so long as you hold steadfast onto them: The Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger.”</strong> [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So holding steadfast onto the Rope of Allaah – which is in our hands – refers to acting upon the Sunnah, which explains the noble Qur’aan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>A Weak Hadeeth from Mu’aadh regarding Opinion, and what is Rejected from it:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Before I finish my talk, I feel that it is necessary for me to direct the attention of the brothers in attendance to a famous hadeeth, which seldom is missing from the books on the Principles of Fiqh. I will mention it because <strong>it is weak</strong>, from the perspective of its chain of narration as well as it being in contradiction with what I spoke about in this talk, which was <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>the lack of there being any distinction between the Qur’aan and the Sunnah when it comes to deriving Laws, and the obligation of accepting these two sources together</strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed it is the hadeeth of Mu’aadh bin Jabal radhi Allaahu anhu who reported that the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said to him when he sent him to Yemen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“With what will you judge by?” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>He said: “By the Book of Allaah.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>He صلى الله عليه وسلم said: “And if you don’t find (the answer in) it?” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>He said: “Then by the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>He replied: “And if you don’t find (the answer in) it?” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>He said: “I will strive to form my own opinion.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>So he صلى الله عليه وسلم said: “All praise be to Allaah who guided the messenger of Allaah’s Messenger to that which Allaah’s Messenger loves.”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the weakness of its chain, then this is not the place to discuss it now. But I clarified this exhaustively, perhaps the likes of which was not undertaken in the past, in (my book) the <strong>“Silsilah”</strong> (of weak hadeeth) I mentioned previously. [4] But suffice it to say now that the Ameer-ul-Mu’mineen in Hadeeth, Imaam Al-Bukhaaree, said about this hadeeth that it was “rejected.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">So having said this, it is now possible for me to begin explaining the contradiction it </span></strong><strong><span style="color:#993300;">poses, which I stated earlier. So I say:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth establishes a methodology of ruling for the judge, based on three stages. He is not permitted to seek a ruling from his opinion unless after he acknowledges he can’t find it in the Sunnah. Nor is he allowed to derive a ruling from the Sunnah until after he establishes he can’t find it in the Qur’aan. With respect to the opinion, this method (of deriving a ruling) is valid and correct according to all of the scholars, which is why they would say: “When the narration is mentioned, the opinion is nullified.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, with respect to the Sunnah, this method is not correct, because the Sunnah determines and explains the Book of Allaah. So it is obligatory for one to look for the ruling in the Sunnah, even if he thinks that it exists in the Qur’aan, based on what we stated previously. So the Sunnah with respect to the Qur’aan is not like the opinion with respect to the Sunnah. No, definitely not. Rather we must consider the Qur’aan and the Sunnah as one source, there being no distinction between them at all. This is as has been indicated in the sayings of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Indeed, I was given the Qur’aan and something similar to it, along with it”</span></strong> – meaning the Sunnah – and <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“They will not be separated from one another until they return to the Fountain.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this dividing them into categories, mentioned in the hadeeth, is not correct, because it necessitates that they are separate from one another. And this is false, as I have explained previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] It is found under number 885 of Silsilat-ul-Ahaadeeth ad-Da’eefah. We hope that the volume that includes it will be printed soon, in shaa Allaah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>[4] Question:</b> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Noble Shaikh, there are many books of tafseer, so which tafseer do you advise (us) to read. May Allaah reward you well.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[4] Answer: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The books of Tafseer are many, all praise be to Allaah. This is from the blessings of Allaah. However, these books of Tafseer vary – amongst them are those that are long and in depth and those that are short and abridged, as well as those that are free from errors and those that contain errors, particularly in matters of Creed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What I advise my brothers from amongst the youth to read is the <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Tafseer of Ibn Katheer</span></strong> for it is the greatest of tafseers and the one that uses the best way and method (for interpreting the Qur’aan) in spite of it being abridged. This is since he (i.e. Ibn Katheer) has interpreted the Qur’aan using the Qur’aan first, then by using the Prophetic Sunnah, then with the statements of the Salaf, and finally by using the requisites of Arabic, the language in which it was revealed. So it is a precise and reliable tafseer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also the <strong><span style="color:#000000;">tafseer of Al-Baghawee</span></strong> and the <strong><span style="color:#000000;">tafseer of Ibn Jareer At-Tabaree</span></strong>, which is a comprehensive and all-inclusive tafseer. These tafseer books are trustworthy. There is also the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>tafseer of Shaikh ‘Abdur-Rahmaan As-Sa’adee</strong></span>, which is an excellent tafseer using simple expressions which contain tremendous knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the remaining tafseer books, they are good in some aspects, however they have errors in them, especially in matters of Creed. It is not proper for anyone to read these types of tafseer books except for the person that is proficient in knowledge to the point that he is able to take the good from it and avoid its errors. But as for the beginner, he is not able to do this, so he must take from the tafseer books that do not contain dangers and errors, such as the Tafseer of Ibn Katheer, the Tafseer of Al-Baghawee and the Tafseer of Al-Haafidh Ibn Jareer. All of these books of tafseer are valuable and excellent, all praise be to Allaah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Question: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What is your advice to the youth concerning the simplest way to memorize the Book of Allaah?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur’aan is simple and easy to memorize. Allaah says: <b>“And We have indeed made the Qur’aan easy to understand and remember, so is there anyone who will remember it?”</b> [Surah Al-Qamar: 17]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The problem lies in a person’s determination and the truthfulness of his intention. So if a person has true determination and a strong interest in the Qur’aan, Allaah will facilitate and make easy his memorization of it. </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are also some other things one could do to help in memorizing the Qur’aan such as allotting a specific suitable time every day for attending classes with one who teaches the Qur’aan in the masjid. All praise be to Allaah, the teachers today are many. You will not find a neighborhood except that amongst them there lives one who teaches the Qur’aan. This is a great opportunity that didn’t exist in previous times. So a person should choose anyone of the many gatherings or anyone of the many teachers present today and constantly attend these gatherings/sittings with a teacher daily until he completes the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should also constantly repeat over and over again what you recite, until it becomes firmly established in your heart and mind. You must also act upon (what you learn from) the Book of Allaah, for that is the greatest means of learning the Qur’aan. Allaah says: <b>“So be dutiful to Allaah and Allaah will teach you. And Allaah is the All-Knower of everything.” </b>[Surah Al-Baqarah: 282]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Need for the Sunnah in order to Understand the Qur’aan, and Examples for that:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“The male and the female thief – cut off their hands”</strong></span> [Surah Al-Maa’idah: 38] is a good example of this, for the word <strong>“thief”</strong> mentioned in it, is absolute, as is the case with the word “hand.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The verbal Sunnah explains the first of these two (words) and restricts it to mean just the thief that steals a quarter of a dinaar. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“There is no cutting off of the hand except in (cases where one steals) a quarter of a dinaar and more.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم explained the second (word) with his action or with the action of his Companions and his approving of that. This is since they would cut the hand of the thief off from the wrist, as is well known from the books of Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The verbal Sunnah also explains the <strong>“hand”</strong> that is mentioned in the verse concerning Tayammum:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Then wipe your faces and hands”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 43, Surah Al-Maa’idah: 6] in that it can also refer to the palm.<span style="line-height:1.5;">This is based on the Prophet’s saying: </span><span style="line-height:1.5;color:#000000;"><strong>“Tayammum is a tap (i.e. wipe) of the face and hands.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Reported by Ahmad, Al-Bukhaaree, Muslim and others from the narration of ‘Ammaar bin Yaasir radhi Allaahu anhu] </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Below are some other verses from the Qur’aan that cannot be understood correctly, according to what Allaah intended, unless by way of the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“It is those who believe and mix not their Faith with dhulm (wrong) – for them (only) there is security and they are the guided ones.”</strong></span> [Surah Al-An’aam: 82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Companions of Allaah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم understood the phrase <strong>“with dhulm (wrong)”</strong> according to its general sense, which includes every wrong, even if it be small. This is why they had difficulty understanding the verse and so they said: “O Messenger of Allaah! Which one of us doesn’t mix their Faith with wrong?” So the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“It doesn’t mean that. It only means Shirk (here). Didn’t you hear Luqmaan say:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Verily Shirk is a great wrong?’</strong></span> [Surah Luqmaan: 13]”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Reported by Al-Bukhaaree, Muslim and others]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Allaah’s says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And when you travel in the land, there is no sin on you if you shorten your prayer, if you fear that the disbelievers may attack you.”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 101]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The literal wording of this verse necessitates that shortening the prayer while on a journey can only be done on the condition when one is in the state of fear. This is why some of the Companions asked Allaah’s Messenger: “So then why do we shorten the prayer when we are in a state of security?” He صلى الله عليه وسلم replied: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“This is a charity that Allaah has expended to you, so take His charity.”</strong> </span>[Reported by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Forbidden to you (for food) are: al-maytatah (dead animals), blood, the flesh of swine…”</strong></span> [Surah Al-Maa’idah: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But the verbal Sunnah explains that deceased locusts and fish, as well as liver and spleen (types) of blood are lawful. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Two types of deceased animals and two types of blood have been made lawful for us: locusts and sea fish [meaning all types of fish], and the liver and the spleen.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Reported by Al- Bayhaqee and others in marfoo’ and mawqoof form. The chain of the mawqoof narration is authentic and it takes on the ruling of being marfoo’ since it cannot be stated based on one’s mere opinion.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Say (O Muhammad): ‘I find not in that which has been inspired to me anything forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it, unless it be maytah (a dead animal) or blood poured forth (by slaughtering), or the flesh of swine (pork), for that surely is impure, or impious (unlawful) meat (of an animal) which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for other than Allaah…’”</span></strong> [Surah Al-An&#8217;aam: 145]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Sunnah came and forbade other things that haven’t been mentioned in this ayah, such as the Prophet’s صلى الله عليه وسلم saying: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Every predatory animal that has fangs and every bird that has claws is unlawful (for eating).”</span></strong> There are also other ahaadeeth on this subject that forbid other animals, such as what the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said on the Day of Khaybar: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Verily Allaah and His Messenger forbid you from (eating) domesticated donkeys, for they are impure.”</span></strong> [Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Say (O Muhammad): ‘Who has forbidden the adornment with clothes given by Allaah, which He has produced for his slaves, and the good (lawful) things from provision?’”</strong></span> [Surah Al-A&#8217;raaf: 32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But the Sunnah explains that there are certain types of adornments that are forbidden. It is authentically reported that the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم went out one day to meet his Companions holding silk in one hand and gold in the other, and said:<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> “These two things are unlawful for the males of my ummah, (but) lawful for the females.”</strong></span> [Reported by Al-Haakim who authenticated it] The ahaadeeth bearing this same understanding are many, well known and can be found in the two Saheeh collections as well as other collections.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many more examples like these (above) that are known to the people who have knowledge of Hadeeth and Fiqh. So from what has been stated previously, it should become clear to us, O brothers, the importance of the Sunnah in deriving Islamic laws. For indeed if we look back again at the examples I mentioned before, not to mention those that I didn’t mention, we will have certainty that there is no way to understand the noble Qur’aan, unless we understand it along with the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In the first example,</strong> the Companions understood the word <strong>“dhulm”</strong> mentioned in the ayah according to its literal meaning. This was even though they, may Allaah be pleased with them, were as Ibn Mas’ood said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The best of this ummah, possessing the most pious of hearts, profound in learning and the least of constraints.”</strong></span> But in spite of this, they erred with regard to understanding that. So if it were not for the Prophet refuting their error and guiding them to what was correct with regard to the meaning of “dhulm” – that it in fact meant Shirk here – we would have followed them upon their error. However, Allaah, Mighty and Majestic, saved us from that due to the grace of the Prophet’s guidance and Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And in the second example:</strong> if it weren’t for the afore-mentioned hadeeth, we would have remained in doubt, to say the least, regarding shortening the prayer while on a journey in the state of security. That is to say if we wouldn’t have already taken the view of making being in the state of fear a condition, as is literally stated in the ayah. This is also just what the Companions themselves understood (about the ayah) until they saw the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم shorten his prayer, and they shortened their prayer along with him, while they were in a state of security.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In the third example:</strong> If it weren’t for the hadeeth, we would have been forbidden from foods that were made lawful for us, such as (dead) locusts and fish, and liver and spleen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In the fourth example</strong>, if it weren’t for the hadeeth, which mentions some things (not mentioned in the ayah), we would have made lawful what Allaah had made forbidden through the tongue of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, such as predatory (fanged) animals and birds with claws.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The same goes for the fifth example,</strong> if it weren’t for the ahaadeeth reported in that regard, we would have made lawful that which Allaah made unlawful upon the tongue of the Prophet, such as silk and gold. This is why some of the Salaf used to say: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“The Sunnah judges upon the Book (i.e. Qur’aan).”</span></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Knowledge of Arabic is not sufficient for understanding the Qur’aan:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From what has been stated previously, it becomes clear that there is no way for anyone, even if he be a scholar of the Arabic Language and its disciplines, to understand the noble Qur’aan, without seeking assistance in that from the Prophet’s Sunnah in speech and action. This is since he will never be more knowledgeable of the language than the Companions of the Prophet, those who the Qur’aan was revealed to in their language. And (at that time) the language was not blemished with the errors of the non-Arabs and the slang of the common people, but in spite of that, they still erred in understanding these previously mentioned ayaat, when they relied on their knowledge of the language only.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So based on this, it is obvious that <strong>whenever a person is knowledgeable of the Sunnah, he will be more likely to understand the Qur’aan and extract rulings from it, than someone who is ignorant about it</strong>. So how about the one who doesn’t rely on it or reference it at all? This is why from the principles that have been agreed upon by the people of knowledge is: to interpret the Qur’aan with the Qur’aan and the Sunnah,1 and then the sayings of the Companions, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this, we become aware of the misguidance of the scholars of rhetoric, past and present, and their opposition to the Salaf, in their Creed, not to mention their rulings. And it is their remoteness from the Sunnah and their knowledge of it, and their making their intellects and desires as judges for themselves with regard to the verses concerning Allaah’s Attributes. What is better than what has been stated in Sharh Al- ‘Aqeedah At-Tahaawiyyah [of Ibn Abil-‘Izz Al-Hanafee] (pg. 212, 4th Edition):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“How can someone who didn’t learn from the Book and the Sunnah, but rather just learned it from the views of so and so, speak about the fundaments of the Religion! And if he claims that he is taking it from the Book of Allaah, then he is not taking the interpretation of the Book of Allaah from the ahaadeeth of the Messenger. He doesn’t look into it (i.e. the Sunnah), nor does he look at what the Companions or those who succeeded them in goodness said, which has been conveyed to us by way of reliable narrators chosen by the critics (i.e. hadeeth scholars). For indeed, they did not convey the arrangement of the Qur’aan only, but rather they conveyed the arrangement as well as the meanings. They would not learn the Qur’aan like the children do (today), rather they would learn it along with its meanings. And whoever does not follow their path, then he is speaking based on his opinion. And whoever speaks from his opinion, and from what he thinks Allaah’s Religion is, not getting that from the Book, he is in fact sinning (!), even if he may be correct. Whereas whoever takes from the Book and the Sunnah, he is rewarded even if he errs. However, if he is correct, his reward is multiplied.”</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said (pg. 217):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“So it is an obligation to completely submit to the Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم, follow his orders, and meet his reports with acceptance and firm belief, without contradicting that by false notions that we consider “reasonable” or that constitute a misconception and doubt. Or that we put before it the views of men and the rubbish held in their minds. So we must single the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم out with regard to making him the judge, submitting to him, obeying him and complying with him, just as we single out the One who sent him in worship, humility, submissiveness, repentance and reliance (to Him).”</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In summary:</strong> It is an obligation upon all of the Muslims to not differentiate between the Qur’aan and the Sunnah, with regard to the obligation of accepting both of them together and establishing Laws based on both of them. Indeed this is the guarantee that will prevent them from drifting to the right and the left, and from returning to deviation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم clearly stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“I have left two things for you, which you will never go astray so long as you adhere to them: The Book of Allaah and my Sunnah. These two will never separate from one another until they return to the Fountain.” </span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Maalik and Al-Haakim with a sound chain of narration]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] We do not say as is the custom amongst many of the people of knowledge: <strong>“We interpret the Qur’aan by the Qur’aan if there is no trace of it in the Sunnah, then we interpret it by the Sunnah.”</strong> This is due to what we will explain later on in the end of this treatise, when speaking about the (weak) hadeeth of Mu’aadh bin Jabal radhi Allaahu anhu.</p>

19 Ramaḍān 1437</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawzīyah – Allāh have mercy on him – said while describing the way of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم in reciting the Qurān:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People have differed as to which is best: tartīl (slower) recitation covering less (of the Qurān), or faster recitation with more covered; which of them is better? They had two opinions on this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Second Ayah: His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Had We sent down this Qur&#8217;an upon a mountain, you would surely have seen it humbling itself and rending asunder by the fear of Allah&#8221;</strong></span> (Al-Hashr 59:21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A mountain is among the hardest of what there is, the rocks by which the mountain becomes firm are exemplary in hardness. Allah, Exalted is He, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;When, after that, your hearts were hardened and became as stones or even worse in hardness&#8221;</strong></span> (Al- Baqara 2:74)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this Qur&#8217;an were to be sent down upon the mountain, you would surely see this mountain humbling itself and cleaving out of the fear of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Humbling&#8221; &#8211; that is, submissively.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from its severe fright of of Allah, &#8220;Rending asunder&#8221; it cleaves and tears apart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is sent down upon our hearts, and our hearts &#8211; except as Allah wills &#8211; contract and become hard, neither opening nor accepting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who believe, when the Ayat (of the Qur&#8217;an) are sent down to them, it increases their faith; but as for those who have a disease in their hearts; it adds filth to their filth; and it is Allah whose refuge is sought!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of that is that their hearts become more inflexible and hardened and it adds filth to their filth. We seek refuge in Allah from that</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this Qur&#8217;an were to be sent down to the mountain, it would cleave and humble itself due to the greatness of Allah&#8217;s Words sent down upon it</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this, there is evidence that the mountains have senses, because it humbles itself and cleaves. The matter is like that. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said concerning Uhud: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>This is Uhud, a mountain that loves us, and which we love</strong></span>.&#8221; [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With this Hadith, we also recognize the refutation against those who affirm that there are metaphors in the Qur&#8217;an. Those who always raise their flag, using this Ayah as proof:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Then they found therein a wall wanting to collapse&#8221;</strong></span> (Al-Kahf 18:77)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saying: &#8220;How can the wall want?&#8221; We say: Subhan Allah! The Knowing, and The Aware says : &#8220;Wanting to collapse&#8221; and you are saying that it does not want! Is this sensible?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not your right, after this, that you sav: &#8220;How could it want?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This makes us ask ourselves: Are we given the knowledge of everything?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer is that we are not given knowledge, except a little.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not possible for us to object to the statement of the One Who knows the hidden and the witnessed: &#8220;Wanting to collapse&#8221; by saying: &#8220;The wall does not have an Iradah (a want)! And It does not want to collapse!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is one of the evils of metaphors, because it implies a negation of what the Qur&#8217;an affirms.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it not Allah, Exalted is He, Who says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#000000;">The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein, glorify Him and there is not a thing but glorifies His Praise. But you understand not their glorification</span></strong>&#8221; {Al-Israa&#8217; 17: 44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do they glorify Him, without wanting to?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He says: &#8220;<strong>Tusabbih Lahu (they glorify Him)</strong>&#8220;: the Lam is to specify. Thus, it means sincerely. Is it imaginable to have sincerity without an Iradah (volition, objective, will)? Therefore, they will, and everything wills, for Allah says: &#8220;<strong>And there is not a thing but glorifies His Praise</strong>.&#8221; I think it is clear to all of us that this is one of the ways of expressing generality, because In (here) means Ma (not), which negates. Also, &#8220;<strong>A thing</strong>&#8221; is an indefinite pronoun used in the context of negation. &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>But glorifies His Praise</strong></span>&#8221; by that, it includes everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O my Muslim brother, if you see that your heart is not moved by the Qur&#8217;an, accuse yourself, because Allah has informed that if this Qur&#8217;an were to be sent down upon a mountain, it would cleave, and the Qur&#8217;an is recited to your heart, yet and it is not moved. We ask Allah to aid us, and you.</p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcription of the Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Bismillaah hir Rahman nir Raheem. Alhumdulillahi Rabbil Aalameen Wa sallallahu ala Muhammadin wa ala aalihi wa sahbihi wa sallam</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Point of benifits, this is the begining of a series of benifits inshaa Allaahu ta&#8217;ala which we will try to convey from Allaah (Subhana wata&#8217;ala) to make them benefit for myself and for every one who listens to them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Point of benefit &#8211; concerning Soorat Al-Ikhlas chapter 112 &#8211; In the hadeeth it came that it equates that it is equivalent to one third of the Qur&#8217;an. How?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>This is because the Qur&#8217;an is either</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>1) The news about Allaah, His names and attributes, His actions</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>2)The second aspect is that &#8211; it is the news about the creation of Allaah as to that which will occur in the future and that which occured before in the past from the nations and so forth.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>3) Thirdly, he Qur&#8217;an comprises commands and prohibitions.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>And so this soorah Ikhlas talks about Allaah. So it is of the first news and thats why it is the third of the Qur&#8217;an. Because we know the Qur&#8217;an now is three thirds. First third news is about Allaah and the second contains the news about the creation of Allaah, the third contains commands and prohibitions. So it is equivalent to one third of the Qur&#8217;an.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>This soorah Allaah choose it to speak of Himself, purely about Himself. So, Allaah did not mention in it anything except that which relates to Him and His attributes. And this soorah is a deliverance. It delivers it&#8217;s reciter from shirk and from the denial and negation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>This concludes the point of benefit. The first point of benefit. We ask Allaah (Subhana wata&#8217;ala) to bestow upon me and you the beneficial knowledge by which we increase our eeman and correct our deeds.</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwas of the Permanent Committee&gt;Group 2&gt;Volume 2: `Aqidah&gt;The Sects&gt;Ahmad Deedat&#8217;s &#8220;Al-Qur&#8217;an the Miracle of Miracles&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwa no. 19040</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Ahmad Deedat said in his book &#8220;Al-Qur&#8217;an the Miracle of Miracles&#8221; that Qur&#8217;an includes many references to the number 19 and its multiplications. He gave many examples and here are some of them: </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">&#8211; The word &#8220;اسم&#8221; (name) is mentioned 19 times in the Qur&#8217;an. </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">&#8211; The word &#8220;الله&#8221; (Allah) is mentioned 2698 (19 x 142) times in the Qur&#8217;an. </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">&#8211; The word &#8220;الرحيم&#8221; (The Most Merciful) is mentioned 114 (19 x 6) times in the Qur&#8217;an. </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">&#8211; The letter &#8220;ن&#8221; (Nun) is mentioned 133 (19 x 7) times in Surah Al-Qalam. </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">He also made reference to the study conducted by Dr. Rashad Khalifah in his book &#8220;Al-Qur`an Taqdim Mar&#8217;y li-Mu`jizah&#8221;. Here are some examples of the points he raised: </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">&#8211; The first Qur&#8217;anic revelation is composed of 19 words which include 76 (19 x 4) letters. </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">&#8211; The first Surah (Qur&#8217;anic chapter) revealed in the Qur&#8217;an includes 19 Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) and 285 (19 x 15) letters, etc. </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">Please give us your Fatwa (legal opinion issued by a qualified Muslim scholar) in this regard. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This study is among the fabricated falsities of a sect called Al-Batiniyyah Al-Baha&#8217;iyyah. It is based on glorifying the number 19. There is no doubt that this study is false, as it involves manipulating the Glorious Qur&#8217;an and distracting people from pondering  its true meanings.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li style="text-align:justify;">This malicious group holds many false beliefs such as some of its leaders claiming prophethood.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5;">Its followers believe in <strong>Hulul</strong> (a Sufi term meaning indwelling) and <strong>Ittihad</strong> (a Sufi claim of union with Allah), </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5;">deem Jihad (fighting in the Cause of Allah) to be unlawful and </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5;">call for the unification of religions plus many other things.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span style="line-height:1.5;">So, it is the duty of Muslims to beware of falling into this evil group and of being affected by its ideas or books. </span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5;">We ask Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) to save us from their plotting and to protect Muslims from their evils, for He is All-Powerful.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Video Courtesy: Bilal Nahim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Is a woman that is menstruating or in her post-partum period allowed to touch the mus-haf or read from it? Also, is the menstruating woman allowed to enter the masjid in order to gain religious knowledge?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Abdulazeez bin Abdullah bin Baaz:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The menstruating woman is not allowed to sit in the masjid nor touch the mus-haf until she has become purified. However, if a need for her to touch it arose, such as in order to revise a verse (of the Qur&#8217;an) or something like that, there is no problem to do so by wearing gloves or by using some other barrier.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for touching it without some sort of barrier, then no, she should not do that. This is because her impurity is major, like the one who is impure due to sexual relations (junub). The one who is &#8216;junub&#8217; does not read or touch the mus-haf. As for the menstruating woman, she may recite [the Qur&#8217;an] during the whole period. So can the one in her post-partum period, according to the correct Opinion. She can read from her memory without touching the mus-haf unless she has to in order to revise a verse in which case it is alright if she touches it using a barrier.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q: What is the ruling on some people who sway from right to left and backwards and forwards while reciting the Qur&#8217;an? Please advise, may Allah reward you.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Swaying while reciting the Qur&#8217;an is one of the habits that should be abandoned. It contradicts the etiquettes required when reciting the Qur&#8217;an. When reciting or listening to the Qur&#8217;an, a person should listen carefully and not play with things so that the listener and the reciter ponder over the meanings of the Qur&#8217;an and their hearts be submissive to Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Scholars mentioned that this is one of the habits of the Jews when reciting their Book, and we are forbidden to imitate them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Ruling on Speaking while the Quraan is being Recited from a tape/CD/recorder</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What is the legislative ruling for talking during the recitation of the Qur&#8217;an in general gatherings, like if the Qur&#8217;an is recited from a tape and a group of people are talking, what is the ruling on this action?</span></p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih Al-‘Uthaymeen:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Most High states, {<strong><span style="color:#008000;">So when the Qur&#8217;an is recited, then listen to it and give it due attention so that you may receive mercy</span></strong>}. [Soorah Al-‘Araaf: 204]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, if we have a recorder playing the sound of a reciter (while we are talking); either we turn off the recorder or we listen to him. However. remaining in our chatter and talking as if we only hear the sounds of humans, then this is contrary to having manners with the Quran.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So here I say, that either we turn off the recorder or listen to it. Even if one of them was listening and the others continued to chat, then that one individual lowers the sound so that no one hears it except him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Case</strong>: During Menses, it is not unlawful to celebrate Allah&#8217;s Praises (Saying Takbeer, Tasbeeh, and Tahmeed),[29] saying Bismillah before acting upon something (eating, drinking, etc..), reading Hadeeth, Islamic discussions, invocation upon Allah (Dua&#8217;), and listening to the recitation of Qur&#8217;an.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been confirmed by &#8216;Aisha (radhi Allaahu anha) that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;lean on my lap and recite Qur&#8217;an while I was in menses&#8221;</span> (Al-Bukhari and Muslim).[30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also Umm &#8216;Atiyya reported that she heard the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) saying: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The Unmarried young virgins and the mature girl who stay often screened or the young unmarried virgins who often stayscreened and the menstruating women should come out and participate in the good deeds as well as the religious gathering of the faithful believers but the menstruating women should keep away from the Musalla (praying place).&#8221;</span> [31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Case</strong>: The reciting of the Qur&#8217;an by a menstruating woman either via direct looking or silently (in her heart) without the actual uttering by the tongue is permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The majority of the scholars are with the opinion that it is not prohibited for her to utter the Qur&#8217;anic recitation. Imam Bukhari, Ibn Jareer At- Tabaree and Ibn Al-Munthir, Imam Malik, and Imam Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee (in one of his earlier sayings) are with the opinion that it is permissible for her to recite the Ayah (verse in the Qur&#8217;an).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shayekul Islam Ibn Taymeeyah said: &#8220;Basically, there is no Sunnah to prevent her from reciting Qur&#8217;an. The &#8220;hadeeth&#8221; that: &#8220;A menstruating woman and the one who is in state of Jannabah [32] should not recite anything of the Qur&#8217;an&#8221;, is a weak hadeeth as agreed upon by the knowledgeable scholars of Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In fact women at the time of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to have their monthly cycles of menses.Had the recitation of Qur&#8217;an been prohibited for them (as it is the case with Salat) then the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) would have made it clear to his Ummah (Islamic community) and his wives would have known about it and they would have dissipated this knowledge to the people. Because no one had related a prohibition by the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) about this issue, then it cannot be made unlawful especially when it is known that he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not prohibit it at the time when menses was very much present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, recitation by the tongue is not Haram (legally unlawful).[33] This author said: &#8220;having known the dispute between the scholars about this matter, then it is more proper for the menstruating woman not to recite Qur&#8217;an by the tongue except when it is necessary e.g. if she is a teacher or if she is preparing for an exam.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[29] Takbeer: saying Allahu Akbar (Allah is The Greatest); Tasbeeh: saying Subhana Allah (Most Glorified is Allah); Tahmeed: saying Al Hamdulil&#8217;lah: All Praise is due to Allah.<br />
[30] Saheeh Al-Bukhari (Arabic-English) V.1, P.179, Hadeeth # 296.<br />
[31] Agreed upon Hadeeth. In Saheeh Al-Bukhari (Arabic- English), V. 1, P. 192, Hadeeth # 321.<br />
[32] Jannabah: Is the state in which a man (or a woman) has sexual discharge during sexual intercourse or in a dream, etc. In this state a Muslim is not allowed to pray or do other kinds of worships unless and until he (she) performs Ghusl (have a full shower) or do Tayammum if he/she cannot use water for any reason.<br />
[33] Ibin Taymeeyah in Al-Fatawa (religious decrees) V. 26, P. 191.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Saying Sadaqa Allahu Al-`Azhim upon finishing recitation of the Qur&#8217;an</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b></b><b></b><b>Q: I often hear that</b><b> saying Sadaqa Allahu Al-`Adhim upon finishing recitation of the Glorious Qur&#8217;an </b>is an act of Bid`ah (innovation in religion). Other people told me that there was nothing wrong with it. Supporting their view, they quote the Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse) which reads:<b> <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-&#096;Imran, 3: 95" target="_blank" name="Say(OMuhammad%D8%B5%D9%84%D9%89%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%87%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%85):"></a>Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8220;Allâh has spoken the truth; follow the religion of Ibrâhîm (Abraham) Hanîfa (Islâmic Monotheism, i.e. he used to worship Allâh Alone) &#8221; </b>Some educated people also told me that whenever the Prophet (peace be upon him) wanted a Qur&#8217;an reciter to end his recitation, he would just say &#8220;That is enough&#8221;. Never did he use to ask him to say Sadaqa Allahu Al-`Adhim. Therefore, would you kindly give a detailed explanation of the relevant ruling.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody"><b>A: </b>Habitual saying of Sadaqa Allahu Al-Azhim upon concluding recitation of the Glorious Qur&#8217;an is not supported by any proof in the Shari`ah (Islamic Law) and should, therefore, not be used as a common practice. It belongs to the category of Bid`ah particularly when someone believes it to be an act of Sunnah. Such a practice must be given up.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">As for the Ayah which reads: &#8221; <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-&#096;Imran, 3: 95" target="_blank" name="Say(OMuhammad%D8%B5%D9%84%D9%89%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%87%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%85):"></a>Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8220;Allâh has spoken the truth &#8221; it has nothing to do with saying this expression. The Ayah simply means that the Prophet (peace be upon him) is commanded by Allah (Exalted be He) to make it clear to people that the revelations contained in the Tawrah (Torah), the Injil (Gospel) and all other heavenly revealed Scriptures are true.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">By the same token, clear revelations contained in the Glorious Qur&#8217;an are true. However, this does not establish a proof for the desirability to conclude reading of some Ayahs or a certain Surah of the Qur&#8217;an by saying: Sadaqa Allahu Al-`Adhim. Neither the Prophet (peace be upon him) nor any of his Sahabah (Companions, may Allah be pleased with them) were authentically reported to have done such a practice. <a name="TheProphetoncelistenedtoIbn"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="110824" class="tip"></span>The Prophet once listened to Ibn Mas`ud reading Surah Al-Nisa&#8217;. Upon reaching the Ayah which reads: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Nisa', 4: 41" target="_blank" name="How(willitbe)then,whenWe"></a>How (will it be) then, when We bring from each nation a witness and We bring you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) as a witness against these people? &#8221; The Prophet (peace be upon him) said to him:&#8221;That is enough&#8221;. Ibn Mas`ud said: &#8220;When I turned to him, I saw his eyes shedding tears.&#8221;</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> The Prophet (peace be upon him) was moved to tears because the Ayah reminded him of the great horror of the Day of Resurrection. The Ayah reads: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Nisa', 4: 41" target="_blank" name="How(willitbe)then,whenWe"></a>How (will it be) then, when We bring from each nation a witness and We bring you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) &#8221; <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Nisa', 4: 41" target="_blank" name="How(willitbe)then,whenWe"></a>&#8230;as a witness against these people &#8221; i.e. The Muslim people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">In short, there exists no evidence in the Shari`ah that makes it desirable to conclude recitation of the Qur&#8217;an by saying: Sadaqa Allahu Al-`Adhim. This expression has to be left unsaid so that one would be following the example of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them). However, there is nothing wrong if someone happens to say this expression unintentionally. Since Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) always speaks the truth, this expression of Sadaqa Allahu Al-Azhim has to be thought of as an absolute expression which should not be limited to a given time, place, or situation. Therefore, habitual recitation of this expression whenever one finishes reading the Qur&#8217;an has no evidence in its support as has been early mentioned.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[8] Question: </b>Noble Shaikh, what is the ruling on one who recites the Qur’aan whilst not having wudoo, regardless of whether he recites from memory or from the <i>mus-haf?</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[8] Answer: </b>It is permissible for a person to recite the Qur’aan without having wudoo if he recites from his memory. This is since nothing prevented the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) from reciting the Qur’aan <span style="color:#993300;">except for <i>Janaabah</i></span> (sexual impurity). He (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) would recite the Qur’aan whilst in a state of wudoo and without it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <i>mus-haf</i>, it is not permissible for someone who has broken his wudoo to touch it, regardless of whether it is the minor form of impurity or the major form. Allaah says: <b>“No one touches it except for the pure.”</b> [Surah Al-Waaqi’ah: 79] This means: “Those who are pure and free from impurities, uncleanness and Shirk.” Also in the hadeeth, the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) wrote a letter to his vice-regent ‘Amr bin Hazm in which he instructed him: <b>“No one should touch the mus-haf except for the purified.” </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is also the view that has been unanimously agreed upon by the four Imaams – that it is not permissible for one in the state of impurity – whether major or minor state – to touch the <i>mus-haf </i>except from behind a covering, such as when the <i>mus-haf</i> is in a box or a bag or if one touches it using one’s garment or sleeve as a barrier.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Point of Benefit : Is it permissible to pay someone to teach the Qur’aan?</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> Researched By Dr. Saleh As-Saleh 1427/2006</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hamdulillaahi Rabbil ‘Aalameen was-Salaatu was-Salaamu ‘Alaa Muhammadin wa ‘Alaa Aalihi wa-Sahbihi Ajma’een.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Payment in exchange for teaching of the Qur’aan is not without the following matters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) It is a portion of Razq: subsistence-food, allowance, or the like provided by the state’s treasury (Baytul-maal). In this case it is permissible to take.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) It is an unconditional payment: the teacher does not set payment as a precondition. So, in this case, it is permissible to pay him for his teaching.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(c) It is a form of Ji’aalah: Setting up a reward, allowance, or the like for carrying on a permissible task within a specified or unspecified period. For example, to state that whoever teaches my son the Qur’aan or half of it, I will give him such and such. This is permissible. Even the majority of the scholars who see that it is forbidden to receive wages on teaching the Qur’aan, said that it is permissible to take the Ji’aalah and the Razq from Baytul-maal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(d) It is a conditional payment: The teacher will only teach in exchange for specified wages. There are two main views for the ‘Ulamaa’ as to the permissibility of this case: (1) Impermissible, and (2) Permissible.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">The First View: It is impermissible</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the famous view of the math-hab of Imaam Ahmad (rahimahhullaah), and the saying of Imaam Abu Haneefah (rahimahhullaah), ‘Ataa’, Ad-Dahaak bin Qays, and Az-Zuhree (rahimahhullaah), and some contemporary scholars. They based their view on certain evidences, amongst which:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) The hadeeth of ‘Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Shibil (radhi Allaahu anhu) who said: “I heard Allaah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) saying: ‘Recite the Qur’aan and exceed not the limits therein and turn not away from it, and eat not with it and amass not wealth therewith…” [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The textual aspect for the impermissibility lies in the Prophet’s saying: “And eat not with it [don’t make a means of sustenance] and amass not wealth therewith.” Taking wages for the teaching of the Qur’aan is considered of “eating with the Qur’aan and amassing wealth therewith.”2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) The hadeeth related by ‘Ubaadah ibn As-Saamit (radhi Allaahu anhu) in which he told of his teaching of the Qur’aan to some people of Ahlu-Suffah3 and that one of them gave him a bow as a gift. ‘Ubaadah said: “It is only a bow and not money.” He then asked the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) about it and he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: “If you are pleased that you would be encircled by it a ring of fire around your neck [on the Day of Resurrection], then accept it!” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(iii) The hadeeth narrated by Ubay ibn Ka’b (radhi Allaahu anhu) who said: “I taught someone the Qur’aan and he gave a bow as a gift. I mentioned this to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) who said: “If you take it then you would be taking a bow of fire.” So, I returned it. [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof of prohibiting the wages is deduced from the threatening torment on the Day of Resurrection for the one who takes a gift for teaching the Qur’aan. If it is prohibited to accept a gift for teaching the Qur’aan, then by all means the prohibition on taking wages is even greater.[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(iv) The hadeeth of Jaabir (radhi Allaahu anhu) in which it is narrated that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) entered the Mosque while some people were reciting the Qur’aan. Thereupon, he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: “Recite, all is well. In the future there will appear people who will straighten it (the Qur’aan) as an arrow is straightened.[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They will recite it quickly and not slowly (or it means that they will get the reward in this world and not in the hear after).”8 In another narration: “Recite it before there appear people who will recite it and straighten it as an arrow is strained, They will get their reward for it in this world and will not get it in the hereafter.” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(v) The hadeeth of ‘Imraan bin Husain (radhi Allaahu anhu) who said: “I heard Allaah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) saying: ‘Recite the Qur’aan and seek with it Allaah, the Blessed and the Most High’s, reward for there will be those after you who will recite the Qur’aan seeking people’s reward therewith.”10 The aspect of prohibition lies in the clarification by the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) that the recitation of the Qur’aan is such that one seeks with it the reward from Allaah, not a reward from the people in the form of payment of wages. [11]</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">The Second View: It is Permissible</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This view is held by Imaam Maalik, Imaam Ash-Shaafi’ee, Imaam Ahmad (in a second narration), some Hanafiyyah, Abu Qalaabah, Abu Thawr, Ibnul Munthir, and many contemporary scholars. The evidences upon which they relied included the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) The hadeeth of ibn ‘Abbaas ( radhi Allaahu anhu) in saheeh al-Bukhaaree in which he narrated that some of the companions of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) passed by some people, and one of those people had been stung by a scorpion. One of the companions recited soorat al-Faatiha on the stung person for a sheep as his fees. The patient got cured and the man brought the sheep to his companions who disliked that and said, “You have taken wages for reciting Allaah’s Book.” They referred the matter to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“You are perfectly entitled to take wages for Allaah’s Book.” [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Bukhaaree added: As-Sha’bee13said, “The teacher should not fix the tuition, but if he is given something, he should accept it.” Al-Hakam [14] said: “I have never heard anybody saying that it is disliked for the teacher to take tuition.” [15]…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) The hadeeth of Abee Sa’eed al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu) in as-saheehayn reporting the story of some of the Prophet’s companions who came across an Arabian tribe who did not entertain them. The chief of the tribe was bitten by a snake (or stung by a scorpion). The tribe asked the companions to treat the chief with ruqya (Qur’anic recitation as a treatment). The companions conditioned that they pay them in exchange for the ruqya. The tribe accepted and the chief was cured after the recitation of soorat al- Faatiha on him. The tribe presented a flock of sheep to the companions according to the agreement. The companions consulted with the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) before taking the sheep. He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: “Take it and assign a share for me.” [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These evidences were considered by the advocates of the first view as proof for the permissibility to take wages in exchange for ruqya not for teaching the Qur’aan. The response was that there is no difference between the two; if it is permissible to be paid in exchange for ruqya, which is part of the Qur’aan, then it is also permissible to take fees for teaching the Qur’aan, because ruqya is of the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(iii) The hadeeth of Sahl bin Sa’d (radhi Allaahu anhu) in as-Saheehayn in which a woman presented herself to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) for marriage, and a destitute man asked the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to marry her to him. He did not have anything to pay for her dower. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) asked him: “How much of the Qur’aan do you know (by heart)?” The man said: “I know such soorah and such soorah,” and he named them. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: “I have married her to you for what you know of the Qur’aan.” [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is considered a proof permitting the teaching of the Qur’aan in exchange for dowry, and if this is allowed in marriage, then by all means it is permissible in cases where teachers are to be hired out to teach the Qur’aan.[18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Discussion: The evidences of the second view are stronger and more authentic in regard to their confirmation than those of the first view. The closest position is that the prohibition is directed more towards taking gifts, wages and the like for the recitation of the Qur’aan when, in the beginning of Islaam, there was a need to spread the Qur’aan in the hearts of the believers. Still, however, the evidences of the first view, cautions that it is better not to take wages for teaching the Qur’aan and thus limits the view of permissibility to befit the need and circumstances.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Given, the weak situation of Muslims nowadays, and the attachment of many of them to this worldly life, and knowing that in certain communities situations may arise such that there is a genuine need to teach the Qur’aan, then:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) If the teachers are available and there are those who teach without taking payment in return, then they should be preferred.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) If the only teachers available are those who ask for tuition for their teaching, or that the teachers who do not request tuitions are few in number, then hiring teachers from the former category to fulfill the needs of the community is permissible due to necessity. In this case it is better to chose from those teachers who are in need, not the rich ones. Shaykul-Islaam Ibn Taymmeyah (rahimahhullaah) stated that it is permissible to hire needy teachers to teach the Qur’aan. In this way the teacher intends to teach it purely for Allaah’s sake and takes the wages to spend on himself and his family, assisting him on his worship of Allaah. [19] It is noted that even some of the scholars who held the first view approved giving wages for teachers on the condition that they are full-time teachers and that the scope of hiring should not exceed the needs of the communities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(iii) If the available teachers do not set up conditions for their teaching, and the students, their parents or the community at large, pays them for their services, then I hope, inshaa’Allaah, that this would be permissible. AND ALLAAH KNOWS BEST.</p>

24th Dhul Hijjah, 1427.<br />
19See Majmoo’ Fataawaa ibn Taymeeyah (vol. 30, pp. 205-207).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>References :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Reported by Ahmad, Abu Ya’la, Al-Bayhaqee, and At-Tabaraanee in Al-Kabeer and Al-Awsat. Al- Haafith ibn Hajar said: “Its isnaad is strong.” [Fath, vol. 9, p. 82], and Al-Albaanee stated that its isnaad is saheeh [As-Saheehah, vol. 1, p. 466].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] According to advocates of the second view, this text does not necessitate prohibiting what the student may pay willingly to the teacher. In addition they directed the prohibition as being specific to recitation only. They also pointed out that some scholars criticized the narration of this hadeeth considering it weak, and thus it cannot stand to oppose the authenticity of the ahaadeeth in the saheehayn and which they consider more explicit in allowing wages on teaching the Qur’aan. Those in support of the first view consider that the ahaadeeth pertaining to the prohibition strengthen one another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Ahlu-Suffah: Those were poor people from the Muhaajireen who were driven away from their homes and had no money, or families, nor a place to stay. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and the companions (radhi Allaahu anhum) assisted them, and he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) allowed them to stay in a courtyard by his Mosque.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Reported by ibn Maajah in his Sunan (no. 2157). It is considered weak by many scholars like ibn Al- Madeenee and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Sunan Ibn Maajah (no. 2158). Imaam Ath-Thahabee said: “Its isnaad is mudtarib (confounding). Al- Albaanee stated that its isnaad is weak as in al-Irwaa’ (no. 1493). He, however, considered the hadeeth of ‘Ubaadah ibn As-Saamit (see above), and another weak hadeeth narrated by Abud-dardaa’ (radhi Allaahu anhu): “Whoever takes a bow in exchange for teaching the Qur’aan, Allaah will hang upon him a bow of fire on the Day of Resurrection,” as supporting evidence that elevates the hadeeth of Ubay to the degree of saheeh. Note: A hadeeth is considered mudtarib if it is reported through various conflicting narrations with no possibility of preponderating. This may affect the isnaad as well as the text, and it necessitates the weakness of the hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] The second view: The hadeeth of ‘Ubaadah and that of Ubay are weak, and that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) knew that they taught the Qur’aan purely for Allaah’s sake, so he disliked for them to take anything in return. There is no harm, however, that the teacher who teaches the Qur’aan for Allaah’s sake, and does not ask for tuition, accepts from the student what the latter gives him willingly. In addition, the second view holds that the ahaadeeth of prohibition is more directed to cases of taking money in exchange for recitation of the Qur’aan, not for ta’leem (teaching the Qur’aan), and that ta’leem and recitation are two different matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] Apparently in reference to those who exceed the limits in the way of pronunciation of the words of the Qur’aan while in recitation. And Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] Collected by Abu Daawood in his Sunan (Engl. Transl. vol. 1, no. 829). Al-Albaanee stated that its isnaad is saheeh (as-Saheehah, vol. 1, no. 259).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] Ibid, hadeeth no. 830.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] Reported by Imaam Ahmad and At-Tirmithee who said: “This hadeeth is hasan, though its isnaad is is not that strong.” Al-Albaanee said, “At-Tirmithee declared it hasan though its isnaad is weak, because of the many supporting narrations, and that this terminology by At-Tirmithee is clarified in his book as-Sunan (4:400).” [as-Saheehah, vol. 1, no. 257; the Shaykh (rahimahhullaah) mentioned some of the supporting narrations, two of which are sighted above (i. and iv)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] In response to this, the second view states that the evidence from this hadeeth is only regarding the prohibition of seeking reward, and this is not the same as taking payment in exchange for teaching.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12] Reported by al-Bukhaaree in his saheeh (vol. 7, no. 633) and in vol. 3, p. 263. People of the first view hold that what is intended here is the reward in the Hereafter. According to the second view, the context of the hadaath totally disapproves this opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] As-Sha’bee, ‘Aamir bin Sharaaheel bin ‘abd Al-Hamadaani (d. 103Hj or later). He encountered five hundred of the sahaabah. [See Siyar A’alaam an-Nubalaa’, vol. 4, p.249].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14] Al-Hakam bin ‘Utaybah al-Kindee, Abu ‘Abdillaah, the scholar of al-Koofah (d. 113Hj) [ibid, vol. 5, 208].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15] Although these sayings pertain to knowledge in general, supporters of the second view see no difference because, according to them, the salaf did not differentiate between learning the Qur’aan or other disciplines of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[16] Reported in saheeh al-Bukhaaree (vol. 7, no. 632) and in saheeh Muslim (vol. 3, no. 5458).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[17] Reported by Bukhaaree (saheeh al-Bukhaaree, vol. 7, No. 54), and Muslim (saheeh Muslim, vol. 2, No. 3316).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[18] According to supporters of the first view the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) gave this woman in marriage to this destitute man without a dowry honouring him for what he knew of the Qur’aan, and that he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not set up the teaching of the Qur’aan as sadaaq (dowry). However, according to the second view, this opinion is refuted by the narration in Muslim: “I have given her to you in marriage for the part of the Qur’aan which you know.” Also, the first view points out that this permission is peculiar to this case only, based upon a hadeeth reported in Sa’eed bin Mansour’s Sunan. In it the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) gave a woman in marriage to a destitute man and said: “Give her the soorah (which he knew) as her sadaaq and it should not be a dowry for anyone after you.” In response, advocates of the second view see that (a) this constitutes no evidence that this story is the same as the one reported in as-Saheehayn, and (b) there is dispute regarding this additional statement in the sense that it is limited to this report, but not in as-saheehayn and as-sunan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Clarifying the Narrations Pertaining to the Prostration Places in the Qur&#8217;aan</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Terminology:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>marfoo&#8217;</em>: &#8220;raised,&#8221; a narration attributed to the Prophet</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"><em>mawqoof</em>: &#8220;stopped,&#8221; a narration from a companion.</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"><em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em> (t): may Allaah be pleased with him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"><em>soorat</em>: a chapter of the Qur&#8217;aan.</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"><em>mufassal: </em> means the<strong> “</strong>last seventh of the Qur’aan,” and it starts from <em>soorat</em> Qaaf (#50) to the last <em>soorat </em>of <em>An-Naass</em> (#114)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1-al A&#8217;raf 7:206</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Surely, those who are with your Lord (angels) are never too proud to perform acts of worship to Him, but they glorify His Praise and prostrate before Him&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Narration is <em>marfoo&#8217; </em>to Abud Dardaa&#8217; (t) and it is weak, but authentically <em>mawqoof </em>to Ibn &#8216;Umar and Ibn &#8216;Abaas (<em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhum</em>) as reported by &#8216;Abdur Razzaaq (i.e. in his <em>musannaf</em>). The scholars unanimously agreed to prostrate in this place as reported by Ibn Katheer in his <em>Tafseer</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2-ar Ra&#8217;d 13:15</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And unto Allaah (Alone) falls in prostration whoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, and so do their shadows in the mornings and in the afternoons&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An authentic <em>mawqoof </em>report from Ibn &#8216;Umar and Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (<em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhum</em>). Reported by &#8216;Abdur Razzaaq (i.e. in his <em>musannaf</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3-an Nahl 16:49</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And to Allaah prostate all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, of the live moving creatures and the angels, and they are not proud [i.e. they worship their Lord with humility]&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An authentic <em>mawqoof </em>report from &#8216;Umar Ibn al-Khattaab (t) in al-Bukhaari.  &#8216;Umar (t) recited <em>soorat</em> an-Nahl on a Friday on the pulpit and when reached the verse of the <em>sajdah</em> he got down from the pulpit and prostrated and the people also prostrated. The next Friday &#8216;Umar did recite the same <em>soorat</em> and when he reached the verse of <em>sajdah </em>he said: O people! When we recite the verses of <em>sajdah</em> whoever prostrates does the right thing, yet it is no sin for the one who does not prostrate. Also it is an authentic <em>mawqoof </em>report in &#8216;Abdur Razzaaq&#8217;s (<em>musannaf</em>) from Ibn &#8216;Umar and Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (<em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhum</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4- al Israa 17:109</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And they fall down on their faces weeping and it adds to their humility&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An authentic <em>mawqoof </em>report from Ibn &#8216;Umar and Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (<em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhum</em>). Reported by &#8216;Abdur Razzaaq (i.e. in his <em>musannaf</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>5- Maryam 19:58</strong><br />
&#8220;&#8230; When the Verses of the Most Beneficent were recited unto them, they fell down prostrating and weeping.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An authentic <em>mawqoof </em>report from Ibn &#8216;Umar and Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (<em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhum</em>). Reported by &#8216;Abdur Razzaaq. Ibn Katheer reported the unanimous agreement to prostrate in this place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>6- 7-al Hajj 22:18</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;See you not that to Allaah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the mountains, and the trees, and Ad-Dawab (moving living creatures, beasts, etc.), and many of mankind?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al Hajj 22:77</strong><br />
&#8220;O you who believe! Bow down, and prostrate yourselves, and worship your Lord and do good that you may be successful&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hadeeth on the first prostration is an authentic <em>mawqoof </em>report from Ibn &#8216;Umar and Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (<em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhum</em>). Reported by &#8216;Abdur Razzaaq. And the narration on both prostrations is a <em>mawqoof </em>report from &#8216;Amr Ibn al-&#8216;Aaas but there is weakness therein. However, there is a supporting report to it from &#8216;Uqbah bin &#8216;Aamir and Khaalid bin Ma&#8217;daan. It is authentically <em>mawqoof</em> from &#8216;Umar and his son &#8216;Abdullaah, Abud Dardaa&#8217;, and Abu Musa al-Ash&#8217;aree (<em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhum</em>). Ishaaq said: For seventy years I have seen people prostrating the two prostrations in <em>soorat</em> al-Hajj.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>8- al Furqan 25:60</strong><br />
&#8220;And when it is said to them: &#8220;Prostrate to the Most Beneficent (Allaah)! They say: &#8220;And what is the Most Beneficent? Shall we fall down in prostration to that which you command us?&#8221; And it increases in them only aversion&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Its is an authentic <em>mawqoof </em>report from Ibn &#8216;Umar and Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (<em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhum</em>). Reported by &#8216;Abdur Razzaaq (i.e. in his <em>musannaf</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>9- an Naml 27:25</strong><br />
&#8220;Allaah, laa ilaaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Lord of the Supreme Throne!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An authentic <em>mawqoof </em>report from Ibn &#8216;Umar and Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (<em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhum</em>). Reported by &#8216;Abdur Razzaaq.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>10- as Sajdah 32:15</strong><br />
&#8220;Only those believe in Our Ayat, who, when they are reminded of them fall down prostrate, and glorify the Praises of their Lord, and they are not proud.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Its narration is an authentic <em>mawqoof </em>report from Ibn &#8216;Umar and Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (<em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhum</em>). Reported by &#8216;Abdur Razzaaq (i.e. in his <em>musannaf</em>). And from Abu Hurairah (t) that the Prophet (r) used to recite <em>soorat</em> Alif Laam Meem as-Sajdah (chapter 32) in the Fajr prayer (authentic, in al-Bukhaari). Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajar said in al-Fath (i.e. <em>Fathul Baari</em>). I did not see in the transmissions an explicit statement that he (r) prostrated except in the Book of Sharee&#8217;ah, then he (al-Haafidh) mentioned the narration and said: And in its <em>isnaad </em>(transmission) there is some whose condition (of reliability) require (careful) study. Then he said: And At-Tabaraani has, in his <em>sagheer</em>,  a narration that is <em>marfoo&#8217; </em>to &#8216;Ali (t). There is, however, weakness in its chain of transmission (<em>isnaad</em>). [End of al-Haafidh&#8217;s statements].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>11- Saad 38:24</strong><br />
&#8220;&#8230; And Dawud guessed that We have tried him and he sought Forgiveness of his Lord, and he fell down prostrate and turned (to Allaah) in repentance&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Its hadeeth is authentically <em>marfoo&#8217; </em>in al-Bukhaari.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>12- Fussilat 41:38</strong><br />
&#8220;But if they are too proud (to do so), then there are those who are with your Lord (angels) glorify Him night and day, and never are they tired.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Its is an authentic <em>mawqoof </em>report from Ibn &#8216;Umar and Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (<em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhum</em>). Reported by &#8216;Abdur Razzaaq (i.e. in his <em>musannaf</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>13- an Najm 53:62</strong><br />
&#8220;So fall you down in prostration to Allaah, and worship Him (Alone)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Its hadeeth is authentically <em>marfoo&#8217; </em>in al-Bukhaari.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>14- Inshiqaq 84:21</strong><br />
&#8220;And when the Qur&#8217;an is recited to them, they fall not prostrate,&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Its hadeeth is authentically <em>marfoo&#8217; </em>in Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>15- al &#8216;Alaq 96:19</strong><br />
&#8221; &#8230; Fall prostrate and draw near to Allaah!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Its hadeeth is authentically <em>marfoo&#8217; </em>in al-Bukhaari</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Point of Benefit:</strong> Al-Muwafaq (Ibn Qudaamah Al-Maqdisee) in <em>al-Kaafi</em> (v.1, p. 206) said that, &#8220;the places of the verses of prostrations are unanimously affirmed except those of the <em>mufassal</em> and the second <em>sajdah </em>in soorat al-Hajj.&#8221; The evidences for those prostrations, however, are as mentioned (above).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>Completed by the pen of Muhammad bin Saalih al-&#8216;Uthaimeen on 3/8/1404 </em><em> (corresponding to: 4/5/1984).<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 60:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>What is the creed of the Righteous Predecessors regarding the Noble Qur’aan?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The creed of the as-Salaf pertaining to the Noble Qur’aan <strong>is like their creed with regard to the rest of the Attributes and Names of Allaah</strong>, and it is based upon what is proven by the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم). And we all know that Allaah, The One free of all imperfection, The Most High, described the Qur’aan as being His Words, and that it is sent down from Him. So, He, Most Magnificent and Most High, Says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِنْ أَحَدٌ مِّنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ اسْتَجَارَكَ فَأَجِرْهُ حَتَّىٰ يَسْمَعَ كَلَامَ اللَّهِ ثُمَّ أَبْلِغْهُ مَأْمَنَهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And if anyone of the Mushriks seeks your protection, then grant him protection so that they may hear the Word of Allaah [the Qur’aan], and then escort him to where he can be secure&#8221;</span> [Qur’aan, soorat at-Tawbah (9): 6].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the intended by the “<strong>Word of Allaah</strong>” here, without any doubt, is the Noble Qur’aan. And furthermore, He, the Most High, Says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ هَٰذَا الْقُرْآنَ يَقُصُّ عَلَىٰ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ أَكْثَرَ الَّذِي هُمْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily, this Qur’aan narrates to the Children of Israel most of that in which they differ&#8221;</span> [Qur’aan, soorat an-Naml (27): 76].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the Qur’aan is the Word of Allaah, The Most High, letter and meaning. He really Spoke it and bestowed it upon Jibreel, the trustworthy, who then brought it down upon the heart of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) so that he may be one of those who warn, in the plain Arabic language.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Salaf also believe that the Qur’aan is a Revelation</strong>, brought down by Allaah (عزّ وجلّ) upon Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) in parts over a period of twenty three years as necessitated by Allaah’s Wisdom. In addition, its revelation is either original or occasional, meaning that some of it is brought down in response to a certain occasion that necessitated its revelation, and some of it is revealed without being due to a certain reason. Also some of it is revealed as a narration of a past condition that occurred to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and his companions, whilst some of it comes down as original legislations, revealed for the first time. This is according to what has been mentioned by the people of knowledge pertaining to this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the Salaf say: <span style="color:#808000;">“<strong>The Qur’aan is in the beginning from Allaah (عزّ وجلّ), and to Him it shall return at the end of tim</strong>e.”</span> This constitutes the saying of the Salaf regarding the Noble Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is something well known to us all that Allaah, The Most High, described the Qur’aan with great qualities. He described it as <strong>hakeem</strong> (wise), <strong>kareem</strong> (an honourable reciter: Noble), ‘<strong>atheem</strong> (great), and <strong>majeed</strong> (glorious). And these qualities with which Allaah has described His Words <em>applies to the one who holds to this Book and works according to it openly and inwardly</em>. So Allaah, The Most High, grants him from the glory, greatness, wisdom, might, and authority, something that it would not be given to the one who does not cling to the Book of Allaah (عزّ وجلّ). That is why I call upon, from this pulpit, all of the Muslims, rulers and ruled, scholars and common people, to cling hold to the Book of Allaah (عزّ وجلّ), openly and inwardly, so that they attain the might, happiness, glory, and prevalence in the East and West.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken From the <em>Fatawaa</em> of our Shaykh, <em>Allaama Mufti</em> of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Abdul Azeez bin Abdullaah Bin Baz<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is reading the Qur’aan for the deceased- by placing copies of the Qur’aan in the home or house of the deceased – where some Muslim neighbours and friends come and each one of them reads a part for example, then they go off to their work and they are not paid for reciting …… And after they finish reciting they supplicate for the deceased and gift him the reward for reciting the Qur’aan … Does this recitation and supplication reach the deceased and is he rewarded or not?  I hope for a benefit and I am grateful to you….. Taking into account that I heard some of the scholars saying that it is absolutely prohibited, some saying it is disliked and some saying it is permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This action and the like of it has no foundation and it is not recorded on the authority of the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> nor on the authority of his Companions <em>-radiAllaah anhum</em><em> &#8211;</em> that they used to read for the deceased.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> said: ‘Whoever does an action which we have not commanded then it is rejected.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Muslim in his authentic book and Bukhari mentioned it without a complete chain but he was decisive about its authenticity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, in the two Saheehs of Bukhari and Muslim on the authority of ‘Aeysha <em>-radiAllaah anha</em><em> –</em> on the authority of the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – </em>who said: ‘Whoever innovates in this matter of ours, that which is not from it, it will be rejected.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Saheeh of Muslim on the authority of Jaabir <em>-radiAllaah anhu</em><em> &#8211;</em> that the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> used to say in his <em>Khutbah</em> on Fridays: <em>Amma ba’d:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the best speech is the Speech of Allaah, the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>&#8211; and the worst of the affairs are the innovated ones.  Every innovation is a <em>Bida’</em> and every<em>Bida’</em> is misguidance.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nisa’ee mentioned an extra wording with an authentic chain: ‘and every misguidance is in the Hellfire.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for charity for the deceased and supplicating for them, then that benefits and reaches them and the Muslims are in consensus aboutthat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And with Allaah is the capability and Allaah’s aid is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Majmoo’ Fatawa – Ibn Baaz vol. 4 p. 339</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We wish from the eminent Shaykh that he clarifies for the Muslims the ruling of reciting the Qur’aan over the dead, is it permissible or not?  And what is the ruling of the Ahadeeth that mention this?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reading over the dead has no foundation which can be relied upon nor is there any legislation for this.  Indeed what has beensanctioned is reading the Qur’aan amongst the living so they can benefit and reflect upon the Book of Allaah and understand it.  As for reciting over the deceased at his grave or after his death &#8211; before his burial &#8211; or reading for him in any place so that the reward can be gifted to him, then we do not know of a foundation for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some scholars have authored works and written many books, of them there are those who have allowed and encouraged reciting the whole of the Qur’aan upon the deceased and they regarded it from the same category of giving charity with wealth.  There are those from the people of knowledge who say that these matters are dependent upon evidence; which means that they are from aspects of worship so it is not permissible to perform them except with what the <em>Sharia’ </em>affirms.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> said: ‘Whoever does an action which we have not commanded then it is rejected.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no evidence for this issue – as far as we know – which indicates the permissibility of reciting for the dead.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no evidence regarding this issue from what we know which indicates the legality of reading over the dead, so it is necessary to remain upon the original foundation which is that worship is dependent upon evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So reciting for the dead should not be done, in contrast to giving charity on their behalf, supplicating for them, Hajj, Umrah and paying off debts, then these matters benefit them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are texts which mention this and it is established from the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> that he said: ‘When the son of Aadam dies his actions are severed except for three: recurring charity,knowledge which he can benefit from or a righteous child who supplicates for him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah &#8211;<em>Subhanahu &#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And those who came after them [i.e. after his Companions] say: ‘Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in Faith, and put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed. Our Lord! You are indeed full of kindness, Most Merciful’ &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Hashr:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah has praised those who came later because they supplicated for those who preceded them.  This indicates theallowance of supplicating for the deceased of the Muslims and that itdoes benefit them.  Likewise, charity benefits them due to theaforementioned hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is possible to give charity to the poor and needy people with the money used to hire someone to recite over the dead with the intention that it is for the deceased and that the deceased benefits with this money and saves himself from the vulgarity of <em>Bida’</em>.<strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is established in the Saheeh that a man said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah my mother has passed away and did not leave a bequest and I think that if she had spoken she would have given charity.  Will she receive a reward if I gave charity on her behalf?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> said: ‘Yes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> clarified that charity on behalf of the deceased benefits him and likewise Hajj and Umrah on his behalf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are ahadeeth which mention this, likewise paying off debt benefits him.  As for a reward for the deceased for reciting Qur’aan or gifting it to the dead, praying or optional fasting on his behalf then all of this has no basis and what is correct is that it is not fromthe <em>Sharia’</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Majmoo’ Fatawa – Ibn Baaz vol. 4 p. 340- 341</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Imaam Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee<br />
SOURCE: &#8220;Kayfa yajibu &#8216;alaynaa an Nufassir al-Qur&#8217;aan&#8221; (pg. 11-17)<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[3] Question:</b> There are some who say that if a hadeeth contradicts an ayah in the Qur’aan, it should be rejected no matter what level of authenticity it has. Then they use as an example the hadeeth:<b>“Indeed the deceased person will be punished due to the weeping (i.e. wailing) of his family over him”</b>[1] and use the statement of ‘Aa’ishah in which she quoted Allaah’s saying to refute this hadeeth: <b>“And no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another.”</b> [Surah Faatir: 18] So how do we respond to those who say this?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[3] Answer:</b> Rejecting this hadeeth falls under the issues related to rejecting the Sunnah by way of the Qur’aan. So this shows the deviation of this way of thinking.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the response to this hadeeth – and I am referring here particularly to those who use the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah, may Allaah be pleased with her – then it is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>First:<br />
From a Hadeeth Standpoint:</b> There is no way to reject this hadeeth from a hadeeth standpoint due to two reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. It has been reported through an authentic chain of narration from Ibn ‘Umar (<i>radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</i>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Ibn ‘Umar (<i>radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</i>) is not alone in reporting it since he was followed in that by ‘Umar bin Al-Khattaab (<i>radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</i>). Furthermore, he and his son are both not alone in reporting it either, for they were also followed in that by Al-Mugheerah bin Shu’bah (<i>radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</i>). This is what comes to my mind at this time since the reports of all three of these Companions can be found in the two <i>Saheeh</i> Collections.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Additionally, if a person were to conduct an exclusive research on this hadeeth, he would find other paths of narration for it. These three ahaadeeth all have authentic chains of narration. So they cannot be rejected merely on the claim that they “contradict” the noble Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Second:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>From a Tafseer Standpoint:</b> This is since the scholars have explained this hadeeth in two ways:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. This hadeeth only applies to a deceased person who knew during the course of his life that his family would commit oppositions to the Religion after his death but yet he did not advise them. So (for example) he did not direct them to not weep over him since this weeping would serve as a means for him being punished in the grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The usage of the word <b>“the”</b> when referring to the <b>“deceased person”</b> is not all-encompassing and inclusive. So the hadeeth does not mean that <i>every</i> deceased person will be punished due to the crying of his family members. Rather, the word <b>“the”</b> here is for a specific designation, meaning it refers to only those who do not advise others to not commit what opposes the Religion after his death. So this is the type of person who will be punished by the weeping of his family over him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who takes charge of advising his family and directing them with religious guidelines such as not to wail over him and not to commit the offenses that are done particularly in these times, then such a person will not be punished. However, if he does not direct and advise (his family) with this, he will be punished.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the detailed breakdown that we must be aware of with regard to the first explanation. It is in accordance with the interpretation of many well known and famous scholars such as An-Nawawee and others. So when we come to comprehend this detailed breakdown, it becomes clear that there is in fact no contradiction between this hadeeth and Allaah’s statement: <b>“And no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another.”</b> [Surah Al-An’aam: 164]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A contradiction only arises if the word <b>“the”</b> in the word <b>“the deceased person”</b> is understood to be all-inclusive, meaning that it encompasses everyone who dies. This is where the hadeeth becomes obscure and contradicts the noble ayah in the Qur’aan. But if we understand the (true) meaning of the hadeeth that we just mentioned previously, then there is no more contradictions or obscurities since we would come to realize that the one who is being punished is only that way because he failed to advise and direct his family members (before his death). This is the first manner in which this hadeeth has been interpreted in order to repel this so-called “contradiction.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. A second interpretation has been mentioned by Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah, may Allaah have mercy on him, in some of his writings. And it is that the punishment here does not refer to the punishment in the grave or the punishment in the Hereafter but rather that it refers to pain and sorrow. Meaning: When a dead person hears his family members weeping over him, he will feel bad and sorrowful for their grief over his loss.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah said. If it were correct, it would remove the misconception from its root. However, I say: Such an explanation goes against two facts, which is why we can only rely on the first explanation of this hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The First Fact:</b> The report from Al-Mugheerah bin Shu’abah (<i>radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</i>) that I indicated previously has an addition to it, which clarifies that the punishment here does not refer to just pain and sorrow but rather to actual punishment, i.e. punishment in the Hellfire, unless Allaah grants His forgiveness. This is clearly stated in Allaah’s saying: <b>“Verily, Allaah does not forgive that partners be associated with Him (in worship), but He forgives what is less than that to whom He wills.”</b> [Surah An-Nisaa: 48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the narration of Al-Mugheerah (<i>radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</i>) it states: <b>“Indeed, the deceased person will be punished due to the weeping of his family over him on the Day of Judgement.”</b> So this clearly states that the deceased will be punished due to his family crying over him on the Day of Judgement and not in his grave, which is what Ibn Taimiyyah explained as meaning pain and sorrow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Second Fact:</b> When a person dies, he no longer has a sense of anything that goes on around him whether good or bad, as indicated by evidences from the Qur’aan and Sunnah, except in certain cases, which have been mentioned in some ahaadeeth either as a rule for every deceased person or for only some, such as those whom Allaah enables to hear certain things that will cause them pain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So firstly there is the hadeeth reported by Al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh from Anas bin Maalik (<i>radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</i>) in which he narrated that the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“Verily, when a servant (of Allaah) is placed in his grave, and his companions depart from him – at the point where he can still hear their footsteps – two angels come to him.”</b>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This authentic hadeeth affirms a special type of hearing that the deceased will have at the time of his burial while the people are walking away from him. This means that at the time the two angels come to sit by him, his soul returns to his body and in this state of being, he is able to hear the footsteps (of his loved ones walking away). So the hadeeth does not mean on the outset that this deceased person and all deceased people will have their souls returned to them and that they will remain with the ability to hear the footsteps of the people passing by the graves up until the day that they are resurrected. No.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a specific circumstance and a special type of hearing on the part of the deceased since his soul has come back to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, if we were to go by the interpretation of Ibn Taimiyyah, we would then be forced to expand the senses of the deceased person to include everything that goes on around him whether at the time he is being transferred to his grave before burial or after he is placed in his grave so that he can hear his living family members weeping over him. Such a claim requires textual proof, which is not present. This is the first point.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Secondly, some texts from the Qur’aan and the authentic Sunnah indicate that the deceased cannot hear. This is a vast topic and it requires an in-depth discussion. However I will mention one hadeeth with which I will conclude the answer to this question. And it is the statement of the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) in which he said: <b>“Verily, Allaah has angels that roam throughout earth who convey to me the greetings (of Salaam) on behalf of my ummah.”</b> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is meant by <b>“roam”</b> here is that they frequent gatherings. So every time a Muslim sends Salaat (praises) on the Prophet, there is an assigned angel that conveys this greeting from that Muslim to the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>). Therefore, if the deceased were able to hear, the one with the most right to hear out of all of those deceased would be our Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) due to Allaah’s favoring him and particularizing him with special qualities and attributes over all of the prophets, messengers, and rest of mankind. So if anyone had the ability to hear, it would be the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>). And furthermore, if the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) were able to hear anything after his death, he would hear the Salaat (praises) of his ummah on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So here we come to understand the error, or the deviation, of those who ask assistance – not from the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) – but rather from those less than him, whether messengers, prophets or righteous people. This is since if they were to ask assistance from the Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>), he would not be able to hear them as is clearly stated in the Qur’aan: <b>“And those whom you call besides Allaah are servants (of Allaah) just like you.”</b> [Surah Al-A’raaf: 194]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in His saying: <b>“If you supplicate to them, they cannot hear your supplication.”</b> [Surah Faatir: 14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, after they die, the deceased cannot hear unless there is some text that applies to a particular issue – as I mentioned before – such as the deceased hearing the footsteps. This concludes the answer to this question.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Shaikh Saalih Al-Fawzaan<br />
SOURCE: The end of his treatise &#8220;Tadabbur al-Qur&#8217;aan&#8221;<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are some questions and answers related the subject of this lecture, which we wanted to include here in order to complete the benefit:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>[1] Question:</b> It has been mentioned in a hadeeth that the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“The sins of my ummah were displayed before me, and so I didn’t see anything worse than that (sin) of a man who memorized a verse (from the Qur’aan) then forgot it.”</b> What does this hadeeth mean?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[1] Answer:</b>I am not aware of this hadeeth nor did I come across it in my research. However, I will note that forgetfulness is of two types: The first type is when forgetfulness occurs due to someone becoming confused and distracted or due to some sickness that has stricken him. In this case, he will not be held accountable for his forgetfulness. The second type is if the forgetfulness occurs due to him turning away from reciting the Book of Allaah. In this case, the person will be held accountable for his action, since he forgot it due to negligence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>[2] Question: </b>Noble Shaikh, I try to read the Noble Qur’aan and I love the Book of Allaah greatly. However, the matter becomes difficult for me and I am not able to complete my recitation. What is the solution to this problem?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[2] Answer: </b>The solution can be found in that which Allaah has instructed when He said: <b>“So when you recite the Qur’aan, seek refuge in Allaah from the outcast Devil. Verily, he has no power over those who believe and put their trust in their Lord (Allaah). His power is only over those who obey and follow him and those who associate partners in worship with Him (i.e. Allaah).”</b> [Surah An-Nahl: 98-100]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has instructed us to seek refuge in Him from the outcast Devil before reciting the Qur’aan. This is so that Allaah can remove and distance this enemy from us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And you must also always reflect on the Qur’aan, since reflecting on it is one of the things that will cause you to be conscious about it and incite you towards the noble Qur’aan. All of your longing should not be geared towards just completing a surah or finishing up a juz and so on. Rather, your objective in reciting the Qur’aan should be to reflect and ponder upon the meaning of what you recite from the verses of Allaah. The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) would prolong his recitation during the Night Prayer, and he would not pass upon a verse related to Allaah’s Mercy except that he would stop and ask Allaah (for Mercy), nor would he pass upon a verse in which (Allaah’s) punishment was mentioned except that he would stop and seek refuge in Allaah (from that). All of this shows that he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) would recite the Qur’aan whilst reflecting on it and having a conscious and attentive heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>[3] Question: </b>What is your advice to the youth concerning the simplest way to memorize the Book of Allaah?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[3] Answer: </b>The Qur’aan is simple and easy to memorize. Allaah says: <b>“And We have indeed made the Qur’aan easy to understand and remember, so is there anyone who will remember it?”</b> [Surah Al-Qamar: 17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The problem lies in a person’s determination and the truthfulness of his intention. So if a person has true determination and a strong interest in the Qur’aan, Allaah will facilitate and make easy his memorization of it. There are also some other things one could do to help in memorizing the Qur’aan such as allotting a specific suitable time every day for attending classes with one who teaches the Qur’aan in the masjid. All praise be to Allaah, the teachers today are many. You will not find a neighborhood except that amongst them there lives one who teaches the Qur’aan. This is a great opportunity that didn’t exist in previous times. So a person should choose anyone of the many gatherings or anyone of the many teachers present today and constantly attend these gatherings/sittings with a teacher daily until he completes the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should also constantly repeat over and over again what you recite, until it becomes firmly established in your heart and mind. You must also act upon (what you learn from) the Book of Allaah, for that is the greatest means of learning the Qur’aan. Allaah says: <b>“So be dutiful to Allaah and Allaah will teach you. And Allaah is the All-Knower of everything.” </b>[Surah Al-Baqarah: 282]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>[4] Question:</b> Noble Shaikh, there are many books of tafseer, so which tafseer do you advise (us) to read. May Allaah reward you well.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[4] Answer: </b>The books of Tafseer are many, all praise be to Allaah. This is from the blessings of Allaah. However, these books of Tafseer vary – amongst them are those that are long and in depth and those that are short and abridged, as well as those that are free from errors and those that contain errors, particularly in matters of Creed. What I advise my brothers from amongst the youth to read is the Tafseer of Ibn Katheer for it is the greatest of tafseers and the one that uses the best way and method (for interpreting the Qur’aan) in spite of it being abridged. This is since he (i.e. Ibn Katheer) has interpreted the Qur’aan using the Qur’aan first, then by using the Prophetic Sunnah, then with the statements of the Salaf, and finally by using the requisites of Arabic, the language in which it was revealed. So it is a precise and reliable tafseer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also the tafseer of Al-Baghawee and the tafseer of Ibn Jareer At-Tabaree, which is a comprehensive and all-inclusive tafseer. These tafseer books are trustworthy. There is also the tafseer of Shaikh ‘Abdur-Rahmaan As-Sa’adee, which is an excellent tafseer using simple expressions which contain tremendous knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the remaining tafseer books, they are good in some aspects, however they have errors in them, especially in matters of Creed. It is not proper for anyone to read these types of tafseer books except for the person that is proficient in knowledge to the point that he is able to take the good from it and avoid its errors. But as for the beginner, he is not able to do this, so he must take from the tafseer books that do not contain dangers and errors, such as the Tafseer of Ibn Katheer, the Tafseer of Al-Baghawee and the Tafseer of Al-Haafidh Ibn Jareer. All of these books of tafseer are valuable and excellent, all praise be to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>[5] Question: </b>What are the most important lessons that a student of knowledge should begin with, and what advice do you give him? Also, what do you say concerning someone that makes excuses for himself from studying when we desire to take him to attend lessons and lectures?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[5] Answer: </b>The student of knowledge (in Riyadh) must enroll himself in one of the educational institutes under the Imaam Muhammad bin Su’ood Islamic University for they have excellent curriculums that are arranged according to the levels of the students – step by step – the first year, then the second year, then the third and the fourth. There is a curriculum for each year, which differs from the curriculum of the previous year and they progress in levels after each year. These are curriculums that have been chosen by our scholars and teachers who did well in establishing these institutes and selecting syllabuses for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I advise the student of knowledge to enroll in one of these institutes, however he is able to do that. Thereafter, he should register with one of the collegiate faculties of the University, such as the faculty of Sharee’ah, the faculty of Usool-ud-Deen, the faculty of Hadeeth and its Sciences, the faculty of the Arabic Language and so on. If the student of knowledge is not able to enroll in one of these institutes and collegiate faculties, he should try to make time to sit in the classes of the scholars who teach in the masaajid. And they, all praise be to Allaah, are many and the classes they give cover a wide range of Islamic sciences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I advise the student of knowledge to firmly adhere to these classes, whether those given in the University or those held in the masaajid. So it is not enough for him that he attend classes one week then is absent from them for several weeks afterward or that he attend one month, then is absent for several months. This person will not benefit at all. This is since if he misses out on receiving some of the knowledge, there will remain a void in his mind and comprehension and he will miss out on much good. So the student of knowledge must have diligence, a strong interest and eagerness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>[6] Question: </b>Noble Shaikh, what is your opinion concerning what some people do today in that when the Imaam passes by a verse related to (Allaah&#8217;s) punishment during prayer, they seek refuge in Allaah (out loud) even though they are praying, and when he passes by a verse related to (Allaah&#8217;s) Mercy, they supplicate to Allaah. What is the ruling on this? May Allaah reward you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[6] Answer: </b>there is no doubt that this is something prescribed in the supererogatory prayers since the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) would do it in the recommended prayers. As for the obligatory prayers, then I hold that is not legislated to do this since the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) would not do this in the obligatory prayers. Rather, he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) would only do this in the recommended prayers. So the one following in prayer should remain silent for the Qur&#8217;aan during prayer and not say anything at all. Allaah says: <b>“And when the Qur&#8217;aan is recited, then listen to it and be silent in order that you may gain mercy.”</b> [Surah Al-A&#8217;raaf: 204]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad, may Allaah be pleased with him, said: “This ayah was revealed concerning the prayer” &#8211; meaning: The reason it was revealed was with regard to the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the one following in prayer should listen to the recitation of his Imaam during the obligatory prayer and not supplicate (to Allaah) upon hearing a verse related to Mercy or seek refuge in Allaah (by saying &#8216;Audhu billaah) upon hearing a verse related to punishment. This only applies to the recommended prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>[7] Question: </b>Noble Shaikh, there is an Imaam in one of the masaajid in Riyadh that has a beautiful and pleasant voice when reciting the Qur’aan. This is such that people have begun to go pray with him in large amounts from remote areas, leaving off the masaajid in their vicinities. They do this during the prayers in which the Qur’aan is recited out loud and especially during the nights of Ramadaan for Taraaweeh. Is this permissible? Please benefit us, may Allaah reward you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[7] Answer: </b>Yes, this is a phenomenon that exists today, and it is that many people gather together in one of the masaajid, coming from distant areas, just for this masjid. This is something that is not encouraged, and I don’t consider it to be a good practice, since it is better to pray in and frequent the masjid that is in the vicinity of your home. The reason for this is because there is less of a burden in doing this and also because it is less likely that one will do this for showing off or to be seen by the people. Furthermore, there may occur personal differences and division between the Imaam of the abandoned masjid and his former congregation who no longer pray with him. If the people abandon their masaajid and instead go to pray in specified masaajid, the other masaajid will become inactive and close down. So I don’t approve of this. It is better for the residents of an area to pray in the masjid of that area.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Secondly, if too many people accumulate in one masjid, this may lead to people praying in the streets. And praying in the streets is not permissible except in cases of emergency, such as during the ‘Eid prayer or the Jumu’ah prayer, for in these occasions, the masjid becomes constricted and it is permissible to pray in the streets in these situations – when the masjid is overcrowded, since this is not done in other than these occasions. So if the result of too many people gathering in one of the masaajid is that the people will end up praying in the streets, on occasions other than the Jumu’ah prayer, then this is not permissible because praying in the streets is only allowed in cases of emergency.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>[8] Question: </b>Noble Shaikh, what is the ruling on one who recites the Qur’aan whilst not having wudoo, regardless of whether he recites from memory or from the <i>mus-haf?</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[8] Answer: </b>It is permissible for a person to recite the Qur’aan without having wudoo if he recites from his memory. This is since nothing prevented the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) from reciting the Qur’aan except for <i>Janaabah</i> (sexual impurity). He (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) would recite the Qur’aan whilst in a state of wudoo and without it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <i>mus-haf</i>, it is not permissible for someone who has broken his wudoo to touch it, regardless of whether it is the minor form of impurity or the major form. Allaah says: <b>“No one touches it except for the pure.”</b> [Surah Al-Waaqi’ah: 79] This means: “Those who are pure and free from impurities, uncleanness and Shirk.” Also in the hadeeth, the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) wrote a letter to his vice-regent ‘Amr bin Hazm in which he instructed him: <b>“No one should touch the mus-haf except for the purified.” </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is also the view that has been unanimously agreed upon by the four Imaams – that it is not permissible for one in the state of impurity – whether major or minor state – to touch the <i>mus-haf</i>except from behind a covering, such as when the <i>mus-haf</i> is in a box or a bag or if one touches it using one’s garment or sleeve as a barrier.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>[9] Question: </b>What is your opinion concerning someone who preoccupies himself with the significant affairs of the Muslims, such as Calling to Allaah and raising the youth upon the noble Qur’aan and the purified Sunnah, but does not find time to memorize the Qur’aan? What is your advice to these kinds of people?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[9] Answer: </b>It is obligatory upon the Caller to first become qualified before he sets out on Da’wah (Calling), by way of studying the noble Qur’aan, its meanings and interpretation, and by way of studying the prophetic Sunnah, as much as he is able to, reading its explanation and learning the religious laws. So it is obligatory upon the Caller to Allaah to be qualified. No one is fit for Da’wah (Calling) except for he who has knowledge. Allaah says: <b>“Say: This is my path, I call to it upon clear insight – I and those who follow me.”</b> [Surah Yoosuf: 108]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“Clear insight”</b> here refers to knowledge and wisdom. Allaah says: <b>“Call to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good admonition.”</b> [Surah An-Nahl: 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, an ignorant person is not fit to carry out the Da’wah since perhaps he might mess up the Da’wah by making lawful the forbidden or making unlawful the permitted. Or he may be severe on a matter that does not require that harshness be applied and so on. So there must be conditions for the Caller, amongst which the most fundamental of these conditions is that he acquires knowledge by which he can call the people to the Religion of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, perhaps doubt-raising arguments may be presented to the Caller for which he will need to provide answers. So if he is ignorant, how can he respond to these doubts?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can he reply to the objections of his opponents? How can he confront the deviants, sinners and confused individuals? If he doesn’t have knowledge, he will indeed face defeat in front of them. So the Caller must have knowledge of the Qur’aan, the prophetic Sunnah, the Hadeeth, Fiqh (Jurisprudence), ‘Aqeedah (Creed) and all of the other Islamic sciences.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Imaam Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee<br />
SOURCE: &#8220;Kayfa yajibu &#8216;alaynaa an Nufassir al-Qur&#8217;aan&#8221; (pg. 17-19)<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the upcoming E-Book <b>&#8220;How are we Obligated to Interpret the Qur&#8217;aan&#8221;</b> of Imaam Al-Albaanee, <i>rahimahullaah</i>, being a translation of the booklet &#8220;<i>Kayfa yajibu &#8216;alaynaa an Nufassir al-Qur&#8217;aan</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[4] Question:</b> In the case where a recorder is turned on and the recitation of the noble Qur’aan is played, but some of the surrounding people do not listen to it because they’re busy talking with one another, what is the ruling concerning their not listening to the Qur’aan? Are these people sinning or just the person who plays the Qur’aan on the recorder?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[4] Answer:</b> The answer to this issue varies depending on the different scenarios in which the Qur’aan is being recited from the recorder. So if the scenario is a gathering of knowledge, remembrance and the recitation of the Qur’aan, then in this situation, it is obligatory to pay complete attention to it. And whoever doesn’t do so, is sinning because he is disobeying Allaah’s statement in the Qur’aan: <b>“And when the Qur’aan is recited, then listen to it and remain silent, in order that you may receive mercy.”</b> [Surah Al-A’raaf: 204]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if it is not a gathering of knowledge, remembrance and recitation of the Qur’aan, but rather, a normal gathering, such as when a person works at home or studies or researches, then in this situation it is not permissible for this person to turn the recorder on and raise the volume of the recitation such that the sound reaches the ears of the other people inside the house or gathering. This is since, in this scenario, these people are not responsible for listening to the Qur’aan, since they did not gather for that occasion. The one who will be held accountable is the person who raises the volume on the recorder and causes everyone else to hear it. This is since he is burdening the people and forcing them to listen to the Qur’aan in a situation in which they are not prepared to do this type of listening.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The closest example we can give of this is when one of us walks down a street and hears the sounds of the butter merchant and the falafel sellers as well as the one who sells these recorded cassette tapes. So the sound of the Qur’aan fills the street, and wherever you go, you hear its sound. So are those people who walk on the street – everyone on his separate way – responsible and required to remain silent for this Qur’aan that is being recited in other than its proper place?! No, rather the one who will be held accountable is only the person who burdens the people by causing them to hear the sound of the Qur’aan, whether because he does it for business purposes or because he wants to get the people’s attention or for whatever other materialistic gains he does it for.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, they are treating the Qur’aan, from one perspective, as musical instruments, as occurs in some ahaadeeth.[1] So they are purchasing a small gain with Allaah’s verses through this method, which differs from the method used by the Jews and the Christians, about whom Allaah said: <b>“They purchased a small gain with the verses of Allaah.”</b> [Surah At-Tawbah: 9]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">From the upcoming E-Book <b>&#8220;How are we Obligated to Interpret the Qur&#8217;aan&#8221;</b> of Imaam Al-Albaanee, <i>rahimahullaah</i>, being a translation of the booklet &#8220;<i>Kayfa yajibu &#8216;alaynaa an Nufassir al-Qur&#8217;aan</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Question:</b> What is the ruling on kissing the Qur’aan?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer:</b> According to our beliefs, this act falls into the general meaning of certain ahaadeeth (forbidding innovations), such as the Prophet’s (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) statement: <b>“Beware of newly invented matters for indeed every newly invented matter is an innovation, and every innovation is a misguidance.”</b> [1] And in one narration of the hadeeth, it states: <b>“And every misguidance is in the Hellfire.”</b> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many people hold a certain position with regard to this issue, saying: “What’s wrong with that? It’s only a way of showing our love and respect for this noble Qur’aan.” So we say to them: Yes, that’s true. This only shows one’s love and respect for the noble Qur’aan. However, was this form of respect hidden from the first generation, which consisted of the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger? And likewise was it unknown to those who succeeded the Companions (Taabi’een), as well as their successors (Atbaa’ at-Taabi’een) who came after them? No doubt the answer will be as the scholars amongst the Salaf used to say: “If it were good, they would have preceded us in (doing) it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is one perspective. As for another perspective then we must ask the question: What is the foundation with regard to kissing something – that it is permissible or forbidden?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This requires us to mention the hadeeth reported by the two Shaikhs (Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim) in their Saheeh collection, to remind those who wish to remember, and to make it known how far the Muslims are today from their righteous predecessors, their understanding and their methods used to resolve matters that occurred to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hadeeth I’m referring to is the one reported by ‘Abbaas bin Rabee’ah who narrated: “I saw ‘Umar bin Al-Khattaab (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) kissing the (Black) Stone and saying: <b>‘I know that you are just a stone and that you can’t cause harm or bring benefit. So if it weren’t that I saw the Messenger of Allaah kissing you, I would not have kissed you.’”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is the meaning of these words from Al-Faarooq: <b>“If it weren’t that I saw the Messenger of Allaah kissing you, I would not have kissed you?!”</b> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So why then did ‘Umar kiss the Black Stone, which as is stated in the authentic hadeeth: <b>“The Black Stone is from Paradise?”</b> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Did he kiss it based on some logical reasoning that came from him, like that made by those who this question is about, who use their logic on this issue, saying: “This is the Speech of Allaah, and we will kiss it?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Did ‘Umar say: “This stone is a relic from Paradise, which was promised to those who obey Allaah, so I will kiss it – I don’t need any text from Allaah’s Messenger to show me that it is legislated (in the Religion) to kiss it?!” Or did he treat this “trivial” matter, as some people nowadays want to say, with the slogan that we invite to, which we call the Salafee slogan &#8211; which is sincerely following only the Messenger and those who abide by his Sunnah until the Day of Judgement? This was the stance of ‘Umar (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>), such that he said: <b>“If it weren’t that I saw the Messenger of Allaah kissing you, I would not have kissed you?!”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the foundation with regard to this type of kissing is that we treat it based on the past Sunnah, not that we pass judgement on matters based on our whims, as we indicated earlier, such that we say (for example): “This is something good, so what’s wrong with it?!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Recall with me what the (first) reaction of Zayd bin Thaabit (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) was when Abu Bakr and ‘Umar presented him with the task of compiling the Qur’aan in order to protect it from being lost. He (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) told them: <b>“How can you do something that the Messenger of Allaah didn’t do?”</b> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But the Muslims of today do not have this kind of understanding at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it is said to the one who kisses the mus-haf: <b>“How can you do something that Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) didn’t do?”</b> He will counter you with many strange answers, such as: “My brother, what’s wrong with that?! I’m only showing respect for the Qur’aan!” So tell him: “My brother, these words fall back on you! Are you saying the Messenger of Allaah didn’t used to show respect to the Qur’aan?!” There is no doubt that the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) used to respect the Qur’aan, but in spite of this, he wouldn’t kiss it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or they may argue: “You forbid us from kissing the Qur’aan, yet look at you, you ride in cars and travel by plane. And these things are innovations!” The refutation of this is based on what you heard previously – that the innovation that is misguidance is only that which occurs with regard to the Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those innovations that occur with regard to worldly matters, then as we stated previously, they may at times be permissible and at times be prohibited, and so on. This is something that is well known, and needs no examples.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a person that rides aboard a plane in order to travel to the Sacred House so that he can make pilgrimage (Hajj), there is no doubt that this is permissible. And a person that rides on board a plane in order to travel to the west to make pilgrimage there, there is no doubt this is a sin, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for matters related to worship, for which if someone is asked about it: “Why do you do it(?)”, his reply is: “To get close to Allaah!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: There is no way to get closer to Allaah except by that which Allaah legislated and prescribed. However, I would like to remind you about something which, in my opinion, is very important for strengthening and supporting this principle <b>“Every innovation is a misguidance”</b> – there being no room for my intellect to consent with it at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the Salaf used to say: <b>“No innovation is introduced except that a Sunnah is caused to die.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I take this fact to heart as if I can feel it with my hand, due to my constant scrutinization of matters to see if the are innovations, and if they contradict what the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) brought,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the true people of knowledge and virtue take hold of the Qur’aan in order to recite from it, you do no see them kissing it. Rather, they only act in accordance to what is in it. But as for the common people, who have not set of rules or guidelines to curb their emotions, then they say: “What’s wrong with that?” But yet they don’t act in accordance to what is found in it (from laws and rulings)!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we say: <b>“No innovation is introduced except that a Sunnah is caused to die.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is another innovation similar to this one. We see some people – even the vile sinners amongst them who only have a small portion of Faith left in their hearts – who when they hear the Mu’adhin calling to prayer, they stand up! And when you ask them: “Why are you standing up?” They reply: “Out of respect for Allaah!!” But yet, they don’t even go to the masaajid! They spend their time playing chess and backgammon and so on. And yet, they believe they are showing respect to their Lord by standing up like this. Where did this form of standing come from?? Naturally, it came from a fabricated hadeeth that has no source to it, which is: <b>“When you hear the Adhaan (call to prayer), then stand up.”</b> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no source for this hadeeth. Rather, it came by way of a distortion (of an authentic hadeeth) by some weak narrators and liars, who reported <b>“Stand”</b> (qoomoo) instead of <b>“Say”</b> (qooloo), whilst at the same time abridging the authentic hadeeth: <b>“When you hear the Adhaan, then say (qooloo) just as he says. Then send Salaat upon me…”</b> [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So look at how the Devil beautifies innovations to people, such that they feel content with themselves that they are believers who respect the rites of Allaah – the proof for this being: when they take the mus-haf, they kiss it, and when they hear the Adhaan, they stand up!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But does he act upon the Qur’aan? He doesn’t act upon the Qur’aan! So, for example, he may pray, but does he avoid delving into prohibitions? Does he avoid taking interest or giving it? Does he avoid spreading amongst the people the means that will increase them in their disobedience to Allaah? Does he…Does he…, and so on and so forth?? These questions may never end. This is why we stop and suffice with that which Allaah has legislated for us from acts of obedience and worship without adding one single letter to that. This is since the matter is as the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“I have not left behind anything that Allaah commanded you with except that I ordered you to do it.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this thing that you do, will it bring you closer to Allaah? If the answer is yes, then bring a text from Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) concerning that. Their answer will be: “There is no text for that.” So therefore, it is an innovation, and every innovation is a misguidance and every misguidance is in the Hellfire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No one should find difficulty with this issue saying: “This is a minor issue, but yet in spite of that, it’s a misguidance that will take the one who does it to the Hellfire??”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ash-Shaatibee responded to the likes of this question, saying: “Every innovation, no matter how small it may be, is misguidance.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should not look at this ruling – in the fact that it’s misguidance – to the innovation itself. Rather, one should look at this ruling to the place in which this innovation has been newly introduced into. What is this place? The place I am referring to is the Legislation of Islaam, which is perfect and complete. So it is not proper for anyone to try to “amend it” by introducing an innovation into it, whether big or small. This is where the <b>“misguidance”</b> of innovations comes from. The misguidance doesn’t come from just him introducing the innovation into Islaam, but rather because of the fact that he is giving (himself) the ability to amend the Legislation (of Islaam), above that of our Lord and above our Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Take what you wish from the Qur’aan for whatever you wish.&#8221;<br />
AUTHOR: Imaam Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee<br />
SOURCE: His treatise: &#8220;Kayfa Yajibu &#8216;alaynaa an Nufassir al-Qur&#8217;aan&#8221;<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p>[<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/take-what-you-wish-from-the-qur_aan-for-whatever-you-wish-e28093-shaykh-al-albaanee-al-ibaanah-com.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>Read or Download PDF</strong></a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[1] <strong>Question</strong>: Noble Shaikh, I read a hadeeth in a small book, which states: <strong>“Take what you wish from the Qur’aan for whatever you wish (i.e. need).”</strong> Is this hadeeth authentic? Please benefit us, may Allaah reward you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] <strong>Answer</strong>: This hadeeth:<strong> “Take what you wish from the Qur’aan for whatever you wish (i.e. need)”</strong> is a hadeeth that has become famous amongst some tongues. But unfortunately, it is one of those hadeeths that have no basis in the Sunnah. So because of this, it is not permissible to report it or ascribe it to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, this vast and comprehensive understanding (found in the hadeeth) is not valid and not established at all in the Legislation of Islaam: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Take what you wish from the Qur’aan for whatever you wish.”</strong></span> So for example, (this hadeeth indicates that) I can just sit at home and not go out to work in my job or occupation, instead seeking sustenance from my Lord – that He send it down to me from the sky – since I am taking what I wish from the Qur’aan! Who says such a thing!!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, this is a false statement. Perhaps it is a narration that was fabricated by those lazy Sufis who are accustomed to sitting and residing in those places they call ribaataat (hospices). They gather in these areas and sit there awaiting Allaah’s sustenance from those people who bring it to them. This is in spite of them knowing that this is not from the nature of a Muslim since the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم nurtured everyone to have high aspirations and to be dignified, as he صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The upper hand is better than the lower hand. The upper hand is the one that gives and the lower hand is the one that asks (i.e. begs).”</strong> </span>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning this topic, I was amazed by a story I once read regarding one of these ascetics and Sufis, but I will not prolong it since their tales are many and bizarre:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">They claim that one of them went out one time traveling throughout the land without any provisions. So it got to the point that he was about to die from hunger when a village appeared to him from afar, so he walked to it. This was on a Friday. According to his perception, he had gone out while putting all of his reliance upon Allaah. So in order not to invalidate this so called “reliance”, according to his view, he didn’t make himself visible to the gathering of people in the masjid. Rather, he hid himself under the mimbar (pulpit) so that no one would notice him. But he kept telling himself that perhaps someone would detect him. In the meantime, the speaker (khateeb) delivered his sermon and this man failed to pray along with the congregation! After, the Imaam finished giving his sermon and praying, the people began exiting the doors of the masjid in groups and individually. This was such that the man felt that the masjid would soon be empty, at which point the doors would be locked and he would remain alone in the masjid without any food or drink.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">So he had no choice but to make some sounds like that of one clearing his throat in order to let those present known that he was there. Some people realized someone was there so they went and found a man that looked like he had nearly transformed to just bones due to hunger and thirst. The people took hold of him and rushed to assist him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">They asked him: “Who are you, sir?”</span><br />
<span style="color:#800080;"> He replied: “I am a zaahid (ascetic), one who puts his reliance in Allaah.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">They said: “How can you say ‘I am one who puts his reliance in Allaah’ when you almost died. If you had truly put your reliance in Allaah, you would not have asked (for help), nor would you have alerted the people to your presence by clearing your throat. And as a result you would have died due to your sin!”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an example of the extent that can be reached due to the likes of this hadeeth: “Take what you wish from the Qur’aan for whatever you wish (i.e. need).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To summarize: This hadeeth has no basis to it.</p>

Chapter 183<br />
Inducement towards the Recitation of some Special verses and Surah of the Noble<br />
Qur&#8217;an</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1009.</b> Abu Sa`id Ar-Rafi<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">`</span> bin Al-Mu`alla (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Shall I teach you the greatest Surah in the Qur&#8217;an before you leave the mosque?&#8221; Then he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), took me by the hand, and when we were about to step out, I reminded him of his promise to teach me the greatest Surah in the Qur&#8217;an. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;It is `Alhamdu lillahi Rabbil `Alamin (i.e., Surat Al-Fatihah) which is As-Sab` Al-Mathani (i.e., the seven oft-repeated Ayat) and the Great Qur&#8217;an which is given to me</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1010.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported about Surat Al-Ikhlas (Chapter 112): The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, it is equivalent to one-third of the Qur&#8217;an</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to another version, he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to his Companions, &#8220;Is anyone of you incapable of reciting one-third of the Qur&#8217;an in one night?&#8221; They considered it burdensome and said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, which of us can afford to do that?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Surat Al-Ikhlas [Say: He is Allah (the) One] is equivalent t</span>o<span style="color:#0000ff;"> one-third of the Qur&#8217;an.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1011.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A man heard another reciting Surat Al-Ikhlas repeatedly. The next morning he came to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and informed him about it as if he considered it to be of little reward. On that the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, this Surah is equal to one-third of the Qur&#8217;an</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1012.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Surat Ikhlas is equivalent to one-third of the Qur&#8217;an</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1013.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A man said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! I love Surat-Al-Ikhlas [Say: He is Allah, (the) One].&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Your love for it will admit you to Jannah</span>.&#8221;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1014.</b> `Uqbah bin `Amir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do you not know that last night certain Ayat were revealed the like of which there is no precedence. They are: `Say: I seek refuge with (Allah) the Rubb of the daybreak&#8217; (Surah 113), and `Say: I seek refuge with (Allah) the Rubb of mankind&#8217; (Surah 114)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1015.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to seek protection against the evil of jinn and the evil eyes till Surat Al-Falaq and Surat An-Nas were revealed. After they were revealed, he took to them for seeking Allah&#8217;s protection and left everything besides them</span>.<br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1016.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">There is a Surah in the Qur&#8217;an which contains thirty Ayat which kept interceding for a man until his sins are forgiven. This Surah is `Blessed is He in Whose Hand is the dominion.&#8217; (Surat Al-Mulk 67)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi and Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1017.</b> Abu Mas`ud Al-Badri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who recites the two Ayat at the end of Surat Al-Baqarah at night, they will suffice him</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1018.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do not turn your houses into graveyards. Satan runs away from the house in which Surat Al-Baqarah is recited</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1019.</b> Ubayy bin Ka`b (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Abu Mundhir! Do you know which Ayah in Allah&#8217;s Book is the greatest?</span>&#8221; I replied: &#8220;It is `Allah la ilaha illa Huwal-Haiyul-Qayum (<span style="color:#ff0000;">Allah! none has the right to be worshipped but He, the Ever Living</span><span style="color:#800000;">.</span>..)&#8217;.&#8221; (2:255) Thereupon he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) patted me in the chest and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Rejoice by this knowledge, O Abu Mundhir</span>!&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1020.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) put me in charge of charity of Ramadan (Sadaqat-ul-Fitr). Somebody came to me and began to take away some food-stuff. I caught him and said, &#8220;I must take you to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam).&#8221; He said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">I am a needy man with a large family, and so I have a pressing need.</span>&#8221; I let him go. When I saw the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) next morning, he asked me, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">O Abu Hurairah! What did your captive do last night?</span>&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! He complained of a pressing need and a big family. I felt pity for him so I let him go.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He told you a lie and he will return</span>.&#8221; I was sure, according to the saying of the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) that he would return. I waited for him. He sneaked up again and began to steal food-stuff from the Sadaqah. I caught him and said; &#8220;I must take you to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam).&#8221; He said, &#8220;Let go of me, I am a needy man. I have to bear the expenses of a big family. I will not come back.&#8221; So I took pity on him and let him go. I went at dawn to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) who asked me, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">O Abu Hurairah! What did your captive do last night</span>?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! He complained of a pressing want and the burden of a big family. I took pity on him and so I let him go.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He told you a lie and he will return</span>.&#8221; (That man) came again to steal the food-stuff. I arrested him and said, &#8220;I must take you to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), and this is the last of three times. You promised that you would not come again but you did.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Let go of me, I shall teach you some words with which Allah may benefit you.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What are those words?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;When you go to bed, recite Ayat-ul-Kursi (2:255) for there will be a guardian appointed over you from Allah, and Satan will not be able to approach you till morning.&#8221; So I let him go. Next morning the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) asked me, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">What did your prisoner do last night</span>.&#8221; I answered, &#8220;He promised to teach me some words which he claimed will benefit me before Allah. So I let him go.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) asked, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">What are those words that he taught you?</span>&#8221; I said, &#8220;He told me: `When you go to bed, recite Ayat-ul-Kursi from the beginning to the end  i.e.,[<span style="color:#ff0000;"> Allah! none has the right to be worshipped but He, the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists. Neither slumber nor sleep overtakes Him. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His Permission? He knows what happens to them (His creatures) in this world, and what will happen to them in the Hereafter. And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He wills. His Kursi encompasses the heavens and the earth, and preserving them does not fatigue Him. And He is the Most High, the Most Great</span>].&#8217; (2:255). He added: `By reciting it, there will be a guardian appointed over you from Allah who will protect you during the night, and Satan will not be able to come near you until morning&#8217;.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Verily, he has told you the truth  though he is a liar. O Abu Hurairah! Do you know with whom you were speaking for the last three nights</span>?&#8221; I said, &#8220;No.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He was Shaitan (Satan)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1021.</b> Abud-Darda&#8217; (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Whoever commits to memory the first ten Ayat of the Surat Al-Kahf, will be protected from (the trial of) Ad-Dajjal (Antichrist)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration, the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">(Whoever commits to memory) the last ten Ayat of Surat Al-Kahf, he will be protected from (the trial of) Ad-Dajjal (Antichrist).</span>&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1022.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: While Jibril (Gabriel) was sitting with the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), he heard a sound above him. He lifted his head, and said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;This is a gate which has been opened in heaven today. It was never opened before</span>.&#8221; Then an angel descended through it, he said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">This is an angel who has come down to earth. He never came down before</span>.&#8221; He sent greetings and said: &#8220;Rejoice with two lights given to you. Such lights were not given to any Prophet before you. These (lights) are: Fatihah-til-Kitab (Surat Al-Fatihah), and the concluding Ayat of Surat Al-Baqarah. You will never recite a word from them without being given the blessings it contain<span style="color:#008000;">                                                          s</span>.&#8221;<br />

Warning against forgetting the Qur&#8217;an</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1002.</b> Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Read the Qur&#8217;an regularly.

[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1007.</b> Abu Lubabah Bashir bin `Abdul-Mundhir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who does not recite the Qur&#8217;an in a pleasant tone is not of us.</span>&#8221;<br />

The Excellence of Reciting the Qur&#8217;an</h5>

[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>992.</b> An-Nawwas bin Sam`an (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The Qur&#8217;an and its people who applied it, will be brought on the Day of Resurrection preceded with Surat Al-Baqarah and Surat Al-`Imran arguing on behalf of those who applied them</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>993.</b> `Uthman bin `Affan (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The best amongst you is the one who learns the Qur&#8217;an and teaches it</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>994.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The one who is proficient in the recitation of the Qur&#8217;an will be with the honourable and obedient scribes (angels) and he who recites the Qur&#8217;an and finds it difficult to recite, doing his best to recite it in the best way possible, will have a double reward.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>995.</b> Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The believer who recites the Qur&#8217;an is like a citron whose fragrance is sweet and whose taste is delicious. A believer who does not recite the Qur&#8217;an is like a date-fruit which has no fragrance but has a sweet taste. The hypocrite who recites the Qur&#8217;an is like a colocynth whose fragrance is so sweet, but its taste is bitter. The hypocrite who does not recite the Qur&#8217;an is like basil which has no fragrance and its taste is bitter</span>.&#8221;<br />

[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>997.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Envy is justified in regard to two types of persons only: a man whom Allah has given knowledge of the Qur&#8217;an, and so he recites it during the night and during the day; and a man whom Allah has given wealth and so he spends from it during the night and during the day</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>998.</b> Al-Bara&#8217; bin `Azib (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: A man was reciting Surat Al-Kahf, and a horse was tied with two ropes beside him. As he was reciting, a cloud overshadowed him, and as it began to come nearer and nearer, the horse began to trample voilently. The man came to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) in the morning and mentioned the incident to him. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">That was tranquillity which descended as a result of the recitation of the Qur&#8217;an.</span>&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>999.</b> Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Whoever recites a letter from the Book of Allah, he will be credited with a good deed, and a good deed gets a ten-fold reward. I do not say that Alif-Lam-Mim is one letter, but Alif is a letter, Lam is a letter and Mim is a letter</span>.&#8221;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1000.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who does not memorize any part from the Qur&#8217;an he is like the ruined house.</span>&#8221;<br />

<h3 align="center">Holding Fast to the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.092.373"></a>Volume 9, Book 92, Number 373:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Tariq bin Shihab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Jew said to &#8216;Umar, &#8220;O Chief of the Believers, if this verse: &#8216;This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favors upon you, and have chosen for you, Islam as your religion.&#8217; (5.3) had been revealed upon us, we would have taken that day as an &#8216;Id (festival) day.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I know definitely on what day this Verse was revealed; it was revealed on the day of &#8216;Arafat, on a Friday.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 374:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That he heard &#8216;Umar speaking while standing on the pulpit of the Prophet in the morning (following the death of the Prophet), when the people had sworn allegiance to Abu Bakr. He said the Tashah-hud before Abu Bakr, and said, &#8220;Amma Ba&#8217;du (then after) Allah has chosen for his Apostle what is with Him (Paradise) rather than what is with you (the world). This is that Book (Quran) with which Allah guided your Apostle, so stick to it, for then you will be guided on the right path as Allah guided His Apostle with it.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 375:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet embraced me and said, &#8220;O Allah! Teach him (the knowledge of) the Book (Quran).&#8221;</p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 377:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah bin Dinar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah Bin &#8216;Umar wrote to &#8216;Abdul Malik bin Marwan, swearing allegiance to him: &#8216;I swear allegiance to you in that I will listen and obey what is in accordance with the Laws of Allah and the Tradition of His Apostle as much as I can.&#8217;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 378:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said bin Al-Musaiyab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Huraira said that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;I have been sent with &#8216;Jawami-al-Kalim &#8216; (the shortest expression with the widest meaning) and have been made victorious with awe (cast in my enemy&#8217;s hearts), and while I was sleeping, I saw that the keys of the treasures of the world were placed in my hand.&#8221; Abu Huraira added: Allah&#8217;s Apostle has gone, and you people are utilizing those treasures, or digging those treasures out.&#8221; or said a similar sentence.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 379:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;There was no prophet among the prophets but was given miracles because of which people had security or had belief, but what I was given was the Divine Inspiration which Allah revealed to me. So I hope that my followers will be more than those of any other prophet on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 380:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Wail:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I sat with Shaiba in this Mosque (Al-Masjid-Al-Haram), and he said, &#8220;&#8216;Umar once sat beside me here as you are now sitting, and said, &#8216;I feel like distributing all the gold and silver that are in it (i.e., the Ka&#8217;ba) among the Muslims&#8217;. I said, &#8216;You cannot do that.&#8217; &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;Why?&#8217; I said, &#8216;Your two (previous) companions (the Prophet and Abu Bakr) did not do it. &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;They are the two persons whom one must follow.'&#8221; (See Hadith No. 664, Vol. 2)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 381:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hudhaifa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to us, &#8220;Honesty descended from the Heavens and settled in the roots of the hearts of men (faithful believers), and then the Quran was revealed and the people read the Quran, (and learnt it from it) and also learnt it from the Sunna.&#8221; Both Quran and Sunna strengthened their (the faithful believers&#8217;) honesty. (See Hadith No. 208)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 382:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The best talk (speech) is Allah&#8217;s Book &#8216;Quran), and the best way is the way of Muhammad, and the worst matters are the heresies (those new things which are introduced into the religion); and whatever you have been promised will surely come to pass, and you cannot escape (it).</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 383:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira and Zaid bin Khalid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were with the Prophet when he said (to two men), &#8220;I shall judge between you according to Allah&#8217;s Book (Laws).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 384:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;All my followers will enter Paradise except those who refuse.&#8221; They said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Who will refuse?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Whoever obeys me will enter Paradise, and whoever disobeys me is the one who refuses (to enter it).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 385:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some angels came to the Prophet while he was sleeping. Some of them said, &#8220;He is sleeping.&#8221; Others said, &#8220;His eyes are sleeping but his heart is awake.&#8221; Then they said, &#8220;There is an example for this companion of yours.&#8221; One of them said, &#8220;Then set forth an example for him.&#8221; Some of them said, &#8220;He is sleeping.&#8221; The others said, &#8220;His eyes are sleeping but his heart is awake.&#8221; Then they said, &#8220;His example is that of a man who has built a house and then offered therein a banquet and sent an inviter (messenger) to invite the people. So whoever accepted the invitation of the inviter, entered the house and ate of the banquet, and whoever did not accept the invitation of the inviter, did not enter the house, nor did he eat of the banquet.&#8221; Then the angels said, &#8220;Interpret this example to him so that he may understand it.&#8221; Some of them said, &#8220;He is sleeping.&#8221; The others said, &#8220;His eyes are sleeping but his heart is awake.&#8221; And then they said, &#8220;The houses stands for Paradise and the call maker is Muhammad; and whoever obeys Muhammad, obeys Allah; and whoever disobeys Muhammad, disobeys Allah. Muhammad separated the people (i.e., through his message, the good is distinguished from the bad, and the believers from the disbelievers).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 386:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hammam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hudhaifa said, &#8220;O the Group of Al-Qurra! Follow the straight path, for then you have taken a great lead (and will be the leaders), but if you divert right or left, then you will go astray far away.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 387:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;My example and the example of what I have been sent with is that of a man who came to some people and said, &#8216;O people! I have seen the enemy&#8217;s army with my own eyes, and I am the naked warner; so protect yourselves!&#8217; Then a group of his people obeyed him and fled at night proceeding stealthily till they were safe, while another group of them disbelieved him and stayed at their places till morning when the army came upon them, and killed and ruined them completely So this is the example of that person who obeys me and follows what I have brought (the Quran and the Sunna), and the example of the one who disobeys me and disbelieves the truth I have brought.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 388:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah&#8217;s Apostle died and Abu Bakr was elected as a Caliph after him, some of the Arabs reverted to disbelief, &#8216;Umar said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;How dare you fight the people while Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, I have been ordered to fight the people till they say &#8216;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah&#8217; And whoever says: None has the right to be worshipped but Allah.&#8217; waves his wealth and his life from me unless he deserves a legal punishment lusty, and his account will be with Allah! Abu Bakr said, &#8220;By Allah, I will fight him who discriminates between Zakat and prayers, for Zakat is the Compulsory right to be taken from the wealth By Allah, if they refuse to give me even a tying rope which they use to give to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, I would fight them for withholding it.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;By Allah, It was nothing, except I saw that Allah had opened the chest of Abu Bakr to the fight, and I came to know for certain that was the truth.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 389:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Uyaina bin Hisn bin Hudhaifa bin Badr came and stayed (at Medina) with his nephew Al-Hurr bin Qais bin Hisn who has one of those whom &#8216;Umar used to keep near him, as the Qurra&#8217; (learned men knowing Quran by heart) were the people of Umar&#8217;s meetings and his advisors whether they were old or young. &#8216;Uyaina said to his nephew, &#8220;O my nephew! Have you an approach to this chief so as to get for me the permission to see him?&#8221; His nephew said, &#8220;I will get the permission for you to see him.&#8221; (Ibn &#8216;Abbas added: ) So he took the permission for &#8216;Uyaina, and when the latter entered, he said, &#8220;O the son of Al-Khattab! By Allah, you neither give us sufficient provision nor judge among us with justice.&#8221; On that &#8216;Umar became so furious that he intended to harm him. Al-Hurr, said, &#8220;O Chief of the Believers!&#8221; Allah said to His Apostle &#8216;Hold to forgiveness, command what is good (right), and leave the foolish (i.e. do not punish them).&#8217; (7.199) and this person is among the foolish.&#8221; By Allah, &#8216;Umar did not overlook that Verse when Al-Hurr recited it before him, and &#8216;Umar said to observe (the orders of) Allah&#8217;s Book strictly.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 166, Vol. 6)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 390:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Asma&#8217; bint Abu Bakr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I came to &#8216;Aisha during the solar eclipse. The people were standing (offering prayer) and she too, was standing and offering prayer. I asked, &#8220;What is wrong with the people?&#8221; She pointed towards the sky with her hand and said, Subhan Allah!&#8221; I asked her, &#8220;Is there a sign?&#8221; She nodded with her head meaning, yes. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle finished (the prayer), he glorified and praised Allah and said, &#8220;There is not anything that I have not seen before but I have seen now at this place of mine, even Paradise and Hell. It has been revealed to me that you people will be put to trial nearly like the trial of Ad-Dajjal, in your graves. As for the true believer or a Muslim (the sub-narrator is not sure as to which of the two (words Asma&#8217; had said) he will say, &#8216;Muhammad came with clear signs from Allah, and we responded to him (accepted his teachings) and believed (what he said)&#8217; It will be said (to him) &#8216;Sleep in peace; we have known that you were a true believer who believed with certainty.&#8217; As for a hypocrite or a doubtful person, (the sub-narrator is not sure as to which word Asma&#8217; said) he will say, &#8216;I do not know, but I heard the people saying something and so I said the same.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

The Prophet then said, &#8220;You continued doing what I saw you doing till I was afraid that this (Tarawih prayer) might be enjoined on you, and if it were enjoined on you, you would not continue performing it. Therefore, O people! Perform your prayers at your homes, for the best prayer of a person is what is performed at his home except the compulsory congregational) prayer.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 229,Vol. 3) (See Hadith No. 134, Vol. 8)</p>

Inform us bout the spirit.&#8221; The Prophet stood up for a while, waiting. I realized that he was being Divinely Inspired, so I kept away from him till the inspiration was over. Then the Prophet said, &#8220;(O Muhammad) they ask you regarding the spirit, Say: The spirit its knowledge is with my Lord (i.e., nobody has its knowledge except Allah)&#8221; (17.85) (This is a miracle of the Qur&#8217;an that all the scientists up till now do not know about the spirit, i.e, how life comes to a body and how it goes away at its death) (See Hadith No. 245, Vol. 6)</p>

Abu Bakr said to &#8216;Umar, &#8220;You intended only to oppose me.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I did not intend to oppose you!&#8221; Then their voices grew louder in front of the Prophet whereupon there was revealed: &#8216;O you who believe! Do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet..a great reward.&#8217; (49.2-3) Ibn Az-Zubair said, &#8216;Thence forward when &#8216;Umar talked to the Prophet, he would talk like one who whispered a secret and would even fail to make the Prophet hear him, in which case the Prophet would ask him (to repeat his words).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Uwaimir Al-&#8216;Ajlani came to &#8216;Asim bin &#8216;Adi and said, &#8220;If a man found another man with his wife and killed him, would you sentence the husband to death (in Qisas,) i.e., equality in punishment)? O &#8216;Asim! Please ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle about this matter on my behalf.&#8221; &#8216;Asim asked the Prophet but the Prophet disliked the question and disapproved of it. &#8216;Asim returned and informed &#8216;Uwaimir that the Prophet disliked that type of question. &#8216;Uwaimir said, &#8220;By Allah, I will go (personally) to the Prophet.&#8221; &#8216;Uwaimir came to the Prophet when Allah had already revealed Qur&#8217;anic Verses (in that respect), after &#8216;Asim had left (the Prophet ). So the Prophet said to &#8216;Uwaimir, &#8220;Allah has revealed Qur&#8217;anic Verses regarding you and your wife.&#8221; The Prophet then called for them, and they came and carried out the order of Lian.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then &#8216;Uwaimir said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Now if I kept her with me, I would be accused of telling a lie.&#8221; So &#8216;Uwaimir divorced her although the Prophet did not order him to do so. Later on this practice of divorcing became the tradition of couples involved in a case of Li&#8217;an. The Prophet said (to the people). &#8220;Wait for her! If she delivers a red short (small) child like a Wahra (a short red animal). then I will be of the opinion that he (&#8216;Uwaimir) has told a lie but if she delivered a black big-eyed one with big buttocks, then I will be of the opinion that he has told the truth about her.&#8221; &#8216;Ultimately she gave birth to a child that proved the accusation.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 408:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Malik bin Aus An-Nasri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I proceeded till I entered upon &#8216;Umar (and while I was sitting there), his gate-keeper Yarfa came to him and said, &#8221; &#8216;Uthman, &#8216;Abdur-Rahman, Az-Zubair and Sa&#8217;d ask your permission to come in.&#8221; &#8216;Umar allowed them. So they entered, greeted, and sat down. (After a while the gatekeeper came) and said, &#8220;Shall I admit &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas?&#8221; &#8216;Umar allowed them to enter. Al-&#8216;Abbas said &#8220;O Chief of the believers! Judge between me and the oppressor (&#8216;Ali).&#8221; Then there was a dispute (regarding the property of Bani Nadir) between them (&#8216;Abbas and &#8216;Ali). &#8216;Uthman and his companions said, &#8220;O Chief of the Believers! Judge between them and relieve one from the other.&#8221; Umar said, &#8220;Be patient! beseech you by Allah, with Whose permission the Heaven and the Earth Exist! Do you know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Our property is not to be inherited, and whatever we leave is to be given in charity,&#8217; and by this Allah&#8217;s Apostle meant himself?&#8221; On that the group said, &#8220;He verily said so.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then faced &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas and said, &#8220;I beseech you both by Allah, do you both know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said so?&#8221; They both replied, &#8220;Yes&#8221;. &#8216;Umar then said, &#8220;Now I am talking to you about this matter (in detail) . Allah favored Allah&#8217;s Apostle with some of this wealth which He did not give to anybody else, as Allah said: &#8216;What Allah bestowed as Fai (Booty on His Apostle for which you made no expedition&#8230; &#8216; (59.6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So that property was totally meant for Allah&#8217;s Apostle, yet he did not collect it and ignore you, nor did he withhold it with your exclusion, but he gave it to you and distributed it among you till this much of it was left behind, and the Prophet, used to spend of this as the yearly expenditures of his family and then take what remained of it and spent it as he did with (other) Allah&#8217;s wealth. The Prophet did so during all his lifetime, and I beseech you by Allah, do you know that?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then addressed &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas, saying, &#8220;I beseech you both by Allah, do you know that?&#8221; Both of them replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;Then Allah took His Apostle unto Him. Abu Bakr then said &#8216;I am the successor of Allah&#8217;s Apostle&#8217; and took over all the Prophet&#8217;s property and disposed of it in the same way as Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to do, and you were present then.&#8221; Then he turned to &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas and said, &#8220;You both claim that Abu Bakr did so-and-so in managing the property, but Allah knows that Abu Bakr was honest, righteous, intelligent, and a follower of what is right in managing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah took Abu Bakr unto Him, &#8216;I said: I am the successor of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr.&#8217; So I took over the property for two years and managed it in the same way as Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and Abu Bakr used to do. Then you both (&#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas) came to me and asked for the same thing! (O &#8216;Abbas! You came to me to ask me for your share from nephew&#8217;s property; and this (&#8216;Ali) came to me asking for his wives share from her father&#8217;s property, and I said to you both, &#8216;If you wish, I will place it in your custody on condition that you both will manage it in the same way as Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr did and as I have been doing since I took charge of managing it; otherwise, do not speak to me anymore about it.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then you both said, &#8216;Give it to us on that (condition).&#8217; So I gave it to you on that condition. Now I beseech you by Allah, did I not give it to them on that condition?&#8221; The group (whom he had been addressing) replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then addressed &#8216;Abbas and &#8216;Ali saying, &#8220;I beseech you both by Allah, didn&#8217;t I give you all that property on that condition?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then said, &#8220;Are you now seeking a verdict from me other than that? By Him with Whose Permission the Heaven and the Earth exists I will not give any verdict other than that till the Hour is established; and if you both are unable to manage this property, then you can hand it back to me, and I will be sufficient for it on your behalf.&#8221; (See, Hadith No. 326, Vol. 4)</p>

Allow him to come in.&#8221; He was called in and &#8216;Umar said to him, &#8220;What made you do what you did.&#8221; He replied, &#8220;We have been instructed thus by the Prophet&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Bring proof (witness) for this, other wise I will do so-and-so to you.&#8221; Then &#8216;Abdullah bin Qais went to a gathering of the Ansar who then said, &#8220;None but the youngest of us will give the witness for it.&#8221; So Abu Said Al-Khudri got up and said, &#8220;We used to be instructed thus (by the Prophet).&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;This tradition of the Prophet remained hidden from me. Business in the market kept me busy.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 452:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-A&#8217;raj:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Huraira said, &#8220;You people claim that Abu Huraira narrates many narrations of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. (Anyhow) with Allah will be our appointment. I was a poor man, and used to stick to Allah&#8217;s Apostle contented with what will fill my stomach, and the Muhajirin (emigrants) used to be busy trading in the markets, and the Ansar used to be busy looking after their properties. One-day I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;Who will spread his Rida&#8217; (a garment covering the upper part of the body) till I finished my speech and then fold it, (i.e. wrap it over your body), in which case he will never forget anything he had heard from me.&#8221; So I spread my garment which I was wearing; and by Him Who sent Muhammad with the Truth, ever since, I have never forgotten whatever I heard from him (the Prophet)&#8221; (See, Hadith No. 119, Vol. 1)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 453:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Muhammad bin Al-Munkadir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I saw Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah swearing by Allah that Ibn Sayyad was the Dajjal. I said to Jabir, &#8220;How can you swear by Allah?&#8221; Jabir said, &#8220;I have heard &#8216;Umar swearing by Allah regarding this matter in the presence of the Prophet and the Prophet did not disapprove of it.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 454:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Horses may be used for three purposes: For a man they may be a source of reward (in the Hereafter); for another, a means of protection; and for another, a source of sin. The man for whom they are a source of reward, is the one who keeps them for Allah&#8217;s Cause and ties them with long ropes and lets them graze in a pasture or garden. Whatever those long ropes allow them to eat of that pasture or garden, will be written as good deeds for him and if they break their ropes and run one or two rounds, then all their footsteps and dung will be written as good deeds for him, and if they pass a river and drink from it though he has had no intention of watering them, even then, that will be written as good deeds for him. So such horses are a source of reward for that man. For the man who keeps horses for his livelihood in order not to ask others for help or beg his bread, and at the same time he does not forget Allah&#8217;s right of what he earns through them and of their backs (that he presents it to be used in Allah&#8217;s Cause), such horses are a shelter for him (from poverty). For the man who keeps them just out of pride and for showing off, they are a source of sin.&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle was asked about donkeys. He said, &#8220;Allah has not revealed anything to me regarding them except this comprehensive Verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Then anyone who has done good, equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant) shall see it, and any one who has done evil, equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant) shall see it.&#8221; (99.7-8)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 455:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A woman asked the Prophet (Hadith 456).</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 456:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A woman asked the Prophet about the periods: How to take a bath after the periods. He said, &#8220;Take a perfumed piece of cloth and clean yourself with it.&#8221; She said,&#8217; &#8220;How shall I clean myself with it, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Clean yourself&#8221; She said again, &#8220;How shall I clean myself, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Clean yourself with it.&#8221; Then I knew what Allah&#8217;s Apostle meant. So I pulled her aside and explained it to her.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 457:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Um Hufaid bint Al-Harith bin Hazn presented the Prophet with some butter, dried yoghurt (curd milk) and mastigures as a gift. The Prophet then asked for a meal (mastigures etc. to be put) and it was eaten over his table cloth, but the Prophet did not eat of it, as he had aversion to it. But if it had been illegal to eat, it would not have been eaten over his table cloth nor would he have ordered that (mastigures meat) to be eaten</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 458:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever has eaten garlic or onion, should keep away from us, or should keep away from our mosque and should stay at home.&#8221; Ibn Wahb said, &#8220;Once a plate full of cooked vegetables was brought to the Prophet at Badr. Detecting a bad smell from it, he asked about the dish and was informed of the kinds of vegetables in contained. He then said, &#8220;Bring it near,&#8221; and so it was brought near to one of his companions who was with him. When the Prophet saw it, he disliked eating it and said (to his companion), &#8220;Eat, for I talk in secret to ones whom you do not talk to.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 459:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jubair bin Mutim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A lady came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and she talked to him about something, and he gave her some order. She said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! If I should not find you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;If you should not find me, then go to Abu Bakr.&#8221; Ibrahim bin Sa&#8217;d said, &#8220;As if she meant the death (of the Prophet).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 460:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of the Book used to read the Torah in Hebrew and then explain it in Arabic to the Muslims. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said (to the Muslims). &#8220;Do not believe the people of the Book, nor disbelieve them, but say, &#8216;We believe in Allah and whatever is revealed to us, and whatever is revealed to you.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 461:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ubaidullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Why do you ask the people of the scripture about anything while your Book (Quran) which has been revealed to Allah&#8217;s Apostle is newer and the latest? You read it pure, undistorted and unchanged, and Allah has told you that the people of the scripture (Jews and Christians) changed their scripture and distorted it, and wrote the scripture with their own hands and said, &#8216;It is from Allah,&#8217; to sell it for a little gain. Does not the knowledge which has come to you prevent you from asking them about anything? No, by Allah, we have never seen any man from them asking you regarding what has been revealed to you!&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 462:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the slanderers had given a forged statement against her, Allah&#8217;s Apostle called &#8216;Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration was delayed. He wanted to ask them and consult them about the question of divorcing me. Usama gave his evidence that was based on what he knew about my innocence, but &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;Allah has not put restrictions on you and there are many women other than her. Furthermore you may ask the slave girl who will tell you the truth.&#8221; So the Prophet asked Barira (my salve girl), &#8220;Have you seen anything that may arouse your suspicion?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;I have not seen anything more than that she is a little girl who sleeps, leaving the dough of her family (unguarded) that the domestic goats come and eat it.&#8221; Then the Prophet stood on the pulpit and said, &#8220;O Muslims! Who will help me against the man who has harmed me by slandering my wife? By Allah, I know nothing about my family except good.&#8221; The narrator added: Then the Prophet mentioned the innocence of &#8216;Aisha. (See Hadith No. 274, Vol. 6)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 463:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle addressed the people, and after praising and glorifying Allah, he said, &#8220;What do you suggest me regarding those people who are abusing my wife? I have never known anything bad about her.&#8221; The sub-narrator, &#8216;Urwa, said: When &#8216;Aisha was told of the slander, she said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Will you allow me to go to my parents&#8217; home?&#8221; He allowed her and sent a slave along with her. An Ansari man said, &#8220;Subhanaka! It is not right for us to speak about this. Subhanaka! This is a great lie!&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 464:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ata:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah in a gathering saying, &#8220;We, the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle assumed the state of Ihram to perform only Hajj without &#8216;Umra.&#8221; Jabir added, &#8220;The Prophet arrived (at Mecca) on the fourth of Dhul-Hijja. And when we arrived (in Mecca) the Prophet ordered us to finish the state of Ihram, saying, &#8220;Finish your lhram and go to your wives (for sexual relation).&#8221; Jabir added, &#8220;The Prophet did not oblige us (to go to our wives) but he only made that legal for us. Then he heard that we were saying, &#8220;When there remains only five days between us and the Day of Arafat he orders us to finish our Ihram by sleeping with our wives in which case we will proceed to &#8216;Arafat with our male organs dribbling with semen?&#8217; (Jabir pointed out with his hand illustrating what he was saying). Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up and said, &#8216;You (People) know that I am the most Allah-fearing, the most truthful and the best doer of good deeds (pious) from among you. If I had not brought the Hadi with me, I would have finished my Ihram as you will do, so finish your Ihram. If I had formerly known what I came to know lately, I would not have brought the Hadi with me.&#8217; So we finished our Ihram and listened to the Prophet and obeyed him.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 713, Vol. 2)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 465:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah Al Muzam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Perform (an optional) prayer before Maghrib prayer.&#8221; (He repeated it thrice) and the third time he said, &#8220;Whoever wants to offer it can do so,&#8221; lest the people should take it as a Sunna (tradition). (See Hadith No. 277, Vol. 2)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 466:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jundab bin &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Recite (and study) the Quran as long as you are in agreement as to its interpretation and meanings, but when you have differences regarding its interpretation and meanings, then you should stop reciting it (for the time being.) (See Hadith No 581, Vol. 6)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 467:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jundab bin &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Recite (and study) the Qur&#8217;an as long as your hearts are in agreement as to its meanings, but if you have differences as regards its meaning, stop reading it then.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 468:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the time of the death of the Prophet approached while there were some men in the house, and among them was &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khatttab, the Prophet said, &#8220;Come near let me write for you a writing after which you will never go astray.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;The Prophet is seriously ill, and you have the Quran, so Allah&#8217;s Book is sufficient for us.&#8221; The people in the house differed and disputed. Some of them said, &#8220;Come near so that Allah&#8217;s Apostle may write for you a writing after which you will not go astray,&#8221; while some of them said what &#8216;Umar said. When they made much noise and differed greatly before the Prophet, he said to them, &#8220;Go away and leave me.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas used to say, &#8220;It was a great disaster that their difference and noise prevented Allah&#8217;s Apostle from writing that writing for them.</p>

<h3 align="center">Virtues of the Qur&#8217;an</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="006.061.502"></a>Volume 6, Book 61, Number 502:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha and Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet remained in Mecca for ten years, during which the Qur&#8217;an used to be revealed to him; and he stayed in Medina for ten years.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 503:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu &#8216;Uthman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was informed that Gabriel came to the Prophet while Um Salama was with him. Gabriel started talking (to the Prophet). Then the Prophet asked Um Salama, &#8220;Who is this?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;He is Dihya (al-Kalbi).&#8221; When Gabriel had left, Um Salama said, &#8220;By Allah, I did not take him for anybody other than him (i.e. Dihya) till I heard the sermon of the Prophet wherein he informed about the news of Gabriel.&#8221; The subnarrator asked Abu &#8216;Uthman: From whom have you heard that? Abu &#8216;Uthman said: From Usama bin Zaid.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 504:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Every Prophet was given miracles because of which people believed, but what I have been given, is Divine Inspiration which Allah has revealed to me. So I hope that my followers will outnumber the followers of the other Prophets on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 505:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah sent down His Divine Inspiration to His Apostle continuously and abundantly during the period preceding his death till He took him unto Him. That was the period of the greatest part of revelation; and Allah&#8217;s Apostle died after that.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 506:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jundub:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once the Prophet fell ill and did not offer the night prayer (Tahajjud prayer) for a night or two. A woman (the wife of Abu Lahab) came to him and said, &#8220;O Muhammad ! I do not see but that your Satan has left you.&#8221; Then Allah revealed (Surat-Ad-Duha):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;By the fore-noon, and by the night when it darkens (or is still); Your Lord has not forsaken you, nor hated you.&#8217; (93)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 507:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Caliph &#8216;Uthman ordered Zaid bin Thabit, Said bin Al-As, &#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Harith bin Hisham to write the Quran in the form of a book (Mushafs) and said to them. &#8220;In case you disagree with Zaid bin Thabit (Al-Ansari) regarding any dialectic Arabic utterance of the Quran, then write it in the dialect of Quraish, for the Quran was revealed in this dialect.&#8221; So they did it.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 508:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Safwan bin Ya&#8217;la bin Umaiya:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ya&#8217;la used to say, &#8220;I wish I could see Allah&#8217;s Apostle at the time he is being inspired Divinely.&#8221; When the Prophet was at Al-Ja&#8217;rana and was shaded by a garment hanging over him and some of his companions were with him, a man perfumed with scent came and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What is your opinion regarding a man who assumes Ihram and puts on a cloak after perfuming his body with scent?&#8221; The Prophet waited for a while, and then the Divine Inspiration descended upon him. &#8216;Umar pointed out to Ya&#8217;la, telling him to come. Ya&#8217;la came and pushed his head (underneath the screen which was covering the Prophet ) and behold! The Prophet&#8217;s face was red and he kept on breathing heavily for a while and then he was relieved. Thereupon he said, &#8220;Where is the questioner who asked me about &#8216;Umra a while ago?&#8221; The man was sought and then was brought before the Prophet who said (to him), &#8220;As regards the scent which you perfumed your body with, you must wash it off thrice, and as for your cloak, you must take it off; and then perform in your &#8216;Umra all those things which you perform in Hajj.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 509:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Thabit:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr As-Siddiq sent for me when the people! of Yamama had been killed (i.e., a number of the Prophet&#8217;s Companions who fought against Musailama). (I went to him) and found &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab sitting with him. Abu Bakr then said (to me), &#8220;Umar has come to me and said: &#8220;Casualties were heavy among the Qurra&#8217; of the! Qur&#8217;an (i.e. those who knew the Quran by heart) on the day of the Battle of Yalmama, and I am afraid that more heavy casualties may take place among the Qurra&#8217; on other battlefields, whereby a large part of the Qur&#8217;an may be lost. Therefore I suggest, you (Abu Bakr) order that the Qur&#8217;an be collected.&#8221; I said to &#8216;Umar, &#8220;How can you do something which Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not do?&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;By Allah, that is a good project. &#8220;Umar kept on urging me to accept his proposal till Allah opened my chest for it and I began to realize the good in the idea which &#8216;Umar had realized.&#8221; Then Abu Bakr said (to me). &#8216;You are a wise young man and we do not have any suspicion about you, and you used to write the Divine Inspiration for Allah&#8217;s Apostle. So you should search for (the fragmentary scripts of) the Qur&#8217;an and collect it in one book).&#8221; By Allah If they had ordered me to shift one of the mountains, it would not have been heavier for me than this ordering me to collect the Qur&#8217;an. Then I said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;How will you do something which Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not do?&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;By Allah, it is a good project.&#8221; Abu Bakr kept on urging me to accept his idea until Allah opened my chest for what He had opened the chests of Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar. So I started looking for the Qur&#8217;an and collecting it from (what was written on) palmed stalks, thin white stones and also from the men who knew it by heart, till I found the last Verse of Surat At-Tauba (Repentance) with Abi Khuzaima Al-Ansari, and I did not find it with anybody other than him. The Verse is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Verily there has come unto you an Apostle (Muhammad) from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty..(till the end of Surat-Baraa&#8217; (At-Tauba) (9.128-129) Then the complete manuscripts (copy) of the Qur&#8217;an remained with Abu Bakr till he died, then with &#8216;Umar till the end of his life, and then with Hafsa, the daughter of &#8216;Umar.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 510:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hudhaifa bin Al-Yaman came to Uthman at the time when the people of Sham and the people of Iraq were Waging war to conquer Arminya and Adharbijan. Hudhaifa was afraid of their (the people of Sham and Iraq) differences in the recitation of the Qur&#8217;an, so he said to &#8216;Uthman, &#8220;O chief of the Believers! Save this nation before they differ about the Book (Quran) as Jews and the Christians did before.&#8221; So &#8216;Uthman sent a message to Hafsa saying, &#8220;Send us the manuscripts of the Qur&#8217;an so that we may compile the Qur&#8217;anic materials in perfect copies and return the manuscripts to you.&#8221; Hafsa sent it to &#8216;Uthman. &#8216;Uthman then ordered Zaid bin Thabit, &#8216;Abdullah bin AzZubair, Said bin Al-As and &#8216;AbdurRahman bin Harith bin Hisham to rewrite the manuscripts in perfect copies. &#8216;Uthman said to the three Quraishi men, &#8220;In case you disagree with Zaid bin Thabit on any point in the Qur&#8217;an, then write it in the dialect of Quraish, the Qur&#8217;an was revealed in their tongue.&#8221; They did so, and when they had written many copies, &#8216;Uthman returned the original manuscripts to Hafsa. &#8216;Uthman sent to every Muslim province one copy of what they had copied, and ordered that all the other Qur&#8217;anic materials, whether written in fragmentary manuscripts or whole copies, be burnt. Said bin Thabit added, &#8220;A Verse from Surat Ahzab was missed by me when we copied the Qur&#8217;an and I used to hear Allah&#8217;s Apostle reciting it. So we searched for it and found it with Khuzaima bin Thabit Al-Ansari. (That Verse was): &#8216;Among the Believers are men who have been true in their covenant with Allah.&#8217; (33.23)</p>

I was about to jump over him during his prayer, but I controlled my temper, and when he had completed his prayer, I put his upper garment around his neck and seized him by it and said, &#8220;Who taught you this Sura which I heard you reciting?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle taught it to me.&#8221; I said, &#8220;You have told a lie, for Allah&#8217;s Apostle has taught it to me in a different way from yours.&#8221; So I dragged him to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said (to Allah&#8217;s Apostle),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I heard this person reciting Surat Al-Furqan in a way which you haven&#8217;t taught me!&#8221; On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Release him, (O &#8216;Umar!) Recite, O Hisham!&#8221; Then he recited in the same way as I heard him reciting. Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;It was revealed in this way,&#8221; and added, &#8220;Recite, O &#8216;Umar!&#8221; I recited it as he had taught me. Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said, &#8220;It was revealed in this way.

What does it matter?&#8221; He said, &#8220;O mother of the Believers! Show me (the copy of) your Qur&#8217;an,&#8221; She said, &#8220;Why?&#8221; He said, &#8220;In order to compile and arrange the Qur&#8217;an according to it, for people recite it with its Suras not in proper order.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;What does it matter which part of it you read first? (Be informed) that the first thing that was revealed thereof was a Sura from Al-Mufassal, and in it was mentioned Paradise and the Fire. When the people embraced Islam, the Verses regarding legal and illegal things were revealed. If the first thing to be revealed was: &#8216;Do not drink alcoholic drinks.&#8217; people would have said, &#8216;We will never leave alcoholic drinks,&#8217; and if there had been revealed, &#8216;Do not commit illegal sexual intercourse, &#8216;they would have said, &#8216;We will never give up illegal sexual intercourse.&#8217; While I was a young girl of playing age, the following Verse was revealed in Mecca to Muhammad: &#8216;Nay! But the Hour is their appointed time (for their full recompense), and the Hour will be more grievous and more bitter.&#8217; (54.46) Sura Al-Baqara (The Cow) and Surat An-Nisa (The Women) were revealed while I was with him.&#8221; Then &#8216;Aisha took out the copy of the Qur&#8217;an for the man and dictated to him the Verses of the Suras (in their proper order) .</p>

Your example and the example of the Jews and Christians is that of person who employed laborers and said to them, &#8220;Who will work for me till the middle of the day for one Qirat (a special weight)?&#8217; The Jews did. He then said, &#8220;Who will work for me from the middle of the day till the &#8216;Asr prayer for one Qirat each?&#8221; The Christians worked accordingly. Then you (Muslims) are working from the bar prayer till the Maghrib prayer for two Qirats each. They (the Jews and the Christians) said, &#8216;We did more labor but took less wages.&#8217; He (Allah) said, &#8216;Have I wronged you in your rights?&#8217; They replied, &#8216;No.&#8217; Then He said, &#8216;This is My Blessing which I give to whom I wish.&#8221;</p>

So Allah revealed the Verse which occurs in the Surah starting with &#8220;I do swear by the Day of Resurrection.&#8217; (75.1) i.e. &#8216;Move not your tongue concerning (the Qur&#8217;an) to make haste then with.

<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;There will appear some people among you whose prayer will make you look down upon yours, and whose fasting will make you look down upon yours, but they will recite the Qur&#8217;an which will not exceed their throats (they will not act on it) and they will go out of Islam as an arrow goes out through the game whereupon the archer would examine the arrowhead but see nothing, and look at the unfeathered arrow but see nothing, and look at the arrow feathers but see nothing, and finally he suspects to find something in the lower part of the arrow.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 579:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The example of a believer who recites the Qur&#8217;an and acts on it, like a citron which tastes nice and smells nice. And the example of a believer who does not recite the Qur&#8217;an but acts on it, is like a date which tastes good but has no smell. And the example of a hypocrite who recites the Qur&#8217;an is like a Raihana (sweet basil) which smells good but tastes bitter And the example of a hypocrite who does not recite the Quran is like a colocynth which tastes bitter and has a bad smell.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 580:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Recite (and study) the Qur&#8217;an as long as you agree about its interpretation, but if you have any difference of opinion (as regards to its interpretation and meaning) then you should stop reciting it (for the time being).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 581:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jundub:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Recite (and study) the Quran as long as you agree about its interpretation, but when you have any difference of opinion (as regards its interpretation and meaning) then you should stop reciting it (for the time being)&#8217;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 582:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That he heard a man reciting a Quranic Verse which he had heard the Prophet reciting in a different way. So he took that man to the Prophet (and told him the story). The Prophet said, &#8220;Both of you are reciting in a correct way, so carry on reciting.&#8221; The Prophet further added, &#8220;The nations which were before you were destroyed (by Allah) because they differed.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.019.173"></a>Volume 2, Book 19, Number 173:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Masud :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet recited Suratan-Najm (103) at Mecca and prostrated while reciting it and those who were with him did the same except an old man who took a handful of small stones or earth and lifted it to his forehead and said, &#8220;This is sufficient for me.&#8221; Later on, I saw him killed as a non-believer.</p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 19, Number 177:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet I prostrated while reciting An-Najm and with him prostrated the Muslims, the pagans, the jinns, and all human beings.</p>
<hr />

<p style="text-align:justify;">I saw Abu Huraira reciting Idha-Sama&#8217; un-Shaqqat and he prostrated during its recitation.

<hr />

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab recited Surat-an-Nahl on a Friday on the pulpit and when he reached the verse of Sajda he got down from the pulpit and prostrated and the people also prostrated. The next Friday &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab recited the same Sura and when he reached the verse of Sajda he said, &#8220;O people! When we recite the verses of Sajda (during the sermon) whoever prostrates does the right thing, yet it is no sin for the one who does not prostrate.&#8221; And &#8216;Umar did not prostrate (that day). Added Ibn &#8216;Umar &#8220;Allah has not made the prostration of recitation compulsory but if we wish we can do it.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 19, Number 184:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Rafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I offered the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer behind Abu Huraira and he recited Idhas-Sama&#8217; Un-Shaqqat, and prostrated. I said, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; Abu Huraira said, &#8220;I prostrated behind Abu-l-Qasim and I will do the same till I meet him.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon Allah’s Messenger, his household, his companions, and whoever followed his guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed, we do advise those concerned and occupied with memorizing the Qur’an to fear Allah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) and to be dutiful to Him, for He it is Who has guided them towards that goodly and blessed direction, namely memorizing the Book of Allah. This is a tremendous affair as it is the religion of Allah which He sent down as guidance to people. So memorize the Qur’an so proficiently that it is not forgotten, for this requires patience and perseverance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It takes some people only two or three readings of a Qur’anic text to memorize it, yet this is not sufficient to firmly commit the Qur’an to one’s memory. As a matter of fact, it demands great deal of repetition and long practice and perseverance, for the Qur’an is more liable to escape (from one’s memory) than a camel from its tying rope.[1a] If a person does not strongly and meticulously commit it to his memory and on top of that neglects to study it and to read it regularly, it will certainly escape from his memory faster than a camel escapes from its tying rope. So long as Allah has guided you to study and memorize the Qur’an, it behooves you to perfect that memorization.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having done with its memorization, you should then embark on learning the Sunnah of Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) . Memorize as much as you can from it, such as ‘Umdatul- Ahkam and Bulugh Al-Maram. Memorize Imam Muhammad Ibn Adbulwahhab’s Book of Tawhid, whose subject matter is the tawhid of worship; and Imam Ibn Taymia’s “Al- Aqidatul-Wasitiyah”, on the topic of tawhid pertaining to the Names and Attributes and on the topic of ‘aqidah and manhaj. These are the foundations of Islam. If you learn them strongly and accurately, all of your ‘aqidah and manhaj related matters will be rectified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, I advise you to be sincere towards Allah, the Lord of the Universe, for all these matters that I have mentioned to you, i.e. memorizing the Qur’an and memorizing these texts and books, are amongst the greatest acts of worship whereby we seek nearness to Allah. We are in need of sincerity towards Allah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) with regards to these acts. So cultivate yourselves upon sincerity towards Allah, the Lord of the Universe, and study the texts that encourage towards sincerity from Riyadus-Salihin and from other than it, from the Qur’an itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says: <span style="color:#008000;">And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allah, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him).</span>(Qur’an, 98:5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Say (O Muhammad): &#8220;Verily, I am commanded to worship Allah (Alone) by obeying Him and doing religious deeds sincerely for Allah&#8217;s sake only and not to show off, and not to set up rivals with Him in worship</span>. (Qur’an, 39:11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah commands the Messenger (peace be upon him) to single Him out for worship and orders him to be sincere. Similarly, He commands the Ummah and those who follow him to be sincere. No act of worship is accepted unless it is carried out with sincerity, for sincerity is a great condition from the conditions for accepting acts of worship. Any act of worship that is performed seeking nearness to Allah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) must fulfill two conditions: sincerity towards Allah and following the Messenger (peace be upon him) ; that is to say, your deed should emanate from the Book and the Sunnah and be established upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness, i.e. by following the Messenger (peace be upon him) , and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord.</span>(Qur’an, 18:110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is to say, neither type of shirk should enter into this worship, be it major or minor shirk such as showing off.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, sincerity is an affair that is of considerable importance, and without it acts of worship are null and void, and are of no benefit in this life as well as in the hereafter. Worse still, they should bring destruction upon the one who performs them. For the one who shows off, Allah shall make a display of him; and the one who seeks to be heard, Allah shall expose him and disgrace him on the Day of Resurrection before those who will be witnessing. So do not recite the Qur’an in order to be said about you that so-and-so is a reciter. Indeed, one of the first three people upon whom hellfire will be enflamed is such a reciter. As the noble Messenger (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the first people who will be judged on the Day of Resurrection are: a man who died as a martyr. He will be brought forth, and He (Allah) will make His favors known to him and he will acknowledge them. Allah will say: What did you do with them? He will say: I fought in Your cause until I died as a martyr. Allah will say: You have lied. Rather, you fought in order to be said that you are brave, and that was said. Then a command will be passed regarding him and he will be dragged along on his face until he is cast into Hellfire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And a man who acquired knowledge and taught it (to others), and learned the Qur’an and taught it (to others). He will be brought forth, and He (Allah) will make His favors known to him and he will acknowledge them. Allah will say: What did you do with them? He will say: I obtained knowledge and taught it and recited the Qur’an for Your sake. Allah will say: you have lied. Rather, you acquired knowledge so as to be said that you are a knowledgeable man and recited the Qur’an so as to be said that you are a reciter, and that was said. Then a command will be passed regarding him and he will be dragged along on his face until he is cast into Hellfire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And a man whom Allah increased his provision and granted every type of wealth. He will be brought forth, and He (Allah) will make His favors known to him and he will acknowledge them. Allah will say: What did you do with them? He will say: I left no way in which You like money to be spent without spending in it for Your sake. Allah will say: you have lied. Rather, you did that in order to be said that you are a generous man, and that was said. Then a command will be passed regarding him and he will be dragged along on his face until he is cast into Hellfire.[<em>Reported by Muslim (1905) from the narration of Abu Hurairah radhi Allaahu anhu</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadith causes fear in every Muslim and makes him think seriously about every action he performs, every word he utters, and every movement he makes. It makes him observe Allah in everything he does. It behooves every believer to try to be from the people of uprightness and people of sincerity and to achieve the level of Ihsan in his worship, and that is to worship Allah as if you see Him, and since you do not see Him then He sees you. Therefore, it is binding upon man to cultivate himself upon these affairs, not to be cultivated upon the love of showing off and fame or any insignificant worldly pursuits and interests that do not weigh with Allah the wing of a mosquito. So you recite the Qur’an and memorize it so as to act upon it. Hence, the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the senior companions used to read ten verses to the other companions in order to memorize them and never moved on to other verses until they had memorized them and acted upon them, so they used to acquire knowledge and action simultaneously. This is a great manner of cultivation that Muslims have become totally oblivious to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Messenger (peace be upon him) , then Allah revealed the Qur’an to him gradually in sequential parts in proportion to the events and occasions over a period of twenty-three years. All this was done in order to raise the Ummah upon understanding this Qur’an, acting upon it, and implementing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (peace be upon him) used to teach them the Qur’an part by part, ten verses in each, and explain to them its meaning so that they would learn it and implement it. They would not proceed to the next text until they have grasped its meaning and put it into action. If it were a text pertaining to ‘aqidah, they would hold as a belief what is contained therein; if it were an exhortation to fight in the cause of Allah, they would hope in fighting in the cause of Allah or would actually set off for the battleground; and if it were an exhortation to charity and a righteous act or a promise of reward or a warning, they would never surpass it until they have fully comprehended all its content.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a great cultivation indeed, yet people now are not capable of it. O young people! Bear this in your minds, for the Ummah is in need of sincere scholars who are free from whims and desires and purely devoted to Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brothers, nowadays desires are blowing the youth of the Ummah away (from the right salafi path) &#8212; desires pertaining to partisanship and other than it. A student of knowledge would devote himself sincerely to teaching the Qur’an, yet would be umbilically attached to parties that do not act upon that Qur’an but rather follow their own desires. So beware of this type of people, and upon you is sincerity towards Allah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala), seeking knowledge and acting upon the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of Allah’s Messenger. And I hope that you continue to pursue that 10 A WORD OF ADVICE FOR THOSE MEMORIZING THE BOOK OF ALLAH blessed course which started with memorizing the Qur’an until you become from the firmly established scholars whom Allah has praised and in whose favor He has said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allah.</span>[Qur’an, 35:28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So much so, that some people of knowledge have stated that knowledge is fear of Allah, and this is not attainable except for scholars, scholars who have true knowledge of Allah, uphold His Names and Attributes and worship Allah therewith, and believe in Paradise as if they see it with their very eyes and believe in Hell as if they see it with their very eyes. In line with this, Handhalah ? said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr met me and said: How are you, Handhalah? I replied: Handhalah has become a munafiq (i.e. hypocrite).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: Glorified is Allah! What are you saying? I said: When we are in the company of Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him)  and he reminds us of Hell and Paradise, it is as if we can see them with our very eyes. But when we leave the company of Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) , we turn to our wives, children and properties, and so we tend to forget much (of what we heard from him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is to say, they become busy with farming and attending to their wives, etc. which he deemed to be hypocrisy. When he is in the company of Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him), he is in a different state from that when he is away from his company.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr said: By Allah! I do experience the same. So I and Abu Bakr went to Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) and entered upon him. I said: Handhalah has become a munafiq (i.e. hypocrite), O Allah’s Messenger. So Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) said: And what’s that? I replied: When we are in your company and you remind us of Hell and Paradise, it is as if we can see them with our very eyes. But when we leave your company, we turn to our wives, children and properties, and so we tend to forget much (of what we hear from you). Thereupon, Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) said: By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, if you persist upon that state which you achieve in my company and upon remembering (Allah), the Angels will shake hands with you in your beds and in your pathways; however, O Handhalah, there is time for this and time for that. He said this three times.[<em>Reported by Muslim (2750)</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet who amongst us now reaches that level?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah has commanded that this Qur’an be contemplated: <span style="color:#008000;">That they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may remember</span> [Qur’an, 38:29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By Allah, the souls cannot rise to that high levels or come up to the same standing as that of the companions. Yet the Qur’an is the means of elevation. By Allah, souls shall never rise to high levels except through this Qur’an and this Sunnah. Through genuine commitment, sincere belief and open sensibility, souls and minds get uplifted to superior status such that this world becomes of little worth to them and their lives become just as insignificant. Hence when the companions of Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) used to sit with him, it was as if they saw Paradise with their own eyes. Due to the strength of their belief, they presented their hearts and souls as a sacrifice in the cause of Allah for they deemed them to be of no value.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now you see many Muslims thoroughly preoccupied with this worldly life, such that al-wahan has crept up on us, and that is the love for this worldly life and hatred of death. Thus with this kind of life and with the deviant cultivation they acquire at misguided schools, Muslims have become scum, as the scum on a stream of water. By Allah, were they to understand this Qur’an, to be raised upon it in the correct manner, and to found their ‘aqidah and manhaj upon it, this condition of theirs would alter completely. Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When you conduct ‘inah [1] transaction, and you follow the tails of cows, and you are content with farming, and you abandon jihad, Allah shall inflict disgrace upon you which He will not withdraw until you return to your religion.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is to say, to that Qur’an and to the Sunnah by way of understanding it, implementing it, believing in it, and recognizing its lofty status with Allah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala), and with His Messenger and with the believers. If they return (to their religion) with this kind of spirit, Allah will reestablish their position and status in this life. But if they did not acknowledge the status of this Qur’an and went about taking their aqidah from here and there and importing their manhaj from here and there, they would be moving from one pitfall to another until they recover their awareness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The youth need to learn the Qur’an and to get the proper cultivation (based upon it) and to recognize its lofty status. They should also display the banner of the Qur’an and the Sunnah to the Ummah by spreading and disseminating the essence of the Qur’an which will raise them to the high standing that the companion achieved, in order that the Ummah return to its genuine religion &#8212; the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger (peace be upon him) , not this party, nor that group, nor that school of thought, nor that other sect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Implementing the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger (peace be upon him) is the one and the only way out. There is no other remedy for the Ummah except that. All these distorted visions and empty slogans destroy the Ummah worse and worse. They are of no avail or use to the Ummah in any way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If memorizing and learning the Qur’an and the Sunnah is done with the purpose of ensuring victory and support for one’s party, then this is not the correct way. Today we find those who study to obtain degrees in order to promote their own parties, such that they distort and twist the religion of Allah and the speech of the scholars, all this in favor of their own parties. Some read the Qur’an as a means to promote their own party, some read the Qur’an as a means to promote their own sect, while others read the Qur’an as a means to promote their own ‘aqidah and manhaj. No! This is not the correct way. The correct way is to submit to the Qur’an and the Sunnah, not to direct them (i.e. the course of their interpretation) according to your frame of mind and desire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We want memorizers of the Qur’an who understand it and comprehend it in accordance with the understanding of the righteous salaf, not the understanding of the people of innovations and misguidance or the understanding of the deviant parties. No matter what, do not put your trust in these parties, and do not lean towards them in matters of your religion. Rather, turn to the books of the salaf, the books of ‘aqidah, the books of hadith, the likes of the two Sahihs, the four books of Sunan [3], Ahmad’s Musnad, and other Masanid [4] and Ma’ajim [5]. We advise you to turn to these books, not to nashids and movies and other nonsense that has compromised and softened the youth of this Ummah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These people have no knowledge. Therefore, it is obligatory that the youth be warned against their nonsense and their tricks and deception. They raise the youth upon fun and amusement and upon love for that. This was not the case with the companions, the followers, nor with the Imams up to this time of ours. Now amusement has become the primary occupation and interest before anything else. While the neglectful person intends to occupy himself with seeking knowledge, these people divert him towards these means of entertainment, namely nashids, movies, music, and so on and so forth. Indeed they have caused this Ummah more calamities on top of the ones it is already suffering. They claimed to save the Ummah from the state of loss it has come to, yet they only added to its trials and tribulations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is important though is that the sole remedy lies in the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger and the way of the salaf. That is to say, how they used to cultivate themselves, how their relationship with the Qur’an was, what their occupation was and how they spent their time. To the salaf, time was more precious than gold, yet now countless hours are wasted in amusement and absolute nonsense. Therefore, be cautious, O brothers, and commit yourselves to memorizing the Book of Allah and invest your time in memorizing it and memorizing the Sunnah, then memorizing some portion of the mutun (texts) that I mentioned to you above, and then acquire knowledge from scholars and traverse this path upon that clear and noble methodology. After that you will become the men of this Ummah, and by the Will of Allah you shall direct it towards goodness by means of knowledge, proof, and evidence and the correct cultivation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah to save the Ummah by virtue of sincere men, and sincere men do not materialize except through the way part of which I elucidated above that is attained through correct cultivation upon the Qur’an and the Sunnah and holding in high esteem the manhaj of the salaf and keeping steadfast upon it and leading the Ummah to that good and to that path of guidance. We ask our Lord to accomplish that, for verily our Lord is indeed All-Hearer of invocation. And peace and blessings be upon Allah’s Messenger, his household, and his companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Dr. Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali</strong> (Translator of the Noble Qur&#8217;an) writes:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‎It is a pity that many nations are only satisfied in the translated meaning of the Qur&#8217;an and Prophet&#8217;s Sunnah instead of studying the (true) Arabic text of the Qur&#8217;an and Prophet&#8217;‎s Sunnah. For this reason they are divided into various sects (due to the lack of knowledge about the religion of Islam) e.g. as regards to the ways of religious education, etc. so they are plunged in differences, which was prohibited by Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the translation of the meaning of the Qur&#8217;an is meant for the above said purpose then it is a real mischief-doing, and an evil action and is against what was brought by Allaah‎s Messenger (Peace be upon him) and also against the opinions of the early and present day religious scholars. <strong>All the religious scholars unanimously agree that the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah should be taught in the language of the Qur&#8217;an (i.e. Arabic Language)</strong>. So did the early religious scholars of the Muslim nation when they conquered different countries.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translations are mainly meant for informing the people who have not yet embraced Islam to make clear to them the principles of Islam and the teachings of Muhammad (Peace be upon him) and to know its exact facts. When they reach this state and Allaah has blessed them with Islam, they must take the Qur&#8217;anic and the Messenger‎s Language (i.e. Arabic) as the only language to understand Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah&#8217;s mercy be on Shaykh &#8216;Umar Uzbak, a great Turkish man, who strove for Islam in Uzbakistan under the Russian government, after his long fight against the enemies of Islam with fire (iron) and tongue (speech), he took refuge in Afghanistan at Kabul, where the government honoured him. I met him there in 1352 A.H. (approx. 1932 CE) i.e. nearly 40 years ago, and he had vowed to Allaah that he will never speak to a relative or anybody else except in the Qur&#8217;anic and Messenger&#8217;s (Arabic) language. His wife sent a man for me to intercede for her to him that he should speak with her and her children in the Turkish language even for an hour everyday. So when I spoke to him about it, he said: &#8216;Russians had compelled us to learn perfectly the Russian language (by force), so we learnt it. And unless they knew that the learning of the Russian language will make the person who learns it, follow their ways of thinking, characters, and their traditions, they would not have forced anybody to learn it.&#8217; He further said to me, &#8216;I have vowed to Allaah long ago not to speak except in the language of the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah (i.e. Arabic) and I do that only for Allaah&#8217;s sake. If my wife and children desire to enjoy speaking with me, they should learn the language of the Qur&#8217;an and of the Prophet (Peace be upon him) (i.e. Arabic) and I am ready to teach them the Qur&#8217;anic language whenever they desire that‎</p>

Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[ <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/how-are-we-obligated-to-interpret-the-noble-quraan-shaykh-al-albanee-al-ibaanah-com.pdf" target="_blank">Here is complete book</a>]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[9] Question:</b> How are we obligated to interpret the noble Qur’aan?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[9] Answer:</b> Allaah, Blessed and Exalted, sent the Qur’aan down to the heart of His Messenger Muhammad in order to bring mankind from out of the darkness of disbelief and ignorance to the light of Islaam. Allaah says: <b>“Alif-Laam-Raa. This is a Book which We have revealed unto you (O Muhammad) in order that you may lead mankind from out of the darkness (of disbelief) into the light (of Islaam), by the permission of their Lord, to the path of the All-Mighty, the Most Praiseworthy.”</b> [Surah Ibraaheem: 1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He placed His Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) to clarify, interpret and explain what is in the Qur’aan. Allaah says: <b>“And We revealed to you (O Muhammad), the Reminder (i.e. the Sunnah), in order for you to explain to mankind what was (already) revealed to them, and so that they may reflect.”</b> [Surah An-Nahl: 44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Sunnah came in order to explain and clarify what is found in the noble Qur’aan, and it is (also) a revelation sent by Allaah, as He says: <b>&#8220;And he (i.e. Muhammad) does not speak from his own desire. Rather, it is just revelation that is revealed to him.”</b> [Surah An-Najm: 3-4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“I was indeed given the Qur’aan and something similar to it along with it. It is imminent that there will come a time where a man who has eaten to his full will recline on his couch and say: ‘Stick to the Qur’aan. Whatever you find in it that is Halaal (lawful), then declare it lawful. And whatever you find in it that is Haraam (unlawful), then declare it unlawful!’ Whereas, whatever Allaah’s Messenger made unlawful is just like what Allaah made unlawful.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the first source that must be used to interpret the noble Qur’aan is the Qur’an (itself) along with the Sunnah, which consists of the Prophet’s statements, actions and silent approvals. Then after that, it must be interpreted using the interpretations (tafseer) of the people of knowledge, at the head of whom are the Companions of the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>). And the foremost amongst the Companions with regard to this subject (tafseer) is ‘Abdullaah bin Mas’ood (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>). This is due to several factors, one being that he was one of the first to accompany the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) (i.e. accept Islaam), and another being that he (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) would give strong emphasis to asking about, understanding, and interpreting the Qur’aan. Then after him comes ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Abbaas (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>), about whom ‘Abdullaah bin Mas’ood (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) said: <b>“He is the interpreter (turjumaan) of the Qur’aan.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then after them, any Companion whose interpretation (tafseer) of an ayah can be authentically confirmed – and there exists no difference of opinion amongst the Companions regarding it, we accept this interpretation (tafseer) from him with full contentment, submission and reliance. And if no such tafseer can be found (from the Companions) regarding a particular ayah, then we take its tafseer from the Taabi’een, particularly those who specialized in studying tafseer under the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>), such as Sa’eed bin Jubair, Taawoos and others who are well known for their studying of tafseer under some of the Companions, particularly Ibn ‘Abbaas (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>), as we mentioned previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unfortunately, there are some ayaat that are interpreted according to a certain opinion or madh-hab (school of Jurisprudence), and for which no direct explanation from the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) can be found. So because of this, some latter-day individuals relied solely on applying such ayahs according to their madh-hab in order to interpret them. And this is an extremely dangerous matter – where ayaat are interpreted in order to support one’s madh-hab and (personal) views – whereas the scholars of tafseer have interpreted these verses in a different way than the adherents of these madhaahib have interpreted them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps, we should mention an example of this, which is Allaah’s statement: <b>“So recite what is easy from the Qur’aan.”</b> [Surah Al-Muzammil: 20] Some of the adherents of certain madhaahib have interpreted this ayah to refer to just the recitation itself, meaning: What is obligatory to recite from the Qur’aan in all of the prayers is just one long ayah or three short ayaat. They said this in spite of there being reported the authentic hadeeth from the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>): <b>“There is no prayer for the one who doesn’t recite the opening chapter (Faatihah) of the Book (Qur’aan).”</b> And in another hadeeth, the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“Whoever performs a prayer in which he doesn’t recite the opening chapter of the Book, then it is deficient, deficient, deficient, and not complete.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The basis of proof indicated in these two hadeeths is rejected by the afore-mentioned interpretation of the above ayah, which is that the ayah refers to the recitation of the Qur’aan in general. And according to them, it is not permissible to interpret the Qur’aan except with the Sunnah that came in mutawaatir[1] form – meaning it is not permitted to interpret the mutawaatir except with the mutawaatir. So because of this, they rejected the two previously mentioned hadeeth due to their relying on their opinion or madh-hab for the interpretation of this ayah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In spite of this, all of the scholars of tafseer, past and present, have explained that the meaning of the noble ayah <b>“So recite what is easy from the Qur’aan”</b> is: “So pray what is easy for you from the Night Prayer (Tahajjud).” This is since Allaah mentioned this part of the ayah in connection to His saying (i.e. the complete ayah): <b>“Verily, your Lord knows that you stand (to pray at night) a little less than two thirds of the night, or half the night, or a third of the night, and also a party of those with you. And Allaah measures the night and the day. He knows that you are unable to pray the entire night, so He has turned to you (in mercy). So recite what is easy from the Qur’aan.”</b> [Surah Al-Muzammil: 20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The last part means: “So pray what is easy for you from the Night Prayer (Tahajjud).” Therefore, the ayah is not in reference to what a person is obligated to recite specifically during the night prayer. Rather, (in this ayah), Allaah facilitates for the Muslims to pray what they are able to perform from the Night Prayer. This means that they are not obligated to pray what the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) used to pray, which was eleven rak’aat, as you are aware of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the meaning of the ayah. It is phrased in an Arabic style of “applying a portion, by which the whole is intended.” Thus, Allaah’s statement: <b>“So recite”</b> means <b>“So pray.”</b> The prayer is the whole, while the recitation (in prayer) is the portion. The purpose of this phrasing is to clarify the importance of this portion with respect to that whole. Another example of this is Allaah’s statement: <b>“Perform the prayer from midday until the darkness of the night (Dhuhr, ‘Asr, Maghrib, ‘Ishaa), and (also) the (recitation of the) Qur’aan of Fajr (dawn).”</b> [Surah Al-Israa: 78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of <b>“the Qur’aan of Fajr”</b> is “the Fajr Prayer.” So in this situation also, the portion is applied but the whole is intended. This is a style in the Arabic Language that is well known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, after showing the interpretation of this ayah from the scholars of tafseer, without there being any difference of opinion amongst the past and present from them, it is not permissible to reject the first and second hadeeths (mentioned previously), claiming that they are ahead, and that it is not permissible to interpret the Qur’aan with ahaad hadeeth! This is since the afore-mentioned ayah was interpreted by the statements of the scholars who are knowledgeable of the language of the Qur’aan. This is first, and secondly, it is because the hadeeth of the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>)(<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) does not contradict the Qur’aan, but rather, it explains and clarifies it, as we explained in the beginning of this discussion. How can this be when this ayah has no relation to the subject of what a Muslim is obligated to recite during prayer, regardless of whether it is an obligatory or recommended prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for the two afore-mentioned hadeeths, then it is clear that they both are on the subject of a person’s prayer not being valid unless he recites Surah Al-Faatihah in it: <b>“There is no prayer for the one who doesn’t recite the opening chapter (Faatihah) of the Book (Qur’aan)”</b> and <b>“Whoever performs a prayer in which he doesn’t recite the opening chapter of the Book, then it is deficient, deficient, deficient, and not complete.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that the prayer is defective. So whoever finishes his prayer while it is deficient, then he in fact didn’t pray at all. And his prayer at this point becomes invalid, as is apparent in the first hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if this reality becomes clear to us, we must therefore feel secure with the ahaadeeth that come to us from the Prophet, which are reported in the books of Sunnah, firstly, and with their authentic chains of narration, secondly. And we must have no doubts or uncertainties about them due to some philosophical approach to the ahaadeeth, which we hear about in current times, such as:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“We only accept the ahaad ahaadeeth on issues regarding rulings, and not for issues regarding creed. This is since matters of creed cannot be established based on ahaad ahaadeeth.” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what they claim! Yet we know for a fact that the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) sent Mu’aadh (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) to call the People of the Scripture to believe in Tawheed, and he was just one individual.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This brief discussion is sufficient with regard to this topic that I wanted to clarify, which is related to: How are we obligated to interpret the Noble Qur’aan?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah send His Peace and Blessings on our Prophet, Muhammad, his family, Companions and those who follow them in goodness until the Day of Recompense, and all praise is for Allaah, Lord of all that exists.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Footnotes:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] A Mutawaatir hadeeth is a narration that has been reported by a group of people that is so large that it is impossible to conceive that they conspired to lie regarding it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] An Ahaad hadeeth is a narration reported by just one narrator. It is the opposite of Mutawaatir. A Mutawaatir hadeeth is a narration that has been reported by a group of people that is so large that it is impossible to conceive that they conspired to lie regarding it.</p>

<td>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Last two Ayah of Surat ul Baqarah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (Muhammad ) believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allâh, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. They say, &#8220;We make no distinction between one another of His Messengers&#8221; &#8211; and they say, &#8220;We hear, and we obey. (We seek) Your Forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the return (of all).&#8221; (Al-Baqarah 2:285)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh burdens not a person beyond his scope. He gets reward for that (good) which he has earned, and he is punished for that (evil) which he has earned. &#8220;Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error, our Lord! Lay not on us a burden like that which You did lay on those before us (Jews and Christians); our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear. Pardon us and grant us Forgiveness. Have mercy on us. You are our Maulâ (Patron, Suppor-ter and Protector, etc.) and give us victory over the disbelieving people.&#8221; (Al-Baqarah 2:286)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Virtue of These Ayah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn &#8216;Abbas &#8221; who said:<br />
&#8220;While Jibra&#8217;eel (Gibrael) &#8221; `May Peace be upon him&#8217; was sitting with the Prophet !, he heard the opening of a gate above him. So he raised his head and said: `This is a gate from the shies that has opened today, which has never opened before this day.&#8217; So an angel descended from it (the gate). So he Jibra&#8217;eel &#8221; said: &#8220;This is an angel that has descended to the earth, which has never descended except today. He gave Salam and said: &#8216;Receive glad tidings [Oh Muhammad ! with two lights which have been given to you, that have never been given to a Prophet before you: The Opening of the Book (i.e. Surat Al- Fatihah) and the end of Surat Al-Baqarah. Never do you read a letter from either of the two (Surahs) except that you are given it.( Which means that you are given its reward (i.e. the reward of recitation)) (Reported by Muslim) (Taken from Mukhtasar Sahih Muslim with Shaykh AI-Albani&#8217;s editing, p.553, Hadith no. 2094.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tafsir Ibn Kathir</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Each one believes in Allah, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. (They say,) &#8220;We make no distinction between one another of His Messengers.&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, each of the believers believes that Allah is the One and Only and the Sustainer, there is no deity worthy of worship except Him and there is no Lord except Him. The believers also believe in all Allah&#8217;s Prophets and Messengers, in the Books that were revealed from heaven to the Messengers and Prophets, who are indeed the servants of Allah. Further, the believers do not differentiate between any of the Prophets, such as, believing in some of them and rejecting others. Rather, all of Allah&#8217;s Prophets and Messengers are, to the believers, truthful, righteous, and they were each guided to the path of righteousness, even when some of them bring what abrogates the Law of some others by Allah&#8217;s leave. Later on, the Law of Muhammad, the Final Prophet and Messenger from Allah, abrogated all the laws of the Prophets before him. So the Last Hour will commence while Muhammad&#8217;s Law remains the only valid Law, and all the while a group of his Ummah will always be on the path of truth, apparent and dominant. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And they say, &#8220;We hear, and we obey&#8221;) means, we heard Your statement, O our Lord, comprehended and implemented it, and adhered to its implications.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((We seek) Your forgiveness, our Lord) contains a plea and supplication for Allah&#8217;s forgiveness, mercy and kindness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope) means, Allah does not ask a soul what is beyond its ability. This only demonstrates Allah&#8217;s kindness, compassion and generosity towards His creation. This Ayah is the Ayah that abrogated the Ayah that worried the Companions, that is, Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whether you disclose what is in yourselves or conceal it, Allah will call you to account for it.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates that although Allah will question His servants and judge them, He will only punish for what one is able to protect himself from. As for what one cannot protect himself from, such as what one says to himself &#8211; or passing thoughts &#8211; they will not be punished for that. We should state here that to dislike the evil thoughts that cross one&#8217;s mind is a part of faith. Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He gets reward for that which he has earned) of good,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And he is punished for that which he has earned) of evil, that is, concerning the acts that one is responsible for.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah then said, [mentioning what the believers said] while directing His servants to supplicate to Him, all the while promising them that He will answer their supplication:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;Our Lord! Push us not if we forget or fall into error,&#8221;) meaning, &#8220;If we forgot an obligation or fell into a prohibition, or made an error while ignorant of its ruling.&#8221; We mentioned the Hadith by Abu Hurayrah, that Muslim collected, wherein Allah said, &#8220;I shall (accept your supplication).&#8221; There is also the Hadith by Ibn `Abbas that Allah said, &#8220;I did (accept your supplication).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Our Lord! Lay not on us a burden like that which You did lay on those before us (Jews and Christians),) means, &#8220;Even if we were able to perform them, do not require us to perform the difficult deeds as You required the previous nations before us, such as the burdens that were placed on them. You sent Your Prophet Muhammad , the Prophet of mercy, to abrogate these burdens through the Law that You revealed to him, the Hanifi (Islamic Monotheism), easy religion.&#8221; Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said that Allah said, &#8220;I shall (accept your supplication).&#8221; Ibn `Abbas narrated that the Messenger of Allah said that Allah said, &#8220;I did (accept your supplication).&#8221; There is the Hadith recorded through various chains of narration that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(I was sent with the easy Hanifiyyah way.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear) </strong>of obligations, hardships and afflictions, do not make us bear what we cannot bear of this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We mentioned that Allah said, &#8220;I shall (accept your supplication)&#8221; in one narration, and, &#8220;I did (accept your supplication),&#8221; in another narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Pardon us) meaning, between us and You regarding what You know of our shortcomings and errors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And grant us forgiveness) concerning what is between us and Your servants. So do not expose our errors and evil deeds to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Have mercy on us) in what will come thereafter. Therefore, do not allow us to fall into another error. They say that those who commit error need three things: Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for what is between Him and them, that He conceals these errors from His other servants, and thus does not expose them before the servants, and that He grants them immunity from further error.&#8221; We mentioned before that Allah answered these pleas, &#8220;I shall,&#8221; in one narration and, &#8220;I did,&#8221; in another narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(You are our Mawla) meaning, You are our supporter and helper, our trust is in You, You are sought for each and every type of help and our total reliance is on You. There is no power or strength except from You.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And give us victory over the disbelieving people) those who rejected Your religion, denied Your Oneness, refused the Message of Your Prophet , worshipped other than You and associated others in Your worship. Give us victory and make us prevail above them in this and the Hereafter. Allah said, &#8220;I shall,&#8221; in one narration, and, &#8220;I did,&#8221; in the Hadith that Muslim collected from Ibn `Abbas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further, Ibn Jarir recorded that Abu Ishaq said that whenever Mu`adh would finish reciting this Surah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And give us victory over the disbelieving people), he would say &#8220;Amin.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Author:&#8217;Abdullaah Ibn Saalih Al-Fawzaan<br />
Source:Ahaadeeth As-Siyaam: Ahkaam wa Adaab (pg.63-65)<br />
Translator:isma&#8217;eel alarcon (al-manhaj.com)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Umaamah (radhi Allaahu anhu) reported that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <b>&#8220;Recite the Qur&#8217;aan for indeed it will come on the Day of Judgement as an intercessor for its Ashaab (those who read, memorize and implement it).&#8221;</b> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth indicates the virtues of reciting the Qur&#8217;aan, the greatness of its reward and that it will intercede for its holders on the Day of Judgement towards their entrance into Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nawaas Ibn Sama&#8217;aan (radhi Allaahu anhu) reported: &#8220;I heard the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) say: <b>&#8216;The Qur&#8217;aan will be brought on the Day of Judgement as well as the people who used to act upon it. Surat-ul-Baqarah and Aali &#8216;Imraan will then approach them.&#8217;</b> The Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) likened them to three examples, which I have not forgotten afterwards. He (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <b>&#8216;As if they were two clouds or two dark black canopies with light between them both or like two flocks of birds stretching their wings in the air pleading for the one who recited them.'&#8221;</b> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullaah Ibn &#8216;Amr (radhi Allaahu anhu) reported that the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <b>&#8220;The fast and the Qur&#8217;aan will intercede for the servant on the Day of Judgement. The fast will say: &#8216;My Lord, I restricted him from food and drink, so allow me to intercede for him.&#8217; And the Qur&#8217;aan will say: &#8216;I prevented him from sleeping at night, so allow me to intercede for him.&#8217; So they will be allowed to intercede.&#8221;</b> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is essential for the person fasting to recite the Qur&#8217;aan much during these blessed days and honorable nights. For indeed, there is a special virtue for the abundance of recitation in these days, which is not found in any other month. He should take advantage of the nobleness of time during this month, in which Allaah revealed the Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a special merit to reciting the Qur&#8217;aan in the nights of Ramadaan. For indeed, the night brings an end to the busy daily affairs, the enthusiasm is roused and the heart and the tongue mount upon reflecting. And Allaah is the one in whom we seek assistance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported that Jibreel used to meet with the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) during each night of Ramadaan and they would study the Qur&#8217;aan together. [4] So if making thikr (remembrance of Allaah) were better than the Qur&#8217;aan or equal to it (on these nights), they would have done that all the time or at certain times along with constantly gathering for that occasion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, this hadeeth illustrates the precedence of studying the Qur&#8217;aan during Ramadaan and gathering together for that occasion as well as turning towards one who is more prominent in the memorization of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The predecessors of this ummah would recite the Qur&#8217;aan constantly during Ramadaan. And when they would fast, they would sit in the masaajid and say: <b>&#8220;We will guard our fast and not backbite anyone.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They would recite the Qur&#8217;aan in their prayer and out of it. &#8216;Uthmaan (radhi Allaahu anhu) would complete the recitation of the (whole) Qur&#8217;aan once a day. And some of the Salaf would complete it during their qiyaam in Ramadaan every three nights. Some of them would do it every seven days and some every ten days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee would complete the Qur&#8217;aan sixty times during Ramadaan, while reciting it outside of prayer. Al-Aswad would recite the whole Qur&#8217;aan every two nights of Ramadaan. Qataadah would always compete the Qur&#8217;aan every seven days. He would do it every three days in Ramadaan, and during the last ten days, he would do it every night. Their reports concerning that are famous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Rajab (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said: &#8220;The forbiddance of reciting the Qur&#8217;aan in less than three days (as stated in a hadeeth) has only been mentioned in regards to its being done on a normal basis. As for the specific times that are virtuous, such as the month of Ramadaan and especially the nights in which the night of Al-Qadr is sought. Or those places that are virtuous, such as Makkah for the one who enters it without residing there, then it is recommended to recite the Qur&#8217;aan a lot in these times and places, seeking the merits connected with their time and place. This is the opinion of Ahmad, Abu Ishaaq and other scholars. And the actions of others indicate that as has been stated previously.&#8221; [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The person reciting the Qur’aan must observe the proper etiquettes of recitation. Some of them are that: He make his intention sincerely for Allaah, that he recite it whilst being in a state of purity, that he use the Siwaak and that he recite it while pondering on its meaning and observing total consciousness. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;A Book, which We have revealed to you in order that its verses may be pondered upon, so that the people of understanding may be reminded.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, from the etiquettes of the recitation is that one does not stop his reciting in order to speak to someone else. Indeed, when many people sit to recite the Qur&#8217;aan, and there are people sitting next to them, a majority of the time, they stop their recitation and speak to their neighbors. This is not proper since it is turning away from the recitation without a valid reason.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is on the one who recites, to act upon the Qur&#8217;aan, making permissible its Halaal and forbidding its Haraam, so that the Qur&#8217;aan can be a proof for him on the Day of Judgement and intercede for him in entering the gardens of bliss.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Ibaanah Magazine , Issue No.3 &#8211; Dhul-Qa’dah 1416H / April 1996<br />
Shaykh Abu Anas Hamad al-’Uthman [1].<br />
From An-Nubadh fî Âdâbit-Talabil-’Ilm (pp.61-66)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hudayfah &#8211; <em>radiallâhu </em><i>’</i><em>anhu</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allâh <em>sallallâhu </em> <i> ’</i><em>alayhi wa sallam</em> related two matters to us. I have seen one of them, and I am waiting for the other. He informed us: <i> “Trustworthiness was sent down in the depths of the heart of the people, then they learnt it from the Qur‘ân, and then they learnt it from the Sunnah.”</i> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hâfidh Ibn Hajr (825H) &#8211; <em>rahimahullâh</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“His saying: <i> “then they learnt it from the Qur‘ân, then they learnt it from the Sunnah.”</i> So it occurs in this narration with the repetition of “then”, which contains an indication that they would learn Qur‘ân before learning the details of the <i>Sunnah</i>. And what is meant by the details of the <i>Sunnah</i> is anything that they would learn from the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> &#8211; whether it was obligatory or recommended.” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Maymûnî said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Abû ’Abdullâh (Imâm Ahmad) which is more beloved to you, that I should begin teaching my son the Qur‘ân or the Hadîth? He said: “No! The Qur‘ân.” I said: Shall I teach him all of it? He replied: “Unless that is difficult, in which case teach him some of it.” Then he said to me: “If he begins reciting first, then he will learn correct recitation and will persevere in it.” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Muflih &#8211; <em>rahimahullâh</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Upon this are the followers of Imâm Ahmad right up until our time.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) &#8211; <em>rahimahullâh</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“As for seeking to memorise the Qur‘ân, then this is to be given preference over many of the things that the people consider to be knowledge, but are &#8211; in reality &#8211; either totally useless, or having little benefit. It is also to be given precedence in learning especially by those who wish to acquire knowledge of the <em>Dîn</em>, its principles and its particulars. Since what is prescribed for such a person at this time is that he should begin by memorising the Qur‘ân, as it is the foundation of the branches of the knowledge of the <em>Dîn</em>. This is contrary to what is done by many of the people of Innovation from the non-Arabs and other than them, in that one of them will pre-occupy himself with superfluous parts of knowledge; such as <em>kalâm</em> (rhetorical speech) and argumentation; or very rare matters of differences; and blind-following; which there is no need for; or very strange and rare <i>ahadîth</i>, which are not established, nor of benefit; and many discussions which do not establish proofs. And he abandons memorising the Qur‘ân which is more important than all of this.” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad ibn al-Fadl said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I heard my grandfather say: I asked my father for permission to study under Qutaybah so he said: “First learn the Qur‘ân and then I will give you permission.” So I memorised the Qur‘ân by heart. So he said to me: “Remain until you have led the people in prayer with it (i.e for Tarawîh Prayer).” So I did so, then after the ’Îd he gave me permission, so I left for Marw.” [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ’Abdul Barr (d.463H) &#8211; <em>rahimahullâh</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Seeking knowledge is of levels and is of different stages which should not be skipped over. Whoever skips over them altogether, then he has overstepped the path of the Salaf &#8211; may Allâh have mercy on all of them. Whoever deliberately takes a path other than this has seriously deviated. However, whoever oversteps due to an <em>ijitihâd</em> (a knowledge based judgment that a qualified Scholar makes, intending to reach the truth), then such a person has erred. So the first knowledge is memorisation of the Book of Allâh and seeking to understand it. And it is obligatory to seek everything which will aid in understanding it. However, I do not say that is obligatory to memorise all of the Qur‘ân, but I do say that it is obligatory and essential for anyone who wishes to become a scholar &#8211; not that it is something obligatory in itself.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Khatîb al-Baghdâdî (d.463H) &#8211; <em>rahimahullâh</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It is fitting for a student that he begins with the memorisation of the Book of Allâh &#8211; <em>the Mighty and Majestic</em>. Since it is the greatest of the branches of knowledge and that which should be placed first and given precedence.” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hâdfidh an-Nawawî (d.676H) &#8211; <em>rahimahullâh</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So the first thing he should begin with is memorisation of the mighty Qur‘ân, which is the most important branches of knowledge. And the <em>Salaf</em> did not use to teach Hadîth or Fiqh, except to one who memorised the Qur‘ân. So when he has memorised it, then let him beware of pre-occupying himself from it with Hadîth, Fiqh or other things, to the extent that it leads him to forget anything of the Qur‘ân, or makes that likely.” [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Seeking Knowledge in Due Amounts</strong> [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh, the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“</b><strong>And this is a Qur‘ân which We have divided into parts, in order that you recite it to men at intervals. And we have sent it down in stages.” </strong>[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>sallallâhu </em><i>’</i><em>alayhi wa sallam </em>said to ’Abdullâh ibn ’Amr ibn al-’Âs <em>radiallâhu </em><i>’</i><em>anhumâ</em>: “<i>Read the Qur‘ân in every month.” </i>I said: I find that I have more strength than that. <i>“Recite it in every twenty nights.”</i> I said: I find that I have more strength than that. <i>“Then recite it in every seven days and do not increase upon that.”</i> [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">’Abdullâh ibn ’Amr ibn al-’Âs <i>radiallâ</i><em>hu </em><i>’</i><em>anhumâ </em>also related from the Prophet <em>sallâhu </em><i>’</i><em>alayhi wa sallam </em>that he said: <i>“He does not understand the Qur‘ân who recites it in less than three days.”</i> [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">’Umar ibn ’Abdul-Wâhid &#8211; a companion of al-Awzâ’î &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We read <i>al-Muwatta</i> to Mâlik (d.179H) in forty days, so he said: “A book that took me forty years to compile, you take from me in forty days! How little you understand of it.” [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Khatîb al-Baghdâdî said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It is fitting that he take care in acquiring knowledge and that he should not take too much in one go. Rather, he should take a little at a time, such that he can bear it, memorize it and be able to understand it. Because Allâh &#8211; <i>the Most High </i>&#8211; says: <strong>“And those who disbelieve say: Why is the Qur‘ân not sent down to him all at once? Thus (is it sent down in parts) that We may strengthen your heart thereby. And We have revealed it to you gradually, in stages.” </strong>[16]” [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Khatîb &#8211; <i>rahimahullâh</i> &#8211; also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And know that the heart is an organ from the organs. It is able to bear some things and unable to bear others &#8211; just like the rest of the body. Thus, some people are able to carry one-hundred pounds, whereas others are unable to carry even twenty. Some people are able to walk a number of mites in a day without tiring, whereas others are unable to even walk a mile in a day before they become tired&#8230; So let each person limit himself to what he is able without expending all his energies, because that will better aid him in learning with a good mind, from a arm and proficient teacher.” [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Supplicating for an Increase in Knowledge</strong> [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Say: My Lord! Increase me in knowledge.</strong><strong>”</strong> [Sûrah Tâ Hâ 20:114]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umm Salamah &#8211; <i>radiallâhu ’anha </i>&#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh&#8217;s Messenger <em>sallallâhu </em><i>’</i><em>alayhi wa sallam</em> used to supplicate in the morning Prayer: <i>“O Allâh! I ask you for beneficial knowledge, righteous action and pure sustenance.” </i>[20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Atlas bin Mâlik &#8211; <i>radiallâhu ’anhu</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allâh&#8217;s Messenger <em>sallallâhu </em><i>’</i><em>alayhi wa sallam</em> supplicated: <i>“O Allâh! Benefit me with knowledge. Teach me that which will benefit me, and provide me with knowledge from which I can derive benefit.” </i>[21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abû Bakr Muhammad ibn Ja’far said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">l heard Ibn Khuzaymah (d.311H) being asked: From where did you acquire this knowledge? So he said: “Allâhs Messenger <em>sallallâhu </em><i>’</i><em>alayhi wa sallam</em> said: <i>“Zam-zam water is that for which it is drunk.” </i>[22] So when I drunk the Zam-zam water, I supplicated to Allâh for beneficial knowledge.” [23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslâm Ibn Taymiyyah said: [24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The reality of this matter is that the servant differs in what he asks of knowledge and guidance, and of what he seeks to ask. So with remembrance of Allâh and turning towards Him, Allâh guides such a person &#8211; as He said &#8211; : <strong>“O My servants! All of you are misguided, except whomsoever I guide. So seek your guidance from Me.”</strong> [25] And as the Prophet <em>sallallâhu </em><i>’</i><em>alayhi wa sallam</em> used to say: <i>“O Allâh! Lord of Jibrîl, Mikaîl and Israfîl. The Originator of the heavens and the earths. Knower of the Unseen and the apparent. You judge between Your servants in that which he differs. So guide me in that which I differ from the truth</i> &#8211; <i>by Your permission. Indeed, You guide whomsoever You please, to a path that is straight</i>.<i>”</i> [26]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">As Salaamu Alaykum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakaatuh. May Allah have mercy upon me, you and all of the Muslims. Aameen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once, I entered the masjid for our class with our Shaykh Hasan Abdul-Wahhaab Marzouq Al-Bannaa (may Allah preserve him, and his family upon good), I found him praying. After I offered my prayer of greeting the masjid, I greeted the Shaykh, and kissed his head. We talked about how each of us spent our Eid and the conditions of our families. After this the Shaykh began to drink his tea, which was prepared for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked the Shaykh, <strong>how does one become a strong student, treading the path of seeking knowledge?</strong> The Shaykh replied, Patience (Sabr). He said this 3 times. He said patience with Allah, in good and bad times. Patience with yourself, patience with ease and with hardships. Patience with your family and friends. Patience with knowledge. Patience with the Qur’aan. Patience with learning the Arabic language. I thanked the Shaykh and returned to my place of sitting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After a short while, the Shaykh motioned to me to come to him. <strong>He told me, not to waste time</strong>. He told me to guard my time from the time wasters. He told me not to waste my time with that which wont bring about any benefit. Guard your time against your desires. Give knowledge all of your time. Tire yourself with seeking knowledge. Do not become distracted by those who want to take your knowledge. Once again I thanked the Shaykh and returned to my place of sitting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After a short period, the Shaykh motioned to me again to come to him. <strong>He told me to engulf myself in reading the Qur’aan</strong>. He said to read the Qur’aan in abundance. Over and over and over. He said to read the Qur’aan when you wake from your sleep, read the Qur’aan before you go to bed. The more you read the Qur’aan, the better you will become in the Arabic language. So constantly read the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>He also told me to listen to the tapes of the Ulamaa (major scholars),</strong> from the likes of Shaykh Al-Albaanee, Shaykh Al-Uthaymeen, Shaykh Ibn Baaz, and Shaykh Saalih Aali Shaykh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Later on the Shaykh was asked about <strong>the rights of the Qur’aan</strong>. Is it better to read it or to memorize it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">He, the Shaykh (may Allah preserve him, and his family) said, one should read the Qur’aan. The Qur’aan is to be read. To memorize it is good. But if it cant be memorized, so read it. Read it in your prayers, before you sleep, when you wake. Before prayer and after prayer. Always have a mushaf (copy of the Qur’aan) near you, everywhere. In Shaa Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah have mercy upon us all.</p>

<p><em>Bismillaah wa -Alhamdulillaah wa Salaatu wa Salaam &#8216;alaa Rasulillaah &#8216;amma ba&#8217;d</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On Sunday 10th June, 2012, The Noble <em>Shaykh Dr. &#8216;Ali at-Tuwayjari (</em>May <strong>Allaah</strong> Preserve Him), professor of tafseer at the university of <em>Madinah</em>, K.S.A., and from the well known scholars of <em>Saudi Arabia</em> delivered a LIVE Tele-Lecture with <em>Muwahhideen Publications</em> highlighting some points to reflect upon in the noble book of <strong>Allaah</strong>.</p>
<p>This lecture event was translated LIVE into English.</p>
<p><strong>Listen / <a href="http://salafiaudio.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/points_of_contemplation_from_the_book_of_allaah_-_shaykh_ali_at-tuwayjari.mp3" target="_blank">Download Mp3 Here</a></strong> (<strong>Time</strong> 44:18)<br />

<p>The <em>Shaykh</em> organized this beautiful reminder according to 3 noble merits of the <em>Qur’aan</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="text-align:justify;">The virtue of its recitation. Here, he appealed to the </span><em style="text-align:justify;">Muslimoon</em><span style="text-align:justify;"> to sectionize the </span><em style="text-align:justify;">Qur’aan</em><span style="text-align:justify;"> into portions and allot a fraction of each day to the recitation of these portions, bit by bit, so much so, as taught in the hadeeth of </span><em style="text-align:justify;">‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr</em><span style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-align:justify;">, that one should not allow 40 days to pass without reciting and reflecting on the entire book.</span></span></span></span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="text-align:justify;">The virtue of it as a cure. Here, the </span><em style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh</em><span style="text-align:justify;"> discussed the healing benefits of the </span><em style="text-align:justify;">Qur’aan</em><span style="text-align:justify;"> for those experiencing illness, pain, fear and even whisperings of the </span><em style="text-align:justify;">shaytaan</em><span style="text-align:justify;">. He emphasized the blessings of </span><em style="text-align:justify;">Suraat-ul-Baqarah</em><span style="text-align:justify;"> and enlisted 3 ways from the </span><em style="text-align:justify;">Sunnah</em><span style="text-align:justify;">, whereby one can perform this </span><em style="text-align:justify;">ruqayyah</em><span style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-align:justify;">.</span></span></span></span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="text-align:justify;">The Virtue of Teaching it. Here, the </span><em style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh</em><span style="text-align:justify;"> encouraged the </span><em style="text-align:justify;">muslimoon</em><span style="text-align:justify;"> to learn the </span><em style="text-align:justify;">Qur’aan</em><span style="text-align:justify;"> and to teach it, showing the loftiness of such an act.</span></span></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is merely a summary of the points of contemplation mentioned by our <em>Shaykh Dr. &#8216;Ali ibn Razi at-Tuwayjari</em> <em>(hafidhahullaah) </em>in this highly beneficial reminder.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center">From the Secrets of <em>Fatiha</em> and What it Contains<br />
By Shaykh ul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah as-Salafi  <em>-Rahimullaah-</em><br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <strong><em>Two Strengths</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The human being has two strengths:</p>
<ol>
<li>The strength of researched knowledge.</li>
<li>And the strength of practical firm determination of actions.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> A human’s complete happiness is dependent upon the perfection and completion of the two strengths of knowledge and firm determination of actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the perfection and completion of the strength of knowledge, then this is achieved</p>
<ol>
<li>by knowing his Creator and his Originator,</li>
<li>knowing His Names and Attributes;</li>
<li>by knowing the path which leads to Him, and</li>
<li>by knowing what causes weakness in following that path, and</li>
<li>by knowing himself and his shortcomings and mistakes.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having awareness of these <strong>five points</strong>, leads the human to achieve perfection in the strength of knowledge. The most knowledgeable of the people are those who know and understand these points the most.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> As for the perfection and completion of the strength of practical firm determination of actions, this can only be achieved by complying with the rights of Allaah <em>-Subhanahu-</em> which He has over the slave, and the slave fulfills them with <em>Ikhlaas</em> (sincerity), truthfulness, faithfully, being righteous and by following and testifying to Allaah’s favours upon the slave of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The slave has shortcomings in fulfilling Allaah’s rights, and so is ashamed to face Allaah with what (little) he has from servitude to Him. The slave knows that his servitude to Allaah is less than that which Allaah is worthy of, in fact it is even less and lesser than that.  There is no way for him to perfect these two strengths except with Allaah’s help.  Allaah guides him to the straight path to which He guided, His <em>‘Aawliyaa</em> and those who are close to Him. Allaah averts him from going off the path (<em>Siraat</em>), through either becoming corrupted in his strength of knowledge, and he falls into misguidance, or from his strength of actions, which obligates anger upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <strong><em>The Principles of Guidance in Sooratul – Fatiha</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The complete happiness of a human cannot be achieved except with a combination of these matters, and they are included in Sooratul Fatiha and these matters are arranged in the best way, so the saying of Allaah Ta’ala: <span style="color:#339966;">&lt;&lt;All praise belongs to Allaah, the Lord of all the worlds * The Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.  * The Only Owner (and the Only Ruling Judge) of the Day of Recompense (i.e. the Day of Resurrection)&gt;&gt;</span> comprises the first principle, which is knowing about Allaah and His Names, His Attributes and His Actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Names mentioned in this Soorah are the principle names of Allaah’s Beautiful Names, which are; the Name ‘<strong>Allaah</strong>’, ‘<strong>ar-Rabb</strong>’ (The Lord) and <strong>‘ar-Rahmaan</strong>’ (The Most Merciful).</p>
<ul>
<li>The Name ‘Allaah’ comprises the attributes of al-Ulooheeya (worship).</li>
<li>The Name ‘ar-Rabb’ comprises the attributes of Roobubeeyah.</li>
<li>The Name ‘ar-Rahman’ comprises the attributes of Beneficence, generosity and Kindness.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meanings of the Names of Allaah revolve around this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;">&lt;&lt;You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything)&gt;&gt;</span> : This is knowing the path leading to Allaah, which is none other than worshipping Him Alone with what Allaah loves and is pleased with, and seeking aid from Him whilst worshipping Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for His saying: <span style="color:#339966;">&lt;&lt;Guide us to the Straight Way &gt;&gt;</span> this comprises the explanation that the slave of Allaah has no way to his own happiness except by <em>Isteeqamah</em> (being upright) on the <em>Siraat al-Mustaqeem</em> (the straight path).  There is no path for him to <em>Isteeqamah</em> except by Allaah’s guidance, just as there is no way for him to Allaah’s worship except by Allaah’s aid, in the same way there is no path for him to <em>Isteeqamah</em> upon the correct way except by Allaah’s guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Allaah’s saying: <span style="color:#339966;">&lt;&lt; not (the way) of those who earned Your Anger, nor of those who went astray&gt;&gt;</span> this contains the two extremities of deviancy from the straight path.  Deviating to one of these sides leads to misguidance, which is the corruption of knowledge and belief deviating to the other side, to Allaah’s anger which is due to corruption of the intention and action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first part of the <em>Soorah</em> is mercy, the middle is guidance and last part is blessings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <strong><em>The Slave of Allaah is between Blessings and Guidance</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The portion of blessings a slave of Allaah has is related to the amount of guidance he has.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proportion of guidance for a slave of Allaah is related to the portion of Mercy. So, the whole matter returns back to Allaah’s Blessings and His Mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Blessing and Mercy are from those things which necessitate Allaah’s <em>Roobubeeyah</em> (Lordship). Indeed Allaah is The Merciful and The Giver of blessings and these are from the obligations of His <em>Ilaheeyaeehi</em> (being the One worthy of worship), so He is the deity in Truth, even if the rejecters deny it, and the <em>Mushrikeen</em> associate partners with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever puts into effect the meanings of <em>Fatiha</em> with knowledge and understanding, practically and immediately; then he will have been successful in his perfecting [knowledge and action] in the best way. Then his worship of Allaah becomes a distinct worship by which his grade is raised above that of the general worshippers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Wa Allaahul Must’aan</em>.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do you know this Book?</strong></span><br />
[From the &#8216;Invitation to Islam&#8217; Newsletter, Issue 2, July 1997]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Of all the acclaimed masterpieces that the world has seen, nothing can be compared to the book known as the Qur&#8217;an. Millions have become Muslims upon simply hearing a verse from this amazing book, yet still the majority knows nothing of it. The Qur&#8217;an is the Final Revelation from the Creator to humanity. It was revealed in the year 610 CE to the Prophet Muhammed (Peace be upon him), and completed over a period of 23 years. These 23 years of revelation resulted in a book which comprised of 114 chapters and 6,666 verses. All of this was to become the primary source of law for the whole of mankind to live and die by.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The impact of this book is such that Allah says :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Had We[1] revealed this Qur&#8217;an upon a mountain, surely you would have seen it humble itself and crumble out of the fear of Allah. Such are the parables We put forward to mankind so that they may reflect&#8221; (Surah Al-Hashr 59:21)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, it seems as if the hearts of the people have become harder then the mountains which tower above us. When the Qur&#8217;an is recited or even mentioned, people turn away with disgust. In the West, this is primarily due to the negative exposure from the media. It has resulted in many non-Muslims not even wanting to hear the name of this amazing book. Muslims too, have become hardhearted because of the cultural influences of the West. Many young Muslims perceive the Qur&#8217;an to be nothing more then an old wrapped up book, which comes off the highest shelf once a year during Ramadan!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If people were to truly reflect upon this book, they would realise that nothing in this world is quite the same. So why should this claim be accepted over others? Why should the Qur&#8217;an be given precedence over the likes of the Bible, the Gita[2] or the Granth Sahib[3] ? The following reasons will inshallah give an indication as to why this book deserves the attention of all humanity.</p>
<p><strong>Preservation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There is probably in the world no other book which has remained twelve centuries with so pure a text&#8221;. Writing 200 years ago, these are the words of the famous English critic of Islam, Sir William Muir. But as Muslims we do not need Williarn Muir to tell us this. 1400 years ago, the Muslims accepted this reality when Allah revealed to them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed it is We who have sent down the reminder (the Qur&#8217;an), and indeed it is Us who shall preserve it&#8221; (Surah Al-Hijr 15:9)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These words have proved true to this very day. From the moment the first words were revealed to Muhammed (Peace be upon him), to this very day, every single letter and word of the Qur&#8217;an has remained unchanged.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Before Islam, all the revelations sent were not given this divine assurance. This is why we find that books like the Bible are riddled with corruption and inaccuracies. It is well known that man has tampered with the Bible to the extent that annually different versions are produced to suit trends and desires[4]. In fact this has been going on for so long that it is almost impossible to see what of the words of the Creator are left, if any!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With the Qur&#8217;an it is the exact opposite. The contents of this amazing book are stored in the hearts of millions of Muslims worldwide. Children as young as 12 have memorized the entire book in its original language, Arabic. There is no other religious scripture on earth which is orally preserved in its original language by so many and over such a period of time, without having been tampered somewhere along the line. The Bible is a prime example of this. Many Christians believe that English is the divine language of the Bible. However Jesus (as) spoke Aramaic. From Aramaic, his life-story was translated into Hebrew. From Hebrew it was translated into Greek. From Greek to Latin, and then finally from Latin to English! There has not been a single vicar, priest or layman in recorded history who has even memorised the Bible in English, let alone the Aramaic! As Muslims we believe the Qur&#8217;an can only be in the language it was revealed in, i.e. Arabic. Anything else is a translation and not the divine words of the Creator. A true test of this divine preservation would be to burn all the books and manuscripts in existence, to see which can return as it was. The Qur&#8217;an would be the only book which would return in its original form, letter for letter, word for word.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many Christians say that the Qur&#8217;anic claim of preservation needs to be backed-up by manuscript evidence. For us this is not a necessary criteria, but in order to quell the doubts, the Muslims have ample proof. Two copies of the Qur&#8217;an are in existence which date back to the Third Caliph Uthmaan (may Aah be please with him), 20 years after the death of the Prophet (Peace be upon him). These two copies are to be found in the Topkapi museum, Istanbul, Turkey and in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. The Tashkent copy is thought to have been the personal copy of the Caliph as it still contains stains of his blood, which was shed when he was murdered whilst reading it. Any copy of the Qur&#8217;an which is compared to these copies, will show that there is not a single difference between what we have today and what was in existence 1400 years ago. Thus Allah&#8217;s promise holds true.</p>
<p><strong>No Mistakes</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Man as a creature is fallible. For this reason anything which is produced by him will naturally have faults. With the Qur&#8217;an, such a notion cannot even be considered as it is from the one who is Infallible. In fact Allah clarifies this matter beautifully when he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Do they not consider the Qur&#8217;an? Had it been from other then Allah surely they would have found much discrepancies within it&#8221; (Surah An-Nisa 4:82)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Throughout history many have tried to scrutinize and search the Qur&#8217;an for mistakes and errors. To this day no one has been able to bring a shred of proof showing that this book is not from Allah. Some Christians have even called it the work of the Devil because the book affected them so much when they read it! With other scriptures, contradictions, mistakes and absurdities are constantly present. When people contrast these ambiguities with the Qur&#8217;an, it often results in the acceptance of this faultless book.</p>
<p><strong>The Arabic Language</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Upon hearing Qur&#8217;anic recitation, you may be rather startled. Besides hearing the reciter of the prayer, you often hear people in the background sobbing and wailing heavily. So what is it that makes these people cry so much? It is nothing more then the beauty and eloquence of this book which moves millions to tears. This beauty is expressed in the language of Arabic. Allah says :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed We have revealed this as an Arabic Qur&#8217;an so that you may understand&#8221; (Surah Yusuf 12:2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At the time of the Prophet (Peace be upon him) three modes of expression were used. There was normal speech, the speech of the soothsayer and poetry. The Arabs were the masters of their language, and poetry was their cultural highlight. Arabic poetry is split into 16 categories, each separate from the other. When the Qur&#8217;an was proclaimed to the Arabs it amazed them beyond all limits. It was like nothing they had ever heard before. It did not fit into the 16 categories of poetry, nor was it the speech of a soothsayer, and it certainly was not normal speech. If it was not all these, then it could only be the word of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eloquence and majesty of the early chapters of the Qur&#8217;an moved many to tears, and the beautiful Qur&#8217;anic Arabic converted millions of Arabs in the Middle-East. Not only did the Qur&#8217;an effect the lives of these Arabs, but it also transformed their culture. Even today, no serious study of the Arabic language is possible without reference to this book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reaction of some pagans was that they accused Muhammed (Peace be upon him) of being a soothsayer and a madman. In order to silence them, Allah issued a challenge. At first he asked them to produce a book like the Qur&#8217;an. When it could not be done, Allah asked them to produce ten chapters like it. When this too could not be done Allah finally stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And if you are in doubt as to what We have revealed to Our slave, then produce a chapter like it&#8221; (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:23)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The smallest chapter in the Qur&#8217;an is only 3 verses long (Chapter 108). The pagans at the time of the Prophet (Peace be upon him) could not even produce something as small as this, and since then no one else has completed this impossible task. All of this is in light of the fact that the Prophet Muhammed (Peace be upon him) could not read or write, thus refuting those who say that the Qur&#8217;an was his own handiwork.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur&#8217;an is the Final book of revelation. After it there will be no more. However, many have tried to deny this by producing their own new versions of the Qur&#8217;an. Among them have been the two false prophets, Musailama[5] and Ghulam Ahmed[6]. Many Chapters in the Qur&#8217;an are named after animals, such as the Ant, Spider etc. Musailama tried to copy this, and went about creating a chapter in his book called the Weasel! In Arabic it is called Al-Wabl and it hardly causes people to be struck in awe! On the other hand Ghulam Ahmed, the &#8216;British stooge&#8217;, claimed to receive revelation in cockney English!! Such foolishness could never compare to the beauty of the Qur&#8217;an with its clear and beautiful Arabic language.</p>
<p><strong>Science</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Over the past few decades much interest has been shown in the scientific content of the Qur&#8217;an. Scientific data which has been discovered in recent times, has been existent in this book for 1400 years. In fact the very common origin of this universe is stated clearly by Allah, the Most High:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Do not the disbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together, then We parted them. And We made from water every living thing. Will they then not believe?&#8221; (Surah Al-Anbiya 21:30)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This parting of the heavens and the earth is more commonly known to scientists as the &#8216;big bang&#8217;. It is also a fact that life originated from water and that every living cell is composed of 85% water. Without water life is impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The mountains of the earth, like icebergs, have roots going deep into the ground. This ensures that they will not topple with their extreme heights &#8211; this is known as &#8216;isostasy&#8217;. In this way the mountains are like the stakes which are used to anchor a tent. But this fact is already known to us when Allah says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Have We not made the earth an expanse and the mountains stakes?&#8221; (Surah An-Naba 78:6-7)<br />
&#8220;Allah has cast into the ground mountains standing firm so that it does not shake with you&#8221; (Surah Luqman 31:10)</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The embryological data which is found in the Qur&#8217;an is astounding. Allah describes the formation of a baby inside the womb from the very moment the sperm reaches the ovum, to its formation into a human. This data, which was only discovered about 30 years ago, has amazed many Western scientists. Amongst them is Dr Keith Moore from the University of Toronto, Canada. Dr Moore[7] is a recognized authority in embryological circles, with his university text book being set as a standard text in many universities throughout the world. When Dr Moore was asked as to how this information in the Qur&#8217;an could be explained, he replied: &#8220;It could only have been divinely revealed&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>History</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur&#8217;an is a book of historical accuracy. One accuracy which has corrected the mistakes of many Christians and historians, is the fate of the pharaoh who drowned in the Red Sea whilst pursuing Moses. The Biblical story would have us believe that the matter ended when the pharaoh drowned. But the Qur&#8217;an explains further. When he was drowning the pharaoh confessed his faith in Allah. But it was too late, and Allah promised him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This day We shall preserve you in your body, so that you may be a sign for those who come after you. But indeed many of mankind are heedless of Our signs&#8221; (Surah Yunus 10:92)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In 1898 the tombs of various pharaohs were discovered in the Valley of the Kings, in Egypt. In 1975 Dr Maurice Bucaille, an eminent French surgeon was allowed to examine the mummified bodies of Rameses II and the pharaoh who had pursued Moses &#8211; Merneptah. Dr Bucaille discovered that Merneptah had received very violent blows to several parts of his body and had suffered a massive heart attack. Amazingly, these are the results which occur when someone dies from drowning! Thus Allah had saved the body of the transgressing pharaoh as a sign for all humanity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For those who say that Muhammed (Peace be upon him) knew his history and wrote it in the Qur&#8217;an, the following shall prove otherwise. In the year 615 CE the Roman army was defeated by the Persians. About this event Allah revealed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Romans have been defeated in the lowest land, but in a few years they shall be victorious again, within three to nine years. The decision of the matter, before and after, is only with Allah&#8221; (Surah Ar-Rum 30:24)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The words of Allah proved true as the Persians were defeated at the battle of Issus, 7 years later in 622 CE. There is no possible way that Muhammed (Peace be upon him) could have known (if he wrote the Qur&#8217;an) that the Romans would be victorious. In fact he also did not know that the &#8216;lowest land&#8217; at which the battle was fought was literally that. The battle in 615 CE was fought on the shores of the Dead Sea, the lowest point below sea level on earth, at 1300 ft.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A book with these credentials could only be from the Creator of the heavens and the earth. A book which we need to acquaint ourselves with. A book . . .</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;. . . which has been revealed to you (O&#8217; Muhammed) so that you may lead mankind out of the darkness and into the light&#8221; (Surah lbrahim 14:1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Footnotes</strong> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 The word &#8216;WE&#8217; does not mean that there is more then one God. Rather it is a plural of respect which gives Allah grandeur over his creation.<br />
2 The Baghyad Gita is one of the Hindu scriptures.<br />
3 The Guru Granth Sahib is the Sikh scripture<br />
4 The most recent version of the Bible is the &#8216;Politically Correct Version&#8217;!!<br />
5 Musailama claimed prophethood just before the death of the Prophet Muhammed (Peace be upon him). He was from the region of Yamaamah in Arabia and from the tribe of Haneefah.<br />
6 Ghulam Ahmed was born in 1840 in Qadian, India. He claimed prophethood at the request of his imperialist masters, the British Government.<br />
7 Besides Dr Moore, there have been many other famous Western scientists who have accepted Islam. One of the most prominent was the famous French oceanographer, Jacques Yves Cousteau who has recently passed away. Cousteau was amazed at the accuracy of the Qur&#8217;anic statements regarding underwater activity and thus embraced Islam. As a result of his death, Cousteau&#8217;s life achievements have been highlighted in the Western media. However his acceptance of Islam was conveniently absent from the news-reports.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Reciting Surah Al-Ikhlas, Al-Mu`awwidhatayn, and Al-Fatihah as a cure for illness </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwa no. 446 :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">Q: Is it lawful or not to recite Surah Al-Ikhlas, Al- Mu‘awwidhatayn (Surahs Al-Falaq and Al-Nas) and Al-Fatihah for the purpose of seeking healing? Did the Messenger (peace be upon him) or the Salaf (righteous predecessors) do so? Please, enlighten us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Reciting Surah Al-Ikhlas, Mu‘awwidhatayn, Al-Fatihah and other Surahs is regarded as a permissible Ruqyah (reciting Qur’an and saying supplications over the sick seeking healing) which the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) legislated by performing it himself and approving it for his Sahabah (Companions).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari and Muslim narrated in their two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith on the authority of Ma‘mar from Al-Zuhry from ‘Urwah that ‘Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">In his last illness, the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to blow breath (into his cupped hands) and recite Al-Mu‘awwidhatayn (Surahs Al-Falaq and Al-Nas) and then wipe over his body. But when his illness aggravated, I used to recite them over him and pass his own hand over his body for its blessing.</span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ma‘mar asked Al-Zuhry  “How did he use to blow breath?” He said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“He used blow into his hands and then pass them over his face.”</span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari narrated on the authority of Abu Sa‘id Al-Khudry (may Allah be pleased with him):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the Sahabah of the Prophet (peace be upon him) came across one of the Arab tribes, but they refused to extend to them hospitality. Then the leader of that tribe was stung, so they asked (the Sahabah), “Do you have any remedy or someone who can recite supplications over the sick as a cure?” They said, “You refused to offer us hospitality, so we will not do anything until you give us something in return.” And they agreed on a flock of sheep, <em><span style="color:#008000;">so one of them (the Sahabah) started reciting Umm Al-Qur’an (Surah Al-Fatihah); gathering his saliva and spitting on it (the snake-bite)</span></em>, and the man got cured. Then they brought the sheep, but they (the Sahabah) said, “We will not take them until we ask the Prophet (whether it is lawful).” When they asked him, he smiled and said, “How do you know that it (Surah Al-Fatihah) is a Ruqyah? Take them (the sheep) and assign a share for me.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The first Hadith indicates that the Prophet (peace be upon him) did recite Al-Mu‘awwidhatayn over himself during his illness, while the second shows his approval of his Sahabah’s recitation of Al-Fatihah as Ruqyah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Whosoever The Qur’Aan And The Sunnah Does Not Suffice,Then May Allaah Not Suffice Him (Man-Lam Yakfih Alqur’Aan Was-Sunnah Falaa Kafaahul-Allaah)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation Of The Text In Al-Qawl-Ul-Mufeed Fee Adillatit Tawheed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Benefit (Faa’idah):<br />
al-‘Allaamah Ibnul-Qayyim has mentioned in Zaad al-Ma’aad: 4/352:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His (ta’aalaa) statement:<br />
Is it not sufficient for them that We have sent down to you the Book (the Qur&#8217;aan) which is recited to them? (Al-&#8216;Ankaboot 29:51)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said: ((Whosoever the Qur’aan does not heal, then may Allaah not heal him. And whosoever the Qur’aan does not suffice, then may Allaah not suffice him)) [Faman lam Yashfih al- Qur’aan, Falaa Shafaahul-Allaah, wa man lam Yakfih Falaa Kafaahul-Allaah]. End of quote.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Aboo Ibraaheem [2] said: Whosoever the Book and the Sunnah does not suffice, then may Allaah not suffice him. And whosoever the Book and the Sunnah does not satisfy, then may Allaah not satisfy him [Wa man lam Yakfih al-Kitaab was-Sunnah Falaa Kafaahul-Allaah, wa man lam Yaqna’ bil-Kitaab was-Sunnah Falaa Aqna’hul-Allaah].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>EXPLANATION OF THE TEXT BY SHAYKH AHMED AL-WASAABEE (HAFIDHAHULLAAH): </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We find many of the people of innovation following the statements of their leaders in misguidance, and beautifying this to themselves and to the people, and leaving off the guidance of the Kitaab and the Sunnah. So the phrases that are mentioned in this chapter are supplications against these people and their likes, from the people of innovations and desires, those who are not satisfied, and do not find comfort in the Kitaab and the Sunnah, then these are supplications against them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] And he is the writer, ash-Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab al-Wasaabee (hafidhahullaah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Posted from Class 43 this Excellent Book:</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#993300;">Sahih Bukhari , Volume 4, Book 56, Number 814:</span></p>
<p>Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a Christian who embraced Islam and read <em>Surat-al-Baqara</em> and <em>Al-Imran,</em> and he used to write (the revelations) for the Prophet. Later on he returned to Christianity again and he used to say: &#8220;Muhammad knows nothing but what I have written for him.&#8221; Then Allah caused him to die, and the people buried him, but in the morning they saw that the earth had thrown his body out. They said, &#8220;This is the act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our companion and took his body out of it because he had run away from them.&#8221; They again dug the grave deeply for him, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown his body out. They said, &#8220;This is an act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our companion and threw his body outside it, for he had run away from them.&#8221; They dug the grave for him as deep as they could, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown his body out. So they believed that what had befallen him was not done by human beings and had to leave him thrown (on the ground).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source : Everyday Issues , Al-Istiqaamah Issue No.7 &#8211; Rabî&#8217; ul-Awwal 1418H / July 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwa from Shaik Ibn Baaz</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q]: What is your advice &#8211; O Shaykh &#8211; for those who go without reading the Qur&#8217;aan for a month, or even many months, and who have no excuse for such behaviors? However, you will find some of them reading those magazines that contain no benefit for them, and following them up closely!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: &#8220;It is recommended for every Believing man and woman to recite the Book of Allaah often, with due contemplation and understanding. This may be done by using a copy of the Qur&#8217;aan or from one&#8217;s memory. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <strong>&#8220;This is a Book which We have sent down to you, full of blessings, that you may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may remember.&#8221; </strong>[Soorah Saad 38:29].And:<strong> &#8220;Indeed those who recite the Book of Allaah and offer the Prayer perfectly and spend in charity out of what We have provided for them &#8211; secretly and openly &#8211; hope for a sure trade-gain that will never perish. That He may pay them their wages in full and give them even more out of His Grace. Indeed, He is Oft-Forgiving, ready to appreciate good deeds.&#8221;</strong> [Soorah Faatir 35:29-30].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The aforementioned recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan includes both reciting and acting upon it. The recitation is to be done with contemplation and understanding of it. Sincerity to Allaah is a means of complying with and acting upon the Qur&#8217;aan, and its recitation contains a great reward &#8211; as the Prophet <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> said: <em>&#8220;Recite the Qur&#8217;aan. For on the Day of Resurrection, it shall come as an intercessor for its companion.&#8221;</em> This was recorded by Muslim in his Saheeh (no.804). The Prophet <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> also said: &#8220;The best of you is he who learns the Qur&#8217;aan and teaches it.&#8221; This was Recorded by al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh (3/66). Another narration states: <em>&#8220;Whosoever reads one harf (letter) of the Qur&#8217;aan shall receive a good deed and ten good deeds similar to it. I do not say that Alif Laam Meem is a harf but Alif is a harf and Laam is a harf and Meem is a harf.&#8221;</em>12 The Prophet <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> said to &#8216;Abdullaah ibn &#8220;Amr ibn al-&#8216;Aas: <em>&#8220;Complete the recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan once a month.&#8221;</em> He said: I am able to do more than that. So he said: <em>&#8220;Then complete its recital once in seven days.&#8221;</em>13 The Companions used to complete the entire Qur&#8217;aan once every seven days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I advise all the readers of the Qur&#8217;aan to increase in their reading of it, with contemplation and understanding it, along with sincerity to Allaah in this &#8211; with the purpose of learning and benefiting from the Qur&#8217;aan. They should read the entire Qur&#8217;aan once a month. If, however, they are able to do more than this without any difficulty, then they should complete it in less than this time. However, it is best not to complete it in less than three days, since this is the least amount of time that the Prophet <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> mentioned to &#8216;Abdullaah ibn &#8216;Amr ibn al-&#8216;Aas. This is because if it is read in less than three days, the person becomes hasty and lacks thought and concentration &#8230;&#8221;14</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. <strong>Saheeh</strong>: Recorded by at-Tirmidhee (no.2912), who authenticated it, from the hadeeth of &#8216;Abdullaah ibn Mas&#8217;ood <em>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>.<br />
13. Recorded by al-Bukhaaree (no.5054).<br />
14. <em>Fataawaa al-Mar&#8217;ah</em> (no.294)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: On the last night of Ramadan in 1400 A.H., the Imam (the one who leads congregational Prayer) finished the recitation of the whole Qur&#8217;an. He said that the reward of this Khatmah (completing of one reading of the whole Qur&#8217;an) is dedicated to our Prophet Muhammad. What is the opinion of the Shariýah (Islamic law) on this? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is not permissible to dedicate the reward of any act of worship or Khatmah to the Messenger (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Salaf (righteous predecessors) from the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet, may Allah be pleased with them) and those after them did not do so. The acts of Ibadah (worship) are Tawqifiy (bound by a religious text and not amenable to personal opinion). The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, &#8216;Anyone who does an action which is not in accordance with this matter of ours (Islam), will have it rejected. &#8216; The Prophet (peace be upon him) is rewarded for every righteous act performed by his Ummah (nation) just as they are, because it was he who guided and directed them to this. It has been authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, &#8216;Anyone who guides to good will have a reward like that of the one who does it.&#8217; (Related by Muslim in his &#8220;Sahih [Book of Authentic Hadith]&#8221; on the authority of Abu Mas&#8217;ud Al-Ansary [may Allah be pleased with him])</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">You can download the below as PDF @ <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/an-interview-with-umm-saalih-a-grandmother-who-completed-memorizing-the-quran-at-82-years-old.pdf" target="_blank">An Interview with Umm Saalih, A Grandmother Who Completed Memorizing the Qur&#8217;an at 82 Years Old</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hamdulillaah (All-Praise is due to Allah), the One Who said (what means): &#8220;And in truth We have made the Qur&#8217;aan easy to remember; but is there any that remembers?&#8221; Surah 54: 32</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many all over the world memorize the Qur&#8217;aan, and it is not strange to see the youth memorizing the Noble Qur&#8217;aan and an early age. Al-Hamdulillaah, the One who made the Qur&#8217;aan easy for remembrance, had made it easy for Umm Saalih age 82. In an interview with Umm Saalih, she was asked the following questions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q1: &#8220;What was the reason that drove you to memorize the Qur&#8217;aan after so many years?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said, &#8220;I always hoped to memorize the Qur&#8217;aan from the time I was young. My father always used to invoke Allaah for me to become one of the memorizers of the Qur&#8217;aan, like himself and like the elder brothers of my family who memorized it. So I memorized in the beginning about three parts and then after I completed the age of thirteen, I got married and became busy with the household and the children. After I had seven children, my husband died. They (the children) were all young so I took the time to raise them and educate them, and then after they grew up and got married, I had more time for myself. Therefore, the first thing I directed myself to focus upon was the Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q2: &#8220;Tell us about your journey with the Noble Qur&#8217;aan.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said, &#8220;My younger daughter was going to high school and she was the closest of my children to me and the most beloved, because she stayed with me after her older sisters got married and got busy with their lives, and because she was a quiet girl, upright, loving, and good. In addition, she was interested in learning the Noble Qur&#8217;aan, and her teachers encouraged her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, she was very enthusiastic and always told me of many women who were driven by this great motivation to memorize the Qur&#8217;aan, and this is where I started.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q3: &#8220;Tell me about your way of memorization.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said, &#8220;We assigned ten verses (meaning her and her daughter who was going to high school). So each day after Asr, we used to sit together. She reads and I repeat after her three times. Then she explains the meaning to me, and after a while, she repeats that three times. On the next morning, she repeats them to me before she goes to school.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She recorded also the recitations of Ash Shaykh al Husary, Rahimuhullaah, repeating each verse three times and thus I continued to listen most of the time. Therefore, the next day we would go to the next ten verses if my memorization was good. Otherwise, we would postpone taking additional verses until the day after. Moreover, we assigned the day of Friday to review the memorizations of the entire week. And this was the journey from the beginning.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then she said, &#8220;Over four years and a half, I memorized twelve juz&#8221; according to the way I described to you. Then this young daughter got married. When her husband knew of our task concerning the memorization, he rented a house close to me, close to my house, so that he could allow the continuation of the memorization. In addition, he, May Allah reward him used to encourage us and sometimes sit with us listening, explaining and teaching.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then after three years of her marriage, my daughter got busy with the children and the household and our schedule was interrupted, but that did not make her give up. To the contrary, she sensed that my eagerness for the memorization was still established so she looked for a special good teacher to continue the journey under her supervision. So, I completed the memorization by the success of Allaah and my daughter is still working to finish the memorization of the Glorious Qur&#8217;aan. She has a little left, In Shaa Allaah Ta&#8217;aala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q4: &#8220;This motivation of yours, did it have an effect on other women around you?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said, &#8220;It really had a good strong effect. My daughters and stepdaughters were all encouraged and worked on learning and teaching the Qur&#8217;aan to their children and learning it themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q5: &#8220;After finishing the Noble Qur&#8217;aan, don&#8217;t you think about working on memorizing hadith?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said, &#8220;Now I have memorized ninety hadith and In Shaa Allaah I will continue the journey. I depend, in my memorization, upon the tapes and upon the Qur&#8217;aan radio station. At the end of each week, my daughter comes and checks for me the memorization of three hadith, and I am trying now to memorize more.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q6: &#8220;Over this period of memorization of the Qur&#8217;aan, did your life change? Was it affected in one way or another?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said, &#8220;Yes, I went through a major change and I tried always, all praise is due to Allaah, to obey Allaah before I started the memorization. However, after I started the task of memorization, I began to feel a self-comfort, a great self-comfort and all worries began to move away from me. I even reached the stage of freeing myself from all these excessive worries concerning fearing for the children and their affairs, and my morale was boosted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I had a noble objective to work for and this is a great Ni&#8217;mah (Favor) from Allaah . upon me, since we know that some women, when they get old and they do not have a husband, and their children got married, may be destroyed by the empty time, thoughts, worries, and so forth. But, AlHamdulillaah, I didn&#8217;t go through this and I made myself busy with a great task and a great objective.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q7: &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you think at one point, to join one of the circles focusing on teaching the Noble Qur&#8217;aan?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer was, &#8220;Yes, some of the women suggested this to me, but I am a woman who got used to staying at home, and I don&#8217;t like to go out everyday, and Al Hamdulillaah, my daughter sufficed me from all difficulty and I was so happy while I was learning from her. My daughter had set an example in goodness and righteousness which we rarely find in our days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She started this task and journey with me while she was an adolescent and this is a critical age many people complain of. She used to pressure herself so that she could have spare time to teach me, and she used to teach me with kindness and wisdom. Her husband was a good help to her and he exerted a lot of effort. I ask Allaah . to give them success and to bring their children up on uprightness.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q8: &#8220;What do you say to a woman of your age who wishes to learn and memorize the Qur&#8217;aan yet she is worried about it and feeling unable to?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said, &#8220;I say to her there their shall be no despair with the firm, sincere and truthful determination. Begin with sincerity, firm determination and dependence on Allaah at each time. And remember that at this age you should have the time for yourself. However, do not use your time to only go out or to sleep and so forth. Rather, busy yourself with righteous work.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q9: &#8220;Now what would you say to a woman who is still young? What would you advise her?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She, may Allaah preserve her, said: &#8220;Preserve Allaah and He will preserve you. Make use of the favor of Allaah bestowed upon you from health and ways and means of comfort. Use that to memorize the Book of Allaah. This is the light which enlivens your heart, your life and your grave after you die.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if you have a mother then exert the effort to teach her, and there is no better favor upon a mother than one of her righteous children aiding her to be close to Allaah.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">There are some people who write amulets for sick, insane, and psychiatric patients including in them parts of the Qurýan and Sunnah we never vouch for the sound creed of such people. We advised them against doing so, but they refused to listen, saying: We write only what is in the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam), which is not prohibited. Some of these amulets are worn by the patients themselves, or by an impure woman such as a menstruating woman, or a woman in her postnatal, or an insane, an under age child who does not know how to clean himself. Is this permissible?</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) permitted incantations with Qur&#8217;anic recitation, and supplications, as long as they do not include Shirk, or meaningless words. Muslim narrated in his Sahih that Auf bin Malik said: We used to use incantations in the pre-Islamic era, so we asked the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam): What formula should we recite for that purpose? He said: <span style="color:#008000;">Let me hear what you say. There is no harm in incantations as long as they do not include Shirk in them</span>. [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Scholars have unanimously agreed on the permissibility of incantations provided they meet the above condition, and believing that it has no effect without the Will of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is rather, Shirk according to the Hadith which is narrated by Imam Ahmad in which Imran bin Husain, may Allaah be pleased with him, reported that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) <span style="color:#008000;">saw a man wearing a copper bangle on his arm, and he asked him: What is this? He said: I am wearing it for cephalic weakness. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: Remove it, for it will not increase you in anything except weakness, and if you should die while you are wearing it, you would never be successful. </span>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another version narrated by Ahmad, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: <span style="color:#008000;">He who wears an amulet commits Shirk</span>. [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also narrated by Ahmad and others that Ibn Mas&#8217;ud, may Allaah be pleased with him, said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah saying: <span style="color:#008000;">Verily, incantations amulets and Tiwalah [5] are Shirk</span>. [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If the worn amulet contains Qur&#8217;anic words, then it is, prohibited according to the preponderant opinion for three reasons:</strong> </span></p>
<ol>
<li>The general prohibition of wearing any kind of amulets according to the Prophetic traditions with no exception.</li>
<li>Leaving no excuse for wearing amulets that contain other than Qur&#8217;anic formulas.</li>
<li>Amulets that are worn are usually subject to disrespect by taking them into washrooms, or wearing them during intercourse or the like.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">As for writing a Surah or a Verse on a slate or on a sheet, and washing the writing with water and saffron, to drink that water for the hope of gaining blessings, knowledge, wealth, good health, or the like, we have never heard that such was done by the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) for himself or for someone else.</span> He neither permitted any of his Companions to do so, nor did he give the permission to his Ummah to do so, even though the needs for doing so are existent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Based on the above, it is better to avoid doing so, and be content with what is authentically approved of incantations of Qur&#8217;anic recitation, the beautiful Names of Allaah, the authentic supplications, or the like, whose meaning are clear and they are free from the blemishes of Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should seek nearness to Allaah by doing only the permissible things for the hope of gaining reward, relief, and gaining beneficial knowledge. This should be sufficient, and he who is content with what Allaah has legitimized, Allaah renders him free from the need of someone else. It is only Allaah Who grants success.</p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;"><em>[1] The term incantations is used throughout the book to refer to a recitation formula for healing, whereas amulet is the written formula for the same purpose.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;"><em>[2] Muslim no. 2200</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;"><em>[3] Ibn Majah no. 3531 and Ahmad 4:445</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;"><em>[4] Ahmad 4:154, Abu Ya&#8217;la no. 1759 and Al-Hakim 4:417</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;"><em>[5] Tiwalah, a spell which is used to make a man love his wife, or the other way round.</em></span></p>
