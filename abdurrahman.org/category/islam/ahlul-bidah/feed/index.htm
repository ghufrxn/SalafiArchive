<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 79 : Point 135-136</strong><br />
<strong> Shaykh Ahmad Najmee | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong>135</strong>]<span style="color:#993300;"><strong> If you hear a man attacking the narrations (<em>athaar</em>) or rejecting the narrations or desiring some thing other than the narrations then have doubt about his Islam. And do not doubt that he is the person of Desires and Innovator.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong>136</strong>] <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that Ruler&#8217;s oppression does not reduce or remove anything that Allaah has made obligatory upon the tongue of his prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). His oppression will be upon himself and your acts of obedience along with him will be complete if Allaah,the Most High,wills. Meaning, the congregational prayer and the <em>jumu&#8217;ah</em> prayer along with them and fighting <em>jihaad</em> along with them. And all acts of obedience accompany them in that , for you will have your intention.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 84 : Point 150C</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Yūnus ibn &#8216;Ubayd saw his son come away from the company of a person of the innovated sects, so he said &#8220;<em>O my son! where have you just come from?&#8221;</em> He replied &#8220;<em>from being with Amr ibn Ubayd</em>&#8220;. He said &#8220;<em>O my son! that I should see you coming out from the house of a Khunsaa (hermaphrodite, bisexual) would be more beloved to me than that I should see you coming out from the house of so-and-so.That you should meet Allaah, O my son, as a fornicator , a major sinner, a thief and a treacherous person would be more beloved to me than that you meet Him with the saying of the people of the deviant sects.&#8221;</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Do you not see that the Yūnus ibn &#8216;Ubayd knew that the hermaphrodite would not misguide his son away from his religion whereas the innovator may lead him astray until he becomes a disbeliever.</strong></span></p>

<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>

From these seventy-two innovated sects branch off, each one of these have offshoots until they amount to two thousand eight hundred. All of them are misguidance.

<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] That is, whatever the book comprises of, from the sayings of Allah, the words of His Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) and that which the Companions were united upon.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 58: Point 101 (Part A)</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Some of the scholars, amongst them Ahmad ibn Hanbal, declared the Jahmee to be a disbeliever and not from the people of the Qiblah. His blood is lawful. He does not inherit, neither is inheritance received from him, since he says that <em>there is no Jumu’ah or congregational prayer, no ‘Eid prayer, no charity (Sadaqah)</em> and because they say, “<em>One who does not say the Qur’an is created is a disbeliever</em>.” They allow fighting and killing within the nation of Muhammad (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>). They contradict those who preceded them. They put the people to trial regarding something that neither the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) nor any of his Companions spoke about.</strong></span><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>They desire to empty the Mosques and for the congregations to be neglected. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>They weakened Islam, caused Jihaad to be left and busied themselves with sectarianism. They went against the narrations and spoke up with that which had been abrogated </strong></span>[1]<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>. They used verses of uncertain meaning as clear proof and so caused the people to have doubts about their religion. They disputed about their Lord and said, “<em>There is no punishment in the grave, nor any Pond (Hawd), nor any Intercession and Paradise and the Fire have not been created</em>.” They rejected much of what the Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said. Those who permit the declaration of their being unbelievers declare them to be so and declare the spilling of their blood to be lawful because of these matters, since whoever rejects a verse from the Book of Allah has rejected the whole Book and whoever rejects a hadeeth from the Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) has rejected all of his sayings and is a disbeliever in Allah, the Sublime.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] The Mu’tazilah and the Raafidah denied abrogation (<em>naskh</em>). Before them, the Jews had denied it.</p>

<h3><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Transcript of the Audio:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Point Number 101</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And some of the scholars; amongst them Imaam A<u>h</u>mad ibn <u>H</u>anbal said: ‘The <em>Jahmee</em> is a disbeliever, he is not from the people of the <em>Qiblah</em>, his blood can be lawfully shed, he does not inherit nor is inheritance received from him. Since he says, “There is no <em>Jum`ah</em> prayer, no congregational prayer, no <em>`Eid</em> prayers and no charity.” And they said, “Whoever does not say that the Qur·aan is something created then he is a disbeliever.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“The saying of the scholars: “The <em>Jahmee</em> is a disbeliever, he is not from the people of the Qiblah,”</strong> meaning <em>Kaafir</em>; he is a disbeliever on account of his blind sayings because he has negated Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. And there is no doubt that this is the worst of disbelief. Their sayings of disbelief lead to <em>Ta`<u>t</u>eel</em> (total negation), as was said by the Shaykh (the author) and it is denial of the existence of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. And Imaam A<u>h</u>mad <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> has refuted them in his book <em>ar-Radd `alal-Jahmiyyah,</em> and this is printed and verified &#8211; and all praise is for Allaah. And a number of the people have refuted them. Shaykh ul-Islaam refuted them in his huge book <em>Bayaan Talbees al-Jahmiyyah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“He (the Jahmee), his blood is lawful to be shed, he does not inherit not is inheritance taken from him.”</strong> Because he is a <em>Murtad</em> (apostate), so therefore his blood is lawful to be shed because that which renders a person’s blood secure is Islaam whereas the <em>Kaafir</em>; his blood is lawful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Because he says (the Jahmee; the follower of Al-Jahm ibn <u>S</u>afwaan) that, “There is no <em>Jum`ah</em> prayer and there is no <em>Jamaa`ah</em> (congregational) prayer,” </strong>because Al-Jahm denied the <em>Jum`ah</em> prayer and he denied the congregational prayer. All that is sufficient in his view is <em>al-ma`rifatu billaah</em> (a person has awareness of Allaah). So <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) with him is just <em>al-ma`rifah</em> (awareness). So if a person is aware of his Lord in his heart then he becomes a believer; <em>mu·min</em> who is perfect in his <em>eemaan</em> even if he doesn’t pray, even if he doesn’t fast, even if he doesn’t do anything from the acts of worship at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And he said that, “There are no <em>`Eid</em> prayers and no <em><u>S</u>adaqah</em> (charity). </strong>Because he held that deeds are not a part of <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) nor its utterance upon the tongue nor is belief either. Rather, <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in his view is near <em>ma`rifah</em> (awareness).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And they said, “Whoever does not say that the Qur·aan is something created then he is a disbeliever.” </strong>The <em>Jahmiyyah</em> said, “Whoever doesn’t say that the Qur·aan is created and rather says that the Qur·aan is the speech of Allaah then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) because he has caused Allaah to resemble His creation and <em>Tashbeeh</em> (declaring resemblance to the creation) is <em>kuffar</em> (disbelief).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Point Number 101 Continued</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And they permitted use of the sword against the nation of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>! And they contradicted those who came before them, they put the people to trial with something which neither Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> nor anyone from his companions spoke with. They sought for the emptying and abandonment of the mosques and the congregations. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And they held as lawful the use of the sword against the nation of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>!” </strong>They permitted killing the Muslims; those who disagreed with them in `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief). And therefore when they gained authority in the time of Al-Ma·moon, what did they do to the Muslims? They killed those of the scholars whom they killed and they tortured those who they tortured in order to try and force them to hold the saying that was the position of the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And they contradicted whoever came before them,”</strong> from the Muslims. So these sayings did not appear except from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“they put the people to trial with something which Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> did not speak with.” </strong>They wanted to force the people to accept their saying as occurred in the time of Al-Ma·moon and those who came after him when they tried to force the people to accept the saying that the Qur·aan is created.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And they wanted to empty out the mosques and the congregations. </strong>Because their position with regard to <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) is that it is merely awareness, even if the person does not do any action, even if he does not speak with his tongue, even if he does not hold belief in his heart. So therefore, there would be no need for the mosques and the congregations because the prayer is not obligatory in their view.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Point Number 101 Continued</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And they weakened Islaam, caused <em>Jihaad</em> to be left and busied themselves with causing separation, they contradicted the narrations and they spoke with that which had been abrogated, they utilised unclear text as proof and they caused the people to have doubts about their religion. And they disputed regarding their Lord and they said: “There is no punishment in the graves nor any great reservoir; <em>al-<u>H</u>aw<u>d</u></em> nor any intercession; <em>shafaa`ah;</em> and that Paradise and the Fire have not yet been created.” And they denied much of that which Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said. So therefore, those who permitted that they be declared disbelievers declared that their blood may be lawfully shed from this aspect. Since whoever rejects a single <em>aayah</em> from the Book of Allaah then he has rejected the whole of the Book and whoever rejects a single <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> then he has rejected all of the narrations. And he is a disbeliever in Allaah, the Sublime.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And they caused weakness in Islaam,” </strong>meaning, the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> weakened Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and they caused <em>Jihaad</em> to be left,” </strong>they left off Jihaad in the cause of Allaah because they do not hold that disbelievers are to be declared disbelievers because they have awareness of Allaah. And this means that Fir`awn was a Muslim then because he had awareness of Allaah in his heart. He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And in the context of what Musa <em>`alayhissalaam</em> said to Fir`awn when he went to call him to the truth that he said to him: “You indeed know that no-one has sent these signs except the Lord of the heavens and the earth&#8230;” </strong>(Sooratul-Israa· (17), <em>aayah </em>102)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he had awareness of Allaah in his heart. And the people of <em>shirk</em>; the <em>mushrikoon</em> in the time of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>; they had awareness of Allaah in their hearts. Indeed they used to worship Him with different types of acts of worship so they believed that Allaah &#8211; the Perfect &#8211; is the Lord and that He deserves worship. However, they associated others in worship along with Him claiming that those others besides Him will draw them closer to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and they contradicted the narrations,” </strong>meaning they contradicted the evidences and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and they spoke with the abrogated texts,” </strong>they took a hold of evidences that had been abrogated and they do not act upon the text which abrogates in order to misguide just as Allaah, the Majestic and Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>…So as for those in whose hearts there is deviation then they follow that which is unclear from it… </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the <em>Mutashaabih</em>, from that which is unclear on its own is the <em>Mansookh</em>, those texts that have been abrogated because it is necessary for the person to have awareness of the <em>Naasikh</em> and the <em>Mansookh</em> (the text which abrogates and the earlier text which was abrogated). And also <em>al-mu<u>t</u>laq w`al muqayyad</em> (to have awareness of the unrestricted text and the restricted texts) and the <em>khaa<u>s</u></em> and the `<em>aam</em> (the text which has been specified and the general text). He must have awareness of the branches of knowledge for the derivation of evidences. So, he does not use as evidence just any text, which he finds without seeing whether it is something abrogated or whether it is something which has been made specific by something or whether it is something which has been restricted by something; not examining this on account of deviation and in order to misguide the people. And they say that: “We use the Qur·aan as proof.” But they are not actually using the Qur·aan as proof. The Qur·aan is used as proof by those who accept all of it. But as for one who takes just a part of it and leaves the other parts then he is a disbeliever in it. He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>…Do you believe in a part of the Book and disbelieve in other parts?&#8230; </strong>(Sooratul Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>85)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a person who does not gather between the <em>Muhkam</em> and <em>Mutashaabih</em> (clear and clarifying texts along with the texts, which are unclear) combine the two then this one is taking a part of the Book and leaving a part. And therefore, He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>…Whereas those firmly grounded in knowledge they say: “We believe in it, all of it.” … </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They say: “<em>Kullun</em>” (All of it); meaning the <em>Muhkam</em> (those texts which are clear and clarified) and the <em>Mutashaabih</em> (that which is not immediately clear with regard to its meaning).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>…They say: “All of it is from our Lord”… </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, therefore, they refer the <em>Mutashaabih</em> (those texts, which are unclear) to the <em>Muhkam</em> (to that text, which is clear and clarifies it) so therefore, it explains it and clarifies it. However, this requires a scholar; `<em>aalim</em>. It is not permissible for a pretender to knowledge to enter into it or a person who is a deviant intending to misguide. So, the <em>Mutashaabih</em> (the text, which is unclear) will not be taken hold of except by 1 of 2 kinds of men; either one who is <em>zaa·igh</em> (deviant) and intends to misguide like the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>. And therefore, Imaam A<u>h</u>mad said about them: “They use as evidence that which is unclear from the Qur·aan.”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the second type of person who uses the <em>Mutashaabih</em> (those aayahs, which are not on their own clear with regard to their meaning) or otherwise a <em>Muta`aalim</em> (a false pretender to knowledge who doesn’t realise and speaks about Allaah without knowledge.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and they used unclear texts as proof,” </strong>and therefore, Imaam A<u>h</u>mad refuted them in his book <em>ar-Radd `alal-Jahmiyyah</em>. He brought the texts which they use as evidence, and he refuted their opinion about them, and he made clear the correct understanding of those texts and he harmonised between the <em>aayahs</em> and <em>a<u>h</u>aadeeth</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“so they caused the people to have doubts about their religion.”</strong> So there is no doubt that this is confusion in thoughts and ideas. So, it is not permissible to speak about matters of knowledge and especially matters of <em>`aqaa·id</em> (creed and beliefs) except one who firmly grounded in knowledge. It’s not permissible for them to be spoken about by half students or by false claimants to knowledge not to mention by people of deviation and misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And they disputed concerning their Lord,” </strong>they innovated <em>al-jadal</em> (newly brought about argumentation, religious debating). He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>No-one disputes about the signs (<em>aayaat</em>) of Allaah except for those who disbelieve. So do not let their travelling about upon the land deceive you. </strong>(Soorah Ghaafir (40), <em>aayah </em>4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The believer does not dispute about the <em>aayaat</em> of Allaah. Rather, he accepts them and he believes, he holds as his belief that they are the speech of Allaah and that they are good and guidance. But as for the person who just withholds about them and raises doubts then this is one who disputes about the speech of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and they said there is no punishment of the grave,” </strong>This fully confirms with their <em>madhhab</em> because in their view whoever has awareness of Allaah then he is a believer of it and it is not necessary that he has to pray and fast and perform <em>Hajj</em> and perform `<em>Umrah</em> nor carry out the deeds. And based upon this there will be no punishment in the grave because all of mankind have awareness of Allaah and therefore, there is no sin and obedience so those who are in the graves all have awareness of Allaah. So therefore, they will not be punished.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and they said there is no <em><u>H</u>aw<u>d</u></em> (Great Reservoir) nor any <em>shafaa`ah</em> (intercession),” </strong>All of the affairs of the hidden and the unseen; <em>ghaib</em>, they denied them because they place reliance upon their intellects alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and they said the Paradise and the Fire have not yet been created.” </strong>Meaning the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> said the Paradise and the Fire have not yet been created despite the fact that Allaah has informed that they are already created. He, the Most High said with regard to Paradise:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Paradise has already been prepared for the <em>Muttaqeen</em> (People of <em>Taqwa</em>; those who are dutiful to Allaah). </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>133)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Aw-Iddat</em> (already prepared); it shows that it’s already been prepared and is present and He said with regard to the Fire:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>It has already been prepared for the disbelievers. </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>131)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also, the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed that the severe heat in the summer is from the breathing out of the Hellfire and this indicates that it is present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, the fire has 2 breaths; a breathing in, in the winter and that is the severest cold that you find and it has a breath (breathing out) in the summer time and that is the severest heat that you find. The saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“The severest summer heat is from the breathing out of the Hellfire.”</em></strong><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><strong>[3]</strong></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And they denied much of that which was said by Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.” </strong>They denied much of that which occurs in the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em> because it contradicts their opinion and what they believe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“So those who held it lawful to declare them as disbelievers declared their blood lawful to shed from this aspect.” </strong>Those of the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em> who declared them to be disbelievers; that he declared them to be disbelievers on account of all of these filthy sayings gathered because they result in there not being any religion left.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Because whoever rejects a single <em>aayah</em> from the Book of Allaah then he has rejected the whole of the Book,” </strong>As has preceded that whoever takes as proof part of the Qur·aan; believes in other parts so regarding some he tends to cling onto it then he has believed only in a part of the Book and he has left the other part. So a person who uses as proof that which is unclear (the <em>Mutashaabih</em>) and leaves aside the <em>Muhkam</em> (that which is clear and clarified) then he is from those who believe in a part of the Book and reject other parts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and whoever rejects a <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> then he has rejected all of the narrations.” </strong>Likewise, the <em>Sunnah</em> contains that which is <em>Muhkam</em> (clear and clarified) and it contains that which is <em>Mutashaabih</em> (that which on its own is unclear). So whoever takes that which is unclear from the <em>Sunnah</em> and leaves off the <em>Muhkam</em> (that which is clear and clarified) then he has rejected all of the <em>Sunnah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And he is a disbeliever in Allaah, the Sublime.” </strong>This is the result and Allaah’s refuge is sought because the one who truly believes in Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The true believer says, “We have <em>eemaan</em> in all of it, we believe in it. All of it is from our Lord.” </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the person of deviation then he takes that which is <em>Mutashaabih</em> (unclear) because it is more fitting for his purpose. And as for the <em>Muhkam</em> (that which is clear, clarifies) then it does not suit his purpose so he leaves it. This is the way of people of the desires, the way of the deviated sects always and it is not specific to the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>. However, its origin was from the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>. However, the people of the deviated sects, all of them in every time, this is their way. They take hold of those proofs, only the ones that will conform to their desires and they leave whatever conflicts with their desires. <a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> <em>Ar-Rad`alaa azzanaadiqah w`al-Jahmiyyah</em> (Imaam A<u>h</u>mad’s refutation of the <em>Zindeeqs</em> and the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Shaykh <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee<em><u> h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said, `His saying, <strong>“they spoke with that which has been abrogated,”</strong> what he intended was that they deny abrogation; the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> deny <em>naskh</em> (deny that there is abrogation). So, the <em>Jahmiyyah </em>and the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> and the <em>Raafidah</em> and before them the Jews denied there being any abrogation and they said; “Abrogation does not occur, neither in the Qur·aan nor in the <em>Sunnah</em> and the <em>Salaf</em> have refuted them.`</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (reference should be <u>h</u>adeeth no. 533/534) from Aboo Hurayrah and Ibn `Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhum</em> and also reported by Muslim (615) from Aboo Hurayrah and likewise by Muslim (2209) from Ibn `Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> A point that’s brought by some of the explainers, they mention Ibn al-Qayyim with regard to the declaration of the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>; the disbelievers, Imaam ibn al-Qayyim said in his famous poem; An-Nooniyyah that the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> were declared to be disbelievers by 500 scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong><em><u> h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said on this point with regard to the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> is a disbeliever; “this saying where the author mentioned at great length then in summary it is that he passed the judgement that the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> are disbelievers and there is no doubt of the disbelief of the first <em>Jahmiyyah</em>; those who founded it, the initial <em>Jahmiyyah</em> but as for the second (later <em>Jahmiyyah</em>) who had developed into the saying of the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> then those people no-one from the <em>Salaf</em> declared them to be disbelievers. So the speech of the author is not to be taken unrestrictedly. And then he intended here that the affair itself is disbelief. So as for one who is upon it; a particular individual then he is to be examined. Have the conditions meaning declaring him to be <em>kaafir</em> been fulfilled and have any preventing factors been removed or not? So if the conditions for him to be declared a disbeliever are present and any preventing factor is absent then the judgement will be passed upon anyone who denies anything that the author has already mentioned here or who rejects anything from the texts, he will be judged to be a disbeliever if the proof is established upon him; conditions for declaring him so are present and preventing factors are absent.” And then he mentioned the issue with regard to the individual as well-that detail is necessary, Allaahu A`lam.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 56: Point 98 (Start of Volume 2)</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that the scholars did not cease refuting the saying of the Jahmiyyah until in the <em>Khilaafah</em> of <em>Banul `Abbaas</em>, the lowly and despicable folk  (<em>Ruwaybi<u>d</u>ah)</em> spoke concerning public affairs. And they spoke against the narrations from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And they adopted analogy and opinion and they declared those who disagreed with them to be disbelievers.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/jahmiyyah-and-ruwaybidah-the-lowly-despicable-folk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And you should know that the People of Knowledge did not cease refuting the saying of the Jahmiyyah,” </strong></span>the Jahmiyyah; a definition of them has preceded already that they are the followers of Al-Jahm ibn <u>S</u>afwaan who propagated the foul saying that the Qur&#8217;aan is a created thing and who openly proclaimed negation of the names of Allaah and His attributes and he had the saying of <em>Al-Irjaa`</em> (taking actions out of <em>eemaan</em>) and he had a foul <em>ma<u>dh</u>hab</em> (path).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So his followers are called the Jahmiyyah as an ascription to al-Jahm. And from the worst, most ugly of their sayings is the saying that the Qur&#8217;aan is a created thing and denying the names and attributes of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, and distorting the speech of Allaah and the speech of His Messenger with falsehood; explaining it and distorting it with falsehood. So they (Jahmiyyah) are the most dangerous of the sects and the most ugly of the sects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore, the People of the <em>Sunnah</em> and the People of Knowledge did not leave them alone, rather, they rebutted their doubts and refuted their sayings and demolished them. And this is present in the books of the People of Knowledge. From them is the refutation of Imaam A<u>h</u>mad ibn <u>H</u>anbal <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> upon the Jahmiyyah and this is present and is printed. And from them is the refutation of `Uthmaan ibn Sa`eed ad-Daarimee upon Bishr al-Mareesee al-`Aneed and it is printed also. And from them is <em>Bayaanu Talbeesil-Jahmiyyah</em> of Shaykh ul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah and from them is<em> Ijtimaa`ul Juyoosh Islaamiyyah `alaa Ghazwal Mu`attillah w’al Jahmiyyah</em> of Ibnul Qayyim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“until in the <em>Khilaafaa </em>(caliphate) of <em>Banul `Abbaas </em>(`Abbaasids),” </strong></span>in the <em>Khilaafah</em> of Al-Ma`moon who was from the <em>Banul `Abbaas</em>, evil occurred. And those who are not suitable to speak, spoke. They spoke with regard to knowledge and with regard to the fundamentals; those who are not suitable to speak. And if a person speaks about something other than his own speciality, then the affairs will be corrupted. So it is essential that no-one speaks about the affairs of the religion and of knowledge except the people who are specialised in it and the People of Knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the affairs will not be rectified by chaos; by everyone speaking and claiming to have knowledge as is present now from those <em>muta`aalimeen</em> (pretenders to knowledge); those who ruminate (think deeply) upon questions of <em>`aqeedah</em> and speak about <em>eemaan</em> and what is the reality of <em>eemaan</em>. And they speak about things which they have no right to speak about at all. They have no knowledge and they do not learn with the scholars. Rather, they just learned by themselves and they rely upon their own understandings and they start laying down principles from themselves and from their own understandings. So, the affair is very dangerous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“so then in the <em>Khilaafah</em> of <em>Banul `Abbaas</em>, the <em>Ruwaybi<u>d</u>ah</em> (the lowly, despicable folk) started speaking about <em>amaril `aammah</em> (affairs of the masses and the people).”</strong></span> This occurs in a narration; meaning this will be from the signs of the Last Hour that public affairs are spoken about by those who are not known for `<em>ilm</em> (knowledge).<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> This is the <em>Ruwaybi<u>d</u>ah</em> (the lowly, despicable folk) and their speaking is one of the signs of the Hour. So it is not right that such a person should speak about the public affairs and about the general matters, which affect everybody. No-one should speak about that except for the People of Knowledge; those who are firmly grounded in knowledge. And this should not be entered into by everyone just as He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَإِذَا جَاءَهُمْ أَمْرٌ مِّنَ الْأَمْنِ أَوِ الْخَوْفِ أَذَاعُوا بِهِ ۖ وَلَوْ رَدُّوهُ إِلَى الرَّسُولِ وَإِلَىٰ أُولِي الْأَمْرِ مِنْهُمْ لَعَلِمَهُ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَنبِطُونَهُ مِنْهُمْ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And if some matters relating to public safety or fear come to them, they broadcast it, and if only they had referred it back to the Messenger and to those in charge with authority amongst them, then the reality of the matter would be known to those who are able to verify and deduce.</span> </strong>(Sooratun-Nisaa·(4), <em>aayah</em> 83)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So public affairs affecting the nation (<em>ummah)</em> are not to be spoken about except by the people who are specifically qualified to do so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And they spoke against the narrations of Allaah’s Messenger<em><u> s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.”</span> </strong>They interfered even in the <em>A<u>h</u>aadeeth</em>, they make attacks upon them and they write works and declare things authentic and declare things weak. And they are not known for knowledge and they did not learn knowledge and they are not from the narrators of <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> nor from the Imaams of <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em>. So they are therefore, <em>Ruwaybi<u>d</u>ah</em>; these lowly despicable folk. They stand up and they start speaking about the most dangerous thing, which is the science of <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> and the knowledge of narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And they adopted analogy and opinion and they declared anyone who disagreed with them to be disbelievers.” </strong></span>What is meant by <em>qiyaa<u>s</u></em> (analogy) here is <em>al-qiyaas ul-baa<u>t</u>il</em> (false analogy). As for <em>al-qiyaas u<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (correct analogy) then that is from the underlying fundamental evidences with the People of Knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, false analogy such as drawing analogy between the Creator and the creation or making analogy between a matter and another matter, which has no connection to it and does not have a common underlying factor. The like of that is false analogy. Because <em>al-qiyaas</em> (analogy) is joining a matter (<em>far·`a)</em> which we do not find a text for, joining it to a matter which there is a text for (<em>asl)</em> and so applying a ruling to it on account of there being an underlying factor (`<em>illah)</em>, common to both of them. So if there is no <em>`illah</em> (common underlying factor) common to both things then it will be a false and futile analogy.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Point Number 98 continued]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>So the ignorant, the inattentive and the ones having no knowledge entered into their saying. So therefore they entered into disbelief without knowing. And the <em>ummah</em> was ruined in a number of ways, committed disbelief in a number of ways, committed heresy in a number of ways and went astray in a number of ways and it split and innovated in a number of ways. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Except for those who remained firm upon the sayings of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and upon what he was upon and what his companions were upon who did not go beyond what they had been upon and did not overstep their affair. Whatever sufficed them sufficed him and he did not wish to turn away from their way and their position. He knew that they were upon the correct Islaam and the correct true faith (<em>eemaan)</em>. So he followed them in his religion and found peace. And he knew that the religion lies in following; <em>taqleed</em> and that those who are meant to be followed are the companions of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So the ignorant people, the inattentive ones and the one having no knowledge entered into their saying.” </strong></span>Meaning, the door was opened for everyone. They began speaking about the affairs of knowledge right until now as you know on account of these satellite channels and this speech and this chaos with regard to knowledge has reached the extent that the common masses of people speak about the matters of knowledge and they raise doubts about the matters of knowledge. They raise doubts about the Islamic rulings. They raise doubts about the verdicts of the Imaams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as has preceded, they declare those who disagree with them to be disbelievers to the extent that they declare the earlier Imaams to be disbelievers and to being ignorant people and to the extent that some of them say, “I am a person and A<u>h</u>mad ibn <u>H</u>anbal was a person. We are men and they were men. Maalik was a man and I am a man!” This is the level that the situation has reached with them that there is no special distinction for the saying of the Imaams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“To the extent that they committed disbelief in a way which they did not know.”</span> </strong>They committed disbelief in a way that they did not know. So a person may say a saying of <em>kufr</em> (disbelief) and he does not know that it is a saying of disbelief on account of his being ignorant. So he says that which is disbelief and he promotes disbelief and he doesn’t even know that it is disbelief (<em>kufr)</em> on account of his having entered into something which he is not proficient in. So the danger is very great for him and for the nation (<em>ummah)</em>. If the danger were just restricted to him; the one who is speaking, it would be easier but the problem is that this spreads throughout the <em>ummah (</em>nation).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So the <em>ummah</em> (nation) became ruined through a number of different ways and committed disbelief in a number of different ways,” </strong></span>meaning, they confused and deceived the <em>ummah</em> (nation) and they entered weaknesses into it until there came to be from them those people who adopt sayings of disbelief and they say, “<em>these are sayings of scholars</em>” just as they say about the saying of Al-Jahm and the Mu`tazilah to the extent that they write in the newspapers, then they say about the true scholars (`<em>ulemaa)</em>, “<em>you people, you restrict the truth to just yourselves and you throw away the sayings of the Imaams such as Ibn Seenaa and Ibn `Arabee and Al-Jahm Ibn <u>S</u>afwaan. And those people are scholars who have their value</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and they committed heresy in different ways and went astray in different ways and they split and they innovated in different ways.” </strong></span>All of these calamities were on account of the ignorant people entering into the matters of knowledge and on account of having little fear of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. So when they had very little fear of Allaah, they entered into these matters. And therefore one of the <em>Salaf</em> said: &#8220;<em>Their wara`(piety) was very slight so that is why they spoke</em>.” As for a person who fears Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, then he doesn’t enter into anything if he is not proficient in it and not from its people, in particular the affairs of the religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Except for those who remained firm upon the sayings of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and upon what he was upon and upon what his companions were upon and do not step beyond any of them.” </strong></span>They were not secure from these calamities, from disbelief and deviation and misguidance and diverting from the correct way and from mutual enmity and from cutting off ties with each other. No-one was safe from these calamities <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>except</strong> </span>those who adhered to that which Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his companions were upon just as he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“And my nation will split into 73 sects, all of them will be in the Fire except for one. They said, “Who is it, O Messenger of Allaah?” He said, “Those who are upon that which I and my companions are upon.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And who found sufficiency in whatever sufficed them,” </strong></span>and it is the Book and the Sunnah and that which the <em>Salaf-us-<u>S</u>aali<u>h </u></em><u>(</u>the righteous predecessors) were upon, from the companions and the <em>taabi`een </em>and the most excellent generations and the Imaams. However, the problem lies in those people who say, “<em>They were men and we are men. And their speech has no distinction over our speech</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And he knows that they were upon the correct Islaam and upon the correct <em>eemaan</em> (true faith).” </strong></span>Just as He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَالسَّابِقُونَ الْأَوَّلُونَ مِنَ الْمُهَاجِرِينَ وَالْأَنصَارِ وَالَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوهُم بِإِحْسَانٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And the first and foremost ones from the <em>Muhaajireen</em> and the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em> and those who followed them upon goodness.</span> </strong>(Sooratut-Towbah (9), <em>aayah </em>100)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He `<em>alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu</em> <em>wassalaam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Adhere to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly guided orthodox Khulafaa after me.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever wants salvation then this is the path to it. And the one who does not want salvation will have whatever he chooses for himself but the harm is not restricted to him; rather, he will also carry the sins of the people along with his own sin. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>لِيَحْمِلُوا أَوْزَارَهُمْ كَامِلَةً يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ ۙ وَمِنْ أَوْزَارِ الَّذِينَ يُضِلُّونَهُم بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ ۗ أَلَا سَاءَ مَا يَزِرُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So they will carry their burdens of sin completely on the Day of Resurrection and they will carry from the sins of those whom they misled also without knowledge. Indeed what an evil burden they will bear! </strong></span>(Sooratun-Na<u>h</u>l (16), <em>aayah </em>25)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that the companions and the most excellent generations are the ones who were upon correct Islaam and the correct religion. So how can you abandon them and go instead for those for whom there is no guarantee that he is upon the correct religion and that he is upon the truth?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“So this person followed them in his religion and was at peace.”</span> </strong><em>Qalladahum</em>; meaning he followed them, <em>ittaba-’ahum</em>.</p>
<p><strong> وَالَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوهُم بِإِحْسَانٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>… and those who followed them upon good. </strong></span>(Sooratut-Towbah (9), <em>aayah </em>100)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is meant by <em>taqleed</em> here is <em>ittibaa</em>`; following.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And this person knows that the religion is just in following and that the ones to be followed are the companions of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.” </strong></span>As we have mentioned, what is meant by <em>taqleed</em> here is correct <em>taqleed</em>; following, which is <em>ittibaa`</em> just as Yusuf `<em>alayhissalaam</em> said:</p>
<p><strong> إِنِّي تَرَكْتُ مِلَّةَ قَوْمٍ لَّا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَهُم بِالْآخِرَةِ هُمْ كَافِرُون</strong></p>
<p><strong>وَاتَّبَعْتُ مِلَّةَ آبَائِي إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">I have left the religion of a people who do not truly believe in and worship Allaah alone and who deny the Hereafter. And I have followed the religious way of my forefathers; Ibraaheem and Is<u>h</u>aaq and Ya`qoob.</span> </strong>(Soorah-Yusuf (12), <em>aayah </em>37 and 38)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>ittibaa</em>` (following) of the righteous predecessors (<em>Salaf-us-<u>S</u>aali<u>h)</u></em>, this is the truth and there is no blame at all for following them. Indeed blameworthiness is only for those who follow the people who are not deserving of being followed and who take as an example those who are not befitting to be taken as examples.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad in the <em>Musnad</em> and by al-Bazzaar in his <em>Musnad</em> and by at-Ta<u>h</u>aawiyy in <em>Shar<u>h</u> Mushkil ul-Aathaar</em> from a <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of Anas that he said: Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Before the Last Hour, there will be years of deception in which a liar will be believed and a truthful person will be taken to be a liar and in which a treacherous person will be trusted and in which a trustworthy person will be taken to be treacherous. And in it the <em>Ruwaybi<u>d</u>ah</em> will speak. So it was said, “Who are the <em>Ruwaybi<u>d</u>ah</em>?” So he said, “The little evil one who speaks about the public affairs.”</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafi<u>dh</u> ibn Katheer said in <em>an-Ni<u>h</u>aayah fil-Fitan w`al-Milaa<u>h</u>im</em>; its chain of narration is good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> As for one of the verifiers of the <em>Musnad</em> of Imaam A<u>h</u>mad; Shuayb al-Arna`ut, he said in his checking of the <em>Musnad</em> of A<u>h</u>mad, the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> is <em><u>h</u>asan</em>, this particular chain is weak as it contains Mu<u>h</u>ammad bin Is<u>h</u>aaq who is <em><u>h</u>asan</em> in <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> but he was a <em>mudallis</em> and he reports it here, he just says, “from”, he doesn’t say that he directly heard it from his Shaykh, he said, “from him”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As an addition to what occurs here, this <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> also occurs as a <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>, reported by Ibn Maajah (4,042) and by Al-<u>H</u>aakim and by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad also and declared <em><u>h</u>asan</em> by Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy in <em>A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (1,887) because it has a number of chains which support it. He also authenticates a <em>hadeeth</em> of Aws ibn Maalik <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> with a similar wording, reported by al-Bazzaar and a<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>abaraaniyy and he brings that in <em>A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>aheehah</em> (2,253).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> As for the explanation of <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> then he said, literally the beginning here that, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“the people of knowledge continue rebutting the saying of the Jahmiyyah until it was the <em>Khilaafah</em> of <em>Banul `Abbaas</em>,” </strong></span>he was here narrating the condition that was present and the <em>Khilaafah</em> of <em>Banul Abbaas</em>, the beginning of it was upon good but then the affairs changed after the year 200 when the <em>Khaleefah</em> Al-Ma`moon accepted the call of the Mu`tazilah and became convinced that the Qur&#8217;aan is something created and he called the People of Knowledge to accept this innovation and to accept this saying, which is <em>kufr </em>(disbelief).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, therefore fitnah; tremendous trial occurred, which continued from the year 200 onwards and for 12 years of the <em>Khilaafah</em> of Al-Ma`moon and Al-Mu`ta<u>s</u>im and Al-Waathiq until the <em>Khilaafah</em> was taken on by Al-Mutawakkil `ala-Allaah and then the People of the <em>Sunnah</em> and the <em>Jamaa</em>`<em>ah</em> and the carriers of <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> had some respite then and it was the People of Falsehood who were then curbed of doubt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, after Al-Mutawakkil passed away, after that time then the <em>Khaleefas</em> began to lose their authority and the <em>Khilaafah</em> became just a name without any reality. They became an outer form without a true reality behind it and that was because the Turks gained ascendancy and they took hold of the reality of authority and came to actually control the <em>Khulafaa</em>·. They could bring whoever they wanted and appoint him and they could kill this one as they wished and then after that authority passed away from the Turkish people and passed to <em>Banu Booyaa</em>. [Translator’s side point: <em>Banu Booyaa</em> ruled roughly from the year 325 AH till about the year 450 AH.]. Then to <em>Al-Jaraakisaa</em> (the Circassians) until the <em>Khilaafah</em> was ended in the year 656.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then the saying of `Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> was realised that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“We are a people who used to be the most humiliated people but then Allaah gave us strength and honour through Islaam so whenever we seek to attain honour by other than that which Allaah gave us honour through, then Allaah will humiliate us.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Al-<u>H</u>aakim in his <em>Mustadrak</em> and he declared it authentic from `Umar and likewise Ath-<u>Th</u>ahabee agreed.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad finished by saying, “Except for the fact that the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al-Jamaa`ah</em> and the people of <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> and the people of true `<em>aqeedah</em> have not ceased to be established upon their `<em>aqeedah</em>, not being harmed by whoever opposes them. And therefore, he (meaning the author; al-Barbahaaree <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) therefore made an exception by saying,<span style="color:#993300;"> <strong>“Except for those who remained firm upon the saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his command what he was upon and his prohibition…”</strong></span> to the end of the saying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Checking has preceded and the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> as we had before was reported by at-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee and al-<u>H</u>aakim and others and declared <em><u>h</u>asan</em> by Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> <em><u>H</u>adeeth</em> being part of the famous <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of `Irbaa<u>d</u> ibn Saariyah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>, reported by A<u>h</u>mad and Aboo Daawood and Ibn Maajah and being declared <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> by Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5">[5]</a> Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> makes a point here, he said the point of slight objection to a wording, he said, the author’s saying here, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and you should know that the religion is just <em>taqleed</em>,” </strong></span>the point of objection is to be raised against here for the wording because <em>taqleed</em> means to follow without a proof. So if he had said the <em>deen</em> is <em>ittibaa</em>`; used this word, the religion is to follow the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and the Sunnah of His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> upon the understanding of the <em>Salaf</em> of this <em>ummah</em> from the companions and <em>taabi`een</em> and those who followed them upon good from the bearers of <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> and narrations. This wording would’ve been what is correct because it conforms to what Allaah has commanded with in His Book when He said:</p>
<p><strong>وَأَنَّ هَٰذَا صِرَاطِي مُسْتَقِيمًا فَاتَّبِعُوهُ ۖ وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا السُّبُلَ فَتَفَرَّقَ بِكُمْ عَن سَبِيلِهِ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ وَصَّاكُم بِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And this is My straight way so therefore follow it and do not follow the divergent paths, which will take you away from His path. He has enjoined you with that so that you are a people who are dutiful to Him.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-An`aam (6), <em>aayah</em> 153)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p><strong>اتَّبِعُوا مَا أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكُم مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا مِن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَاءَ ۗ قَلِيلًا مَّا تَذَكَّرُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Follow what is being sent down to you from your Lord and do not follow any others besides Him in disobedience to Allaah. Little it is that you take admonition.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah</em> 3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>ittibaa</em>`; following for the <em>Salaf</em>, those who were before us; upon the narration, upon proof, upon the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, this is the truth and Allaah is the one who grants success.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 54: Point 90D &amp; 90E</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:(90D)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And they called to sectarianism (<em>furqah)</em> and Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, forbade sectarianism. Some of them declared others to be disbelievers. And everyone called to his own opinion and to calling those who disagreed with him disbelievers. So the ignorant people, the rabble and those having no knowledge went astray. They caused the people to become greedy for the things of this life and to fear worldly punishment. So the people followed them upon fear regarding their religion and out of hope for what they possessed from this world</span>.</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And they called to sectarianism and Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, has forbidden sectarianism.”</span> </strong>Allaah has forbidden sectarianism, splitting; <em>al-furqah</em>. So He said:</p>
<p><strong>وَلَا تَكُونُوا كَالَّذِينَ تَفَرَّقُوا وَاخْتَلَفُوا مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَهُمُ الْبَيِّنَاتُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And do not be like those who split up and differed after the clear signs had come to them.</span> </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah</em> 105)</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا تَفَرَّقَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ إِلَّا مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَتْهُمُ الْبَيِّنَةُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And those who were given the scripture did not differ except after the clear truth had come to them.</strong></span>(Sooratul-Bayyinah (98), <em>aayah</em> 4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they differed and split not upon ignorance but rather upon knowledge; `<em>ilm</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying,<span style="color:#993300;"> <strong>“And some of them declared others to be disbelievers,” </strong></span>The <em>firaq</em> (sects) started declaring each other to be disbelievers. And this is a sign which is manifest upon them. And this is a proof that they are all upon falsehood. As for the people of the truth and the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> then they do not declare each other to be disbelievers. Rather, they are friends and allies to each other, they love each other and they support each other and they advise each other. And likewise, they do not declare the other sects to be disbelievers except for what the Book and the Sunnah proves to be disbelief. Otherwise, it is the case that they (the people of sunnah) are justly balanced with regard to the matter of <em>Takfeer</em>. They do not declare anyone a disbeliever except for those whom the proof is established that he is a disbeliever and they are not hasty with regard to this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and each one called to his own opinion and to declaring those who disagreed with him to be disbelievers.” </strong></span>This is a sign of the people of misguidance. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>فَتَقَطَّعُوا أَمْرَهُم بَيْنَهُمْ زُبُرًا ۖ كُلُّ حِزْبٍ بِمَا لَدَيْهِمْ فَرِحُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So they split into parties and sects, each one following a separate book, every group rejoicing in what it was upon.</strong></span>(Sooratul-Mu·minoon (23), <em>aayah </em>53)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Zuburan</em>; meaning books. They authored books and this occurs. They author books to support their own position and their own party and they rejoice in what they are upon. And if they had just been upon ignorance then it could be hoped that they would return. However, they rejoice in what they are upon from falsehood and they believe it to be the truth. And this is a punishment from Allaah for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“So the ignorant people and the <em>ra`aa`</em> (the common rabble) and those who had no knowledge went astray.”</span> </strong>They led the ignorant people astray and the rubble and those who had no knowledge. But as for the people of the truth and the people of knowledge then they are not affected by these sects and these misguidances because they know that it is falsehood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And they caused the people to become greedy for things of this world and they cause them to fear the punishment of this world.” </strong></span>That is from the means which they utilise in their trial that they give their followers some of the things, which they crave after.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So the creation followed them therefore, upon fear with regard to their religion and upon hope with regard to what they had of this world.” </strong></span>Many of the people have love of this world so therefore, they will follow anyone who will give them anything from wealth even if he is upon falsehood as a result of their craving for wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Point Continues </strong></span></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:(90E)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>So the <em>Sunnah</em> and the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> were suppressed and innovations appeared and became widespread. The people committed disbelief in many ways, which they were not aware of. They applied analogy and considered the ability of the Lord, His signs, His rulings, His commands and His prohibitions according to their own intellects and opinions. So whatever accorded with their intellects, they accepted it and whatever ran contrary to their intellects, they rejected it. So Islaam became a stranger and the <em>Sunnah</em> became a stranger and the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> became strangers within their own homes.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So the <em>Sunnah</em> and the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> became suppressed and innovations appeared and became widespread.” </strong></span>After the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> had been apparent in the <em>quroon al-mufa<u>dd</u>alah</em> (most excellent generations) and the people of evil had been subdued, then the affair became turned around and the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> became suppressed and the people of falsehood became apparent. However, this will not persist. Even if the people of falsehood become apparent at one time then they will decline in the future and they will collapse in the future. And the final outcome will always be for the people of <em>Taqwa</em>; those who are dutiful to their Lord. And Imaam Ibn ul-Qayyim <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said:<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And the truth is aided and tested so do not be surprised for this is the way of the Most Merciful.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And they applied analogy,” </strong></span>Analogy (<em>Qiyaas)</em>, meaning in `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) because `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) has no analogy in it because it is <em>tawqeefeeyah</em> (reliant upon direct text). Action with regard to it is not upon except a proof. And no analogy is made in matters of creed and belief. Analogy can only be in <em>fiqh</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and they considered the ability of the Lord and His signs and His rulings and His commands and His prohibitions in accordance with their intellects and their own opinions.” </strong></span>This is al <em>qiyaasul baa<u>t</u>il</em> (the false and futile analogy) making analogy with regard to Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, the One Who cannot be imagined by their minds and their opinions. So they rebut based upon the analogy of their intellects, the speech of Allaah and the speech of His Messenger.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So whatever conformed with their intellects, they accepted it and whatever was contrary to their intellects, they rejected it.” </strong></span>So they make their intellects and their opinions the judge, so whatever conflicts with it, they reject it, either by <em>ta·weel</em> (interpreting it away) or by <em>raf<u>d</u></em> (directly rejecting it) and not accepting it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying,<span style="color:#993300;"> <strong>“So therefore, Islaam became a stranger and the <em>Sunnah</em> became a stranger and the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> became strangers within their own homes.” </strong></span>Just as he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Islaam began as a stranger and it will return to being a stranger just the same as it began. So give glad tidings of a tree in Paradise to the strangers.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>So then they said, “Who are the strangers O Messenger of Allaah?” So he said, “Those who are upon correctness when the people become corrupted.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And in one narration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Those who correct whatever the people corrupt.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They correct themselves are upon correctness and they correct whatever the people have corrupted. They are the <em>ghurabaa</em> (strangers). Why are they called strangers (<em>ghurabaa)</em>? Because those who contradict them are many and those who criticise them are many, so they are strangers amongst the people of their own lands and the people of their own time.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Translator’s side point: Some of the versions have at the end , <strong>“So the people followed them upon fear regarding their worldly life and out of hope for what they possessed from this world.”</strong> <em>W`Allaahu A`lam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Translator’s side point: Quote being from his famous poem <em>Al-Kaffiyaat ash-Shaafiyah</em> along with the explanation of it, they give a reference there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> mentioned in his explanation, “This seems to be referring to the like of the Jahmiyyah and the Mu`tazilah. They brought this matter of analogy and their intellect into the religion and used it to reject the texts; texts with regard to the attributes of Allaah, the Most High and other than them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> <strong>Shaykh Aal Ash Shaykh</strong> continues with the wordings of the <u>h</u>adeeth but this part of the <u>h</u>adeeth is reported by Muslim (145) of a hadeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> without what follows in the main text here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also reported by Muslim (146) from Ibn `Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhuma</em> from the Prophet that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Islaam began as a stranger and it will return to being a stranger just as it began and it will retreat between the two mosques just as a snake returns to its hole.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5">[5]</a> As for the wording, when the companions asked,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Who are the strangers, O Messenger of Allaah? Then he replied, “They are those who are upon correctness when the people become corrupted.”</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This wording is reported by A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>abaraaniyy in <em>Al-Mu`jam al-Kabeer</em> and <em>Al-Mu`jam al-Awsa<u>t</u></em>, <em>Al-Mu`jam as-Sageer</em> from Sahl ibn Sa`d as-Saai`dee. Al-Haythamee said in <em>Majma` az-Zawaa`id</em>, its narrators are those of the <em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> except for Bakr ibn Sulaym and he was reliable as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a side point, Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy declared this narration authentic in <em>As-<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> under <u>h</u>adeeth no. 1273,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The strangers are those who are upon correctness themselves when the people become corrupted.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the last wording that’s mentioned, <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“They are those who correct whatever the people corrupt,”</strong> </span>that is reported by At-Tirmidhiyy and A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>abaraaniyy in <em>al-Kabeer</em> from a narration of `Amr ibn `Awf that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The religion began as a stranger and it will return to being a stranger. So give glad tidings to the strangers, those who rectify what the people have corrupted after me from my Sunnah.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as a<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>irmidhiyy said, “This <u>h</u>adeeth is <em><u>h</u>asan, <u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (good, authentic).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Shaykh al-Albaaniyy in his checking of <u>T</u>irmidhiyy declared this particular report here as <em><u>d</u>a`eef jiddan</em> (very weak, not authentic).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the footnote also, they mention a further wording reported by Ibn Abee Shaybah and Imaam A<u>h</u>mad and ad-Daarimee and Ibn Maajah and others from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Ibn Mas`ood that contains the wording, it was said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Who are the strangers? And that he said, “An-nuzzaa` minal qabaa-il (they are the scattered ones from amongst the tribes).” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They mention here that Imaam al-Bukhaariyy declared that narration to be <u>h</u>asan, as was reported from him by his student, a<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>irmidhiyy. And Al-Baghawee said in <em>Shar<u>h</u>us Sunnah</em>, the <u>h</u>adeeth is <em>sa<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> <em>gareeb</em> with a singular chain. And again this particular report here was declared <em>da`eef</em> by Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy in the checking of <em>Sunan Ibn Maajah</em>, <em>W`Allaahu A`lam</em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 13 : Point 11 (Part A)</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know, may Allaah have mercy upon you, that speculative speech, kalaam, about the Lord, the Most High, is a newly introduced matter and it is an innovation and misguidance. Nothing is to be said about the Lord except what He, the Mighty and Majestic, described Himself with in the Qur·aan and what the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam explained to his Companions. So He, the Majestic in Renown, is One.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him; and He is The All Hearing The All Seeing.</span> </strong></span>(Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Our Lord is the First without any beginning, and the Last without any end. He knows whatever is secret and whatever is most hidden. He has ascended over His Throne, and His Knowledge is in every place. And no place is free of His Knowledge.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/speculative-speech-kalaam-about-allaah-the-most-high-is-an-innovation-misguidance" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Kalaam, speech/rhetorical theology/theological rhetoric, with regard to the Lord, the Most High, is something new and it is an innovation and misguidance.”</strong> Meaning, theological rhetoric, kalaam, with regard to the Self of the Lord, the Perfect and Most High, and with regard to His Names and His Attributes, is a newly introduced affair. It was introduced by the people of misguidance, those who do not submit to the texts and who do not have fear of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. So therefore they speak about the Self of the Lord, and they speak about His Names and His Attributes, and they deny and they negate that which Allaah affirmed for Himself or that which His Messenger affirmed for Him. And they bring opinions from themselves. (And they say) “This is what is correct.” They speak in explanation of the texts with other than their correct explanation, or they say, “We don’t understand them.” They say, “We leave and entrust them to Allaah.” And the Speech of Allaah and the speech of His Messenger becomes just like foreign/non-Arabic speech which the Arabs do not understand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is obligatory upon the Muslims is that they continue upon the correct path, upon the way of the Salaf and that they do not give any attention to those people who mislead others, those who argue about Allaah without any proof which He has given them. They dispute about the Qur·aan and they dispute about the Sunnah. Their affair is just argumentation. So it is obligatory to beware of those people. Those people are not people who are followers (of the Truth); rather they are innovators who are just following their desires. [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And nothing is to be said about the Lord except that which He described Himself with, He the Mighty and Majestic, in the Qur&#8217;aan.”</strong> Having forbidden argumentation about Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and arguments/debates about the Names of Allaah and His Attributes, he now explains what is obligatory. And it is that we affirm the Qur·aan and the Sunnah just as they came upon their meaning, the meaning taken from the Arabic language with which the Qur·aan and the Sunnah came down. So al `ilm, knowledge, its meaning is well known in the language. Likewise al-wajh, the face, is well known. And al-`ayn, eyes, and al-yad, hands, and al-istiwaa·, ascending, and al-`uloow, being high above, all of these and their like, their meaning is well known in the Arabic language in which the Qur·aan came down. Whereas the people of misguidance, they say “This speech is not in accordance with what is apparent from it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then they divide into two categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• A category who say, “We stop and withhold. And we say what is apparent is not what is meant; but then we do not understand what is actually meant by it.” And they are the <strong>Mufowwidah</strong> the people of <strong>tafweed</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• And the second category are the <strong>Mu&#8217;owwillah</strong>, the people of <strong>ta&#8217;weel</strong>, who give false interpretations. And they are more in number; they are the majority out of these two groups. They interpret with other than their correct meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they went astray and they lead others astray and they preoccupy the people. And they fill up books with these debates, with arguments and disputations which lead to nothing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is obligatory is to submit to what occurs in the Book and in the Sunnah with regard to the Names of Allaah and His Attributes as was meant by Allaah and His Messenger, because Allaah knows best about Himself, He the Perfect and Most High, and He knows best about other than Himself. And the most knowledgeable one from the creation about Allaah is the Messenger of Allaah sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. As for us, then our knowledge falls short. There are many things that we do not know related to our own selves with regard to the details of our bodies and the veins and the senses. There are things which we do not know. Do you know the rooh, about the soul? What exactly is it? The intellect, what is it? If you do not know something from your own body, nor something about your own self, then how can you speak about the Self of Allaah the Perfect and Most High, which is not known, except to Him, He, the Perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He (Allaah) knows whatever is in front of them and whatever is behind them and they do not encompass Him with knowledge</strong></span> (Soorah TaaHaa (20), aayah 110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is outside what they know and outside what they can imagine. And no analogy can be made between Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, and His creation. This would be a belittlement of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. So He knows best about His Self and about other than Himself. And He is the One who is truest in saying and better in speech than His creation, as Shaykhul-Islaam rahimahullaah said in al-Waasitiyyah [03].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and what Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam explained to his Companions.”</strong> The issue of the Names and Attributes hinges upon the Book and the Sunnah. And their explanation is also in the Book and the Sunnah, and the language of the Arabs in which the Legislation came down. And we do not go to the logic of Aristotle and Plato, or so and so, or such and such. This is a crime against the Legislation of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, and it is a case of replacing the Revelation with logic and `ilmul-kalaam, theological rhetoric. And what fruit did theological rhetoric and argumentation produce for those people with regard to misguidance and ruin and loss. And they did not reach any result. And this is by their own admission.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They expended their whole lives in debating and disputations, and in the end they acknowledged that they did not reached any result. And if only they had submitted to Allaah and to His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, they would have found relaxation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore one of them said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;"><em>“The result of using the intellects is just that the mind is tied in knots</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#800080;"><em> And most of the striving of the people is just misguidance</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#800080;"><em> And our spirits are forlorn strangers within our bodies</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#800080;"><em> And all the results that come about in this world for us are just harm and an evil climate</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we did not benefit from our studies through our whole lives except that we just gathered they said and such and such said (idle speech).” [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they came to a state of doubt and uncertainty. And as for those who submitted to Allaah and to His Messenger, then they were saved and at peace from this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the people of misguidance say also:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;"><em>“Upon my life, I have gone around all of the institutions of learning</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#800080;"><em> And I have looked upon all those places</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#800080;"><em> And I did not see except one who is putting his palm</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#800080;"><em> upon his chin in confusion or one who is striking his teeth in regret.”</em></span> [05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He went around all the institutes of learning, institutes of theological rhetoric and logic and debating and he examined them and did not find in them that which could remedy the need to know. And he said [06]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I have carefully considered the different paths of theological rhetoric and the ways of the philosophers. And I did not see them remedying the sick [07] nor quenching the thirst of the person with extreme thirst. And I saw that the closest path was the way of the Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Read with regard to affirmation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The good word ascends to Him.</strong></span> (Soorah Faatir (35), aayah 10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The Most Merciful ascended upon the Throne.</span></strong> (Soorah TaaHaa (20), aayah 5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And read with regard to negation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him</span></strong> (Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they do not encompass Him with knowledge</span></strong>. (Soorah Taahaa (20), aayah 110) ”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(End of quote)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“So He, the Majestic in Renown, is One. There is nothing like Him; and He is The All Hearing, The All Seeing.”</strong></span> He is, He the Perfect, One. No one shares with Him with regard to His Self nor with regard to His Names and His Attributes nor with regard to His Creating and His Actions nor with regard to His worship. There is no sharer and no partner for Him. So why therefore tire yourself out? You are a created being and He is the Creator. How can the created being encompass knowledge of the Creator, the Majestic and Most High? So you, your role is just to submit to Allaah and to His Messenger and not to dispute and not to argue and not to tire yourself out and to tire other people out. This is what is obligatory and binding. And therefore the Companions, they did not engage themselves in these unnecessary matters. And they did not withhold with regard to an aayah or with regard to a hadeeth. Rather they affirmed it and submitted to it and held what it contained as their creed and belief, and they never had any problems arise, ever. So the matter is a matter requiring submission and compliance. And that we do not delve into matters of creed and belief in the way which the people of disputation and the people of kalaam, theological rhetoric, and people of logic delved into it. Such that the result was, as they themselves admitted regarding themselves, that they ended up in a state of bewilderment and confusion and not reaching any result, as one of them said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“We didn’t benefit anything from our studies, throughout our whole lives Except in the end we just gathered idle speech.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Meaning), so and so said and so and so said. And if he says such and such then the response is such and such. [08]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee hafizahullaah said regarding this point, “Meaning by that, speech which was introduced by the Jahmiyyah with regard to delving into speaking about Attributes of Allaah without knowledge. But as for describing (giving as an Attribute) that which Allaah described Himself with or which His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam described Him with, then this is something required.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] This occurs in al-`Aqeedah Al-Waasitiyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] These lines of poetry are by al-Fakhrur-Raazee. You can refer back to Dar· Ta`aarud al-Aql wan-Naql and Minhaajus-Sunnah (of Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymeeyah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[05] These lines of poetry are by ash-Shahristaanee, the author of the book al-Milal wan-Nahl. You can refer back to Dar· Ta`aarud al-Aql wan-Naql and Minhaajus-Sunnah (of Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymeeyah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[06] This is a quote from ar-Raazee quoted from him in the book an-Nuboowaat of Shaykhul-Islaam (ibn Taymeeyah)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[07] <strong>Translator’s note:</strong> curing the one who has a need for knowledge</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[08] Shaykh as-Suhaymee hafizahullaah said, “Then he made clear that it is obligatory to describe Allaah with that which He described Himself with, and that which His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam described Him with, without tahreef, distorting the meaning, without ta`teel, denying/depriving it of meaning, without takyeef, saying how, and without tamtheel, likening the Creator to the creation, in accordance with His Saying, He, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There is nothing like Him (Allaah); and He is The All Hearing, The All Seeing</strong> </span>(Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, “There is nothing like Him;” this is negation. And, “and He is The All Hearing, The All Seeing;” this is affirmation. And it contains a proof for detailed affirmation and for general and concise negation. Because His Saying, “There is nothing like Him,” this is a general and concise and negation. It negates everything that can be imagined or can cross the mind. And “and He is The Hearing, The Seeing,” this is affirmation in detail. And this aayah is a tremendous principle with regard to affirming the Attributes along with declaring Allaah, the Exalted and Most High, free of whatever does not befit Him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 13 : Point 10</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Al-kalaam (theological rhetoric), arguing, debating and disputing are newly introduced affairs. They cast doubt into the heart, even if the person happens to attain the Truth and the Sunnah.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F363815261&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/theological-rhetoric-arguing-debating-disputing-are-all-newly-introduced-affairs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These matters, al-kalaam (theological rhetoric), debating and disputing which occurred between all of the sects, these are newly introduced matters. And the reason for them is the following of desires. And whoever is such that his desires follow that which the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam came with, then he will not have doubt.; and he will not be a person of disputing nor arguing nor quarrelling, because he is one who submits and complies. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So if Guidance comes to you from Me, then whoever follows My Guidance, then there will be no fear upon them and they will not grieve.</strong></span> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 38)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So whoever follows My Guidance, then he will not go astray and he will not be wretched.</strong></span> (Soorah Taa Haa (20), aayah 123)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the matter is a question of following, <em><strong>ittibaa</strong></em>`, and complying, <em><strong>inqiyaad</strong></em>, and submitting, <em><strong>tasleem</strong></em>, to the command of Allaah and His Messenger without debating and without argumentation. And the people of misguidance did not fall into argumentation and debates except on account of the fact that they did not submit to Allaah and to His Messenger in the way that the Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah submitted. And therefore you will find the Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah, and all Praise is for Allaah, united with no difference between them in the matter of `aqeedah, creed and belief; rather disagreement is found with the misguided sects. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So if they turn away then they are the ones who will have split away and opposed. So Allaah will suffice you against them. And He is the all Hearing the all Knowing.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 137)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the confirmation of this occurs in another aayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And do not follow the other paths for they will cause you to split away and separate from His path. This He has commanded you with so that you may be dutiful to Him.</span></strong> (Sooratul-An `aam (6), aayah 153)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“(Theological rhetoric, arguing, debating, disputing are all newly introduced affairs. They cast doubt into the heart)</strong> <strong>even if the person involved in them happens to attain the Truth and the Sunnah</strong>.” Meaning, he will still be in error, because he has attained these two (the Truth and Sunnah) through other than the correct path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because the correct path is submission and not delving and debating and arguing which just causes the hearts to become bitter and produces grudges. And it also brings about something worse than that which is at-takfeer, people declaring others to be disbelievers, because the misguided sects they declare each other to be disbelievers and they declare each other to be misguided.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Every sect rejoicing at what they themselves are upon.</strong> </span>(Sooratur-Room (30), aayah 32)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everyone thinking that what he is upon is what is correct. As for the Ahlus-Sunnah walJamaa`ah, the people of Sunnah and the United Body upon the Truth, who submitted to the command and complied, then disagreements did not occur between them, and all Praise is for Allaah. And they do not declare each other to be disbelievers, and they do not declare each other to be misguided; rather they praise each other. And some of them follow others, because they are upon a correct path. Indeed hatred and grudges and declarations of others being disbelievers and being misguided only comes about on account of contradicting the Truth and taking hold of opinions and ideas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is no doubt that everyone wants to defend his own opinion. So he will not accept that it will be said to him, “You are wrong,” for this will mean that you are accusing his intellect of being deficient and he will not be pleased with this. However, if you say to a person of Truth when he has made a mistake, “You have erred with regard to the evidence in this matter, you have missed out on the Sunnah,” then he will accept it, because his intent is the Truth and his intent is not just to support his own opinion. So if you say, “O so and so, you have missed out on the Sunnah, you have missed out on the correct evidence,” then he will accept and return. But if you say to a person who is a follower of desires, “You are in error,” then he will become angry and become worse. And this is the sign of the people of desires, that everyone just wants to aid and support that which he desires. But as for the person of the Truth, then what he wants is that the Truth should be aided, and he seeks after the Truth. And the wise word is the lost property of the believer; wherever he finds it, he takes hold of it. [01]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 11 : Point 07</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that departing from the correct path occurs in one of two ways. As for one of them, then it is that a man strays from the correct path, intending nothing but good. So he is not to be followed upon his error, because he is heading towards destruction. And (secondly) a man who deliberately opposes the Truth and acts contrary to the pious ones who came before him, then he is astray, leading others astray. He is a rebellious devil within this nation. It is a duty upon those who are aware of him to warn the people against him and to explain his condition to them so that no one falls into his innovation and is destroyed.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/know-that-departing-from-the-correct-path-occurs-in-one-of-two-ways" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh rahimahullaah having explained in the preceding speech the correct path which it is obligatory upon the Muslim to proceed upon in his `aqeedah (creed and belief and his Religion. He then mentioned that one who departs from this path will be one two men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first man:</strong> is one who departs from it, not doing so deliberately, rather intending good. However he follows a path other than the path of good. And personal deduction will not be sufficient, even if the person’s intention was righteous and his intent was good, but along with that he must be upon the correct path. This person is counted as being one who has erred. Whoever agrees with him upon that and proceeds with him upon error, and he knows that it is error, then he is destroyed, because this is a path leading to destruction. Even though the person (original person), did not intend to depart from it, rather he was only seeking after good. And this is the condition of many of those people who introduce new ideas from themselves in the matter of knowledge of `aqeedah (creed and belief). So this is a matter which is not permissible and they are not to be followed upon it and the person is not upon correctness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah the Majestic and Most High says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And this is my Straight Path so follow it, and do not follow the divergent paths which will separate you away from His path (Allaah’s path)</span></strong> (Sooratul-An`aam (6), aayah 153)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whichever path will take us away from the Straight Path, then we reject it. Even if the person upon it is intending good and his intention is good, then still we do not following him upon that. And he, if he continues upon his error, he will go on to destruction, because whoever leaves the correct path on his journey and takes a path leading to ruin, then he will be destroyed. [01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>As for the second man:</strong> then he is the one who exits deliberately. He is aware of the Truth. And he knows that what he is gone out to is baatil (false and futile). However, he deliberately exits from the Truth with the intent of misleading the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the first person, his intention was to rectify the people. However he did not proceed upon the correct path. Whereas the second person, his intention is to misguide the people and to turn them away from the correct path. So this one is a shaytaan (a devil), because the devils take the people away from the Straight Path. Iblees said to his Lord, the Mighty and Majestic,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;I shall lie in wait for them and lead them astray from Your Straight Path&#8221;</span></strong>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), aayah 16)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He meant that he would turn them away from it, towards the deviant paths. And the Prophet, sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, struck an example for this, when he drew a straight line and he drew around it other lines. He said with regard to the straight path,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“This is the path of Allaah,”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said with regard to the other paths,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“and these are the other paths, upon every path from them there is a devil calling the people to it.”</strong></span> [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a clear illustration, and what the Shaykh (Imaam Al-Barbahaaree) mentioned here is consistent with it. Since the person who takes the people from the Straight Path, taking them to new and innovated paths, does not want good for them. Rather he wants for them destruction and he is a devil. Whether he be from the devils of the jinn or from the devils of mankind. So it is upon us to beware of this even more than we are wary of the first one, because this one deliberately tries to misguide the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“So he is astray, leading others astray. He is a rebellious devil.”</strong> He is misguided himself, misguiding other people and he is a rebellious, defiant devil. He wants the people turn away from the Straight Path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“It is a duty upon whoever knows of him that he should warn the people against him and make clear his condition to the people so that no one falls into his innovation and is destroyed.”</strong> This person who has departed from the Truth deliberately, it is not permissible to remain silent about him. Rather it is obligatory to disclose his affair and to expose his shameful state, so that the people can beware of him. It should not be said, “The people are free to have their own opinions,” “The people should have freedom of speech,” or “There should be respect for the opinions of others,” as they constantly say these days, with regard to respecting the other person’s opinion. So the matter is not a matter of opinions, the matter is a question of ittibaa` (following the Truth). So for us, Allaah has laid down and described a clear path and He has told us to proceed upon it when He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And this is my straight path, so follow it.&#8221;</span></strong> (Sooratul- An`aam (6), aayah 153)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whichever person comes to us and wants us to depart from this path then, firstly, we reject his saying, and secondly, we make his affair clear and we warn the people against him. And it is not allowable to remain silent about him, because if we remain silent about him, then the people will be fooled by him. Especially if he is a person of eloquence, one who can speak and write well, and a person of culture, then the people will be fooled by him. They will say, “This is a qualified person” “This person is from the thinkers,” as occurs at present. So the matter is very dangerous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this shows that it is obligatory to refute the one who opposes. Opposite to those people who say, “Leave off refutations,” “Leave the people,” “Let everyone have his own opinion and have his own respect and have freedom of thought and the freedom to speak.” In this way this nation will be destroyed. The Salaf (Predecessors), were not silent about the like of those people. Rather they exposed them and refuted them, because they knew of their danger to this nation. So we have no scope for remaining silent about their evil. Rather we must make clear that which Allaah send down. Otherwise we will be people hiding the Truth from those whom about Allaah has said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Those who conceal that which Allaah sent down from the clear signs and the guidance after we have made it clear to the people in the Book; those people Allaah curses them and those who curse, curse them</span></strong>. (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 159)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the affair is not restricted to the mubtadi’ (innovator). Rather the matter involves those who remain silent about him, because blame and punishment include him as well, because what is obligatory is to clarify and clearly explain to the people. This is the role of the knowledge based refutations (rudood), which are to be found plentifully in Islaamic book shops today. All of them defending the Straight Path and warning against those people. So no one promotes these ideas, the idea of the freedom to hold any opinion, or the freedom of speech and respecting others, except for one who strives to misguide and who conceals the Truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we, our intention is the Truth. We do not intend just to defame the people or to just speak against the people. The intent is to make the Truth clear. This is an amaanah (trust and responsibility) which Allaah has placed upon the scholars. So it is not permissible to remain silent about the like of those people. However, unfortunately, when a scholar comes and refutes the like of those people, then they say, “He is just one who is speaking in haste,” to the rest of the evil whisperings. So such a person should not betray the People of Knowledge for their clarifying the evil of the callers to misguidance to the people. He should not betray and let them down. [03] [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Points discussed by Shaykh Saalih al-Fowzaan and Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee hafizahumAllaah:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">leaving the correct path occurs in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The first is one who leaves the correct path but only intends good
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">He did not seek knowledge from the correct place and is heading for destruction</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Following him in his error knowingly is a path leading to destruction</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">He should be advised privately (if he is not calling to his error)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The second one leaves the correct path deliberately, obstinately and knowing the Truth
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">He wishes to mislead the people and he is a devil</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The devil misleads people from the Straight Path (aayah and hadeeth mentioned as proof)</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory to warn against this person otherwise he will fool the people</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">This is the role of the knowledge-based refutations, rudood</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Clarifying the Truth is a trust and responsibility Allaah placed upon the scholars</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Remaining silent about those who mislead the people is hiding the Truth</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> With regard to the wording, “ Innahu Haalaka” this person who intended good but strayed away from the true path, strayed into innovation, then literally ‘he is destroyed’, Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee rahimahullaah said, “I say, if the author rahimahullaah, had restricted this wording and the judgement concerning it, such that he had said, ‘he is destroyed, if he dies upon it and does not repent’ (it would be better). And I say also, that intending good will not benefit a person, that he just intends what is good, but he does not adhere to the Straight Path which came from Allaah and from His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.” Then the Shaykh, mentioned the long incident of those people who were counting the stones in the masjid (reported by ad-Daarimee in his Sunan) the narration concerning `Abdullaah ibn Mas`ood radiyAllaahu `anh. When they were criticized by `Abdullaah ibn Mas`ood radiyAllaahu `anh, that they made their excuse and they said, “<strong>By Allaah, O Aboo `Abdur-Rahmaan, we only intended good</strong>.” Ibn Mas`ood radiyAllaahu `anh, responded to them, “<strong>And how many people intend good, but do not attain it</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] Reported by at-Tayaalisee in his Musnad, Imaam Ahmad in his Musnad, Sa`eed ibn Mansoor in his Sunan, ad-Daarimee, an-Nasaa·ee in (Sunan) al-Kubraa and a number of other references besides. All of them say as a narration of `Abdullaah ibn Mas`ood. It was declared authentic by Ibn Hibbaan and al-Haakim, agreed to by ath-Thahabee and declared saheeh (authentic) by others from the people of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> In addition Shaykh al-Albaanee, in his checking of al-Mishkaat, declared this narration to have a hasan (good) chain of narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] <strong>Translators side point:</strong> Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee rahimahullaah said, “What is obligatory upon everyone who is aware of the Truth is that he should aid it.” After some speech he said, “And whoever claims that refuting the people of innovation causes splits in this nation and it disunites this nation, then he is misguided also, because he wants this nation to unite upon falsehood. This is a matter which Islaam does not consent to.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] <strong>Translators side point:</strong> From the taped explanation of Shaykh Saalih ibn Sa`d as-Suhaymee hafizahullaah. With regard to this point that the people who depart from the Truth are one of two people, he said, “Yes, this is a precise categorisation from the Shaykh, rahimahullaah. The innovators are indeed of two categories, because the Shaykh, as you know, throughout his whole book, his focus is upon the innovators. And from them there is a category who actually want the Truth, but he does not attain it. Just like the people of thikr who we mentioned a short while ago (the same incident of those people in the masjid who were doing an innovated form of thikr which `Abdullaah ibn Mas`ood criticised). Those who said to Ibn Mas`ood, radiyAllaahu’anh, ‘We only intend the Truth.’ However, how many people there are who intend the Truth, but do not attain it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Whoever intends the Truth, he should seek it from its correct place. And the Truth does not come about through venerating individuals, nor through flashy words, nor by having a majority. It only comes about through ittibaa`, following the Truth, following the first generations, the generations of the Companions and the Taabi`een and proceeding upon their methodology. So the like of this person (the first person, he strays into innovation but he only intends the Truth) is destroyed if he does not come back and seek the Truth with its proof from the correct place. However his danger is less than the danger of the second category of the people. And perhaps his harm will be restricted to himself, meaning the one who intends the Truth but he seeks it not in the correct way. So he slips and innovates and falls into innovation, and the judgement upon him will be in the light of how severe his innovations are. It may be of the level of something less or it may be something major or it may be something which takes him out of Islaam, but his danger will be less. And your advising him should be between you and him, if you know that he is not a caller to innovation and that he does not propagate innovation. Then you should come to him privately and you make clear to him the correct path, so that he can follow it. You make clear to him the methodology of the Ahlus-Sunnah walJamaa`ah. You don’t make his affair open. You don’t mention him upon the minbars. You don’t mention him as being a person with criticism. Rather you direct him and give him sincere advice. So if this type of person is how he is, then maybe be one day, by the permission of Allaah, he will turn back. And even if he stays upon his innovation, then he does not represent a great danger to the people (he doesn’t call to this innovation). However what is obligatory is that you strive to give him advice and clarify and give him correct, constructive direction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“As for the second category of people, those who are obstinate, those who do so deliberately with pride, they commit innovation, obstinately, deliberately. The more you forbid him, the more he increases in his error until he becomes a caller to innovation. Therefore the Salaf used to reject the narrations of an innovator, who was a caller to innovation and not accept them, rather they would reject them and warn against him and against his innovation. So the like of this person, you must make his affair clear and warn against him. And if he has written a book, he is refuted with a book. If he has a tape, he is refuted with a tape. If he gives speeches, he is refuted in speeches. The people are warned against his evil. ”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Shaykh went on to mention further examples in that regard: this is not backbiting; this is correct; this is one of the examples that Imaam An-Nawawee in his book Riyaadus-Saaliheen mentioned are an exception. This is a case where it is obligatory to speak against that person and it cannot be said, “This is backbiting, this is forbidden.” This is not the case. Then after some speech the Shaykh said finishing, “So this second type, who is indicated by the author here, he is the most dangerous of people for this nation. Therefore it is obligatory to warn the people against him and to draw attention to their evil and to warn the nation against their evil. ”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Question</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Some of the Takfeeris make takfeer of themselves (i.e. declare themselves disbelievers). One of the brothers who was in Afghanistan informed me that he sat next to one of them one time while this Takfeeri was busy making takfeer (of people). Then all of a sudden that Takfeeri called him, so he said: What do you want?” So he (the Takfeeri) said: “I have committed kufr (disbelief)!”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Answer</strong></span>: Yes, they make takfeer on themselves and they make takfeer on one another. I would like for my brothers in Islaam to refer to the book: “<strong>Al-Farq bainalFiraq</strong>” and the book “<strong>Al-Milal wan-Nihal</strong>” of ash-Shahrastaanee, as well as “<strong>AlFasl</strong>” of Ibn Hazm. So perhaps four or five of them may sit in one gathering and they will not get up from that meeting except that one of them has made takfeer of another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Question</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">There can be found a group of these Takfeeris in ‘Aden in the central Mosque. They have entered the masjid recently. How should we deal with them?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Answer</strong></span>: It is obligatory to warn the people about them because if you present them with the opportunity, they will shed blood and make lawful that which is prohibited, as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم informed us they would do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Question</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The hadeeth of Umm Salamah (radyAllaahu ‘anhaa) reported by Muslim: “There will come upon you leaders of whom you will approve of (the good they do) but reject (the bad). So whoever rejects (their bad deeds), he is absolved from blame. And whoever hates (their bad deeds), he is (also) saved. However, whoever is pleased with them and follows them (i.e. bad deeds), (then he is destroyed).” They (the Sahaabah) said: “Shall we fight against them?” He said: “No, so long as they establish the prayer amongst you.” Isn’t this hadeeth a refutation against them?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: Yes, I have not mentioned several ayaat and ahaadeeth (during this discussion), such as the hadeeth of ‘Ubaadah bin As-Saamit (radhi Allaahu anhu), who reported that the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Whoever bears witness that there is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah; that ‘Eesaa is the slave and messenger of Allaah, His word, which He placed in Maryam, and a spirit from Him; and that Paradise is true and the Hellfire is true, Allaah will admit him into Paradise, regardless of what actions he has.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth and those similar to it prove that it is not permissible to fight against Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Question</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The lowest level of Islaam is not persisting upon committing sins. So if you persist upon committing a sin, then you are a disbeliever. How would you reply to this claim?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: If someone persists on committing a sin, there is no proof that indicates that he is a disbeliever, unless he is persisting upon committing disbelief. As for him persisting upon continuously committing a sin, then this person is guilty of committing a major sin. And Allaah praises the righteous people, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">وَلَمْ یُصِرُّواْ عَلَى مَا فَعَلُواْ وَهُمْ یَعْلَمُونَ<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">“And they do not persist in what (wrong) they have done, while they know.”</span><br />
[Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 135]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this person is sinning if he persists in his evil. But as for this action taking him to the level of disbelief, then where is the evidence for this??</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Question</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Is it permissible for us to make takfeer of the Jamaa’ah at-Takfeer (i.e. declare them to be disbelievers)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: No, we do not declare them to be disbelievers, for the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: “Whoever says to his brother: ‘O Kaafir’, then it falls back on one of them. If he is as he said he is (then it falls on him), and if not then it returns back to him.” So we do not say that they are disbelievers. ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib said about the Khawaarij: “Flee from kufr (disbelief).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we consider them to be innovators and misguided, more astray that the donkey of their people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Is it permissible to wage war against the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: We should not wage war agsint them unless they inititate it against us and we feel that they will present a danger to Islaam and the Muslims. So in that case, we should do what ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib did. Otherwise, the core foundation with regard to the Muslim is that his blood (i.e. life) is sacred, and it is not permissible to wage war against them, unless they initiate first by fighting against the Muslims or it is feared that they will bring harm to the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Jamaa’at at-Takfeer use as evidence the argument that the proof was established upon mankind with Allaah’s statement:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">وَإِذْ أَخَذَ رَبُّكَ مِن بَنِي آدَمَ مِن ظُهُورِهِمْ ذُرِّیَّتَهُمْ وَأَشْهَدَهُمْ عَلَى أَنفُسِهِمْ أَلَسْتَ بِرَبِّكُمْ</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">قَالُواْ بَلَى شَهِدْنَا أَن تَقُولُواْ یَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ إِنَّا آُنَّا عَنْ هَذَا غَافِلِينَ</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“And remember when your Lord brought forth from the Children of Aadam from their loins, their seed and made them testily as to themselves, saying: ‘Am I not your Lord?’ They said: ‘Yes, we testify’ lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection: ‘Verily we were unaware of this.’” [Surah Al-A’raaf: 172]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And they deem Ibn ‘Abbaas’ interpretation (tafseer) of Allaah’s statement:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">وَمَن لَّمْ یَحْكُم بِمَا أَنزَلَ اللّهُ فَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْكَافِرُونَ</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“And whoever doesn’t rule by what Allaah has revealed, then they are the disbelievers” [5] in which he said: “It is a (minor) disbelief less than (major) disbelief” to be a weak narration.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: As for using this ayah as evidence, it states that Allaah has taken a covenant from the Children of Aadam, however there is no mention in it that there is not left any excuses for them. the proof for this is Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">وَمَا آُنَّا مُعَذِّبِينَ حَتَّى نَبْعَثَ رَسُولاً<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">“And We never punish until We have sent a messenger (to forewarn).”</span> [Surah AlIsraa: 15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another proof is Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">وَمَا آَانَ اللّهُ لِيُضِلَّ قَوْمًا بَعْدَ إِذْ هَدَاهُمْ حَتَّى یُبَيِّنَ لَهُم مَّا یَتَّقُونَ<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">“And Allaah will never lead a people astray after He has guided them until He (first) makes clear to them what they should avoid.”</span> [Surah At-Tawbah: 115]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the Saheeh, from the narration of Hudhaifah radhi Allaahu anhu, the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم informed us that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There was a man who when death approached him asked his children: ‘What kind of a father was I to you?’ They replied: ‘The best father.’ So he said: ‘If I order you to do something, would you do it?’ They said: ‘Yes.’ He said: ‘When I die, burn my body and scatter my ashes (throughout the land and sea), for I swear by Allaah, if Allaah is able to get a hold of me, He will surely punish me with a severe torment, the likes of which no other creature in the universe will face.’ So when he died his children did what he asked. So Allaah commanded the land and the sea to gather his remains, until he brought the man forth and Allaah said to him: ‘What caused you to do what you did?’ He replied: ‘My fear of you.’ So Allaah said to him: “I have indeed forgiven you.’” This is proof that this individual was excused due to his ignorance. He doubted Allaah’s Ability. We don’t say that the word qadira here holds the meaning of: to restrain. So its meaning is not: “If Allaah restrains me.” This is since according to the context of the hadeeth, the appropriate meaning is that it refers to Allaah’s Ability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also the hadeeth of Hudhaifah radhi Allaahu anhu, in which he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It is imminent that a time will come upon the people in which one will not know what fasting or prayer is.” So it was said: “What then will remain with them, O Hudhaifah?” He replied: “The testification that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah.” It was said: “And what benefit will this testification be for them?” He said: “It will take them out from the Hellfire.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there are many proofs in the Qur’aan and the Sunnah that indicate that one is excused due to ignorance. One of these proofs is the hadeeth reported by Abu Hurairah radhi Allaahu anhu and Al-Aswad bin Saree’ in Musnad Ahmad concerning how the people of Fitrah (innate inclination) will be tested:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“On the Day of Judgement, three types of people will present their arguments to Allaah. One of them will say: ‘I was deaf and could not hear.’ Another will say: ‘I was simple-minded and didn’t have any intellect.’ And the third will present his argument. So Allaah will bring forth a strip from the Hellfire and say to them: ‘Enter it.’ So if they enter it, it will be cool and safe on them. And if they do not enter it, He will say to them: ‘Now you have disobeyed Me. And you would have been the most disobedient to My messengers.’”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jamaa’at at-Takfeer is a deviant group of people. So we advise our brothers in AlBaydaa and Ibb and other places to beware of them and to regard them as misguided individuals who are far away from the Religion. And they should consider them as a danger to Islaam and the Muslims. So they serve as an instrument for everyone that wishes to attack the Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, we advise them to repent to Allaah, and to turn back to the people of knowledge. And if they remain upon their misguidance and meet Allaah holding these deviant beliefs, they will regret it, and Allaah is the One who we ask for assistance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Question</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Who is the one who has the ability to make takfeer (declare someone a disbeliever)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The scholars are the ones who are capable of placing rulings upon an individual – i.e. if he is either a Muslim or a disbeliever, unless of course if he is a Christian or a Jew or a Communist. Then in this case it is known to the Muslims that such people are disbelievers. There can be found a group that is called Jamaa’at atTakfeer, which is present in Egypt, Sudan and Yemen. This group declares Muslims to be disbelievers due to sins (they commit). And we have made several refutations against them. They feel restrained and pressed back by Da’wah but not by prison and terrorism. However, by calling to the Book and the Sunnah their misguidance can be exposed. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Whoever says to his brother: ‘O Kaafir’, then it falls back on one of them. If he is as he said he is (then it falls on him), and if not then it returns back to him.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not permissible for a Muslim to declare other Muslims to be disbelievers.[6]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">About a week ago, I (Dawud Adib) received an image in a Whatsapp forum indicating that the noble scholar Shaykh Salih bin Fawzan al-Fawzan was standing at the bedside of one of the most notorious people of misguidance of our time, A&#8217;id al-Qarni. Within hours of that picture’s release, there was an abundance of comments—many unfavorable—about the Shaykh&#8217;s visit. One brother who was dismayed about this visit cited to me the statement of al-Imam al-Barbahari concerning not visiting the innovator or deviant who has fallen sick, from his <em>Explanation of the Creed</em>. Although the brother was sincere, he had become confused by the actions of the Shaykh, since, in his mind, they were at least in contradiction to this basic Salafi principle on how we deal with the People of Desires, Deviation, and Misguidance, or maybe even in opposition to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I responded to the brother with two narrations: one from the best caller to Allah, Abul-Qasim Muhammad bin ‘Abdillah bin ‘Abdil-Muttalib (may Allah raise him in rank and grant him peace), and the other from the Imam of the People of the Sunnah and Jama&#8217;ah of his time, al-Imam Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Hanbal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I explained to the brother that this affair (visiting the innovator or deviant who has fallen sick) is not as black and white as one may think.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">جاء في صحيح البخاري من طريق حماد بن زيد عن ثابت عن أنس رضي الله عنه قال. كان غلام يهودي يخدم النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم فمَرض فأتاه النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم يعوده فقعد عند رأسه فقال له. أسلم. فنظر إلى أبيه وهو عنده فقال له أطع أبا القاسم صلى الله عليه وسلم. فأسلم فخرج النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم وهو يقول. الحمد لله الذي أنقذه من النار.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>It was reported in <em>Sahih al-Bukhari</em> from Hammad bin Zayd from Thabit that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said, “There was a Jewish boy who used to serve the Prophet (</strong><strong>may Allah raise him in rank and grant him peace</strong><strong>). He fell sick, and the Prophet (</strong><strong>may Allah raise him in rank and grant him peace</strong><strong>) went to visit him. He sat at his head and said to him, ‘Accept Islam.’ (The boy) looked towards his father, who was with him. (His father) said, ‘Obey Abul-Qasim (</strong><strong>may Allah raise him in rank and grant him peace</strong><strong>).’ So he accepted Islam, and the Prophet (</strong><strong>may Allah raise him in rank and grant him peace</strong><strong>) went out (from his house) saying, ‘Praise be to Allah Who has saved him from the Hell-Fire.’ ” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I told the brother that there are many benefits from this narration, and one of them that clearly stands out was the Prophet&#8217;s (may Allah raise him in rank and grant him peace) zealousness to have people guided and saved from the Fire by the permission of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other authentic narration is from al-Imam Ahmad, found in the book <em>Ahl al-Milal war-Riddah waz-Zanadiqah wa-Tarik as-Salah wal-Fara&#8217;id min Kitab al-Jami</em> by Ahmad bin Muhammad Khallal, in The Book of Funerals, Chapter of Visiting the Sick, #602:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">قال الفضل بن زياد سمعت أحمد بن حنبل سئل عن الرجل المسلم يعود أحداً من المشركين، قال: إن كان يرى أنه إذا عاده يعرض عليه الإسلام يقبل منه فليعده كما عاد النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم الغلام اليهودي فعرض عليه الإسلام.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Fadl bin Ziyad said, “I heard Ahmad bin Hanbal being asked about a Muslim individual visiting one of the pagans who had fallen ill. He [al-Imam Ahmad] said, ‘If he thinks that if he visits him while he is sick and tells him about Islam, he may accept it, then let him visit him, as the Prophet (</strong><strong>may Allah raise him in rank and grant him peace</strong><strong>) visited the Jewish boy who was sick and told him about Islam.’ ” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some days later, I came across an article posted on <a href="http://www.sahab.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.sahab.net</a> from someone responding to the same issue the brother and I were discussing, which provided an elaborate explanation to this timely affair. May Allah bless the brother and Sahab for their efforts in assisting Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The following is my translation of his response:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allah, Lord of all the worlds. In addition, may prayers and peace be upon Muhammad, the most honored of the Messengers. As to what follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As salamu ‘alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There has been an increase in lectures and clamor from the People of Deviation and Desires, from amongst the Qutubis and Takfiris and their apprentices, concerning the [recent] visit of the erudite scholar Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan (may Allah protect and preserve him) to a [well-known] caller of fitnah. This individual who has deviated from the methodology of the Prophet (may Allah raise him in rank and grant him peace) and his Companions [is none other than] A’id al-Qarni.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some students of knowledge have become puzzled about this matter, while others have become despondent. Likewise, some of the general masses of the People of the Sunnah have begun to doubt and their hearts have differed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consequently, I would like to point out some matters that clearly indicate the harmony of this methodology, its deep-rooted firmness, and its constancy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: The [true, erudite] scholar of the People of the Sunnah and Jama’ah is like the ruler who has [the responsibility of] the affairs of the citizens [in his hands]. He is the most knowledgeable of what benefits them and of what assists the call to Allah the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a result, Allah has referred matters of a calamitous, problematic nature to their formal legal opinions and judgments. This is not [the case] for those other than them. Thus, [the meaning of what] Allah the Most High has stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And when there comes to them information about [public] security or fear, they spread it around. However, if they had referred it back to the Messenger or to those of authority among them, then the ones who [can] draw correct conclusions from it would have known about it. And if not for the favor of Allah upon you and His mercy, you would have followed the Shaytan, except for a few.&#8221;</strong> [Surah an-Nisa 4:83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, there is [a clear] distinction between the common people and the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: This visit to this obstinate contravener [to the Book of Allah, the pure Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad and the methodology of the righteous Salaf] did not occur without [thorough] familiarity (with the issue) and [deep] research. If people have these types of thoughts about them [the scholars], then they [in reality] have judged them as those who waste time and indulge in frivolous entertainment, which is not commensurate with their [deep] knowledge and [vast] experience. Indeed, the major, senior scholars have spent their youth being actively engaged in seeking knowledge and shunning enjoyment and pleasures during the prime of their lives.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how could this ever be assumed about them in their advanced age when worldly desires have been suppressed in their hearts, and while they are [consistently] upon what they have been upon?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: If we really understand these two principles from the two aforementioned points, [then we will also come to know and understand that] the scholar has already realized the predominant public benefit in visiting the adamant infringer for the purpose of advising and establishing proofs [against the infringer’s deviations and misguidance]. This is known from the [actions of the] Companions and their followers from amongst the Salaf of this ummah. Amongst the utmost proofs for this is ‘Ali bin Abi Talib sending Ibn ‘Abbas to the Khawarij for a discussion, causing a number of them to return to the truth right on the spot.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[That discussion] brings to mind two narrations from al-Imam Ahmad, [the first] from al-Imam Abu Dawud on p.276 of <em>Masa’il of al-Imam Ahmad</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(a)</strong> I [al-Imam Abu Dawud] said to Ahmad, “We have relatives residing in Khorasan who have adopted the views of al-Irja’. So when we write to Khorasan, should we also extend to them the greetings of peace?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad retorted, “Subhanallah! You do not extend to them the greetings of peace?” So I said to Ahmad, “We should speak to them?” He said, “Yes, unless they are callers to [these deviated beliefs] and quarrel with [you] concerning them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Muflih said in “Al-Adab ash-Shar’iyyah,” vol. 1, p.229:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(b)</strong> In the narration of al-Fadl: “It was said to [al-Imam Ahmad], ‘And should one speak to any of them?’ He said, ‘Yes, unless you know of any nifaq from them, because the Prophet (may Allah raise him in rank and grant him peace) feared for the three [Companions] who stayed behind (from the campaign to Tabuk), thus he ordered the people not to speak to them. I said, ‘O Aba ‘Abdillah! Then how should the People of Desires be dealt with?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“He replied, ‘As for the Jahmiyyah and Rafidah, then no [do not speak to them].’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Then it was said to him, ‘So [what about] the Murji’ah?’ He replied, ‘They are less complicated, unless they are those who quarrel [with you]—then do not speak with them.’ ”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates that the judgment to meet with the People of Innovation to advise them in a particular matter goes back to the scholars, who possess the discretional ability to deal with critical situations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth</strong>: Shaykh Salih (may Allah preserve and protect him) has never been known for trying to win applause, having affection for or displaying flattery to the People of Innovations, or including them in [the fold of those who adhere to] the methodology of the Salaf like those who oppose it do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the contrary, he continues to unleash upon them a firm, unchangeable, cast-iron tongue. He upbraids them; even more than that, he orders to withdraw from them and not come close to them. This is known from his writings and legal decisions to those near and far.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifth</strong>: As we have already clarified, Shaykh Salih (may Allah preserve and protect him) has not opposed the methodology of the Salaf, just as the erudite scholar Shaykh Rabi’ has not opposed it regarding this matter, the matter of giving advice and being patient with the obstinate violator [of the methodology of the Salaf]. Shaykh Rabi’ has displayed mammoth restraint toward the pig-headed opponent [of the Salafi methodology]. Everyone knows that he was patient with ‘Abdur-Rahman ‘Abdul-Khaliq for ten years before speaking out against him. At the same time, [Shaykh Nasir ad-Din al-Albani] (may Allah’s mercy be upon him) has distinguished [Shaykh Rabi’] with the title “the carrier of the flag of [knowledge] of Jarh wa Ta&#8217;dil,” which is why the enemies have unsheathed their swords against him. Assuredly, this is a distinct characteristic that Allah gives to whomever He wants, just as He distinguished al-Imam Ahmad in standing against the innovators, although during his time there existed many [renowned] scholars who were persecuted and killed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sixth</strong>: Those People of Desires, from amongst them the Haddadis and Qutubis, deem Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan as being from the remnants of the Salaf. They have said this about him; the innovator [Abu Ishaq] al-Huwayni recently called him “the remnant of the Salaf.” This is a proof that they deem him to be an extraordinary erudite scholar from among the scholars who call to the Sunnah. Despite this, they do not desire to follow the methodology of Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan in the issue of not revolting against the ruler, the issue of mawazanat, or the issue of bombings and calling a Muslim a disbeliever. This is because they oppose the Shaykh, heart and soul. But they are persistent about those issues in which Shaykh al-Fawzan and Shaykh Rabi’ have differed, focusing on those affairs to create conflict between the Salafi scholars and students of knowledge. Likewise, they intend to confuse and deceive the masses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In summary, Shaykh Salih did not go out in opposition to the ruler (King Salman), may Allah protect and preserve them both, as the Takfiri Qutubis have done in revolting against the rulers and declaring them disbelievers. Rather, he went out on the authorization and order of the king (may Allah protect and preserve them both). Likewise, his visit has not opposed his previous comments regarding the callers of fitnah, and his visit is not a green light allowing the common Muslims to listen to the lessons and lectures of those individuals or to sit with them. How could it be so, when he himself has explained the narration regarding the strike of the tongue at the end of time being like the blows of the sword?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Translator&#8217;s note: It should be noted that the aforementioned narration of &#8220;the strike of the tongue will be like the blows of the sword,&#8221; collected by Imams at-Tirmidhi, Abu Dawud, and Ibn Majah, is weak. This is due to the uncertainty of one of the narrators named Ziyad bin Saymin or Simin Kush, and the weakness of Layth bin Abi Sulaym. More than likely the Shaykh was using it to cite a point and Allah knows best!]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is upon the people to avoid the callers of fitnah and hold on to the well-known scholars. And [Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan] has not opposed the methodology of the Salaf in his evaluation of the benefits and wisdoms of calling to Allah the Most High, as I have previously mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Allah comes every source of goodness.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="dropcap">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="bodytext"><span class="bodytext"><b>This is how the People of Desires, from the Hizbees and Qutubees show respect for the Scholars…rather this is how they show respect for the House of Allaah!</b></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Saalih As-Suhaymee and Shaikh Abdur-Razaaq, may Allaah preserve them, undertook a visit to the area of Qaseem, particularly the city of Buraydah (in Saudi Arabia), some years ago to give a lectures there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But they were met by some people of desires – especially from the Qutubees and Hizbees in the audience who did not want to listen to the Remembrance of Allaah nor to the Call to Tawheed and the following of the correct Manhaj.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To hear what happened to the Shaikhs and how the ignorant people dealt with them, listen to the recording, and follow with the summarization below.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The program begins with the chair of the conference introducing the topic of the lecture, which was a talk on the hadeeth: <b>“The Religion is Sincerity.”</b> He began with the Shaikh on the right who was Shaikh ‘Abdur-Razaaq, the son of ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-‘Abbaad, may Allaah preserve them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Shaikh began with Khutbat ul-Haajah, but was not even halfway through it when commotion broke out at the hands of some deviants amongst the followers of vain desires, who started shouting and screaming. But this was quelled and the Shaikh continued by making du’aa that Allaah grant the Muslims Paradise and that He make them people who fear Allaah and act righteously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the commotion continued for a while, but finally the Shaikh began the lecture and the microphone was passed onto Shaikh Saalih As-Suhaymee who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“To whoever came to this masjid and saw fit to do these kinds of actions, which Allaah is not pleased with, will they not fear Allaah? Whoever wants to listen then let him come and whoever wants to leave then let him leave.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Shaikh ‘Abdur-Razaaq began the lecture and began explaining the hadeeth of <b>“The Religion is Sincerity (Naseeha).”</b> And he stressed the point that what they came to the masjid for was to seek to get closer to Allaah by way of listening and benefiting by the hadeeth of Allaah’s Messenger. And he narrated to them a story about Allaah’s Messenger and Mu’awiyah, which showed that gathering in the masjid is for the purpose of getting closer to Allaah. So this is what they were there for – to worship Allaah and not cause commotion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he began by saying what he will talk about in the lecture – the foundation of sincerity and faith in Allaah. So he discussed the definition of Eemaan and went on to mention the three categories of Tawheed, but noise could still be heard in the background from the troublemakers</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Shaikh ‘Abdur-Razaaq finished and the mic was given to Shaikh Saalih As-Suhaymee who addressed the troublemakers and asked them if Allaah was pleased with the actions they were doing, at which they again turned violent. And commotion broke loose again, with Shaikh Saalih commanding them to fear Allaah. And the situation got worse with the mob storming the podium and in the midst of all that the Shuyookh were making du’aa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the course of this violent attack, they trampled over the mushafs (copies of Qur’aan) and broke Shaikh Saalih As-Suhaymee’s walking cane, since he is blind and needs it to walk!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But Allaah protected the two Shaikhs from the evil of these people of desires and misguidance! And all of this was just because the Shaikhs stick to the truth and call to the Salafee Manhaj while opposing and refuting the deviants.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we advise the brothers to listen to the recording so that they can see for themselves the condition of these people, who fight against the Salafee Scholars and hate the Salafee Da’wah, only because they have no other recourse since their da’wah is dead and they are void of any proofs and evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we cannot forget also what happened to Shaikh Muhammad Amaan Al-Jaamee, may Allaah have mercy on him, who was attacked while giving a lecture in the Masjid of Shaikh ‘Abdullaah Al-‘Ubaylaan years ago.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Access the recording and follow with brief summarization below:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While the Shaikh was in the masjid answering questions, he responded to one question, which consisted of several parts. The first part asked as to the reason why the Muslims are divided into groups, parties and sects. So the Shaikh responded by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The reason is well known – it is something that is going on now, which is the presence of those who incite the people upon political agitation and the presence of those who distribute them into groups. Rather, it is due to these newly invented groups. The groups that are present in the arena nowadays, I consider them to be innovated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is since before this state (of Saudi Arabia) was established, you did not find all of these groups – there was only One Group. The Saudi Society was only one Jamaa’ah (group) – the Jamaa’ah of the Muslims. There was no other group to be found besides it. <b>So the presence of all these groups (nowadays) and the efforts these groups expend in calling the people to their manhaj is the cause for them being divided and split up</b>…”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then one man from the audience began to criticize the Shaikh’s response about the jamaa’aat (groups) and commotion broke loose, with a mob shouting and screaming. And all the while the Shaikh was trying to calm the mob down, seeking refuge in Allaah, but they did not listen to him. Even to the point that the Call for Prayer was proclaimed and they did not listen to that! Rather, the prayer was started and commotion and screaming could still be heard from those who wished to cause fitnah and disrespect the house of Allaah, may Allaah guide these individuals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the way of all of the scholars who have followed the Way of the Salaf, in that they were faced with the opposition of the deviants – even to the point where their opposition was violent, as was the case with Imaam Abu Shaamah, <i>rahimahullaah</i>, the great scholar of the 7th Century, who wrote a tremendous book [<b>Al-Bid’i wal-Hawaadith</b>] refuting the present day innovations of his time, as he was beaten to the point that he never fully recovered from his injuries and eventually died later from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah to protect our scholars and to grant them a long lifespan for benefiting the ummah, Amaeen.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Does the one that listens to the cassette tapes of Ahl-ul-Bid&#8217;ah or reads their books in order to know what they believe fall into sitting with innovators?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân</strong>: It is as sitting with them or maybe even worse. But if he is learned and armed with knowledge and listens to them or reads their books to refute them and warn against them, it is okay.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, were he not to have knowledge and insight and wants to read them or listen to them, it is not allowed. It will get stuck into his head and he has nothing to repel it with. It is not allowed for him to listen to them if he cannot defend himself against these poisons and evilnesses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AUTHOR: Shaikh Rabee&#8217; bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Excerpt from the forthcoming Al-Ibaanah Publication &#8220;The Methodology of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah in Criticizing Individuals, Books and Groups&#8221;, may Allaah facilitate it!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a chapter from the book <b>“<i>Manhaj Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah fee Naqd-ir-Rijaal wal-Kutubi wat-Tawaa’if</i>”</b> (The Methodology of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah in Criticizing Individuals, Books and Groups) written by Shaikh Rabee’ Al-Madkhalee. This book has been highly praised and recommended by the scholars, and has become a classical work in its own time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this book, Shaikh Rabee’ Al-Madkhalee clarifies the correct methodology of Ahlus-Sunnah with regard to criticizing, explaining its foundations and principles and relying on the various statements of the Salaf (predecessors) to support his points. The book is primarily geared towards refuting a false concept that has crept into the Muslims’ ideologies and slogans in recent times, which is the principle of Muwaazanah. This principle dictates that when someone criticizes a person, book or group, he is obligated to also mention the good qualities of that person, book or group along with his criticism. By doing this one would be creating a balance and thus applying “fairness”, hence the term Muwaazanah, which means to make a balance, which in this case means a balance between the good and the bad aspects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this specific chapter of the book, Shaikh Rabee’ brings many quotes from the Salaf showing that it was from their methodology to warn against innovators and their books without requiring themselves to mention their positive aspects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Ibn Al-Jawzee said: ‘Abul-Wafaa ‘Alee bin ‘Aqeel, the Fiqh scholar, said: ‘Our Shaikh Abul-Fadl Al-Hamdhaanee said: The innovators in Islaam and those who fabricate <i>ahaadeeth </i>are worse than the disbelievers. This is since the disbelievers attempt to corrupt the Religion from the outside, whereas these individuals attempt to corrupt it from the inside. They take the likeness of the inhabitants of a land, who strive to corrupt its condition (from the inside), while the disbelievers take the likeness of raiders laying siege to the land from the outside. So it is the ones on the inside who open the doors of the land’s surrounding barrier (and let the besiegers in). These types (of people) are more dangerous to Islaam than those who don&#8217;t ascribe themselves to it.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I say: Today, the opponents of the Sunnah and Tawheed are capitalizing on the pamphlets and cassettes of some individuals that ascribe themselves to the Sunnah and Tawheed, which defame the true scholars and callers of the Sunnah and Tawheed. Rather, what is worse in terms of danger and affliction is that these pamphlets and tapes have influenced many of the children of Tawheed and Sunnah, so that now they launch their arrows of disparagement and oppressive accusations towards the scholars of Tawheed and Sunnah, those who carry their banner and those who defend their sanctity. What is worse than this in terms of misfortune and grief, is that they attach themselves and join forces with the people of innovation and misguidance in their campaign of launching poisonous missiles at them, which the enemies of the Sunnah and Tawheed have been preparing as the ultimate attack to finish off the last remnants of the Sunnah and Tawheed.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Ibn Al-Qayyim said: ‘The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) once saw a book in the hand of ‘Umar (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) that he had transcribed from the Torah, and which caused him to be amazed at how much it conformed to the Qur’aan. So the face of the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) became very angry to the point that ‘Umar went over to a fire and threw it in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how would it be if the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) saw what was written after him from the books that oppose and contradict what is in the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah?! And we ask Allaah to aid us!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) commanded everyone that recorded anything from him apart from the Qur’aan to erase what they had written down. However, afterward, he allowed his Sunnah to be written, but did not grant permission for anything besides that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So all of these books that contain opposition in them to the Sunnah, have no permission to be written. Rather, they only have permission to be erased and destroyed, for there is not anything more harmful to the ummah than these books. The Companions (of the Prophet) burned all the copies of the <i>mus-haf </i>that contradicted the <i>mus-haf </i>of ‘Uthmaan (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) out of fear that differing would spread amongst the ummah. So how would it be if they were to see the books of today that cause disunity and division amongst the ummah…!?’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is the rightly guided methodology, which all of the Salafee youth are obligated to know – it is the methodology indicated in the Qur’aan and the Sunnah, and which the best of this ummah – its scholars of Hadeeth and Fiqh &#8211; followed. One of the conditions for implementing this methodology is that the one criticizing must do that for the sake of Allaah and out of sincerity to Allaah and His Book and in order to preserve Allaah’s Religion and what it encompasses from beliefs, laws and acts of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the severely unfortunate matters is that the people of falsehood and innovation have succeeded in deceiving many of the smart and intelligent students of knowledge, not to mention others, by making them believe that it is not permissible to talk about (i.e. criticize) those active in the field of Da’wah (calling). They mean by this, those who call to innovation and misguidance! By doing this, they intend to broaden the field (of Da’wah) so that they can spread their destructive deceptions! And they hope that with this they will be able to put an end to the Call to Tawheed, Sunnah and the Methodology of the Salaf As-Saalih!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the offshoots of this deceitful way of thinking are those conditions that some of the children of Tawheed have put forth, such as: When criticizing the people of innovation – or those whom they label “callers” – one is obligated to mention their good qualities alongside their bad qualities&#8230;”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Chapter 15: The People of Innovations are worse than the People of Sins</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[134]</b> Abu Moosaa said: “That I live next to a Jew and a Christian, and monkeys and pigs, is more beloved to me than that if I were to live next to a follower of desires (i.e. deviant), who will spread disease to my heart.” [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[135]</b> Yoonus bin ‘Ubaid said to his son: “I forbid you from fornicating, stealing and drinking alcohol. But if you were to meet Allaah having committed these (sins), that would be more beloved (to me) than if you were to meet Him with the views of ‘Amr bin ‘Ubaid or the followers of ‘Amr.” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[136]</b> Abul-Jawzaa said: “If the apes and the swine were to live with me in a house, that would be more beloved to me than if a person from Ahlul-Ahwaa (deviants) were to live with me. They have entered into the ayah: <b>‘And when they meet you they say: We believe. But when they are alone, they bite the tips of their fingers at you in rage. Say: Perish in your rage. Allaah knows what is in the hearts.’</b> [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 119]” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[137]</b> Al-‘Awwaam bin Hawshab said about his son ‘Eesaa: “By Allaah, if I saw ‘Eesaa gathering with the people of musical instruments, alcohol and falsehood, that would be more beloved to me than if I were to see him sitting with the people of argumentation – the innovators.” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[138]</b> Yahyaa bin ‘Ubaid said: “A man from the Mu’atazilah encountered me (one day), so I got up and said: “Either you pass on or I will pass on, for indeed if I were to walk with a Christian, that would be more loved to me than if I were to walk with you.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[139]</b> Arta’ Ibn al-Mundir said: “If my son were one of the sinful wicked people, that would be more beloved to me than if he were a Follower of Desires (i.e. a deviant).” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[140]</b> Sa’eed bin Jubair said: “If my son were to keep the company of a sinning scoundrel upon the Sunnah that would be more beloved to me than if he were to accompany a worshipping innovator.” [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[141]</b> It was once said to Maalik bin Mughawal: “We saw your son playing with the birds.” So he responded: “How wonderful that it preoccupies him from accompanying an innovator.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[142]</b> Al-Barbahaaree said: “If you see a person whose manner and opinion is despicable, he is wicked, sinful, and oppressive, yet he is a person of the Sunnah, accompany him and sit with him, since his sin will not harm you. And if you see a man who strives hard and long in worship, is abstemious, being continual in worship, except that he is a person of innovation, do not sit with him, do not listen to his words, and do not walk along with him, since I do not feel safe that you will not eventually come to be pleased with his way and go to destruction along with him.” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[143]</b> Abu Haatim said: “I heard Ahmad bin Sinaan said: “That a Tanboor player were to live next to me is more beloved to me than if an innovator were to live next to me. This is since I can forbid the Tanboor player and I can break the tanboor (a mandolin-like instrument). But as for the innovator, he corrupts the people, the neighbors and the youth.” [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[144]</b> Imam ash-Shaafi’ee, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “If the servant were to meet Allaah having committed every sin except Shirk, that would be better for him than if he were to meet Allaah with some deviant belief.” [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[145]</b> Imaam Ahmad, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “The graves of sinners from People of Sunnah is a garden, while the graves of the pious ascetics from the People of Innovation is a barren pit. The sinners among Ahlus-Sunnah are the Friends of Allaah, while the pious among Ahlul-Bid’ah are the Enemies of Allaah.” [12]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">O Virtuous Shaykh, with what do you advise us during this time (in) which trials (fitan) have increased and the people of innovation have become widespread and the death of the scholars? (are increasing)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I advise you with the first thing (which is) to have<strong> taqwa of Allaah</strong> and <strong>increase in your supplication to Allaah</strong> that He keeps us and you firm upon the religion and that He protects us and you from the evils of trials (fitan).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I advise you with <strong>seeking knowledge from the people of knowledge</strong> and the diligence in seeking knowledge, because one will not fall into trial (fitna) with Allaah’s permission (only) if he has the correct knowledge. But if you don’t have the correct knowledge, maybe you will fall into trial (fitna) while you are not aware (of it) and (while) you don’t know it is trial (fitna). It is upon you to seek knowledge from the people of knowledge and <strong>do not become lazy</strong> upon seeking knowledge whatever is possible for you.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A beautiful and comprehensive explanation delivered by <em>Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Ramzaan al-Haajiree</em> (May <strong>Allah</strong> Preserve Him) expounding on the guidance of the Companions in dealing with the people of innovation. Herein the <em>Shaykh</em> presents some lofty benefits and salient points of contemplation from the <em>hadith</em> of <em>Ibn Mas’ood</em> and the people in <em>dhikr</em> circles, thus clarifying the approach of <em>Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah</em> regarding the people of innovation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This treatise was translated and compiled by <em>Abu Afnaan Muhammad ‘Abdullah</em> (May <strong>Allah</strong> Preserve him) with the explicit permission and approval of <em>Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Ramzaan al-Haajiree.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>An excerpt taken from the chapter:</strong> <em>The Person of Innovation in The Religion is Not Granted The Success To Repent</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Can a person of <i>bid’ah</i> come back? (The answer is) he sees himself as being upon the truth and the correct position, and believes that he is getting closer to Allah by practicing these forms of <i>bid’ah</i>. For this reason, the person of <i>bid’ah</i> is not granted success to make repentance.Why is this? This is because he does not consider himself as being wrong in the first place, unlike the person who engages in sins. Because the latter, even while he is engaging in sins or acts of disobedience, he knows within himself that he is doing something wrong, he wants to make repentance. However, the person who is upon <i>bid’ah </i>believes that he is doing a righteous action (bringing him closer to Allah), so how can he make repentance?&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Throughout history, the ways of the people of innovation has been apparent to the scholars of <em>Ahl Sunnah wal Jama&#8217;ah</em>; however, in our time, the ability to distinguish  <em>haqq</em> (truth) from <em>baatil</em> (falsehood) has become unclear to most muslims, especially since many of the innovators and deviant groups use clever ways to penetrate the hearts and minds of the people of the Sunnah, like labeling themselves with praiseworthy descriptions such as <em>salaf</em>i, <em>athari</em> and <em>ahl-hadeeth</em> etc., when they are the furthest from the methodology of the <em>salaf-us-saalih (righteous predecessors)</em>. <em>Alhamdulillah</em> we have the people of knowledge, who have not been deceived by these tactics but have the insight into the tell tale signs of the people of innovation. With the aid of our scholars, who equip us with the necessary tools to recognize these people, we can steer clear of their misguidance and be on guard against their infiltration amongst our ranks. The noble <em>Shaykh Khalid ibn Dhawi adh-Dhufayree</em> (May Allaah preserve him) elaborated on several of their characteristics and exposed some of their deceptive ways. The <em>Shaykh</em> detailed some of the major signs of the people of innovation, as their signs are plenty, with a focus on the more apparent groups and personalities from amongst the people of innovation, like the <em>khawarij</em> and their spokesmen in our recent times <em>&#8216;Abdullaah Azaam</em> and <em>Sayid Qutb</em>. May<strong>Allaah, Al-Haqq </strong>show us the truth and make it easy for us to follow it and show us the falsehood and make it easy for us to distance ourselves from it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Shaykh</em> commenced his lecture by stating, the fact that the Prophet <em>(sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) </em>frequently warned against <em>bid’ah</em> (innovation in the religion) in all of his sermons is indicative of the extreme danger of innovation, which is from the reasons of annihilation and destruction. The Messenger <em>(sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em> was keen on ensuring the guidance of his <em>ummah</em> and from the care he had for his nation is that he never left a single door that leads to goodness except that he encouraged going to it and never left a door of evil except that he warned us form going towards it. <span style="color:#993300;">From the greatest of those evils that have become widespread in this ummah and have caused great confusion to many people are <em>bid’ah</em> (innovation in the religion) and <em>ahwaa</em> (desires)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>(sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em> gave us foundational principles on how to deal with the people of innovation, desires, differing and sects with their various waves. Whether they are from the ancient sects that endured like the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>, <em>Mu’tazilah</em>, <em>Ash`aris</em> and other than them; or likewise, the modern day groups like the <em>Ikhwaanis</em>, <em>Tableeghis</em>, <em>Takfirees</em> and <em>Qutbis</em>; all of them are innovated sects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh adh-Dhufayree (hafidhahullaah)</em> then went on to mention some ahadeeth where the Prophet<em>(sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em> warned against <em>bid’ah</em>; and he has shown us the way to escape and survive innovations, which is to beware of them, warn against them, avoid them and their people and to refrain from mingling with the people of innovation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">So boycotting <em>ahlul bid’ah</em> is from the greatest foundations in the religion that will continue to preserve the deen of a Muslim and protect him from the evil of the people of innovation and misguidance. This principle has been clarified in the Book of <strong>Allaah</strong>, and the <em>Salaf</em> were keen on establishing it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our <em>Shaykh</em> then proceeded to narrate a wealth of <em>athaar</em> (narrations) from the <em>Salaf</em> concerning intermingling with <em>ahlul bid’ah wal ahwaa</em>. He said that the people of <em>bid’ah</em> actually scheme and plot against <em>Ahlus Sunnah</em>, so they enter into our ranks with the intention of misguiding us and begin by talking about the <em>Sunnah</em> then gradually introduce their innovation. So it behoves a man of the <em>Sunnah</em>, a <em>Salafi</em> to be intelligent and insightful in recognizing these approaches by the people of innovation and desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continued by stating that there is consensus of the <em>Salaf</em>, in all ages of the <em>ummah</em>, about boycotting and warning against ahlul <em>bid’ah</em><em>wal ahwaa</em> due to the eminent danger in mingling with them. Furthermore, <em>Shaykh adh-Dhufayree (hafidhahullaah)</em> clarified that our <em>Salaf</em> did not only warn against innovations but the innovators as well because surely innovations do not spread on their own; they need marketers. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So if the innovators are warned against, boycotted and refuted, the innovations that they carry will surely weaken and die</strong></span>.<strong><span style="color:#000000;"> However, in our times a people have emerged with a misguided and false principle, which maintains that you can warn against the innovation but not the innovator which is in total opposition to the <em>Sunnah</em> of the Messenger <em>(sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em> and the consensus of the Salaf.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our <em>Shaykh</em> went on to quote the statements <em>Ahlul ‘Ilm</em> concerning sitting with and keeping the company of the people of innovation and earnestly advised us to flee from them. He continued that one should fear misguidance for himself, so it is obligatory to be as distant from the people of innovation as possible and we must beware of them, warn against them and not praise them. And from the greatest ways of remaining firm is to turn to <strong>Allaah</strong>, asking Him for steadfastness upon the deen and to leave off intermingling with <em>ahlul bid’ah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In clarifying this pertinent issue of the perils of intermingling with the people of innovation, <em>Shaykh Khalid adh-Dhufayree (hafidhahullaah)</em> went into much detail by abundantly quoting our <em>Salaf</em> regarding this topic. A must listen for the seeker of Truth.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The People of Innovation are of Two Types</span><a href="http://ittibaa.com/5/post/2013/01/the-people-of-innovation-are-of-two-types.html" rel="nofollow"><br />
</a>Shaykh Saalih ibn Sa`d as-Suhaymee</strong> (hafidhahullaah)</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>Shaykh <span style="text-decoration:underline;">S</span>aali<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span> ibn Sa`d as-Su<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>aymee <em>hafi<span style="text-decoration:underline;">z</span>ahullaah </em>in  his taped explanation of <strong>Sharhus-Sunnah</strong> with regard to the point that the people who depart from the Truth are one of two people, said,“Yes, this is a precise categorisation from the Shaykh, <em>ra<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>imahullaah</em>.  The innovators are indeed of two categories, because the Shaykh, as you know, throughout his whole book, his focus is upon the innovators.</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>And from them there is a <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>category who actually want the Truth, but he does not attain it</strong></span>.  Just like the people of <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">t</span></em><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span></em><em>ikr</em><em> </em>who we mentioned a short while ago (the same incident of those people in the masjid who were doing an innovated form of <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">th</span></em><em>ikr </em>which `Abdullaah ibn Mas`ood criticised)<em>.  </em>Those who said to Ibn Mas`ood,<em> ra</em><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">d</span></em><em>i</em><em>y</em><em>Allaahu’an</em><em>h</em>, ‘We only intend the Truth.’ However, how many people there are who intend the Truth, but do not attain it.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Whoever intends the Truth, he should seek it from its correct place.  And the Truth does not come about through venerating individuals, nor through flashy words, nor by having a majority.  It only comes about through <em>ittibaa</em><em>`</em>, following the Truth, following the first generations, the generations of the Companions and the <em>Taabi`een</em> and proceeding upon their methodology.  So the like of this person (the first person, he strays into innovation but he only intends the Truth) is destroyed if he does not come back and seek the Truth with its proof from the correct place.</p>
<p>However his danger is less than the danger of the second category of the people.  And perhaps his harm will be restricted to himself, meaning the one who intends the Truth but he seeks it not in the correct way.  So he slips and innovates and falls into innovation, and the judgement upon him will be in the light of how severe his innovations are.   It may be of the level of something less or it may be something major or it may be something which takes him out of Islaam, but his danger will be less.</p>
<p>And your advising him should be between you and him, if you know that he is not a caller to innovation and that he does not propagate innovation.  Then you should come to him privately and you make clear to him the correct path, so that he can follow it.  You make clear to him the methodology of the <em>Ahlus</em><em>&#8211;</em><em>Sunnah wal</em><em>&#8211;</em><em>Jamaa</em><em>`</em><em>ah</em>.  You don’t make his affair open.  You don’t mention him upon the <em>mi</em><em>n</em><em>bar</em>s.  You don’t mention him as being a person with criticism.  Rather you direct him and give him sincere advice.</p>
<p>So if this type of person is how he is, then maybe be one day, by the permission of Allaah, he will turn back.  And even if he stays upon his innovation, then he does not represent a great danger to the people (he doesn’t call to this innovation).  However what is obligatory is that you strive to give him advice and clarify and give him correct, constructive direction.</p></blockquote>
<p>“As for the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>second category of people, those who are obstinate, those who do so deliberately with pride, they commit innovation, obstinately, deliberately</strong></span>.   The more you forbid him, the more he increases in his error until he becomes a caller to innovation.  Therefore the <em>Salaf </em>used to reject the narrations of an innovator, who was a caller to innovation and not accept them, rather they would reject them and warn against him and against his innovation.  So the like of this person, you must make his affair clear and warn against him.  And if he has written a book, he is refuted with a book.  If he has a tape, he is refuted with a tape.  If he gives speeches, he is refuted in speeches.  The people are warned against his evil. ”</p>
<p>Then after some speech the Shaykh said finishing, “<span style="color:#993300;">So this second type, who is indicated by the author here, he is the most dangerous of people for this nation.  Therefore it is obligatory to warn the people against him and to draw attention to their evil and to warn the nation against their evil.</span> ”<em> </em></p>

<p id="eow-description" style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Sālih bin Fawzān al-Fawzān</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8230;calling to the sword, meaning [calling] to fitnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the fighting that came about between the Muslims, the splitting of their unity, it only came about due to the people of desires &#8212; from Mu&#8217;tazilah and Khawārij and other than them, the people of desires. They are the ones that caused fitnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Mu&#8217;tazilah, Khawārij, Rawāfid</strong>, and other than them. The trials and tribulations did not come except from them. It was not caused except by them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who killed &#8216;<strong>Uthmān</strong>, may Allah be pleased with him? Who killed <strong>Alī Bin Abī Tālib</strong>, may Allah be pleased with him? Who ignited the fitnah between the Muslims after that other than the people of desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who incited <strong>Al-Ma&#8217;mûn</strong> and those who came after him to subject Ahl-Sunnah to trials? To the point that they pulled their (Ahl-Sunnah&#8217;s) Imām, Ahmad Bin Hanbal, may Allah have mercy on him, and they beat him and imprisoned him. [Who] other than the people of desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who imprisoned <strong>Shaykh Al-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah</strong>, to the point that he died in prison, may Allah have mercy on him. [Who] except the people of desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we must be careful from them, because in the end, their evil leads to the tearing of the unity of the Muslims and [leads] to revolting against the Muslim ruler and to the separation of the community of Muslims, so that they become sects and factions instead of being one Ummah. Na&#8217;am&#8221;</p>

by Shaikh Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhab al-Wasabi (may Allah preserve him).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>TRANSLATION OF THE TEXT IN AL-QAWL-UL-MUFEED FEE ADILLATIT TAWHEED:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Du’aah Ilaa Bid’atihim (Caller to the innovation).</li>
<li>Ghayr Du’aah Ilayhaa (Those who do not call to it).</li>
</ol>
<p>See Hadee as-Saaree of al-Haafidh Ibn Hajar (rahimahullaah) page 385.</p>
<p><strong>EXPLANATION OF THE TEXT BY SHAYKH AHMED AL-WASAABEE (HAFIDHAHULLAAH):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ahmed mentioned that the majority of the scholars are upon this division of the people of innovation:</p>
<ol>
<li>those who call to their innovation and</li>
<li>those who do not call to their innovation.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is mandatory upon us that we take caution from both categories. And the first category of people are more hazardous to the general people than the second category. And even the second category, those who do not call to their innovation, then caution must still be taken from them, for verily a person can be fooled by a particular persons’ statements and actions, because even though he may not be calling to his innovation directly and explicitly, but his actions and deeds are calling to his innovation, and this is very harmful to the slaves of Allaah, and they must take caution from this. And from the way of the Salaf was that they used to have complete caution from all types of people of innovation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">From Sa’eed ibn ‘Aamir who said: “I heard Ismaa’eel [i.e. Ibn Khaarijah] narrate, saying: ‘Two men from the people of the innovated sects came to Muhammad Ibn Seereen and said: “O Aboo Bakr we want to narrate something to you.” He said: “No.” They said: “Then may we recite an Aayah from Allaah’s book to you?” He said: “No, not even half of an Aayah!” He said: “Either you two get up and leave or I will get up.” So the two men stood up and left. So one of the people said: “What harm would it do to you for him to recite an Aayah?” He said: “I hated that he should recite an Aayah and that they would distort it and then it would enter my heart.”</span> [Reported in Sharh Usool I’tiqaad Ahlis-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah of Imaam al-Laalikaa’ee, no. 242.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Shaykh Ahmed mentioned that Ibn Seereen (rahimahullaah) was scared that something might fall into his heart from the beautiful words of that person of innovation, even though he was not calling to his innovation. So the way of the Salaf is that the people of innovation, the Ahlul-Bid’ah, are not to be sat with, and they are not to be listened to, and Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa) has made Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah in sufficiency, and there is no need for the people of innovation, whether they are calling to their innovation or are not calling to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the people are those who say concerning the people of innovation that we take from them [i.e. the Ahlul-Bid’ah] that which is good, and we leave off the evil that is with them. And Shaykh Ahmed (hafidhahullaah) mentioned that this is a false statement, and it is an incorrect statement. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And what is correct is that we do not take from the people of innovation in entirety</strong></span>. And there are great dangers in this [i.e. this false statement that we take the good and leave the bad], and the Shaykh mentioned a story that one of the early Salaf wanted to marry a woman who was known to be from a sect of the Khawaarij. And he hoped that by marrying her he might win her over to the Sunnah, but when he did marry her, it turned out that in fact she had pulled him to the beliefs of the Khawaarij.</p>
