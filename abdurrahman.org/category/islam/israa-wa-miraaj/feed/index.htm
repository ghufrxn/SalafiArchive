<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Night Journey and the Ascent through the Heavens</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وبعد العشر عرج به إلى السماء ، وفرضت عليه الصلوات الخمس ، وصلى في مكة ثلاث سنين</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">After the ten years, he was taken up through the heavens and the five daily prayers were made obligatory upon him and he prayed in Makkah for three years. </span></strong><sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">61</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">61</span>] : <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying «<strong>After the ten years, he was taken up through the heavens</strong>» He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> remained for ten years upon this &#8211; forbidding <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> and calling to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, laying down this foundation. Then, in the eleventh year, he was taken by night from <em>Masjid al-<u>H</u>araam</em> (the Sacred Mosque) to <em>Masjid al-Aqsaa</em> (the farthest mosque, i.e. the mosque in Jerusalem).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي أَسْرَىٰ بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلًا مِّنَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ إِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ الْأَقْصَى</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Perfect and Exalted is He who took His slave on a journey by night from the Sacred Mosque to the farthest mosque</strong></span>.» [17:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whilst he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> was sleeping in the house of Umm Haani, Jibreel <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> came to him and had with him an animal called <em>al-Buraaq</em>, which was smaller than a mule and larger than a donkey. Its steps were as far apart as the distance which it could see. So, he <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> was caused to ride upon it and he was taken to Jerusalem at night.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(أسرى) is from (السرى) which means: &#8216;to travel by night.&#8217; This was something special to him <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and from the miracles given to him <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em>. So there, he met the prophets in Jerusalem, then he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> was taken up through the Heavens. Meaning: he was raised up from Jerusalem to the heavens in the company of Jibreel &#8211; and the meaning of (العروج) is &#8216;to ascend.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, he was taken on a night journey from Makkah to Jerusalem and he was taken up from Jerusalem to the heavens &#8211; meaning: Jibreel <em>`alaihissalaam</em> took him up and he passed by the inhabitants of the heavens. At each level, Jibreel requested that it should be opened for him until he came to the seventh heaven.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, he ascended over the heavens to the farthest lote tree and there Allaah spoke to him with whatever He wished from His revelation and He made obligatory upon him the five daily prayers. So, He obligated for each day and night fifty prayers. However, Moosaa <em>`alaihissalaam</em> advised our Prophet Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> to ask his Lord for a reduction, for his nation would not be able to bear fifty prayers in each day and night. So, Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> kept going back to his Lord asking for a reduction until they came to be five.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, said, as occurs in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of the <em>Israa.</em> and the <em>Mi`raaj</em>:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">»أمضيت فريضتي ، وخففت عن عبادي ، وأجزي الحسنة عشرا«</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>I have established My obligatory duty and I have made it easy upon My servants, and I will reward a good deed ten times over</strong></span>.»<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the narration of Anas from Aboo <u>Dh</u>arr, He said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">»هي خمس وهي خمسون«</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They are five and they are fifty</strong></span>.»<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: They are five with regards to the action and fifty in the balance (of good deeds).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Five prayers in each day and night are equal to fifty prayers upon the balance, because a good deed is rewarded with ten times its like. So a single prayer takes the place of ten prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Night Journey is mentioned at the beginning of <em>Soorah Sub<u>h</u>aan</em> (the 17<sup>th</sup> <em>soorah</em>) [also known as] <em>Soorah</em> <em>Banee Israa.eel</em>; and the <em>Mi`raaj</em> is mentioned at the beginning of <em>Sooratu-Najm</em>:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَقَدْ رَآهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَىٰ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">عِندَ سِدْرَةِ الْمُنتَهَىٰ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">عِندَهَا جَنَّةُ الْمَأْوَىٰ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَىٰ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">مَا زَاغَ الْبَصَرُ وَمَا طَغَىٰ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">لَقَدْ رَأَىٰ مِنْ آيَاتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And he saw Jibreel on another occasion. By the farthest lote tree. Near it is the Garden of Refuge. When the lote tree was covered by that which covered it! His </strong>(<em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em>) <strong>sight did not deviate to the right or left nor did it go beyond that with which he was commanded. He certainly saw tremendous signs of his Lord</strong>.</span>» [53:13-18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was with regard to the <em>Mi`raaj</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He descended from the heaven to Jerusalem, then he returned to Makkah in the same night. So, in the morning he informed the people about that. The believers increased in <em>eemaan</em>, but as for the disbelievers, then their evil increased and they became happy at this and went about broadcasting it: &#8220;How can your companion claim that he went to Jerusalem and came back in a single night when we have to exert ourselves upon camels to reach it, taking a whole month to go there and a month to come back?!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, they made analogy between the ability of the Creator and the ability of the creation, for the <em>Israa.</em> and the <em>Mi`raaj</em> were a test from Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, for the people. The people of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> increased in mockery and their evil and their belittlement of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> whereas the believers increased in <em>eemaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore when the people of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> said to Aboo Bakr a<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>iddeeq <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu`anhu</em>: &#8220;Look at your companion &#8211; what he is saying!&#8221; He said: &#8220;What is he saying?&#8221; They said: &#8220;He is claiming that he went to Jerusalem (and that he was taken up through the heavens) and that he came back in a single night!&#8221; Aboo Bakr a<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>iddeeq said: &#8220;If he said it, then it is just as he said. He has spoken the truth.&#8221; They said: &#8220;How can that be?&#8221; He said: &#8220;I attest to the truth of what he says with regard to something greater than that. I attest to the truth with regard to the news coming down from the heavens upon him. So, how should I not attest to the truth of what he says with regard to his being taken at night to Jerusalem?&#8221;<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This [night journey and ascension] came about through the ability of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, not through the ability of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>. It was only through the ability of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. This was one of the miracles given to the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and is a case of Allaah showing his honorable status with his Lord, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It must be held as a person&#8217;s creed and belief that he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> was taken on the Night Journey and taken up through the Heavens with his soul and his body together whilst awake and not as a dream;, because some people say: &#8220;He was taken on the Night Journey with his soul, and as for his body, then it did not go outside Makkah. And he was only taken on the Night Journey and taken up through the heavens with his soul.&#8221; This is false and futile speech. Rather he was taken on the Night Journey with his soul and his body <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> and he was carried upon <em>al-Buraaq</em>. And this was in a state of being awake, not asleep, since if it had happened with his soul only or if it had been a dream, then what would have been the difference between it and (other) dreams?.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whereas Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي أَسْرَىٰ بِعَبْدِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Perfect and Exalted is He who took His <em>`abd</em> on a journey by night</strong></span>.» [17:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>`abd</em> is used to apply to the soul and the body together. It is not used for just the soul alone that it be described as <em>`abd</em>, nor is it applied to the body alone that is an <em>`abd</em>. It is not used except to apply to the soul and the body combined, for He did not say: &#8220;Perfect and Exalted is He who took the soul of His <em>`abd</em>.&#8221; Rather He said: «&#8230;<strong>took His <em>`abd</em> on a journey by night</strong>.» The <em>`abd</em> is the combination of the soul and the body. And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, is not rendered incapable by anything and He is the One who has full power over everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) said: «<strong>And the five daily prayers were made obligatory upon him and he prayed in Makkah for three years</strong>» He used to pray them as two <em>rak`ahs</em>. When the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> migrated, the four <em>rak`ah</em> prayers were completed and became four <em>rak`ahs</em> – except for <em>Fajr</em> prayer, for in that he lengthened the recitation so it remained as two <em>rak`ahs</em> just as it was, and except for the <em>ma<u>gh</u>rib</em> prayer, for indeed it is three from the first period when it was made obligatory, because it is the <em>witr</em> (prayer with the odd number of <em>rak`ahs</em>) of the daytime. As for the <em><u>Dh</u>uhr</em>, <em>`Asr</em> and the <em>`Ishaa</em> prayers, then in Makkah they were two <em>rak`ahs</em> each but when the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> made <em>Hijrah</em>, they were made complete as four <em>rak`ahs</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As occurs in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">»أول ما فرضت الصلاة ركعتين فلما هاجر النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم   أتمت صلاة الحضر وبقيت صلاة السفر«</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>The prayer was first made obligatory as two <em>rak`ahs, </em>then when the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> made <em>Hijrah</em>, the prayer for the resident was completed and the prayer of the traveler remained as it was</strong>.»<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is by consensus of the people of knowledge, that the prayer was obligatory in Makkah and that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> prayed it in Makkah. However, they differ about whether it was made obligatory three years before the <em>Hijrah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what is more correct, just as the <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> mentioned here. Or it is otherwise said that it was made obligatory five years before the <em>Hijrah</em>, or it is said one year before the <em>Hijrah</em>, or it is said a year and a half. However the most correct saying is what the <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> mentioned is that it was three years before the <em>Hijrah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And was anything else from the pillars of Islaam made obligatory along with the prayer? This is an area of disagreement amongst the scholars; some of them held that the <em>Zakaat</em> was also made obligatory in Makkah, and that only its applicable limits, its amounts and those eligible to receive it were made clear in al-Madeenah. But as for the origin of its being made obligatory, then that was in Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> وَآتُوا حَقَّهُ يَوْمَ حَصَادِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And give the right due from the crops on the day when it is harvested</strong>.</span>» [6:141]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of the «<strong>due</strong>» here is the <em>Zakaat</em>. And the whole <em>soorah</em> came down in Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise in His statement:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَالَّذِينَ فِي أَمْوَالِهِمْ حَقٌّ مَّعْلُومٌ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">لِّلسَّائِلِ وَالْمَحْرُومِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And those whose wealth has a known portion for the beggar who asks and for the deprived</strong>.</span>» [70:24-25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>soorah</em> also came down in Makkah. And what is meant by the «<strong>known portion</strong>» is the <em>Zakaat</em>. So, it was in origin made obligatory in Makkah, however, its details were made clear in al-Madeenah. This is one saying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second saying: what is apparent from the speech of the <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> here, is that the <em>Zakaat</em> was only made obligatory in al-Madeenah and nothing was made obligatory in Makkah, except for the first pillar which is <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and the second pillar which is the prayer. This is what is apparent from the speech of the <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Volume 5, Book 58, Number 227:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abbas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Malik bin Sasaa said that Allah’s Apostle described to them his Night Journey saying, “While I was lying in Al-Hatim or Al-Hijr, suddenly someone came to me and cut my body open from here to here.” I asked Al-Jarud who was by my side, “What does he mean?” He said, “It means from his throat to his pubic area,” or said, “From the top of the chest.” The Prophet further said, “He then took out my heart. Then a gold tray of Belief was brought to me and my heart was washed and was filled (with Belief) and then returned to its original place. Then a white animal which was smaller than a mule and bigger than a donkey was brought to me.” (On this Al-Jarud asked, “Was it the Buraq, O Abu Hamza?” I (i.e. Anas) replied in the affirmative). The Prophet said, “The animal’s step (was so wide that it) reached the farthest point within the reach of the animal’s sight. I was carried on it, and Gabriel set out with me till we reached the nearest heaven.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he asked for the gate to be opened, it was asked, ‘Who is it?’ Gabriel answered, ‘Gabriel.’ It was asked, ‘Who is accompanying you?’ Gabriel replied, ‘Muhammad.’ It was asked, ‘Has Muhammad been called?’ Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said, ‘He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!’ The gate was opened, and when I went over the first heaven, I saw Adam there. Gabriel said (to me). ‘This is your father, Adam; pay him your greetings.’ So I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, ‘You are welcomed, O pious son and pious Prophet.’ Then Gabriel ascended with me till we reached the second heaven. Gabriel asked for the gate to be opened. It was asked, ‘Who is it?’ Gabriel answered, ‘Gabriel.’ It was asked, ‘Who is accompanying you?’ Gabriel replied, ‘Muhammad.’ It was asked, ‘Has he been called?’ Gabriel answered in the affirmative. Then it was said, ‘He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!’ The gate was opened.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I went over the second heaven, there I saw Yahya (i.e. John) and ‘Isa (i.e. Jesus) who were cousins of each other. Gabriel said (to me), ‘These are John and Jesus; pay them your greetings.’ So I greeted them and both of them returned my greetings to me and said, ‘You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.’ Then Gabriel ascended with me to the third heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, ‘Who is it?’ Gabriel replied, ‘Gabriel.’ It was asked, ‘Who is accompanying you?’ Gabriel replied, ‘Muhammad.’ It was asked, ‘Has he been called?’ Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said, ‘He is welcomed, what an excellent visit his is!’ The gate was opened, and when I went over the third heaven there I saw Joseph. Gabriel said (to me), ‘This is Joseph; pay him your greetings.’ So I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, ‘You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.’ Then Gabriel ascended with me to the fourth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, ‘Who is it?’ Gabriel replied, ‘Gabriel’ It was asked, ‘Who is accompanying you?’ Gabriel replied, ‘Muhammad.’ It was asked, ‘Has he been called?’ Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said, ‘He is welcomed, what an excel lent visit his is!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The gate was opened, and when I went over the fourth heaven, there I saw Idris. Gabriel said (to me), ‘This is Idris; pay him your greetings.’ So I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, ‘You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.’ Then Gabriel ascended with me to the fifth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, ‘Who is it?’ Gabriel replied, ‘Gabriel.’ It was asked. ‘Who is accompanying you?’ Gabriel replied, ‘Muhammad.’ It was asked, ‘Has he been called?’ Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said He is welcomed, what an excellent visit his is! So when I went over the fifth heaven, there I saw Harun (i.e. Aaron), Gabriel said, (to me). This is Aaron; pay him your greetings.’ I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, ‘You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.’ Then Gabriel ascended with me to the sixth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked. ‘Who is it?’ Gabriel replied, ‘Gabriel.’ It was asked, ‘Who is accompanying you?’ Gabriel replied, ‘Muhammad.’ It was asked, ‘Has he been called?’ Gabriel replied in the affirmative. It was said, ‘He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I went (over the sixth heaven), there I saw Moses. Gabriel said (to me),’ This is Moses; pay him your greeting. So I greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said, ‘You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.’ When I left him (i.e. Moses) he wept. Someone asked him, ‘What makes you weep?’ Moses said, ‘I weep because after me there has been sent (as Prophet) a young man whose followers will enter Paradise in greater numbers than my followers.’ Then Gabriel ascended with me to the seventh heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, ‘Who is it?’ Gabriel replied, ‘Gabriel.’ It was asked,’ Who is accompanying you?’ Gabriel replied, ‘Muhammad.’ It was asked, ‘Has he been called?’ Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said, ‘He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when I went (over the seventh heaven), there I saw Abraham. Gabriel said (to me), ‘This is your father; pay your greetings to him.’ So I greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said, ‘You are welcomed, O pious son and pious Prophet.’ Then I was made to ascend to Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (i.e. the Lote Tree of the utmost boundary) Behold! Its fruits were like the jars of Hajr (i.e. a place near Medina) and its leaves were as big as the ears of elephants. Gabriel said, ‘This is the Lote Tree of the utmost boundary) . Behold ! There ran four rivers, two were hidden and two were visible, I asked, ‘What are these two kinds of rivers, O Gabriel?’ He replied,’ As for the hidden rivers, they are two rivers in Paradise and the visible rivers are the Nile and the Euphrates.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Al-Bait-ul-Ma’mur (i.e. the Sacred House) was shown to me and a container full of wine and another full of milk and a third full of honey were brought to me. I took the milk. Gabriel remarked, ‘This is the Islamic religion which you and your followers are following.’ Then the prayers were enjoined on me: They were fifty prayers a day. When I returned, I passed by Moses who asked (me), ‘What have you been ordered to do?’ I replied, ‘I have been ordered to offer fifty prayers a day.’ Moses said, ‘Your followers cannot bear fifty prayers a day, and by Allah, I have tested people before you, and I have tried my level best with Bani Israel (in vain). Go back to your Lord and ask for reduction to lessen your followers’ burden.’ So I went back, and Allah reduced ten prayers for me. Then again I came to Moses, but he repeated the same as he had said before. Then again I went back to Allah and He reduced ten more prayers. When I came back to Moses he said the same, I went back to Allah and He ordered me to observe ten prayers a day. When I came back to Moses, he repeated the same advice, so I went back to Allah and was ordered to observe five prayers a day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I came back to Moses, he said, ‘What have you been ordered?’ I replied, ‘I have been ordered to observe five prayers a day.’ He said, ‘Your followers cannot bear five prayers a day, and no doubt, I have got an experience of the people before you, and I have tried my level best with Bani Israel, so go back to your Lord and ask for reduction to lessen your follower’s burden.’ I said, ‘I have requested so much of my Lord that I feel ashamed, but I am satisfied now and surrender to Allah’s Order.’ When I left, I heard a voice saying, ‘I have passed My Order and have lessened the burden of My Worshipers.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Lesson 20 &#8211; Explained by Dawud Burbank rahimahullaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[78]<span style="color:#008000;"> And the Mi`raaj (the ascent through the Heavens) is true; and the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa `alaa aalihi wa sallam, was taken on a Night-Journey</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[79] <span style="color:#008000;">And he was taken bodily, whilst awake, up to the Heavens.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[80] <span style="color:#008000;">Then, to whatever higher places Allaah wished. And Allaah bestowed honour upon him with whatever He wished.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[81] <span style="color:#008000;">And He revealed to him what He revealed to him, {And the heart did not lie about what it saw.}</span> (Sooratun-Najm (53) aayah 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[82] <span style="color:#008000;">So may Allaah extol him and grant him peace and security in the Hereafter and in this life.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> The First Point: </strong></span></p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">No authentic proof has been related affirming the specific date of al-Israa&#8217; wal-Mi&#8217;raaj.</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Al-Imaam Ibn Taymiyyah stated, as in &#8220;Zaad al Ma&#8217;ad,&#8221; 58/1: &#8220;No known proof has been established. Neither concerning its month, which part of the month it was in nor its specific date. Rather, what has been narrated related to all of this has been narrated with conflicting narrations and with discontinuous chains of narrations and thus none of them can be affirmed with surety.</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">● Ash-Shareef Ibn al-Ameer as-San&#8217;aanee said in &#8220;At-Tanweer&#8221;, 7710: &#8220;It is a specific night yet nothing from the authentic Sunnah has been narrated specifying when exactly it is.&#8221;</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> The Second Point: </strong></span></p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">The scholars have differed concerning the time of its occurance and there are numerous opinions regarding this.</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">It is said that it is in Rajab. It is said that it is in Rabee al-Awwal, just as it is said it is in Rabee ath-Thaani.</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">It is also said that it is in Ramadhaan and it is said that it is in Shawwal. Also, it is said that it is in Dhil Qa&#8217;dah.</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Some of them say it was in the begining of the month, others say the middle and others say the later part of the month.</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Many of the scholars have pointed out these conflicting views:</p>
<ul>
<li style="color:#444444;"><span style="color:#444444;">From the Hanafis: al-Mulla &#8216;Ali Qaaree and Abu al-Fadhl al-Aloosee</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#444444;">From the Maalikis: Ibn &#8216;Abdil Barr and Abu &#8216;Abdillah al-Qurtubee</span></li>
<li>From the Shaafi&#8217;ees: an-Nawawee, Ibn Katheer and Ibn Hajr al-Asqalaanee</li>
<li>From the Hanbalis: Ibn al-Jawzee and al-&#8216;Uthaymeen.</li>
</ul>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Third Point: </strong></span></p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">The weakest position with regards to specifying (when it took place) is the position which posits that it was in the month of Rajab.</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Abu al-Khattaab Ibn Dahiyah al-Maaliki stated in &#8220;Adaa mal Wajab min Bayyan Wadh&#8217;i al Waadh&#8217;iyoon fi Rajab,&#8221; pg. 110: &#8220;Some of the storytellers mention that al-Israa&#8217; was in Rajab and according to the people of Praise and Criticism (Scholars of Hadeeth) this is without a doubt a lie.&#8221;</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Also, Ibn al-&#8216;Attar ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee mentioned in &#8220;Hukm Sawm Rajab wa Sha&#8217;baan wa Maa Ahdatha Feehima&#8221;, pg.34: &#8220;From those who considered the hadeeth of al-Israa&#8217; and al-Mi&#8217;raaj happening on the 27th to be weak include:</p>
<ul>
<li style="color:#444444;"><span style="color:#444444;">From the Maalikis: Abu al-Khattaab al-Kalbee</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#444444;">From the Shaafi&#8217;ees: Ibn al-&#8216;Attar, Ibn Katheer and Ibn Hajr al-Asqalaanee</span></li>
<li>From the Hanbalis: Ibn Taymiyyah, Ibn Rajab, Ibn Baaz and al-&#8216;Uthaymeen.</li>
</ul>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fourth Point:</strong></span></p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Celebrating the rememberance of al-Israa&#8217; and al-Mi&#8217;raaj has not been narrated from the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم, nor his Companions, nor the Taabi&#8217;een, nor the Taabi&#8217; at-Taabi&#8217;een, nor was it an action of the Imaams of the well known madhaahib: Abu Haneefah, Maalik, ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee or Ahmad.</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">The previously mentioned individuals are the example for the individual who does not celebrate al-Israa&#8217; wal-Mi&#8217;raaj.</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">However, concerning the one who celebrates it, who is his example in doing such?</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Without a doubt, his example is the Raafidhah Shi&#8217;a and those who follow them from the extremist Sufis!</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifth Point: </strong></span></p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Whoever has the zeal and vigor to do good deeds and to increase in doing such, then let him ask himself:</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">&#8220;How many actions of obedience have clearly come in the Qur&#8217;aan and authentic Sunnah and I do not do them, nor do I exert myself in trying to do so?</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Verily, it is shameful that I fall short and am lazy in those acts of worship which have come in the Qur&#8217;aan and authentic Sunnah, yet I exert myself in that which has neither come in the Qur&#8217;aan or authentic Sunnah, nor did the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم or his Companions who came after him do so!&#8221;</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"><em>Summarized from the book &#8220;At-Tadhkeer al-Baahith bi Annhu Laa Yasihu fi Tahdeed Taareekh Haaditha al-Israa&#8217; wal-Mi&#8217;raaj Athar wa Laa Hadeeth&#8221; by Shaykh &#8216;Abdul Qaadir al-Junayd.  </em><em>Translated by Abu Afnaan Muhammad &#8216;Abdullah</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AsSalam Alaikum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakaatuhu</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><strong>Source</strong>: The Islamic View Point on Celebrations Mawlid, The Night of Isra and Miraj , Mid Shaban Night &#8211; by <strong>Shaykh Ibn Baaz</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The night wherein the event of Isra’ and Mi’raj occurred had not been particularized in the authentic Hadith. All that was in this concern, according to the scholars of Hadith, has not been asserted as valid by the Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Such is the extensive judiciousness of the Almighty Allaah that He made people forget it. Even if its particularization had been asserted, Muslims should have not favoured it with any devotional services whatsoever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are not permitted to celebrate its anniversary, since the Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and his companions –May Allaah be pleased with them- never did it. Neither did they favour it with certain acts of devotion. Should such celebration of the Night be a licit matter, the Apostle (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), would have expounded it to the nation, either by word or by deed. And if such a thing had occurred, it would have been known and become common, and the companions-may Allaah be pleased with them- would have transmitted it to us. They, in fact, passed on from their Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), everything Muslims are in need of. Never were they remiss with regard to religion, nay, they were outstrippers to every good. Should celebration of this anniversary Night were licit, they would have been the first to do it. The Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), is most sincere in guiding people. He most truly fulfilled his mission, and performed his noble duty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the glorification and celebration of that Night had something to do with Islam, the Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), would have never neglected it. Neither would he have concealed it. And since nothing of such a matter have ever occurred, it has become known that glorification and celebration of that Night has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with Islam, because the Almighty Allaah has perfected for this nation its religion, completed His favour upon it, and rebuked the innovators who introduce in religion that which Allaah had not allowed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Almighty-glory be to Him- says in the Quranic Chapter Al-Ma’ida: (This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed my favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion).[5:3]. Allaah –may He be exalted- also says in Chapter Al-Shura: (What! Have they partners [godhead], who have established for them some religion without the permission of Allaah? Had it not been for the Decree of Judgement, the matter would have been decided between them [at once]. But verily the wrongdoers will have a grievous Penalty). Warning against heresies, and declaring that they are errors by way of reminding the nation of their gruesome peril, and estranging people from committing them, have been established as valid in the authentic Hadith of the Apostle (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It has been asserted as valid, among other traditions, in both Sahih Muslim and Sahih Al-Bukhari, on the authority of A’isha –may Allah be pleased with her- that the Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), said: (If anyone introduces into this affair of ours anything which does not belong to it, it is rejected). In another version by Muslim, the Prophet said: (Whoever performs a deed inconsistent with our principles, it will be rejected). Muslim transmitted in his Sahih, on the authority of Jabir-may Allaah be pleased with him- that the Apostle (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), was always used to saying in his speech on Fridays: (and now to our topic; the best speech is that of the Quran, and the best guidance is that of Muhammad (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and the most wicked matter is that of heretic innovations and each heresy is an error). It is reported in the Sunan (precepts) on the authority of Al-‘irbad ibn Sariah-may Allaah be pleased with him-who said: the Apostle (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), gave us an eloquent exhortation that scared the hearts, and shed tears from the eyes. We said: O Apostle of Allah, it looks as if it were a farewell exhortation. Admonish us. He then said: “I enjoin you to fear Allah, and to hear and obey your commander even if he were a slave; for those of you who live after me will see great disagreement. You must therefore follow my Sunnah and that of the rightly guided Caliphs. Hold to it, and stick fast to it. Avoid novelties; for every novelty is an innovation, and every innovation is an error). The traditions to that effect are numerous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Caution and intimidation against heresies have been established as a matter of fact, on the authority of the companions of the Apostle (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and the pious ancestors thereafter. Such was the case only for its being an unnecessary addition to religion, a prescription of something novel without the permission of Allaah, and an imitation of the adversaries of Allaah, as did the Jews and the Christians with regard to making additions to their religion, and inventing what was beyond the permission of Allaah, since that act of theirs was attended by their being prejudicial to Islamic religion, and accusing it of lack of perfection. This matter is quite known to be rife with a great deal of gross corruption, ignominious file actions, contradiction with the saying of the Almighty Allaah: (<strong>This day I have perfected your religion for you…</strong>.), and an obvious contrast to the traditions of the Apostle (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), that caution against, and estrange from heresies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I hope that the aforementioned evidences are quite enough for the truth-seeker to reject this heresy, namely, that of celebrating the anniversary Night of ‘Isra’ and Mi’raj, and to caution against it, considering that it has absolutely nothing to do with Islam. In view of the fact that Allaah has enjoined the duty to give Muslims sincere advice, to elucidate the divine prescription for them, and to proscribe concealing of knowledge to them, I decided to call the attention of my Muslim brethren to this heresy which became so rife in a lot of countries that some people deemed it pertaining to religion</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>About Shaykh Ibn Baaz</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He held the position of Grand Muftee of Saudi Arabia, the Presidency of many Islaamic Committees and Councils, the prominent among these being: Senior Scholars Committee of the Kingdom, Permanent Committee for Islaamic Research and Fataawa, the Founding Committee of Muslim World League, World Supreme Council for Mosques, Islaamic Jurisprudence Assembly Makkah; and the member of the Supreme Council of the Islaamic University at al-Madeenah, and the Supreme Committee for Islaamic Propagation, until he passed away on Thursday 27 Muharram 1420 A.H./May 13 1999 C.E. May Allaah (Subhaanahu wa Ta&#8217;aala) have Mercy upon his soul, aameen.</p>
