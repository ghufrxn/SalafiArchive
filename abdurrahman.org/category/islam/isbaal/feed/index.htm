										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><em>[<strong>Isbaal</strong> is to wear garments that extend below the ankles]</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First Shubuha (Doubt):</strong> Isbaal is permitted as long as it is not done out of Makheelah. Some refer to the following hadeeth as an evidence:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Abdullah bin Umar رضي الله عنهم ا reported that: “I came to visit the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه و سلم and I was wearing an Izaar Yataqa’qa’ (clanking because of its trailing below the ankles) . He صلى الله عليه و سلم said: “Who is this?” I said: “Abdullah bin Umar”. He said: “If you are an Abd (i.e. a true slave) of Allaah, then pull up your Izaar”. I did. He then said: “more!”. (Ibn Umar) said: “I pulled it up until it reached the middle of shank; this was the (length) of his Izaar until he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) died”. He then looked towards Abee Bakr and said: “If anyone trails his garment arrogantly, Allaah will not look at him on the Day of Judgment”. Then Abu Bakr said: “My Izaar sometimes hangs low (in another narration he said: “one of the sides of my lower garment hangs low if I do not take care of it”)[99]. The Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلمsaid: “But you are not one of them (in another narration he said: You are not one of those who do so conceitedly)[100].] [101]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Discussion</strong>: The hadeeth supports the Tahreem of Isbaal rather than the opinion which permits the Isbaal as long as it is not done out of conceit. In fact the hadeeth clearly makes it obligatory on the Muslim not to let his Izaar hang lower than his ankles, and that he must tuck it up even though his intention was like that of Abu Bakr in the hadeeth i.e. not done out of conceit. In fact Abu Bakr said: “One side of my Izaar hangs low if I do not take care of it”. In our times, however, people let their Izaars hang low, unlike Abu Bakr, and then they claim: “Well we do not do it out of arrogance!”. Don’t they realize the commands of Allaah’s Messenger to tuck up the Izaar and that his Izaar was extending to the middle of his shanks? Don’t they know that He صلى الله عليه و سلم never thinks about Makheelah? Isn’t he our example?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also clear that Abu Bakr did not say that: “I made my Izaar trailing”. In fact he said in one narration: “Sometimes my Izaar hangs low”. So, its his Izaar that goes down when as he said: “I do not take care of it”. Its clear that when he takes care of it it stays above his ankles, but when it gets loose it hangs low. Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajer reported that Ibn Sa’dd reported a narration from the way of Talha bin Abdullaah bin Abdur-Rahmaan bin Abee Bakr, that ‘Aaaishah رضي الله عنها وعنهم said: “Abu Bakr was Ahnaa (had an inclination in his back), his Izaar could not hold on him, it used to get loose around his loins”. Al-Hafidh also reported a narration from the way of Qayess Ibn Abee Haazim who said: “I visited Abee Bakr and he was a thin person.” [102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who design garments, pants, etc. whose lower ends abide by the Sunnah, but when they wear them they get loose and sometimes trail below the ankles, resemble the case of Abu Bakr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم considered that Abu Bakr was not “one of those who hang their garments out of conceit”, because Abu Bakr did not intend to lower his Izaar below the ankles, and it only trailed when he did not take care of it. Those who intend to trail out of conceit are threatened with a grave punishment:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allaah will not look (on the Day of Resurrection)</strong>[103]<strong> at person who drags his Izaar (behind him) out of conceit</strong></span>.&#8221; [104]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allaah will not look at a person , on the Day of Judgemt, who drags his Izaar out of pride and arrogance</strong></span>.&#8221; [105]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, on the Day of Judgment, Allaah will not talk to or sanctify the Musbil. This is confirmed in the authentic hadeeth in which Abu Dharr reported the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم as saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“There are three (kinds) of persons to whom Allaah will neither speak on the Day of Judgment, nor will He look at them nor purify them, and they will have a painful Punishment. He (Abu Darr) said: “Allaah’s Messenger repeated it three times. Abu Dharr remarked: “They failed and they lost; who are these persons, O Messenger of Allaah? He صلى الله عليه و سلم replied: “<span style="color:#993300;">The one who wears a trailing robe (the Musbil), the one who takes account of what he gives, and the seller of goods by false oaths</span>.”</span></strong> [106]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Certainly Abu Bakr received a testimony from the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم that he did not lower his Izaar out of arrogance. Those who intentionally make Isbaal, when did they receive a purifying testimony?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another incident, Abdullah Ibn Umar passed by the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم and his Izaar was hanging low. He said describing this incident:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I happened to pass before Allaah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم with my garment hanging low. He said: Abdullah, tug up your lower garment. I tugged it up, and he again said: “Tug it still further”. I tugged it still further and I went on tugging it afterward, whereupon some of the people said: “To what extent?” Thereupon he said: “To the middle of the shanks.” [107]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم did not keep silent when he saw Abdullah bin Umar hanging low his Izaar. This shows that the prophibition of Isbaal for men is not restricted only to the case if it is done out of Makheelah. Abdullah bin Umar is one of the great Sahabah. Imagine what would the position of the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم be if he sees the clothes on many Du’aat (those who invite others to this Deen), or even “scholars” each trailing his Jubbah,[108] garment, or pants? <span style="color:#993300;">We know that Ibn Umar hastened to comply with the Prophet’s command. Now it takes hours, talks, lectures to convey the Prophet’s command and still you find people arguing that: “Well! As long as Isbaal is not done out of conceit then its OK!” Indeed it makes the clement person preplexed! To Allaah alone, is the complaint!</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">الإسبال Isbaal</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>What is Isbaal?</strong></span><br />
Isbaal is to wear garments that extend below the ankles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Is it Forbidden?</strong></span><br />
Yes, because the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The part of an <em>Izaar</em> (garment) which hangs below the ankles is in the Fire.&#8221; [73]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Some hold the opinion that <em>Isbaal</em> is forbidden when it is done out of pride, conceit or arrogance. Is this argument true?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer is: No, because:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>First</strong></span>: The threat to punish in Hell those who drag their garments bellow the ankles is clear [74].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Second</span></strong>: Several texts indicate that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) was commanding the people to pull up their garments. The majority of the Muslim Scholars (Al-Jumhoor) agree that when the text is in the imperative from, intended for <em>Tahreem</em> (forbidding something), unless there is another authentic evidence that indicates otherwise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[73] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, V.7, hadeeth # 678.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[74]The punishable part is that which violates the command of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) i.e below the ankles. Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajer is with the opinion that the obvious literal meaning of the hadeeth holds true i.e. the clothes together with the part below the ankles will be in Hell as it is the case in the saying of Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى):</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">“Certainly! You (disbelievers) and that which you are worhipping now besides Allaah, are (but) fuel for Hell!” (Qur’aan 21:98).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">See Fathul Baaree V. 10, hadeeth # 5789 (same as # 678 above), PP. 268-269, Published by Daar Ar-Rayyaan, Cairo, Egypt.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one incident, the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) sighted someone dragging his lower garment. He rushed to him and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Pull up your <em>Izaar</em> and fear Allaah”. The man said: “I am a an <em>Ahnaf</em> [75] person with trembling knees”. He (the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)) said: “Tuck up your <em>Izaar</em>! Certainly, all of Allaah’s creation of Allaah is good”. Since then the man was not seen except with his <em>Izaar</em> touching the middle of his shanks or up to the middle of his shanks [76].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is clear that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) did not question the man whether he was doing it out of pride or arrogance. In fact its clear that from the condition of the man that he did not even think about arrogance! Nevertheless the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) did not accept it his <em>Isbaal</em> and considered that <em>Isbaal</em> is incompatible with <em>At-Taqwa</em> (the fear of Allaah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Third</strong></span>: The generalized prohibition of <em>Isbaal</em> is clear in the saying of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). On one occasion he said to Sufyaan bin Sahl:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O Sufyaan bin Sahl! Do not lower your garment below your ankles because Allaah does not love the <em>Musbileen</em> (those who lower their lower garments below their ankles).”</strong> [77]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jaabir bin Saleem said that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) told him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;&#8230;And beware of the <em>Isbaal</em> of the <em>Izaar</em> because it is from Al-Makheelah (conceit, arrogance, etc.) and Allaah does not love it.”</strong> [78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One can notice the text (underlined) in the imperative from indicating the forbidding of Isbaal whether it is done out of Makheelah or not. Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajer in his commentary about some of the Ahaadeeth mentioned above said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The <em>Isbaal</em> mentioned in these <em>Ahadeeth</em> is a grave sin if it is done out of <em>Makheelah</em>, otherwise the apparent meaning of the <em>Ahadeeth</em> indicates that it is forbidden.” [79]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Fourth</strong></span>: The manifestation of the ِAayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">And whatsoever the messenger gives you take it, and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain from it.</span>” (Qur’aan 59:7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is known that the <em>Ath-Thawb</em> [80] of the most honorable of mankind, Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) was up to the middle of his shanks.” [81]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is confirmed in another hadeeth in which Uthmaan (رضي الله عنه) reported that the “<strong>The lower garment of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) extended to the middle of his shanks</strong>.” [82] Who else is more humble than him (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)? He knew that <em>Isbaal</em> necessitates <em>Al-Makheelah</em> even if the <em>Musbil</em> does not intend it. This is supported by the hadeeth of Jaabir bin Saleem in which the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) made it clear that <em>Isbaal</em> is a manifestation of arrogance:</p>

<span style="color:#999999;"> [82] Reported by At-Tirmithee in Ash-Shamaa’il Al-Muhammadiyyah and Al-Albaanee authenticated it # 98.</span></p>
<p>He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) commanded Jaabir bin Saleem saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And Tuck up your <em>Izaar</em> up to the middle of your shanks, and if you dislike it, then up to the ankles (i.e. up to a point above the ankles) and beware of <em>Isbaal</em> because it is arrogance.&#8221;</strong> [83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shouldn’t we, therefore, abide by the command of Allaah in the above ِAayah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Fifth</strong></span>: Isbaal by men is an immitation of women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) forbade that men dress like women and vice versa. He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah cursed the man dressed like a women and the women dressed like a man.” [84]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In fact Ibn Umar رضي االله عنهما said that: “the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The one who trails his <em>Thobe</em> out of conceit, Allaah will not look at him on the the Day of Judgment”.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ummu Salamah رضي االله عنها said: “What should the women, O Messenger of Allaah, do with the lower ends of their dresses?” He said: “They may let them hang down a span”. She said: “Still their feet will be uncovered”. He said: “Then let them hang the ends down a forearm’s length, not exceeding it.” [85]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Lowering the garments below the ankle is a the code of dress of women. Shaykh ul Islaam Ibn Taymmeyah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“&#8230;The imitation (of others) in the outward appearances produces a proportional assumption of the deeds and manners. That is why we are ordered to oppose the Kuffar&#8230; and that is also why men and women are prohibited from imitating each other in accordance with the Ahadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; من تشبه بقومٍ فهو منهم &#8221;<br />
<b>“Whoever takes the similitude of certain people becomes one of them”</b> [86]</p>

<span style="color:#999999;"> [86] An authentic hadeeth collected by Abee Dawood, Ahmad, and others. See As-Silsilah As-Saheehah V.1, 676</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man who imitates women acquires from their manners according to the extent of his imitation, such that it he may end up in complete effeminacy&#8230;The woman who imitates men assumes part of their manners until she attains levels of <em>Tabarruj</em> [87], <em>Burooz</em> [88] and <em>Mushaarakah</em> with men [89] driving some of them to show their bodies as men do, demanding superiority over men, and doing whatever contradicts the bashfulness of the woman&#8230;” [90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Ummar bin Al-Khattaab (رضي الله عنه) saw a man dragging his <em>Izaar</em>, he called upon him and said: “Are you having your menses?”. The man said: “O Ameer Al-Mu’mineen [91]! Does a man have menses?” Umar said: “What made you drag your <em>Izaar</em> over your feet?” He then ordered a blade, rapped (the lower ends of) the man’s <em>Izaar</em> and cut what trailed below the ankles&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Today we see that men are trailing their <em>Izaar</em> (<em>Thobe</em>, trousers, pants, etc.) like women while women wear clothes whose lower ends are way above the ankles! May Allaah guide our men and women to abide by the Commands of Allaah and His Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Sixth</strong></span>: Isbaal is extravagancy:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has set a measure for everything, including the clothes for men. If a Muslim exceeds the limits set by Sharee’ah then he becomes an extravagant. Allaah, Most Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And eat and drink but waste not by extravagance, certainly He (Allaah) likes not the extravagants.”</span> (Qur’aan 7: 31).</p>

<span style="color:#999999;"> [89] <em>Mushaarakah</em>, joining men in all walks of life.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [90] Sheikh ul Islam Ibn Taymmeyah in his book Al-Fatawa (Arabic), V. 22, P. 254.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [91] Ameer Al-Mu’mineen, the Commander of the Faithful. It is a title given to the Islamic Caliph. This incident was narrated by Kharshah bin Al-Hurr. The report is found in Waleed An-nasr’s book Al-isbaal Lighayer Al-Khuyalaa, p. 18, where he attributed it to At-Tabaree. It is reported in a summarized version by Ibn Abee Shaybah in his Mussannaf (V.8, p. 393) with a <em>Saheeh</em> <em>Isnaad</em>, as An-Nasr said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajer, may Allaah’s Mercy be upon him, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“If the <em>Thobe</em> (as well as all other garments) exceeds the appropriate size [92] of the one who wears it, then it would be prohibited based upon extravagance and that leads to <em>Tahreem</em>.” [93]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Seventh</strong></span>: <em>Isbaal</em> and impurities:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ubaid bin Khalid said: “I was walking trailing my <em>Burd</em> [94]. A man talked to him saying: “Pull up your <em>Thobe</em> because that (will keep it) more clean and will last longer”. I looked (to see who was talking to me) and he was the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). I said: “It is only a black and white-striped <em>Burdah</em> (outer garment)”. He said: “Don’t you have an example in me?” I said: “I looked (at him) and his <em>Izaar</em> was (extending) to the middle of his shanks.” [95]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullah Ibn Mas’oud narrated that: “A young man paid a visit to Umar (رضي الله عنه) (after he was stabbed by Abu Lu’lu’ah Al-Majoosee) and he started praising Umar (رضي الله عنه). (The narrator) said: “Umar saw the man trailing his Izaar”. He said to him: “<strong>O son of my brother! Lift your clothes, for this will keep them clean, and save you from the Punishment of your Rabb</strong>.” [96]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The painful suffering from the fatal wounds in Umar’s body did not prevent him from talking about the issue of Isbaal because Umar realized the threat of punishment in Hell for those who hang down their lower garments. In this there is a great lesson for all Muslims and especially our young generations that they should take this matter seriously and abide by the commands of Allaah and His Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). On the other hand the incident shows that Umar while leading an Ummah did not say this is a “minor issue” as some Muslims respond when they are adviced about this issue or that of the beard. He considered all matters of Deen in light of the teachings of the Qur’aan and Sunnah. Certainly if a person is new to Islaam or if he is ignorant, then we gradually teach him the importance of Tawheed and that the Sunnah is an integral part Tawheed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[92] The appropriate size takes into consideration what is prohibited and what is permitted. For example, it is prohibited to wear pants that “just fit in” and display or “framelike” the shapes of the private parts of men. This would alos be considered an an immitation of the Kuffar.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [93] Fathul Baaree, V. 10, P. 263.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [94] Burd, a black decorated square outer garment.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [95] Shayekh Al-Albaanee said that the hadeeth is authentic as in Ash-Shamaa’il Al-Muhammadiyyah (Sumarized Version), # 97.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [96] Collected by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim. See Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree V. 5, hadeeth # 50. It is also reported by Ibn Abee Shaybah in his Musannaf , V. 8, P. 27.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When these matters are made clear to him, then it is very natural to call him to abide by them. Setting the priorities without compromising or indefinitely postponing the reminders is, <em>inshaaa</em>’ <em>Allaah</em>, the beneficial approach.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Note</strong></span>: Someone may ask the question: “If the Sunnah for women is to trail their dresses, then what about the impurities that may attach to the dresses?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A women asked Umm Salamah رضي االله عنها the following question: “I am a women having a long trail of my garment and I walk in a filthy place; (then what should I do?). Umm Salamah replied: “The Messenger of Allaah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: ‘What comes after it cleanses it’. “ [97]</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[97] The hadeeth is reported by Imaam Malik, Ahmad, At-Tirmithee, Abee Dawoood, and Ad-Daarimee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sharee’ah permitted the trailing by the women in order to cover her feet which are illegal to keep naked before others. That is the exception upon which the ruling for women regarding the trailing is different from that for men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Summary</strong></span>: <em>Isbaal</em> is forbidden due to the following reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1-The threat of punishment in Hell for the <em>Musbil</em>,<br />
2-The clear command of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) to pull the garments above the ankles,<br />
3-The absolutely generalized terms regarding its Tahreem,<br />
4-The demand to follow the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and abide by his orders,<br />
5-It is a Makheelah (pride, arrogance, conceit, etc.),<br />
6-It is an imitation of women,<br />
7-It is an extravagancy,<br />
8-The Musbil cannot protect against filth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shayekh Al-Albaanee said that the hadeeth is authentic since it is supported by another sound narration reported by Abee Dawood and in which a women of the Banu Abd Al-Ashhal reported: “I said O Allaah’s Messenger! Our road to the mosque has an unpleasent stench; what should we do when it is raining? He asked: “Is there not a cleaner part after the filthy part of the road?”. She replied: “indeed there is one”. He said: “It makes up for the other”. See Mushkatul Masaabeeh, V.1, hadeeth # 504 and 512.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Clearing Some Shubuhaat </span></strong>[98]<strong><span style="color:#993300;"> Regarding Isbaal</span></strong></p>
<p>[98] Shubuhaat, unclear matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>First Shubuha:</strong></span> Isbaal is permitted as long as it is not done out of Makheelah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some refer to the following hadeeth as an evidence:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Abdullah bin Umar رضي االله عنهماreported that: “I came to visit the Messenger of Allaah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and I was wearing an Izaar Yataqa’qa’ (clanking because of its trailing below the ankles) . He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: “Who is this?” I said: “Abdullah bin Umar”. He said: “If you are an Abd (i.e. a true slave) of Allaah, then pull up your Izaar”. I did. He then said: “more!”. (Ibn Umar) said: “I pulled it up until it reached the middle of shank; this was the (length) of his Izaar until he ((صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)) died”. He then looked towards Aboo Bakr and said: “If anyone trails his garment arrogantly, Allaah will not look at him on the Day of Judgment”. Then Abu Bakr said: “My Izaar sometimes hangs low (in another narration he said: “one of the sides of my lower garment hangs low if I do not take care of it”)[99]. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)said: “But you are not one of them (in another narration he said: You are not one of those who do so conceitedly)[100][101]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Discussion</strong>: The hadeeth supports the <em>Tahreem</em> of <em>Isbaal</em> rather than the opinion which permits the <em>Isbaal</em> as long as it is not done out of conceit. In fact the hadeeth clearly makes it obligatory on the Muslim not to let his <em>Izaar</em> hang lower than his ankles, and that he must tuck it up even though his intention was like that of Abu Bakr in the hadeeth i.e. not done out of conceit. In fact Abu Bakr said: “One side of my Izaar hangs low if I do not take care of it”. In our times, however, people let their <em>Izaars</em> hang low, unlike Abu Bakr, and then they claim: “Well we do not do it out of arrogance!”. Don’t they realize the commands of Allaah’s Messenger to tuck up the <em>Izaar</em> and that his <em>Izaar</em> was extending to the middle of his shanks? Don’t they know that He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) never thinks about <em>Makheelah</em>? Isn’t he our example?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also clear that Abu Bakr did not say that: “I made my <em>Izaar</em> trailing”. In fact he said in one narration: “Sometimes my Izaar hangs low”. So, its his <em>Izaar</em> that goes down when as he said: “I do not take care of it”. Its clear that when he takes care of it it stays above his ankles, but when it gets loose it hangs low. Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajer reported that Ibn Sa’dd reported a narration from the way of Talha bin Abdullaah bin Abdur-Rahmaan bin Abee Bakr, that ‘Aaaishah رضي االله عنها وعنهم said: “Abu Bakr was Ahnaa (had an inclination in his back), his Izaar could not hold on him, it used to get loose around his loins”. Al-Hafidh also reported a narration from the way of Qayess Ibn Abee Haazim who said: “I visited Abee Bakr and he was a thin person.” [102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[99] From Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, V. 7, hadeeth # 675.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [100]Ibid. Also reported by Abee Dawood.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [101] The hadeeth was reported by Imaam Ahmad, Abdul Razzaaq, At-Tabaraanee and others. Al-Albaanee said: The hadeeth’s Isnaad is according to the conditions laid down by Ash-Shayekhan (i.e. the two Shayeks: Al- Bukhaaree and Muslim), As-Silsilah As-Saheehah, V. 4, P. 95. The part of the hadeeth starting with the saying of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم): If anyone trails his Izaar” and ending with “you are not of those who do so conceitedly” is reported by Al-Bukhaaree, Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree V. 7, hadeeth # 675.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [102] Fathul Baaree V. 10, P. 255.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who design garments, pants, etc. whose lower ends abide by the Sunnah, but when they wear them they get loose and sometimes trail below the ankles, resemble the case of Abu Bakr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) considered that Abu Bakr was not “one of those who hang their garments out of conceit”, because Abu Bakr did not intend to lower his Izaar below the ankles, and it only trailed when he did not take care of it. Those who intend to trail out of conceit are threatened with a grave punishment:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>Allaah will not look (on the Day of Resurrection) </strong>[103]<strong> at person who drags his Izaar (behind him) out of conceit.</strong>&#8221; [104]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>Allaah will not look at a person , on the Day of Judgemt, who drags his Izaar out of pride and arrogance</strong>.&#8221; [105]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, on the Day of Judgment, Allaah will not talk to or sanctify the Musbil. This is confirmed in the authentic hadeeth in which Abu Dharr reported the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) as saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[103] See Appendix.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [104] Al-Bukhaaree, Muslim, and Ahmad. See Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, V. 7, hadeeth # 675., and Saheeh Muslim, V. 3, Ahadeeth # 5191-5195.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [105] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, V. 7, hadeeth # 679 and Saheeh Muslim, hadeeth # 5201.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There are three (kinds) of persons to whom Allaah will neither speak on the Day of Judgment, nor will He look at them nor purify them, and they will have a painful Punishment. He (Abu Darr) said: “Allaah’s Messenger repeated itthree times. Abu Dharr remarked: “They failed and they lost; who are these persons, O Messenger of Allaah? He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) replied: “The one who wears a trailing robe (the Musbil), the one who takes account of what he gives, and the seller of goods by false oaths.” [106]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Certainly Abu Bakr received a testimony from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) that he did not lower his Izaar out of arrogance. Those who intentionally make Isbaal, when did they receive a purifying testimony?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another incident, Ubdullah Ibn Umar passed by the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and his Izaar was hanging low. He said describing this incident:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I happened to pass before Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) with my garment hanging low. He said: Abdullah, Tuck up your lower garment. I tucked it up, and he again said: “Tug it still further”. I tucked it still further and I went on tugging it afterward, whereupon some of the people said: “To what extent?” Thereupon he said: “To the middle of the shanks.” [107]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) did not keep silent when he saw Abdullah bin Umar hanging low his Izaar. This shows that the prophibition of Isbaal for men is not restricted only to the case if it is done out of Makheelah. Abdullah bin Umar is one of the great Sahabah. Imagine what would the position of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) be if he sees the clothes on many Du’aat (those who invite others to this Deen), or even “scholars” each trailing his Jubbah,[108] garment, or pants? We know that Ibn Umar hastened to comply with the Prophet’s command. Now it takes hours, talks, lectures to convey the Prophet’s command and still you find people arguing that: “Well! As long as Isbaal is not done out of conceit then its OK!” Indeed it makes the clement person preplexed! To Allaah alone, is the complaint!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Second Shubuha:</span></strong> The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) himself dragged his garment, so why is it that trailing is forbidden?

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra (رضي الله عنه): “We were with Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) when the sun eclipsed. Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) stood up dragging his cloak till he entered the mosque&#8230;” [109]. In another narration, Abu Bakra said: “Allaah’s Messenger came out dragging his cloak till he reached the mosque.” [110] Still in another narration by Abu Bakra: “He got up dragging his garment hurriedly till he reached the mosque.” [111]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other case is when the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) made an early salutation after the third rak’ah of an afternoon prayer. “A man called Al-Khirbaaq who had long arms got up and said: “Has the prayers been shortened, O Messenger of Allaah? He came out angrily trailing his cloak and when he came to the people he said: Is he telling the truth? They said: “Yes”. He then said one rak’ah, then gave the salutation, then made two prostrations (of forgetfullness), then gave the salutation.” [112]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third incident as reported by Abur Rahman bin Abee Sa’eed Al-Khudree who narrated it from his father. He (the father) said: I went to Qibaa’ with the Messenger of Allaah(صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) on Monday till we reached (the habitation) of Banu Saalim. The Messenger of Allaah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) stood at the door of ‘Itbaan and called him loudly. So he came out dragging his lower garment. Upon this Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: “We have made this man to make haste”. ‘Itbaan said: “Messenger of Allaah, if a man parts with his wife suddenly without seminal emission, what is he required to do (with regard to bath)?”. The Messenger of Allaah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: “It is with the seminal emission that bath becomes obligatory.” [113]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[109] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, V. 2, hadeeth # 150.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [110] ibid, hadeeth # 170.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [111] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, V. 7, hadeeth # 676.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [112] See Saheeh Muslim, V. 1, hadeeeth # 1187.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [113] Saheeh Muslim, V. 1, hadeeth # 674.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of the above Ahadeeth are supporting evidences for the opinion that if a person does not intend to lower his garment, but it happens that he draggs it due to to certain circumstances, like being in a hurry, angry, etc. then he is not a Musbil by intention. Therefore, he is to be reminded but not blamed. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) came in a hurry, so did ‘Itbaan. Another exception is due to necessity.114 For example if someone has a wound on his ankle, he may cover it by extending his lower garment if he does not have any other means to protect it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Third Shubuha:</strong></span> It was reported in the Musannaf of Ibn Abee Shayebah with an authentic chain of narrators that Abdullah bin Mas’oud (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) “used to dragg his lower garment; when he was asked about it he said: ‘I have thin shanks’. “ [115]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1-Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajer responded to this issue saying: “it indicates that he extended it lower than the recommended, which is the middle of the shanks. It is improper to suspect that he let it exceed the ankles as indicated by his response: ‘I have thin shanks’116. It is possible that he was not aware of the story of Umr bin Zarrarah,117 and Allaah knows best.” [118]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2-The narration about Ibn Mas’oud is of the Mawqoof [119] category opposed by many Marfoo’[120] narrations. Certainly the Marfoo’ takes precedence over the Mawqoof. The evidence is in what is established by the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[114] See Fathul Baaree, V. 10, P. 257.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [115] Musannaf Ibn Abee Shayebah, V. 6, P. 26 # 11.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[116] In fact Abdullah bin Mas’oud reported that the “The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) disliked ten things”. He mentioned them and amongst them was “the dragging of the Izaar (i.e. below the ankles). This was reported by Imaam Ahmad in his Musnad, V. 6, PP. 103-104, hadeeth # 4179 . The checker, Ahmad Shaakir, may Allaah’s Mercy be upon him, said: ”Its Isnaad is Saheeh”. This supports Al-Hafid’s position that the “Isbaal” in Abdullah bin Mas’oud’s garment was an extension lower than the middle of the shanks but not exceeding the ankles. Certainly Ibn Mas’oud would not opposee the Prophet’s position on Isbaal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[117] Abu Umamah (رضي الله عنه) reported that: “While we were with the Messenger of Allaah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), Umr Bin Zararah AlAnsaaree followed us and he was dressed with a cloak and a trailing Izaar. The Messenger of Allaah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) began to hold the side of his Thobe, humbling himself to Allaah and saying: ‘I am your slave, the son of your male-slave, the son of your female-slave”, until Umr heard it. Upon this he said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah!, I am a person with thin shanks’. He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: ‘O Umr! Allaah has perfected everything He has created; O Umr! Allaah does not like the Musbil.’ “-Reported by At-Tabaraanee and others. Al-Hafidh said: “Its narrators are Thuqaat (trustworthy). See Fathul Baaree, V. 10, PP. 275-276.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[118] Fathul Baaree, V. 10, P.276.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [119] Mawqoof, “stopped”; a narration from a Sahabee (Companion) not traced to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [120] Marfoo’, “raised”; a narration attributed to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fourth Shubuha:</strong></span> Some people consider the matters of Isbaal , the growing of the beard, and the entire outward appearance of the Muslim as “minor” or “trivial” issues. They base this conclusion on their understanding that the Deen of Allaah is divided into a “crust or a shell” and a “core”. The outward appearance is from the “crust” part.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This classification of Islamic matters is an innovation.[121] It is aimed at diluting the Deen of Allaah leaving it for the taste of men and women to decide for themselves whether they have to abide by some of its rules and regulations. In fact we are ordered by Allaah to “fully, perfectly, and whole-heartedly” enter the Deen of Islaam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“O you who believe! Enter perfectly in Islaam and follow not the footsteps of Satan.”</span> (Qur’aan 2:208)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer said in his Tafseer (exegesis) of this ِAayah: “<strong>Enter in Islaam and obey all of its rules and regulations</strong>”. Al-Alloosee, may Allaah’s Mercy be upon him, commented about the same ِAayah, saying: “Entirely enter in Islaam and do not let anything of your outward and inward natures except that Islaam contains them leaving no room for anything else.” [122]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) ordered, forbade, warned and set the example regarding the Isbaal, the beard, the straightening of the lines in the prayers. So, the Muslim should not take these matters lightly because insisting one even one sin, no matter how small, may subject the Muslim to the threat of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is truth in the saying that: “had it not been for the shell, the core would spoil”! Islaam is an intact message. The deeds of the heart reflect on the outward behavior and appearance. This evident in the hadeeth in which the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: “Truly there is a piece of flesh in the body; if it is sound, the the whole body is sound, and if it is corrupt the whole body is corrupt. Truly it is the heart”-Saheeh Muslim, V. 3, # 3882.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is also certain is that the outward appearance influences the inward condition. In the hadeeth reported by An-Nu’maan bin Basheer, the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: “Straighten your rows (in prayers) or Allaah would certainly put your faces in contrary directions (i.e. would create dissension amongst you).”- Saheeh Muslim, V. 1, hadeeth # 874 and 875. In another narration reported by Abee Daawood, the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: “&#8230;or Allaah would make your hearts differ.”-See Saheeh Al-Jaami’, hadeeth # 1202.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[122] Rooh Al-Ma’aanee, V. 1. The Tafseer of ِAayah # 208 of Soorat Al-Baqara. Published in 1408/1987 by Daar Al-Fikr, Beirut, Lebanon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">So when they turned away (from the Path of Allaah), Allaah turned away their hearts (from the right Path).</span>” (Qur’aan 61, 5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sahl bin Sa’d narrated that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Beware of the small sins! The similitude of the small sins is like a group of people who came down to the depth of a valley; one (person amongst them) brought a stick (of wood), and another (person) brought another stick (etc.), until they collected what was enough to get their bread baked. It is certain that when the small sins take hold of their possessor they destroy him (her).” [123]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ubaadah bin Qurss said: “you do certain things that are “thinner than hair” in your sight (i.e. not blameworthy in your consideration), but at the time of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) they were considered from the grave offenses.” [124] When this saying of Ubaadah bin Qurss was mentioned to Muhammad Ibn Seereen,[125] he believed it and said: “I consider that trailing of the <em>Izaar</em> is one of the grave offenses because of the severe threat of Punishment that was related in the texts about it. People think of it as one of the minor sins because of their excessive ignorance and false pride.”[126]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[123] Reported by Imaam Ahmad and others. See As-Silsilah As-Saheehah, V. 1, hadeeth # 389.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [124] Reported by Ahmad and others. Waleed An-Nassr reported it as Saheeh in his book: “(The ruling on) Isbaal not done out of Conceit.” P. 29, second edition, 1411/1990. Publisher’s name not mentioned. 125 Abu Bakr, Muhammad Ibn Seereenn, died 110 Hj/729. He was one of the known Fuqahaa’ (Jurists) of the City of Bara-Iraq. He was famous for his in depth interpreatations of dreams.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[126] Reported in Al-Fath Ar-Rabbaanee Bitarteeb Musnad Al-Imaam Ahmad Ashayebaanee, by Ahmad Al-Bannaa As-Saa’aatee, V. 17, P. 291. Daar Ash-Shihaab, Egypt.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Approved Length of the Lower Garment:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Izaar (including pants) must be above the ankles and preferably to the middle of the shanks:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I happened to pass before Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) with my garment hanging low. He said: Abdullah, Tuck up your lower garment. I tucked it up, and he again said: “Tug it still further”. I tucked it still further and I went on tugging it afterward, whereupon some of the people said: “To what extent?” Thereupon he said: “To the middle of the shanks.” [127]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Huthaifah said: “Allaah’s Messenger took by shank (or by the muscle of my shank) and said: “This is the extent of the <em>Izaar</em>. If you dislike it, have it lower (i.e. above the lower end of the shank’s muscle). If you (still) dislike it, then (know that) it is not legitimate that the <em>Izaar</em> extend below the ankles.” [128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-’Alaa bin Abdur Rahmaan reported that his father (Abdur Rahmaan bin Ya’qoob) said: “Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudree about wearing lower garment”. He said: “You have come to the man who knows it well. Allaah’s Messenger said: ‘The <em>Izaar</em> of the Muslim should be halfway down his legs-and he is guilty of no sin if it extends between that and the ankles, but what comes lower than the ankles is in Hell. (On the Day of Judgment), Allaah will not look at him who conceitedly trails his lower garment.’ “ [129]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[127] Reported by Muslim, Saheeh Muslim V. 3, hadeeth # 5200.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [128] Reported by Ahmad, At-Ttirmithee, An-Nassaa’ee, and others. At-Tirmithee said it is sound and acceptable hadeeth (At-Tirmithee, Book of Dress # 1783). See As-Saheehah, V. 4, # 1765.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [129] Saheeh Abee Dawood, hadeeth # 3449. Also reported by Ibn Maajah. Al-Albaanee said it is Saheeh as in As-Saheehah, and in Saheeh Al-Jaami’ As-Sagheer, # 921.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajer, may Allaah’s Mercy be upon him, said: “It is concluded, therefore, that there are two two cases regarding the men’s Izaar: a highly recommended case where the length of the lower garment is halfway down the shanks, and a permissible length where its lower border is above the ankles.” [130]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Note</strong>: Shortening the lower garment above the middle of shanks is an exaggeration in Deen and it is prohibited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>What Clothes Are Covered Under The Laws Regarding Isbaal?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When it comes to the Issue of Isbaal for men, what matters is the length and not the kind of dress. Abdullah bin Umar reported that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<em>Isbaal</em> is lower garment, <em>Al-Qameess</em>,[131] and turban [132]. If anyone trails any of them conceitedly, Allaah will not look at him on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221; [133]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Hazm said describing the <em>Musbil</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<em>Isbaal</em> generally covers trousers, lower garments, shirts, and everything people wear.” [134]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[130] Fathul Baaree, V. 10, P. 259.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[131] Al-Qamees, the Shirt that covers the body halfway to the middle of the legs. Included in this category is the Morocon بُرنُس hooded cloak, جلاَّبية <em>Jallaabiyyah</em> (a loose shirt like garment, the common dress of the male population of Egypt), العبائة Al-’Abaa’ah (a cloak-like, woolen wrap, occasionally striped), and the like Fathul Baaree, V. 10, P. 260.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[132] This shows that trailing and hanging down is not confined to the <em>Izaar</em> in all of its forms. One should not exceed the usual customs and practices that do not oppose the Islamic teachings. The turban as well as its ends should not be very long in order to safeguard against conceit and arrogance besides this would be considered as extravagance. Some of toady’s lengthy turbans may need a special instrument to roll them! Similarly there is trailing and hanging in the wide sleeves of some garments especially in some parts of Egypt and in Sudan. Imaam Ibn Qayyim, may Allaah’s Mercy be upon him, said: “Lengthy and wide sleeves, which look like bags, were never worn by the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) or anyone of his companions, and (their style) is in opposition to his Sunnah. Their permissibility is doubtful because they they are related to false pride”. Imaam Ash-Shawkaanee, may Allaah’s Mercy be upon him, described the clothes of some of the scholars as having “wide sleeves such that each one would be sufficient to make of it an outer garment or a shirt for one of his children or to one of the orphans!&#8230;”-Nayel Al-Awtaar, V. 2, 108.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[133] Saheeh Abee Dawood, # 3450, Saheeh Ibn Maajah, # 3567, An-Nassaa’ee, and Ibn Abee Shayebah. Shayekh Al- Albaanee authenticated it in Saheeh Al-Jaami’ # 2770.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[134] Ibn Hazm’s Al-Muhalla, V. 4, P. 100, the Chapter on Salaat (Prayers).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajer quoted At-Tabaree saying: “In the lifetime of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) most people used to wear the <em>Izaar</em> and Al-’Ardiyah (loose outer garments, cloaks, robes, etc.). But When people started wearing shirts and other kinds of clothes (like cloaks etc.), the same ruling of prohibition applied to the trailing and hanging of the <em>Izaar</em> was applied to them. Ibn Battaal said: ‘This is a good analogical deduction. So, even if there is no text that includes the <em>Thobe</em> , the prohibition clearly involves all (i.e. all dresses that hang low)’.” [135]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Isbaal</em> And Prayers:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You may have noticed some people tugging up their lower garments (especially pants) when they are about to start their prayers. They refer to a hadeeth reported by Abee Dawood in which it is said that: “Allaah does not accept the prayers from a man trailing his lower garment”. However, the hadeeth is weak. Shayek Nassir ud Deen Al-Albaanee said: “Its Isnaad is weak, because of Abu Ja’far, an un-known as Ibnul Qattan said&#8230;So, whoever authenticated the Isnaad of this is mistaken.” [136]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having said the above, one should be aware that intending to pray in a state of <em>Isbaal</em> out of conceit, subjects the <em>Musbil</em> to a grave punishment from Allaah. Abdullah bin Mas’oud said:“I heared Allaah’s Messenger saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Anyone who conceitedly trails his Izaar during prayers, Allaah has nothing to do with pardoning him and protecting him (from Hell or from bad deeds).”</strong> [137]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration came as <em>Mawqoof</em> (i.e. a narration from a companion. In this case by Abdullah bin Mas’oud). It reads:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The Musbil during prayer has nothing to do with pardoning him and protecting him (from Hell or from bad deeds).”</strong> [138]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[135] Fathul Baaree, V. 10, P. 260.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [136] Al-Albaanee, Mushkat ul Massabeeh, V. 1, # 761.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[137] Reported by Abee Dawood V. 1, Book of Salat, hadeeth # 637 (Arabic or English Texts). The narration is in At-Tabaraanee in Al-Mu’jam Al-Kabeer , V. 9, P. 315. The checker said: it is authentic.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[138] Reported by Abee Dawood and At-Tayaalisee, V. 1, P. 352, Al-Baihaqee, V. 2, P. 432 (Book of Zuhd), Al-Haythamee in Majma’ Az-Zawaa’id, V. 5, P. 124 (he said: At-Tabaraanee reported it and its narrators are trustworthy), and Al-Albaanee authenticated it in Saheeh Al-Jaami’, hadeeth # 5888. Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajer said: “It was reported by At-Tabaraanee with a good Isnaad from Abdullah Ibn Mas’oud. An issue like this could not just be an opinion (i.e. of Abdullah Ibn Mas’oud)&#8230;”-Fathul Baaree, V. 10, P. 257.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Musbil</em>, therefore, should be aware that <em>Isbaal</em> is a great offense during prayers or after its completion. It should be also noted that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) ordered that we should not make <em>Kaft</em> of our clothes or hair during prayers. <em>Kaft</em> is to draw, cluster, pile up, tuck up, or band clothes together right before or during prayers to prevent their spreading [139]. Like, for example, to bring together and assemble the sides of one’s <em>Thobe</em> between the legs when one is about to enter the prayers or during <em>Ruk’oo</em> or <em>Sujood</em>, to pile up the ends of the head-cover on the head or the shoulders, to tuck up the lower ends of the pants,[140] or the ends of the sleeves, etc. In the hadeeth narrated by Abdullah bin Abbaas ,رضي االله عنهما the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said::</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I have been ordered (and thus his Ummah) to prostrate on seven bones: on forehead (along with the tip of the nose), pointed towards his nose, both hands, both knees and the toes of both feet, and not to tuck up the clothes and the hair.” [141]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[139]See Ibn Al-Atheer in An-Nihaayah fee Ghareeb Al-hadeeth, V. 4, P. 184.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[140]This is not to be confused with tucking up and then cutting off the trailing ends of the lower garments halfway to the middle of the legs or to an extent that keeps the lower ends of the Thobe, pants, trousers, etc. above the ankles. Even if the lower end is within the recommended limits, it should not be tucked up at its end because that constitutes Kaft.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[141]Saheeh Al-Bukharee, V. 1, hadeeth # 774.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Dress of Men</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The dress of men is governed by the following legislations:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1-It is forbidden if it extends below the ankles. The Musbil is under the threat of punishment in Hell.<br />
2-Isbaal itself is Makheelah.<br />
3-If the Musbil intends conceit and arrogance, Allaah will not look at him on the Day of Judgment.<br />
4-Isbaal is not confined to the lower garments. It covers the cloak, robe, pants,trousers, turban, sleeves, etc.<br />
5-The person who does not intend Isbaal and his lower Izaar hangs low out of his control is not a Musbil.<br />
6-The recommended length of the lower garment is halfway to the middle of the shanks, and the permissible is to up to the ankles.<br />
7-The dress must not resemble that of the Kuffar.<br />
8-The dress must not be for fame.<br />
9-The dress must not resemble that of women.<br />
10-The dress must not contain forbidden pictures (human and animal life), or material the essence of which is in disagreement with Islamic Principles including the immitation of the Kuffar.<br />
11-Wearing golden rings, bracelets, necklace, etc. Is forbidden.<br />
12-It is forbidden to wear pure silk.</p>

Amma-ba&#8217;d</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#008000;"><em> &#8220;There are three people that Allaah will not speak to on the Day of Judgement, will not look at them, will not purify them; and for them is a painful punishment: one who lets his garment hang below his ankles, the Mannan, and the Munaffiq who does his business with false oaths.&#8221;</em></span> (Muslim no. 106)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said<em><span style="color:#008000;">: &#8220;Whoever drags his garment out of arrogance, Allaah will not look at him on the Day of Judgement.&#8221;</span></em> (Al-Bukhaaree no. 5784 and Muslim no. 2085)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) also said:<em><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Whatever is below the ankles is in the fire.&#8221;</span> </em>(Al-Bukhaaree no. 5787)[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) also said:<em><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;The Izar of the believer is at the middle of his shin, and there is no harm &#8211; or he said &#8211; no sin upon someone if it is anywhere between that and the ankles. What is lower than that is in the Fire. And whoever drags his Izar arrogantly, Allaah will not look at him on the Day of Judgement.&#8221;</span></em>[2] (Abu Dawud no. 4093, Ibn Majah no. 3573, An-Nasa&#8217;i 5/490, no 9716 and Al-Mawatta&#8217; 2/914, 915)</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Refutation of Doubt &#8220;We are like Abu Bakr; we&#8217;re not doing it out of Pride&#8221; </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the course of his series of classes of Readings from &#8211; Complete Characteristics of Muhammad (sallalallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), student Abul-Hasan Maalik (hafidhahullaah) relayed the proofs from the pure Sunnah concerning the Isbal as relates to the Izaar, Thobe, Kamees (shirt), and even the &#8216;Imaamah (turban).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning those who violate these boundaries with the excuse &#8220;We are like Abu Bakr; we&#8217;re not doing it out of Pride,&#8221; Abul-Hasan relayed the following from the scholars:</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;The scholars have mentioned a few different reasons why it is not correct for you to try to compare yourself with Abu Bakr As-Sideeq (radiallaahu &#8216;anhu).</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>&#8211; <strong>Firstly</strong>, we don&#8217;t have a testimony as Abu Bakr did from the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) that he wasn&#8217;t doing it out of pride. The Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: You are not one doing it out of Pride. None of you have a testimony from the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) (saying) you&#8217;re not doing it out of pride. (That&#8217;s) number one.</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Number two</strong>, the &#8216;ulemma mention that it happened to Abu Bakr because of his thinness, he was a thin man. Very small (waist), and it was hard for him to keep his izaar up, and it used to fall.</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>The third issue</strong> the &#8216;ulemma mention is that he was striving to keep it up! He wasn&#8217;t just letting it all hang out and down like this. He was striving to keep it up.</p>
<p>&#8211; [<strong>Fourthly</strong>,] they (the scholars) also mention another narration that the Prophet mentioned that isbal itself is nakhyila &#8211; isbal itself is arrogance. The &#8216;ulemma mentioned that at the very least it leads to arrogance&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul-Hasan relayed other benefits and explanations and rulings from &#8216;ulemma such as Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah, Imam Ibnul-Qayyim, and Imam An-Nawaawee (rahimahumullaah) concerning matters such as isbal for the sleeves of the kamees (they can&#8217;t be too long or wide)[3] and the isbal for the &#8216;Imaamah (the tail of the turban cannot be very long). And this is not a minor issue, rather it concerns the major matter of obeying Allaah and His Messenger, the matter of following the Sunnah[4] of the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), whom Allaah Ta&#8217;aala commanded us to follow and take as an example. The Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) is the best example to follow.[5]</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>[1] Shaikh Muhammad Ibn Saalih al-&#8216;Uthaimeen (rahimahullaah) said: &#8220;The Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) did not confine this to arrogance, and it is not correct to do so based on the Hadeeth before it, because Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudri (radiallaahu &#8216;anhu) said that the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> &#8216;The Izar of the believer is at the middle of his shin, and there is no harm &#8211; or he said &#8211; no sin upon someone if it is anywhere between that and the ankles. What is lower than that is in the Fire. And whoever drags his Izar arrogantly, Allaah will not look at him on the Day of Judgement.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
<p>Because the two actions are different, the punishment for each is different. Whenever the ruling and the reason for that differ, it is not possible to restrict a general ruling. This is because that would lead to a contradiction.&#8221;</p>
<p>[2] The hadeeth is authenticated by Imam Al-Albaanee (rahimahullaah).</p>
<p>[3] Imam Ibn Baaz (rahimahullaah) said: &#8220;As for the sleeves, the Sunnah is that they should not extend beyond the wrist, and with Allaah is the facilitation to do what is right.&#8221;</p>
<p>[4] The word Sunnah refers to the Prophet&#8217;s statements, actions, and his tacit approvals &#8211; some of which are obligatory (such as Ash-Shahadatayn, having the correct &#8216;aqeedah, the 5 obligatory prayers, Zakat, Hajj, fasting Ramadan, obedience to parents, growing the beard, returning the salaam, keeping your thobe or izaar above the ankles) and some of which are recommended (such as the optional prayers, optional fasting, using the miswak, beginning the salaam). The word Sunnah has also been used to refer to the &#8216;aqeedah and manhaj, and the word Sunnah has also been used to refer to the entire Religion.<br />
[5] Among the many ayat Allaah revealed in this regard are the statements of Allaah, Ta&#8217;aala:</p>
<p>لَقَدْ كَانَ لَكُمْ فِي رَسُولِ اللَّهِ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَة لِمَنْ كَانَ يَرْجُو اللَّهَ وَالْيَوْمَ الآخِرَ وَذَكَرَ اللَّهَ كَثِيرا</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah (Muhammad), you have a good example to follow for him who hopes in (the Meeting with) Allaah and the Last Day and remembers Allaah much.</em></span> (Al-Ahzab, ayah 21)</p>
<p>قُلْ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ تُحِبُّونَ اللَّهَ فَاتَّبِعُونِي يُحْبِبْكُمُ اللَّهُ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ ذُنُوبَكُمْ وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَحِيم</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Say (Oh Muhammad to mankind): &#8220;If you (really) love Allaah then follow me (i.e. accept Tawheed, follow the Qur`an and the Sunnah), Allaah will love you and forgive you of your sins. And Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221; </em></span>(Aali &#8216;Imran, ayah 31)</p>
<p>قُلْ أَطِيعُوا اللَّهَ وَالرَّسُولَ فَإِنْ تَوَلَّوْا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ الْكَافِرِينَ</p>
<p>Say (Oh Muhammad): &#8220;Obey Allaah and the Messenger (Muhammad).&#8221; But if they turn away, then Allaah does not like the disbelievers. (Aali &#8216;Imran, ayah 32)</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Cuffing the Pants in Prayer, by Shaykh Zaid al-Madkhalee (hafidhahullaah) </strong></span></p>
<p>Bismillaah Al-Hamdulillaah wa salatu wa salaamu &#8216;ala rasulullaah<br />
Amma-ba&#8217;d</p>
<p><strong>Cuffing the pants in prayer by Shaykh Zaid</strong></p>
<p>Here is an excerpt:</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: What is the ruling on rising or cuffing the pants in prayer if they are beneath the ankles?</p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Zaid al-Madkhalee (hafidhahullaah)</strong> answered:</p>
</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Obligatory. If the pants or the garment, or the trousers, or the izar, hangs beneath the ankles, the man falls into a sin from the major sins and this is not specific to the prayer, rather it is general for all times. As it appears in the hadith: Allaah will not look at the one (man) who drags his garment out of arrogance.[Muslim (2085)]</p>
<div style="text-align:left;">
<p>If a person comes with an attempt to remain neutral, saying &#8216;I don&#8217;t drag my garment due to arrogance; rather it is normal or routine.&#8217; Then bring him the proof with another narration, the statement of the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam): Whatever is beneath the ankles is in the fire. [Musnadof Imam Ahmad (9064)]</p>
<p>So he (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) did not say, &#8216;due to arrogance,&#8217; nor did he restrict this to a condition or a description. Therefore there are two punishments for the one who drags his garment, one of them being more severe than the other &#8211; and they are both severe&#8230;&#8221;</p>
