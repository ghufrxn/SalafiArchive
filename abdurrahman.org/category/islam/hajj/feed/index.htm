<p>Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">“<strong>There are no days during which the righteous action is so pleasing to Allah than these days (i.e., the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah)</strong>.” He was asked: “O Messenger of Allah, not even Jihad in the Cause of Allah?” He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, “Not even Jihad in the Cause of Allah, except in case one goes forth with his life and his property and does not return with either of it.”</p>

<p><strong>Explanation Based on Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s Tafseer</strong></p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَإِذْ جَعَلْنَا الْبَيْتَ مَثَابَةً لِّلنَّاسِ وَأَمْنًا وَاتَّخِذُوا مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ مُصَلًّى ۖ وَعَهِدْنَا إِلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ أَن طَهِّرَا بَيْتِيَ لِلطَّائِفِينَ وَالْعَاكِفِينَ وَالرُّكَّعِ السُّجُودِ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And (remember) when We made the House </strong>(the Ka&#8217;bah at Makkah)<strong> a place of resort for mankind and a place of safety. And take you (people) the Maqam </strong>(place)<strong> of Ibrahim </strong>(Abraham) [or the stone on which Ibrahim (Abraham) stood while he was building the Ka&#8217;bah]<strong> as a place of prayer</strong> (for some of your prayers, e.g. two Rak&#8217;at after the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;bah at Makkah)<strong>, and We commanded Ibrahim </strong>(Abraham)<strong> and Isma&#8217;il </strong>(Ishmael)<strong> that they should purify My House </strong>(the Ka&#8217;bah at Makkah)<strong> for those who are circumambulating it, or staying </strong>(I&#8217;tikaf)<strong>, or bowing or prostrating themselves </strong>(there, in prayer)<strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">[Qur’aan – Surah al-Baqarah 2:125]</p>
<p><strong>Posted from</strong>: <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/11/17/tafseer-explanation-surah-al-baqarah-dr-saleh-as-saleh/"><strong>Tafseer – Explanation Surah Al-Baqarah</strong></a> – Dr Saleh as Saleh [Audio Series|En]. Explanation Based on Shaykh Uthaymeen’s Tafseer</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>The following has been posted from <em>Tafseer Ibn Katheer</em> (Darussalam English Publications):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Virtue of Allah&#8217;s House</strong></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَإِذْ جَعَلْنَا الْبَيْتَ مَثَابَةً لِّلنَّاسِ وَأَمْناً وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">125. And (remember) when We made the House (the Kabah at Makkah) a place of resort for mankind and a place of safety. And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim (or the stone on which Ibrahim as a place)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Awfi reported that Ibn Abbas commented on Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَإِذْ جَعَلْنَا الْبَيْتَ مَثَابَةً لِّلنَّاسِ</strong><br />
(And (remember) when We made the House (the Kabah at Makkah) a place of resort for mankind)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;They do not remain in the House, they only visit it and return to their homes, and then visit it again.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Abu Jafar Ar-Razi narrated from Ar-Rabi bin Anas from Abu Al-Aliyah who said that,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَإِذْ جَعَلْنَا الْبَيْتَ مَثَابَةً لِّلنَّاسِ وَأَمْناً</strong><br />
(And (remember) when We made the House (the Kabah at Makkah) a place of resort for mankind and a place of safety) means,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Safe from enemies and armed conflict. During the time of Jahiliyyah, the people were often victims of raids and kidnapping, while the people in the area surrounding it (Al-Masjid Al-Haram) were safe and not subject to kidnapping.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Mujahid, Ata&#8217;, As-Suddi, Qatadah and Ar-Rabi bin Anas were reported to have said that the Ayah (2:125) means,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Whoever enters it shall be safe.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah indicates that Allah honored the Sacred House, which Allah made as a safe refuge and safe haven. Therefore, the souls are eager, but never bored, to conduct short visits to the House, even every year. This is because Allah accepted the supplication of His Khalil, Ibrahim, when he asked Allah to make the hearts of people eager to visit the House. Ibrahim said (14:40),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>رَبَّنَا وَتَقَبَّلْ دُعَآءِ</strong><br />
(Our Lord! And accept my invocation).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah described the House as a safe resort and refuge, for those who visit it are safe, even if they had committed acts of evil. This honor comes from the honor of the person who built it first, Khalil Ar-Rahman, just as Allah said,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَإِذْ بَوَّأْنَا لإِبْرَهِيمَ مَكَانَ الْبَيْتِ أَن لاَّ تُشْرِكْ بِى شَيْئاً</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And (remember) when We showed Ibrahim the site of the (Sacred) House (the Kabah at Makkah) (saying): &#8220;Associate not anything (in worship) with Me&#8230;&#8221;) (22:26) and,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِنَّ أَوَّلَ بَيْتٍ وُضِعَ لِلنَّاسِ لَلَّذِى بِبَكَّةَ مُبَارَكاً وَهُدًى لِّلْعَـلَمِينَ فِيهِ ءَايَـتٌ بَيِّـنَـتٌ مَّقَامُ إِبْرَهِيمَ وَمَن دَخَلَهُ كَانَ ءَامِناً</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, the first House (of worship) appointed for mankind was that at Bakkah (Makkah), full of blessing, and a guidance for Al-Alamin (mankind and Jinn). In it are manifest signs (for example), the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim; whosoever enters it, he attains security) (3:96-97).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The last honorable Ayah emphasized the honor of Ibrahim&#8217;s Maqam, and the instruction to pray next to it,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim as a place of prayer). The Maqam of Ibrahim Sufyan Ath-Thawri reported that Said bin Jubayr commented on the Ayah,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim as a place of prayer) &#8220;The stone (Maqam) is the standing place of Ibrahim, Allah&#8217;s Prophet, and a mercy from Allah. Ibrahim stood on the stone, while Ismail was handing him the stones (constructing the Kabah).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Suddi said, &#8220;The Maqam of Ibrahim is a stone which Ismail&#8217;s wife put under Ibrahim&#8217;s feet when washing his head.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Qurtubi mentioned this, but he considered it unauthentic, although others gave it prefrence, Ar-Razi reported it in his Tafsir from Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Qatadah, and Ar-Rabi bin Anas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abi Hatim reported that Jabir, describing the Hajj (pilgrimage) of the Prophet said, &#8220;When the Prophet performed Tawaf, Umar asked him, Is this the Maqam of our father&#8217; He said, Yes.&#8217; Umar said, Should we take it a place of prayer&#8217; So Allah revealed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim (Abraham) as a place of prayer.&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari said, &#8220;Chapter: Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim (Abraham) as a place of prayer) meaning, they return to it repeatedly.&#8221; He then narrated that Anas bin Malik said that Umar bin Al-Khattab said, &#8220;I agreed with my Lord, or my Lord agreed with me, regarding three matters. I said, O Messenger of Allah! I wish you take the Maqam of Ibrahim a place for prayer.&#8217; The Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim (Abraham)) was revealed. I also said, O Messenger of Allah! The righteous and the wicked enter your house. I wish you would command the Mothers of the believers (the Prophet&#8217;s wives) to wear Hijab. Allah sent down the Ayah that required the Hijab. And when I knew that the Prophet was angry with some of his wives, I came to them and said, Either you stop what you are doing, or Allah will endow His Messenger with better women than you are.&#8217; I advised one of his wives and she said to me, O Umar! Does the Messenger of Allah not know how to advise his wives, so that you have to do the job instead of him&#8217; Allah then revealed,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>عَسَى رَبُّهُ إِن طَلَّقَكُنَّ أَن يُبْدِلَهُ أَزْوَجاً خَيْراً مِّنكُنَّ مُسْلِمَـتٍ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#008000;">It may be if he divorced you (all) that his Lord will give him instead of you, wives better than you, ـ Muslims (who submit to Allah)</span>).&#8221; (66:5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Ibn Jarir narrated that Jabir said, &#8220;After the Messenger of Allah kissed the Black Stone, he went around the house three times in a fast pace and four times in a slow pace. He then went to Maqam of Ibrahim, with it between him and the House, and prayed two Rakahs.&#8221; This is part of the long Hadith that Muslim recorded in Sahih. Al-Bukhari recorded that Amr bin Dinar said that he heard Ibn Umar say, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah performed Tawaf around the House seven times and then prayed two Rakahs behind the Maqam.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All these texts indicate that the Maqam is the stone that Ibrahim was standing on while building the House. As the House&#8217;s walls became higher, Ismail brought his father a stone, so that he could stand on it, while Ismail handed him the stones. Ibrahim would place the stones on the wall, and whenever he finished one side, he would move to the next side, to complete the building all around. Ibrahim kept repeating this until he finished building the House, as we will describe when we explain the story of Ibrahim and Ismail and how they built the House, as narrated from Ibn Abbas and collected by Al-Bukhari. Ibrahim&#8217;s footprints were still visible in the stone, and the Arabs knew this fact during the time of Jahiliyyah. This is why Abu Talib said in his poem known as Al-Lamiyyah&#8217;, &#8220;And Ibrahim&#8217;s footprint with his bare feet on the stone is still visible.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslims also saw Ibrahim&#8217;s footprints on the stone, as Anas bin Malik said, &#8220;I saw the Maqam with the print of Ibrahim&#8217;s toes and feet still visible in it, but the footprints dissipated because of the people rubbing the stone with their hands.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Earlier, the Maqam was placed close to the Kabah&#8217;s wall. In the present time, the Maqam is placed next to Al-Hijr on the right side of those entering through the door.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Ibrahim finished building the House, he placed the stone next to the wall of Al-Kabah. Or, when the House was finished being built, Ibrahim just left the stone where it was last standing, and he was commanded to pray next to the stone when he finished the Tawaf (circumambulating). It is understandable that the Maqam of Ibrahim would stand where the building of the House ended. The Leader of the faithful Umar bin Al-Khattab, one of the Four Rightly Guided Caliphs whom we were commanded to emulate, moved the stone away from the Kabah&#8217;s wall during his reign. Umar is one of the two men, whom the Messenger of Allah described when he said,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>«اقْتَدُوا بِاللَّذَيْنِ مِنْ بَعْدِي أَبِي بَكْرٍ وَعُمَر»</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Imitate the two men who will come after me: Abu Bakr and Umar.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar was also the person whom the Qur&#8217;an agreed with regarding praying next to Maqam of Ibrahim. This is why none among the Companions rejected it when he moved it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdur-Razzaq reported from Ibn Jurayj from Ata&#8217;, &#8220;Umar bin Al-Khattab moved the Maqam back.&#8221; Also, Abdur-Razzaq narrated that Mujahid said that Umar was the first person who moved the Maqam back to where it is now standing.&#8221; Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr, Ahmad bin Ali bin Al-Husayn Al-Bayhaqi recorded A&#8217;ishah saying, &#8220;<strong>During the time of the Messenger of Allah and Abu Bakr, the Maqam was right next to the House. Umar moved the Maqam during his reign</strong>.&#8221; This Hadith has an authentic chain of narration.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/defects-in-the-sacrificial-animal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[The following is posted from: <a title="The Conditions of a Sacrificial Offering – Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2009/11/19/the-conditions-of-a-sacrificial-offering/">The Conditions of a Sacrificial Offering</a> – Imaam Muhammad bin Saalih Al-‘Uthaimeen ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Third Condition:</strong> The animal must be free of any defect that would prevent its slaughter from being valid and acceptable. These defects are of four types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <span style="color:#993300;">Clear defectiveness of the eye</span>: This is when the animal’s eye becomes sunken or it sticks out to the point that it looks like a knob or it becomes a pale white indicating clearly that it is one-eyed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. <span style="color:#993300;">Clear illness</span>: This is when the animal exhibits signs of sickness, such as a fever that keeps it from grazing and causes a loss of appetite, or an obvious scabies infection that will spoil its meat and harm a person’s health (if he eats it), or a deep wound that threatens to affect its health and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. <span style="color:#993300;">Clear limping</span>: This is when the animal is unable to step safely (without hurting itself) when walking.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. <span style="color:#993300;">Emaciation that causes brain loss</span>: This is based on what the Prophet said when he was asked about what types of animals one should avoid when sacrificing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He gestured with his hand and said: <strong>“They are four: The lame animal that clearly walks crookedly; the one-eyed animal that clearly has a defect in the eye; the sick animal that clearly has signs of illness; and the emaciated animal that is (usually) not picked.”</strong> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth was reported by Maalik in al-Muwatta from Al-Baraa’ bin ‘Aazib. In another version of this report narrated by Al-Baraa’ found in the <em>Sunan</em> collections, he said: “The Messenger of Allaah stood up amongst us and said: <strong>‘Four types (of animals) are not permissible to use as sacrificial offerings…’</strong> and he went on to mention them.” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore if these four defects are found in an animal, they prevent its slaughter and sacrifice from being valid. This goes as well for any other defect that is similar to or worse than these, which means that it is also not valid to sacrifice the following types of animals:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. A blind animal that cannot see with both its eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. An animal suffering from nausea until it releases its load and its harm is removed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. An animal that has been assisted in giving birth if natural delivery is difficult until the threat of danger is removed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. An animal afflicted by something fatal such as choking, falling from a high place, and so on until the threat of danger is removed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. A crippled animal, which is an animal that cannot walk due to a physical disability.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. An animal with one of its front legs or back legs broken.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if these last defects are added to the four mentioned in the narrations, the types of animals that cannot be slaughtered become ten in total. There are these six types plus the animals that suffer from the four previously mentioned defects.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 25 : Point 27</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And the Hajj and fighting jihaad along with the ruler continue. And the <em>Jumu`ah</em> Prayer behind them is allowed; and after it six <em>rak`ahs</em> are prayed, separating each pair of<em> rak`ahs</em>. This was the saying of Ahmad ibn Hanbal.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F368450792&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-hajj-and-fighting-jihaad-along-with-the-ruler-continue" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The functions carried out by the ruler are many, and the place to find them enumerated and to find them mentioned together, and where you can acquaint yourself with them is the books on the rulings relating to rulership (<em>al-ahkaamus-sultaaniyyah</em>) such as alAhkaamus-Sultaaniyyah of al-Maawardiyy and al-Ahkaamus-Sultaaniyyah of Aboo Ya`laa al-Hanbaliyy and books which have been written on this topic which explain the functions of the ruler. And it is mentioned in the books of <em>fiqh</em> and in the books of <em>`aqaa∙id</em> (creed and belief) also as occurs here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>Firstly</strong> </span>(from these functions), is that he (the ruler) is in charge of carrying out the <em>Jumu`ah</em> Prayer and the two `Eed Prayers and the Muslims pray behind him unless he chooses to appoint someone from the Scholars or from the Students of Knowledge to lead the people in Prayer. However, the basic principle is that he (the ruler) has more right to leading the Prayer with regard to the <em>Jumu`ah</em> Prayer (Friday Prayer) and the two `Eed Prayers. So if he appoints someone to do this then he may do so, and this is what action is upon at present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>Secondly</strong></span>, is that he is the one who establishes the Hajj and he leads the people performing Hajj. And he is in charge of them and he looks into any problems they may have.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>Thirdly</strong></span>, is establishment of jihaad in Allaah’s cause; this is from the functions carried out by the ruler. He is the one who gives command for it and he is the one who organises the flags and he is the one who chooses the armies and those who are going to fight. And he appoints the commanders and he appoints the squadrons (army units) and he appoints the armies and he provides the fighters with weaponry. And he gives them directions with regard to fighting the enemy and he specifies the direction in which they are to attack.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So jihaad is from the roles of the ruler; and jihaad is not fowdaa (chaos or anarchy) such that everyone who wants to take up arms and go and fight and attack does so and says, “I am fighting jihaad in Allaah’s cause!” This is not jihaad in Allaah’s cause. Jihaad in Allaah’s cause is properly arranged and it is regulated by legislated regulations (of the Sharee`ah, the Islaamic Law). But as for when it is opened up to chaos then it becomes mere destruction, and its harm becomes more than its benefit, if there is actually any benefit in it at all. So the harm resulting from it is greater. So affairs have regulating principles and jihaad is a tremendous affair. It requires that it is correctly regulated and it needs to be restricted by the rulings which are mentioned for jihaad in the Book and the Sunnah and in the speech of the People of Knowledge. The matter is not of fowdaa (chaos or anarchy) such that a person comes from the callers to fitnah (discord) and sets himself up as the leader for those people who are extremists or radicals or ignorant people, those who do not know, he becomes their leader and he says, “We will fight jihaad in Allaah’s cause.” This is counted as being one of the things that cause harm to Islaam and to the Muslims; and this is not jihaad because it is not restricted by the regulating principles which govern jihaad. And if it is not restricted by the regulating principles of jihaad then it just becomes fasaad (corruption) and it is not jihaad. And everything which exceeds its due limits then it turns over and it becomes its opposite. So they now say to those who criticise them, “You are preventing jihaad in Allaah’s cause.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we say, “We are not preventing jihaad in Allaah’s cause. However, we say that it is essential that jihaad is regulated by its legislated regulating principles, whereas what you people are doing is fowdaa (chaos) and it is not jihaad and Allaah did not command with it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So establishment of the Hajj and fighting jihaad and the <em>Jumu`ah</em> and the `Eed Prayer, these are from the functions of the waleeul-amr (the person in authority).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And praying the <em>Jumu`ah</em> Prayer behind them is permissible,”</strong> meaning, even if they have fisq (they commit open sins), even if they have acts of disobedience, still the person prays behind them because Prayer behind them retains unity and also a faasiq (an open sinner), if he does something that is good then you do good along with him. And for this reason when they said to `Uthmaan radiyAllaahu `anhu whilst he was being besieged, “So and so leads the people in Prayer and he is not the imaam (the ruler), rather he is just an imaam of fitnah (he is just the leader of discord/tribulation).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So `Uthmaan radiyAllaahu `anhu said, “O son of my brother, if the people do what is good then do that which is good along with them and if they do something evil then avoid their evil.” [01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if he prays then we pray along with him if he is the one in authority, even if he has open sins or acts of disobedience, because of the welfare which lies in doing that. Because the Prayer is worship and the sinful person, faasiq, if he prays then he should be encouraged upon that, supplication made for him. And the Companions they prayed behind rulers who had points against them such as al-Hajjaaj and others. The Companions of Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam prayed behind them in compliance with command of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and in order to retain unity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And he should pray after it six <em>rak`ahs</em>.”</strong> This is a matter of fiqh; it comes here in accordance with the mention of the <em>Jumu`ah</em> Prayer. So the <em>Jumu`ah</em> Prayer has no raatibah (regular Sunnah Prayer) before it. So whoever comes to the mosque then he should pray whatever is easy for him and then sit and wait (for the imaam to come out). And if he continues praying until the imaam attends then that is more excellent upon the basis that this is unrestricted optional Prayer; it has no connection to the <em>Jumu`ah</em> Prayer itself. As for the raatibah (regular Sunnah Prayer) of the <em>Jumu`ah</em> then it comes after it. Its least amount is two <em>rak`ahs</em> and its greatest amount, in what is famous, is four <em>rak`ahs</em> with two salutations (two salaams). And there comes in one saying (within the Hanbaliyy math.hab) that it is six <em>rak`ahs</em> with three salutations. Therefore, its least amount will be two <em>rak`ahs</em> and its greatest amount is six <em>rak`ahs</em>, or four <em>rak`ahs</em> as is what is famous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying <strong>“He separates between each pair of two <em>rak`ahs</em>. This was the saying of Ahmad ibn Hanbal.”</strong>[02] Meaning, that does not mean that he prays six <em>rak`ahs</em> altogether with one salaam (salutation at the end of it). Rather six <em>rak`ahs</em>; every two <em>rak`ahs</em> with one salaam (after it); or four <em>rak`ahs</em> with each pair of <em>rak`ahs</em> before the salaam, and this is better. And it’s being ascribed to Imaam Ahmad is because the author (Imaam alBarbahaaree) was a Hanbaliyy (meaning from the students of the students of Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal) and he was well acquainted with the position of Imaam Ahmad. This was a report from Ahmad that it is six rak`ahs. What is famous is that it is four rak`ahs. [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] Reported by al-Bukhaariyy in his Saheeh (no. 695) from `Ubaydillaah ibn `Adiyy ibn Khiyaar with it (this narration)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] There occurs in the Masaa·il of `Abdullaah, son of Imaam Ahmad, that `Abdullaah said, “I asked my father, ‘How many <em>rak`ahs</em> should a man pray after <em>Jumu`ah</em>?’ I said, ‘What is more beloved to you (that he should pray)?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he said, ‘If he wishes, he can pray four after the <em>Jumu`ah</em> and if he wishes he can pray six; except that he should give the salutation after each two <em>rak`ahs</em>. That is the saying with regard to all of the (optional) Prayers of the day; all of them are in pairs.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> There are a number of books of the students of Imaam Ahmad that report matters of fiqh from him and there are a number of separate books in that regard. There is the Masaa·il of his son `Abdullaah and Masaa·il of his student Aboo Daawood and Masaa·il of a number of other of his students. Each one is called the Masaa·il of Imaam Ahmad by such and such from his students. This one referred to here is the Masaa·il (The Questions of Fiqh) put to Imaam Ahmad, collected by his son `Abdullaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> In Riyaadus-Saaliheen we had the hadeeth of Ibn `Umar reported by alBukhaariyy and Muslim that the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam after the <em>Jumu`ah</em> entered his house and prayed two<em> rak`ahs</em>. Likewise in Saheeh Muslim there’s a hadeeth that Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said, “When one of you has prayed the <em>Jumu`ah</em> let him pray four after it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmiyy</strong> rahimahullaah mentioned this issue in his explanation and mentioned there are evidences for two and there are evidences of four.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said, “And the six (praying six) is one report from Imaam Ahmad and it was the saying, from the Companions, of `Aliyy ibn Abee Taalib and Aboo Moosaa radiyAllaahu `anhumaa; and from the taabi`een (it was the saying of) `Ataa and Mujaahid (the two great imaams of Makkah from the taabi`een; `Ataa bin Abee Rabaah and Mujaahid ibn Jabr) and of Humayd ibn `Abdir-Rahmaan and it was the saying of Sufyaan ath-Thowree, great imaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ahmad preferred the saying, as is the view of Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah, that what is preferred in his view is: <strong><span style="color:#808000;">if a person prays it in his house he prays two <em>rak`ahs</em> and if he prays it in the mosque he prays four.</span></strong> (He said,) “That is more established with regard to the evidence behind it.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people would go on the pilgrimage (Hajj) with Muslims and not bring any provisions or supplies with them. They would do this claiming that they were putting their trust in Allaah and that they would be provided for without them having to bring provisions along with them. So Allaah said: <b>“And take provision with you for the journey, but indeed the best provision is Taqwaa (righteousness)”</b> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 197], ordering them to take provisions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Provisions are of two types: The Provision of this world and the provision of the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The provision of the worldly life comes in the form of food, drink, clothes, and all of the other things that a person needs when he travels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the provision for the journey in the Hereafter, then it is Taqwaa. Allaah says: <b>“But indeed the best provision is Taqwaa.”</b> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 197]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So take provisions for your worldly life and take provisions for your Hereafter. Take provisions for your worldly life with food, drink and the necessary supplies for traveling so that you will not need to depend on others. And take provisions for your Hereafter with Taqwaa, which can be defined as implementing Allaah’s commandments while abandoning His prohibitions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is meant by Taqwaa is taking a wiqaayah, or a defense that protects you from Allaah’s punishment and anger, and protects you from the Fire. Such a defense can only be achieved by performing righteous actions. And with the Taqwaa of Allaah you will be able to save yourself from the Hellfire, as Allaah says: <b>“Then We shall save those who used to fear Allaah and were dutiful to Him. And We shall leave the wrongdoers therein (humbled) to their knees (in Hell).”</b> [Surah Maryam: 72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, nothing grants salvation except for righteous deeds. Faith in Allaah and righteous deeds are the provisions of the Hereafter, and they are a protection from His anger, His fire and His punishment. The servant is commanded to seek after the requirements of his religious and worldly affairs. He is obligated to seek after the requirements of his affairs of this life and the next. He is obligated to put his trust in Allaah and to implement the means. So there must be a combination of this and that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No one should understand the meaning of relying upon Allaah to be: Abandoning the require means. This is wrong. Nor should anyone understand that implementing the means suffices over putting one’s trust in Allaah. Rather, both – (1) relying upon Allaah and (2) implementing the required means – must be present.</p>

<p>Clip Extracted from the Tafseer of Surah Al-Kawthar</p>
<p><a title="Tafseer – Explanation Surah 78-114 – Tafseer Juz Amma – Dr Saleh as Saleh [Audio|En]" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2014/12/08/tafseer-explanation-surah-78-114-tafseer-juz-amma-dr-saleh-as-saleh/"><strong>Tafseer – Explanation Surah 78-114 – Tafseer Juz Amma</strong></a></p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The following is posted from Tafseer Ibn Kathir , Darussalam:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">﴿فَصَلِّ لِرَبِّكَ وَانْحَرْ ﴾</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Therefore turn in prayer to your Lord and sacrifice.</strong></span>) meaning, `just as We have given you the abundant goodness in this life and the Hereafter &#8212; and from that is the river that has been described previously &#8212; then make your obligatory and optional prayer, and your sacrifice (of animals) solely and sincerely for your Lord. Woship Him alone and do not associate any partner with him. And sacrifice pronouncing His Name alone, without ascribing any partner to Him.&#8217; This is as Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">﴿قُلْ إِنَّ صَلاَتِى وَنُسُكِى وَمَحْيَاىَ وَمَمَاتِى للَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ &#8211; لاَ شَرِيكَ لَهُ وَبِذَلِكَ أُمِرْتُ وَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ ﴾</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: &#8220;Verily, my Salah, my sacrifice, my living, and my dying are for Allah, the Lord of all that exists. He has no partner. And of this I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims.&#8221;</strong></span>) (6:162-163)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn `Abbas, `Ata,&#8217; Mujahid, `Ikrimah and Al-Hasan all said, &#8220;This means with this the Budn should be sacrificed.&#8221; Qatadah, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Ad-Dahhak, Ar-Rabi`, `Ata&#8217; Al-Khurasani, Al-Hakam, Isma`il bin Abi Khalid and others from the Salaf have all said the same. This is the opposite of the way of the idolators, prostrating to other than Allah and sacrificing in other than His Name. Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">﴿وَلاَ تَأْكُلُواْ مِمَّا لَمْ يُذْكَرِ اسْمُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ وَإِنَّهُ لَفِسْقٌ﴾</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And do not eat from what Allah&#8217;s Name has not been pronounced over, indeed that is Fisq</span></strong>.) (6:121)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Part 7 : The Condemnation of the People of Knowledge for this Dome</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that the people of knowledge &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on them &#8211; condemn what has been prohibited by the Sharia&#8217;. Some of them have clearly mentioned their condemnation and some of them -perhaps- have remained silent, since what is known is that there is no advantage to this speech.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps they took into account the permissibility of remaining silent because of the saying of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; to &#8216;Aeysha -radiAllaah anhu:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;If it were not that your people had recently left kufr (disbelief) I would have rebuilt the house (Ka&#8217;ba) on the foundations upon which Ibraheem built it.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Agreed upon by Bukharee and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is understood is that those who openly mentioned their condemnation fulfilled what Allaah had made obligatory upon them, which is advising for the sake of Islaam and the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following are some of those who condemned the building of this dome.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him &#8211; said in his book &#8216;Iqtidaa Siraat ul-Mustaqeem&#8217; :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;…….And this is why, when his apartment was built in the time of the Tabieen (the followers of the Companions) &#8211; I would sacrifice my mother and father for him &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- that<span style="color:#993300;"> they left the top of it as a skylight towards the sky</span>. And it was like that until recent times, with wax placed upon it and rocks on its edges which held it together.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The roof was projecting upwards towards the sky and it was like that at the time the masjid and the mimbar (pulpit) were burnt down in the year six hundred and fifty odd. The fire was so severe in the land of the Hijjaz that it lit up the necks of the camels in Basra. After that came the fitnah (trial) of the Tartars in Baghdad and other Fitn (trials) also came.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Then the Masjid was re-built as it had originally been, as was the roof, and a wooden wall was introduced around the apartment. Then, after a number of years, the dome was erected on the roof whilst there were those who condemned it.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Sanaani &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him &#8211; said in &#8216;Tatheer al-I&#8217;tiqaad&#8217; :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;If you say: This is the grave of the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, a great dome has been built upon it and a lot of money has been spent on it. Then, I say that this is major ignorance of the reality of the situation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Without doubt this dome was not built by the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, nor by his Companions, nor by their successors (Tabieen), nor the followers of the successors, nor the scholars of the Ummah &#8211; the Imaams of his people.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Rather, this dome was imposed on his grave &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; and was built by one of the latter kings of Misr (Eygpt), Qaloon as-Salihee, more well known as king al-Mansoor in the year 678.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He mentioned it in: &#8216;Tahqeeq an-Nasraah bi Talkheehs mu&#8217;aalim Dar al-Hijrah&#8217; and these matters are issued by the governments and not based upon evidences from the text.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">Shaykh Hussain bin Mahdi an-Nuaymi mentions, in his book &#8216;Ma&#8217;arij alAlbaab&#8217;, the statements of some of those who were tried as a result of taking the dome of the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; as sanction for the permissibility of building all domes. A Mufti states, &#8216;From what is well known is that the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; had a dome, just like the &#8216;Aawliya of Madeenah and the &#8216;Aawliya of the rest of the different cities. Building domes is the fashion in every era; it is believed that having a dome is the cause of receiving blessings.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nuaymi &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him &#8211; commented by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;I say: if this is the case, then what about the fact that the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, warned against this, he cautioned and cleared his blessed and pure self &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam from what you did. You did exactly what he specifically prohibited. Was it not sufficient for you that you opposed his command? This (alone) is evidence against yourselves. You were forward in the presence of the Messenger (ie his statement). Did he &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – allude to any of what you hold permissible? Was he pleased with that or did he not prohibit this? As for your belief of blessings descending, then this is from yourselves and not from Allaah, and Allaah has refuted you.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Ikhwaan &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on them &#8211; entered Madeenah at the time of AbdulAzeez &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him -, it was of great importance to them to remove the dome. If only they had done so, but they &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on them &#8211; feared that the fitnah from the <strong>Qubooreeyeen</strong> (the sect of grave-worshippers) would be greater than removing the dome i.e. that removing an evil might lead to something more evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look how many false arguments the Qubooreeyeen have when they are called to remove these domes, some of which are similar to al-Laat, Uzza and Habil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance. &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof for the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> is:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلِلَّهِ عَلَى النّاسِ حِجُّ البَيتِ مَنِ استَطاعَ إِلَيهِ سَبيلًا ۚ وَمَن كَفَرَ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَنِيٌّ عَنِ العالَمينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> to Allaah&#8217;s Sacred House is an obligatory duty that is owed to Allaah by those who have the ability to make their way there. And whoever rejects the obligation of the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em>, then Allaah has no need of him or any of the creation</span>. </strong>[3:97]<strong> </strong><sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">41</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[41] : <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jews claimed that they were Muslims and that they were upon the religion of Ibraaheem, so Allaah the Majestic and Most High tested them in this <em>aayah</em>, and He said:<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلِلَّهِ عَلَى النّاسِ حِجُّ البَيتِ مَنِ استَطاعَ إِلَيهِ سَبيلًا ۚ وَمَن كَفَرَ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَنِيٌّ عَنِ العالَمينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> to Allaah&#8217;s Sacred House is an obligatory duty that is owed to Allaah by those who have the ability to make their way there. And whoever rejects the obligation of the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em>, then Allaah has no need of him or any of the creation.</span> </strong>[3:97]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, if you are Muslims, then perform the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em>, because Allaah has made the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> to the Sacred House obligatory upon the Muslims, if you do not perform it, and you refuse to perform it, then this is a proof that you are not Muslims, and you are not upon the religious way of Ibraaheem:<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن كَفَرَ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَنِيٌّ عَنِ العالَمينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And whoever rejects the obligation of the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em>, then Allaah has no need of him or any of the creation. </strong></span>[3:97]</p>
<p><strong>وَلِلَّهِ </strong>: Meaning: this is an obligation, a rite, and a binding duty which is due for Allaah, the Perfect and Most High from mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>حِجُّ </strong>: Its meaning in the language is al-qasd (to head towards an intended goal). And the word Hajj in the legislation is to head towards the honourable Ka`bah and the Sacred sites (of pilgrimage) at a particular time, and to carry out specific acts of worship and they are the rites of the Hajj.</p>
<p><strong>حِجُّ البَيتِ</strong>: Meaning: the Ka`bah and whatever is round about it from the sites of pilgrimage which follow on from it.</p>
<p><strong>مَنِ استَطاعَ إِلَيهِ سَبيلًا </strong>: This explains the condition being obligatory, and it is bodily and monetary capability; bodily capability such that he is able to work, ride, and move from his land to Makkah from whatever place he is in upon the earth. This is the bodily capability. It excludes the person who is permanently unable, such as a person with an illness which persists, the feeble old person, and such a one who does not have the bodily ability. But if he has monetary capability, then he should deputize someone to perform the Hajj on his behalf, the obligatory Hajj of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for monetary capability, then it is having the transport necessary to carry him, the riding animal, the plane, or the ship, each as is appropriate to the time; and that he has wealth which is sufficient for him to seek transport to convey him for the performance of the <em><u>H</u></em><em>ajj</em>; and also, that he has provision and money for the journey, going and returning; and for his dependence, such that they will have sufficient funds until he returns to them. So, provision means that he has sufficient funds to suffice him upon his journey, and to suffice his dependents; his children, his parents, his wife, and everyone it is obligatory to spend upon; that he gives them that which will suffice them until he gets back to them, after securing guarantees for the payments of any debts which are upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this wealth is surplus, remaining after his debts have been dealt with. So, if this is available, then this will be his ability to make his way there, &#8220;provision and transport&#8221;<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> as occurs in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu `anhumaa</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whoever does not have the ability, meaning: he does not have the provision nor the transport, then the <em><u>H</u></em><em>ajj</em> is not upon him, because he does not have the ability to do it. So the condition for the <em><u>H</u></em><em>ajj</em> being obligatory is ability.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since the people come to the <em><u>H</u></em><em>ajj</em> from far away, from all the regions of the earth, and every distant place, and it requires spending, and involves some difficulty and toil, and it may bring about dangerous situations, then from the Mercy of Allaah is that He made it binding only once in a lifetime. And whatever is in addition to that is supererogatory. This is from the Mercy of Allaah the Perfect and Most High, that He did not make it obligatory upon the Muslim every year just as the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">» إن الله فرض عليكم الحج فحجوا ، « قال  الأقرع بن حابس &#8211; رضى الله عنه-  أكل سنة يا رسول الله ؟ فسكت عنه الرسول ﷺ ثم أعاد السؤال ، فسكت عنه النبي ﷺ ثم أعاد السؤال ، فقال النبي ﷺ»  لو قلت نعم لوجبت ، ولما  استطعتم ، الحج مرة واحدة ، فما زاد فهو تطوع «</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Allaah has made the </strong><strong><em><u>H</u></em></strong><strong><em>ajj</em></strong><strong> obligatory upon you, so perform the </strong><strong><em><u>H</u></em></strong><strong><em>ajj</em></strong>.» Al-Aqra` bin <u>H</u>aabis <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu `anhu </em>said: Is it every year O Messenger of Allaah? So the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> remained silent. Then he repeated the question, and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> remained silent. And then he repeated the question again, and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> said: «<strong>If I were to say yes, it would become obligatory and you would not be able to do it. The </strong><strong><em><u>H</u></em></strong><strong><em>ajj</em></strong><strong> is a single time, and whatever is in addition, then it supererogatory</strong>.»<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most Perfect:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن كَفَرَ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَنِيٌّ عَنِ العالَمينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever rejects the obligation of the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em>, then Allaah has no need of him or any of the creation</span>. </strong>[3:97]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It contains a proof that whoever refuses to perform the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> and he is able to, and he does not perform the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em>, then he is a disbeliever, because Allaah said: «<strong>whoever rejects</strong>» meaning: whoever refuses to perform the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> when he is able to perform it, then he has committed <em>kufr</em>. [This <em>kufr</em>] may be <em>kufr as<u>gh</u>ar</em> (lesser <em>kufr</em>), but whoever abandons it whilst denying its obligation, then this is <em>kufr akbar</em> (major <em>kufr</em>) by consensus of the Muslims. As for a person who acknowledges its obligation, but abandons it out of laziness, then this is lesser <em>kufr</em>. However, if the person dies and he has wealth, then someone should perform the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> on his behalf using money which he has left behind, because it is the debt of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, upon him. And this <em>aayah</em> shows the obligation of performing <em><u>H</u>ajj</em>, it is a pillar from the pillars of Islaam. The Messenger of Allaah <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> explained that it is a pillar from the pillars of Islaam in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Jibreel<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> and in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Ibn `Umar.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> was made obligatory in the nine year [after the <em>Hijrah</em>] upon one saying, and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> did not perform the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> in that year, rather he performed the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> in the year after it, in the tenth year. Why is this? This is because, he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em>:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« أرسل عليا ينادي في الناس في الموسم» : أن لا يحج بعد هذا العام مشرك ، ولا يطوف بالبيت عريان «</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">sent `Alee to call out to the people in the pilgrimage: «<strong>No person of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> may perform <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> after this year, and no naked person may perform <em><u>t</u>awaaf</em> around the House</strong>.»<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when the people of <em>shirk</em> and the naked people were prevented from the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> in the tenth year, the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> performed the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em>, the Farewell <em><u>H</u>ajj</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Transcription of the Audio:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillah hir Rahman nir Raheem. Alhamdulillahi Rabbil Aalameen wa sallalaahu ala nabeeyena Muhammad wa alaa alihi wa sahbhi wa sallama tasleeman kaseera</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Second Question is why was the Ka&#8217;abah called Baytullah Al Haraam, The inviolable house of Allah ?.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Ka&#8217;bah was called Baytullah i.e The House of Allah. That is because it is the place of magnification of Allah(عز و جل) Most Mighty and Most Majestic.People come to it from all places in order to offer an obligation which Allah had ordained upon them and also because people direct themselves in its direction while in their prayers, wherever they may be fulfilling one of the conditions of the Salah i.e. directing one self towards the Qibla.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) stated in Surah Al- Baqarah (2:144) :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">قَدۡ نَرَىٰ تَقَلُّبَ وَجۡهِكَ فِى ٱلسَّمَآءِ‌ۖ فَلَنُوَلِّيَنَّكَ قِبۡلَةً۬ تَرۡضَٮٰهَا‌ۚ فَوَلِّ وَجۡهَكَ شَطۡرَ ٱلۡمَسۡجِدِ ٱلۡحَرَامِ‌ۚ وَحَيۡثُ مَا كُنتُمۡ فَوَلُّواْ وُجُوهَكُمۡ شَطۡرَهُ ۥ‌ۗ وَإِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلۡكِتَـٰبَ لَيَعۡلَمُونَ أَنَّهُ ٱلۡحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّهِمۡ‌ۗ وَمَا ٱللَّهُ بِغَـٰفِلٍ عَمَّا يَعۡمَلُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Verily! We have seen the turning of your (Muhammad&#8217;s صلى الله عليه وسلم) face towards the heaven. Surely, We shall turn you to a Qiblah (prayer direction) that shall please you, so turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid- Al-Harâm (at Makkah). And wheresoever you people are, turn your faces (in prayer) in that direction. Certainly, the people who were given the Scriptures (i.e. Jews and the Christians) know well that, that (your turning towards the direction of the Ka&#8217;bah at Makkah in prayers) is the truth from their Lord. And Allâh is not unaware of what they do.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) narrated it to Himself added it when he mentioned the Ka&#8217;abah as an honour and magnification of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is because that which is related to Allah in the construct of the statements by Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) is divided into two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) The Attribute of Himself (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى)<br />
2) The creature of  his creation</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it is an attribute, then it is related because it is established with Him and Allah(عز و جل) is qualified by it, it is His attribute like Allah&#8217;s hearing, Allah&#8217;s sight, Allah&#8217;s knowledge, Allah&#8217;s ability, Allah&#8217;s speech and other than that from His most mighty and magnificent attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it s a creature from his creation, then it is added to Allah (عز و جل) in the construct as away of honouring and magnification and in this way Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى)  related the Ka&#8217;abah to Himself when He said in Surah Al Hajj (22:26):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَطَهِّرۡ بَيۡتِىَ لِلطَّآٮِٕفِينَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">And (remember) when We showed Ibrahim (Abraham) the site of the (Sacred) House (the Ka&#8217;bah at Makkah) (saying): &#8220;Associate not anything (in worship) with Me, [La ilaha ill-Allah (none has the right to be worshipped but Allah Islamic Monotheism], and sanctify <span style="color:#ff0000;">My House</span> for those who circumambulate it, and those who stand up for prayer, and those who bow (submit themselves with humility and obedience to Allah), and make prostration (in prayer, etc.);&#8221; )</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He said &#8216;My House&#8217; (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى). He narrated it it to Himself in the construct of the verse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also He added to Himself the masaajid (the Mosques) as He said in Surah Al Baqarah (2:114):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ومن اظلم ممن منع مساجد الله ان يذكر فيها اسمه وسعى في خرابها اولئك ما كان لهم ان يدخلوها الا خائفين لهم في الدنيا خزي ولهم في الاخرة عذاب عظيم</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And who is more unjust than those who forbid Allah&#8217;s Name be glorified and mentioned much (i.e. prayers and invocations, etc.) in <span style="color:#ff0000;">Allah&#8217;s Mosques</span> and strive for their ruin? It was not fitting that such should themselves enter them (Allah&#8217;s Mosques) except in fear. For them there is disgrace in this world, and they will have a great torment in the Hereafter.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You see that now, Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) added the mosques in the  construct to Himself in the relation &#8216; &#8216;Allah&#8217;s Mosques&#8221; and also  (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) He may do the same regarding some of his creatures in order to make clear His comprehensive possession as in His statement  (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) in Surah Al Jasiya (45:13):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;وسخر لكم ما في السماوات وما في الارض جميعا منه ان في ذلك لايات لقوم يتفكرون&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And has subjected to you all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth; it is all as a favour and kindness from Him. Verily, in it are signs for a people who think deeply.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore  in summary  Allah  (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) referred the Ka&#8217;abah to Himself as an honour and magnification and no one should think that Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) reffered the ka&#8217;abah to Himself because it is &#8220;a place in which He resides&#8221;. This is impossible because (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) encompasses everything and nothing from his creatures encompass Him, rather His Kursee(سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) encompasses the Heavens and the Earth, as Allah Stated in Surah Al Baqarah (2:255) that his Kursee extends over the Heavens and the Earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in Surah Zumar (39:67):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وما قدروا الله حق قدره والارض جميعا قبضته يوم القيامة والسماوات مطويات بيمينه سبحان</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And on the Day of Resurrection the whole of the earth will be grasped by His Hand and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He is above His heavens ascended the throne in the most majestic way that befits Him and it&#8217;s not possible that He ( سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) dwells in any of his creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allah knows the best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Maajah -rahimahullaah- reported in his &#8220;Sunan&#8221; [The Book of the Rites of Hajj: chapter (5): The Virtue of the Supplication of the person performing Hajj: (no.2893)]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Muhammad ibn Tareef narrated to us, saying: `Imraan ibn `Uyainah narrated to us: from `Ataa· ibn as-Saa·ib: from Mujaahid: from Ibn `Umar: from the Prophet sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam, that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The fighter in Allaah’s cause, and the person performing Hajj, and the person performing `Umrah are Allaah’s deputation: He called them, and they responded to Him; and they ask of Him, and He gives to them</strong></span>&gt;&gt;.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaanee -rahimahullaah- said: &#8220;Hasan&#8221;; and he said in &#8220;as-Saheehah&#8221; (no.1820), having quoted a supporting narration reported by al-Bazzaar (no.1153) as a hadeeth of Jaabir: &#8220;The hadeeth, when the two chains of narration are gathered is &#8220;Hasan&#8221;.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Imaam Ibn Maajah -rahimahullaah- reported (no.2895): &#8220;Aboo Bakr ibn Abee Shaybah narrated to us, saying: Yazeed ibn Haaroon narrated to us: from `Abdul-Malik ibn Abee Sulaymaan: from Abuz-Zubayr: from Safwaan ibn `Abdillaah ibn Safwaan, who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I was married to a daughter of Abud-Dardaa·, so he came to her and he found Ummud-Dardaa·, but he did not find Abud-Dardaa·. So she said to him: &#8220;Do you intend to perform Hajj this year?&#8221; He said: &#8220;Yes.&#8221; She said: &#8220;Then supplicate to Allaah for good for us, since the Prophet sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The supplication which a person makes for his brother in his absence is responded to. There will be an Angel by his head saying: ‘Aameen’ [O Allaah! Grant it], to his supplication, ‘and may you receive the like of it’.</strong> </span>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>He said: Then I went out to the market place, and I met Abud-Dardaa·, and he narrated the like of that to me from the Prophet sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaanee -rahimahullaah- said: &#8220;Saheeh.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise and thanks are to Allah, the Lord of the worlds, and I send prayers and blessings on our Prophet, Muhammad and upon all his family and Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>How Should a Person Pray in an Airplane?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 . He should offer the voluntary prayers in an airplane while he is sitting in his seat in whatever direction the airplane was facing, indicating the bowing and prostrating (by inclining his head), making the prostration lower than the bowing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. He should not offer the obligatory prayers in an airplane, unless he is able to face towards the Qiblah throughout the whole of the prayer and he is also able to bow, prostrate, stand and sit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. If he is unable to do that, he should delay the prayer until he lands at the airport and then pray on the ground. If he fears that the time for the prayer will expire before the airplane lands, he should delay it until the time of the next prayer. This is the case if it is one of those prayers that may be combined with another, such as Zuhr with &#8216;Asr or Maghrib with &#8216;Isha&#8217;. If he fears that the time for the next prayer will expire, he should pray them both in the airplane before the time ends and perform whatever conditions, pillars and obligations of the prayer he is able to. For example: If the airplane took off just before sunset and the sun set while he was in the air, then he should not offer the Maghrib prayer until the airplane lands at the airport, he disembarks, and then prays on the ground. But if he fears that the time for offering the Maghrib prayer will expire, he should delay it until the time of &#8216;Isha&#8217; and offer them both together, combining them and delaying the Maghrib prayer until the time of the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer after he descends. But if he fears that the time for the isha prayer will expire &#8211; and it expires at midnight &#8211; he should offer them before the time expires in the airplane.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The manner of performing the obligatory prayer in the airplane is to stand facing the Qiblah and make the Takbir. Then he recites Sural Al-Fatihah and the words which it is prescribed to recite before it, such as the opening supplication (Du&#8217;a Al- Istiftah) and some Qur&#8217;anic Verses after it. Then he should bow, then straighten up from bowing, and relax in a standing position, then prostrate, then straighten up from prostration, and relax in a sitting position, then prostrate again, then do likewise in the remainder of the prayer. If he is unable to prostrate, he should sit and indicate the prostration while sitting, and if he does not know the Qiblah, and no one reliable can inform him of it, he should use his judgement and try to ascertain it, then pray according to his judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. The prayer of the traveller in an airplane is shortened, so he performs the four Rak&#8217;ah prayer as two Rak&#8217;ahs like other travellers.</p>

<p>1 . He should perform Ghusl in his house and remain in his normal clothing, or if he wishes, he may don the garments of Ihram.</p>
<p>2. Once the airplane is close to passing over the starting point, he should don the garments of Ihram, if he has not done so already.</p>
<p>3. When the airplane passes over the starting point, he should make the intention for commencing the rites and say the Talbiyyah according to his intention either Hajj or &#8216;Umrah.</p>
<p>4. If he assumes Ihram before passing over the starting point as a precaution, being fearful of remissness or forgetfulness, then there is no objection.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Advice for those about to perform Hajj</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Fourthly.</b> And be very careful not <strong>to walk directly in front of anyone praying in the Haraam </strong>mosque, not to speak of other mosques and prying places as the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“If the one walking between the hands of one praying knew what were upon him then it would be better for him to stand still for forty (…) than that he should walk between his hands.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Maalik, al-Bukhaaree, Muslim, the 4 Sunan of Abu Juhaim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is a general text covering everyone walking in front, and everyone praying – and there is no authentic Hadith to make any exception for the one doing so in the Haraam Masjid – and you should pray therein like any other place towards a sutrah – according to the general nature of the Hadith regarding that – and there are also some narrations from the Companions particularly about the Masjid-ul-Haraam – which I have mentioned in ‘The Original’.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of this when someone goes to Hajj so that it can be said of him <strong>“Hajji so and so.”</strong> The title Hajji (or Al-Hajj in Arabic) was not a term that was known to the righteous predecessors (Salaf as-Saalih), so we cannot hear from any of them that he said about his brother <strong>“Hajji so and so.”</strong> Rather, this is from the innovations of those in recent times.

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Chapter 13 : Warning Against Having Extremism in the Deen</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the great lessons of benefit for the pilgrim during his Hajj to the House of Allaah is the important lesson of taking the <strong>middle course and being just in all matters</strong>, keeping away from extremism, negligence, falling into excess or heedlessness. Allaah Ta’ala has said regarding this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Thus We have made you a just and the best nation, that you be witnesses over mankind and the Messenger be a witness over you.</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah: 143]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of His saying &lt;&lt; <strong>just and the best nation</strong> &gt;&gt; is: trustworthy witnesses, who do not shy away from the truth, so that they exaggerate, nor that they become unmindful but are are balanced and are just.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hajj is full of great experiences and magnificent lessons which show the great importance of the straight path and of being balanced. From the most important circumstances in this great issue is looking to the guidance of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and his Sunnah regarding <strong>stoning the Jamaar</strong> and considering it in light of what has been mentioned by the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam. After that, look at the state of the people in comparison to the Prophet’s Sunnah and you will see that the condition of these people is either that of exaggeration and excess or shortcoming and negligence, except for those whom Allaah has given the understanding of the religion and has honoured with adherence to the Prophetic Sunnah and imitation of his guidance and example.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Imaam Ahmad, Nis’aee and Ibn Majah on the authority of Abdullah bin ‘Abbas –RadhiAllaahu anhuma- who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘The Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said to me on the morning of ‘Aqaba while he was on his she-camel: ‘Collect small stones for me.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So I collected seven small stones for him from the little stones and began to shake off their dust from his palm while he was saying: ‘Throw stones the likes of these (type and size stones).’ </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Then he said: ‘O you people beware of exaggerating in the Deen because what destroyed those before you was indeed exaggeration in the Deen.’</strong></span> [1]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This chain of narration is authentic according to the conditions of Muslim as Shaykh-ul-Islam -Rahimullaah- and others have mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- saying in the hadeeth: ‘Throw stones the likes of these (type and size stones).’ i.e. the stones that were gathered for him had a specified size as is mentioned in the hadeeth. The stones were the size of those used for stoning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word al-Hassa (stone) does not carry the meaning of small sized stones, such as pebbles, nor does it carry the meaning of a large sized stone, such as a rock but rather, what has been legislated is in between.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though this issue has been clearly discussed with detailed explanation, if you were to compare this to the actions of some Muslims ignorant of the Prophet’s -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- Sunnah you would find their actions relating to stoning the Jamaarat to be very strange. You will find them fluctuating between exaggeration and deficiency, increase and falling short or between excess and negligence. The truth, however, is found somewhere inbetween them. The Muslim does not have shortcomings regarding the Sunnah of the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- unlike those who are negligent and incompetent or those who are excessive and exaggerate. The Muslim is just and balanced.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards the saying of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -: ‘<strong>Beware of extremism</strong>.’ then this statement is general and it applies to all types of extremism in all aspects of belief and actions because the ruling derived is taken from the general wording of this hadeeth and not the specific reason for which the statement was revealed. The Muslim is prohibited from extremism in all circumstances and in all his affairs. He is ordered to follow the way of the Noble Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and adhere to his Sunnah in all circumstances.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the Shaytan strives absolutely to turn the believers, the slaves of Allaah, away from the right path and keep them far away from Allaah&#8217;s straight path either through extremism or negligence. The Shaytan uses every which way he can to be victorious.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as some of the Salaf said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Allaah did not command anything except that Shaytan incites evil with two commands; either negligence and shortcoming or exceeding the limits and extremism and he does not mind with which of the two he is victorious.’</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaytan is seated in the path of the Muslim. He does not become lax, nor does he become bored of his relentless plotting or his wait to ambush the Muslim. He strives absolutely to increase the Muslim in misguidance and to divert him from the straight path and clear guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn al-Qayyim -Rahimullaah</strong>&#8211; said in his great book ‘<strong>Ighatha allhaffan min Masayid ash-Shaytaan</strong>’ :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘From his (Shaytan&#8217;s) plots (may Allaah have protect us and you from him) is that he scrutinizes the soul until he knows which of the two strengths can be overcome, the strength of boldness and courage or the strength of abstention, humility and shame. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If Shaytan sees that the soul leans towards humility and abstention, he begins to hinder him and weaken the Muslim’s endeavour and resolve in what he has been ordered and charged with. So Shaytan makes it easy for him to leave that off until he regularly leaves off (what he has been ordered with) or lessens his (following) and neglects Allaah’s orders.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If Shaytan sees that the soul leans towards the strength of boldness, zeal and lofty aspirations, he causes him to undervalue the commands of Allaah and makes him imagine that what he has is insufficient such that he needs to exaggerate and do extra along with that. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Therefore, the Shaytan causes the first to reduce in what Allaah has commanded and causes the second to exceed. Most people, except very few, fall either reduction or excess &#8211; these two valleys &#8211; the valley of shortcoming and the valley of extremism. Only a very small number are steadfast on the path the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and what his Companions were upon.’</strong> </span>[2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Ibn al-Qayyim -Rahimullaah- cites many examples of this, from different angles of the Deen, dividing the people into three groups: the extremists, the negligent and the people of the middle and straight path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed being upright in all matters, taking the middle course and being far away from extremism and negligence is the correct methodology and the straight path which the believers are required to follow, just as Allaah commanded in His Book and His Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- ordered. So truly being in the middle and being upright is holding onto the restrictions Allaah has laid down for His slaves, such that whatever is not from the religion is not added to it nor is anything from the religion excluded. This is what Allaah entrusts the believers with and what He commands them with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta&#8217;ala said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And those, who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor niggardly, but hold a medium (way) between those (extremes)</strong> </span>&gt;&gt; [al-Furqan :67]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta&#8217;ala said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your neck, nor stretch it forth to its utmost reach (like a spendthrift), so that you become blameworthy and in severe poverty</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [al-Isra: 29]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah Ta&#8217;ala said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And give to the kindred his due and to the poor and to the wayfarer. But spend not wastefully (your wealth) in the manner of a spendthrift</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [al-Isra:26]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah Ta&#8217;ala said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>and eat and drink but waste not by extravagance</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [‘Aaraaf:31]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta&#8217;ala said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And be moderate (or show no insolence) in your walking, and lower your voice</strong></span>&gt;&gt; [Luqmaan:19]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, it is authentically reported in the hadeeth of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘The middle course, the middle course will make you reach paradise.</strong></span>’[3]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means: it is binding on you to take the middle course in all matters of speech and action. Moderation is being in the middle, between two extremes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also authentically reported in Musnad and others that the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Take the middle course of guidance, indeed the one who is severe in the Deen, then it will overcome him</strong></span>.’[4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas’ood –RadhiAllaahu anhu- used to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Being restrained within the Sunnah is better than striving in Bida</strong></span>’.’[5]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Deen of Allaah is in the middle, between the one who goes to extremes and the one who is negligent. The best of people are those in the middle who have raised themselves above the shortcoming of the neglectful, but do not join the exaggeration of those who go beyond the limits. Rather the best of people stick to the guidance of the leader of the Messengers, the one chosen by The Lord of the Worlds who is an example for all people, Muhammad bin Abdullah, may Allaah&#8217;s Peace and Prayers be upon him, his Family and all his Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Chapter 11: <strong>Shaving the Head<br />
<a title="Lessons of Creed Acquired From The Hajj – By ‘AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-Badr" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2012/10/06/lessons-of-creed-acquired-from-the-hajj-by-abdurrazzaq-bin-abdul-muhsin-al-badr/">Lessons of Creed Acquired From The Hajj<br />
</a>By  Shaykh AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The actions of the day of an-Nahr, the tenth day of the month of Dhul-Hijjah, are indeed four well-known actions which are the stoning, the slaughter, shaving the head and then the Tawaaf. The discussion here will be about shaving the head or shortening the hair as worship for Allaah in obedience to Him and seeking closeness to Him on this great day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaving is completely removing the hair of the head while shortening is lessening the hair of the head all over. Shaving or shortening the hair is one of the obligations of Hajj and Umrah, it is not permissible to leave it, and the evidence is the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Certainly, you shall enter masjid al-Haram; if Allaah wills, secure, (some) having your heads shaved, and (some) having your head hair cut short, having no fear</strong></span>&gt;&gt; [Fath : 27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qadaamah –Rahimullaah- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘If it was not from the rites of Hajj, Allaah would not have described them this way.’</strong> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Bukhari and Muslim from the hadeeth of Ibn Abbas –RadhiAllaahu anhu- who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘When the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- came to Makkah he ordered his Companions to make Tawaaf of the House and of Safa and Marwa, then to come out of Ihraam and shave or shorten their hair.’</strong> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, it is one of the obligations of Hajj and Umrah. So whoever does not shave or shorten their hair, then it is necessary to atone for this by slaughtering a sacrificial animal. It (i.e. shaving/shortening) is a sign that the time period for Ihraam has ended and it imitates the actions of the Messenger &#8211; alayhi as-sallat wa sallam- where he shaved his head and ordered his Companions to shave their heads, casting aside their impurities and removing dishevelled hair. Shaving the head is the act of humbly placing the forehead in front of its Lord, due to His greatness, and in submission due to His Honour and it is from the most intense forms of Uboodiyah (worship) for Allaah Azza Wa Jal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when the Muslims performs this great act of obedience and important worship in reverence of Allaah and in imitation of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- it is obligatory upon him to <strong>know that shaving the head or shortening the hair is done to worship and seek closeness to Allaah and that it is not permissible to perform it for anyone other than Allaah –subhanahu wa Ta’ala</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great Imaam, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaykh-ul-Islaam ibn Taymeeyah -Rahimullaah–</strong></span> was asked about a people who shave their heads at the command of their shaykhs at such graves as they glorify while regarding it as a means seeking closeness to Allaah and worship: is all of this a Sunnah or a Bida? Is shaving the head, generally, a Sunnah or Bida?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He –Rahimullaah- replied: <strong>‘Shaving the head is of four types</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>One of them is shaving the head in Hajj and Umrah</strong></span> and this is from what Allaah and His Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- have ordered. It is legislated and ordered in the Book, the Sunnah and the consensus of the Ummah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#008000;">Certainly, you shall enter masjid al-Haram; if Allaah wills, secure, (some) having your heads shaved, and (some) having your head hair cut short, having no fear</span></strong>&gt;&gt; [Fath : 27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are multiple narrations on the authority of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallamthat he shaved his head in his Hajj and Umrah as did his Companions. From them were those who shaved their heads and some who shortened their hair. Shaving is better than shortening because <strong style="line-height:1.5;">the Prophet said: ‘O Allaah forgive those who shave their heads.’ The people said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and those who shorten their hair?’ He said ‘O Allaah forgive those who shave their heads.’ The people said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and those who shorten their hair?’ He said ‘O Allaah forgive those who shave their heads.’ The people said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and those who shorten their hair?’ He said: ‘And those who shorten their hair.’</strong><span style="line-height:1.5;"> [3]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the farewell Hajj he -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- commanded the Companions who had brought a sacrificial animal with them to shorten their hair if they had performed Tawaaf of the House and had walked between Safa and Marwa for Umrah and then to shave their heads once they had completed the Hajj. So (in this way) he combined for them, firstly, shortening their hair and, secondly, shaving their heads.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The second type of shaving the head</strong> </span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">is for a need</span>, such as shaving the head for treatment</strong>. This is also permissible according to the Book, the Sunnah and the consensus of the scholars. Indeed Allaah has permitted the Muhrim (pilgrim), for whom it is not usually allowed to have his head shaved until completion of the Hajj rites, to shave his head if he is suffering as Allaah Ta’ala mentions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>and do not shave your heads until the Hady (sacrificial animal) reaches the place of sacrifice. And whosoever of you is ill or has an ailment in his scalp (necessitating shaving), he must pay a Fidyah (ransom) of either observing Saum (fasts) (three days) or giving Sadaqah (charity &#8211; feeding six poor persons) or offering sacrifice (one sheep)</strong> </span>&gt;&gt; [Baqarah :196]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What has been established by agreement of the Muslims is the hadeeth of Ka’b bin Ujraah that when the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- passed by him in the Umrah of Al-Hudaybiyah lice were falling from his head, so the Prophet said to him: ‘Are your lice harming you?’ K’ab replied: ‘Yes.’ So the Prophet said: ‘Shave your head and sacrifice a sheep, or fast three days or feed a group of six needy people.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The authenticity of this Hadeeth is agreed upon and has been received with acceptance by all the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The third type of shaving the head is that which is done for worship, religion and Zuhd (abstention from loving worldly things) in other than Hajj or Umrah</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, some of the people command the one who repents, once he has repented to shave his head. Similar is the one who shaves the head as a sign of being from the people of rituals and religion or as a sign of the perfection of Zuhd and worship or as a sign that the one who shaves is better, more religious or has more Zuhd than the one who does not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there are those who adhere to certain shaykhs such that if they repent, they shave their heads or they cut some of his hair. So the shaykh specifies who should have the scissors and prayer rug so he can pray on that rug (and not with the Muslims). His cutting hair from the heads of the people is from the complete authority befitting him and someone who is imitated in order to make the people repent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So all of this is Bida’ which has neither been commanded by Allaah, nor by His Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</strong>. It is not obligatory nor has it been recommended by any one scholar of the Deen. Not one of the Companions did this, nor did any of those who followed the companions in goodness, neither the scholars of the Muslims who were well known for Zuhd and worship nor the Companions, the successors or those who came after them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There were those who accepted Islam at the time of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- but he never used to order them to shave their heads if they entered Islaam nor did he cut anyone’s hair. He didn’t pray on a rug but, rather, he used to pray as an Imaam with all the Muslims. He used to pray on what they used to pray, sit where they used to sit and he never used to make himself distinct from them by sitting on something special, whether a prayer rug or anything else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever takes this Bida’ -which is not obligatory or even recommended- as a means of seeking closeness and obedience or as a path to Allaah making it a completion of the Deen or orders the repentant to do it, both the Zahid (the one who abstains from loving worldly things) and the worshipper, then he is a misguided person outside the path of ar-Rahmaan (Allaah the Most Merciful), following the footsteps of the Shayateen.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Shaykh ul-Islaam –Rahimullaah- mentioned <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>the fourth type of shaving the head</strong></span> which is shaving the head as other than a ritual or for other than a need, neither seeking closeness to Allaah nor seeking to be religious. He mentions that the people of knowledge have two opinions regarding this, which are two narrations attributed to Imaam Ahmad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first is that it is disliked and this is the Madhab of Maalik and others. The second is that it is permissible and this is well known amongst the companions of Abu Haneefa and ash-Shafi&#8217;ee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Imaam Ahmad mentions the evidence that the scholars use for each of these sayings. [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim</strong> mentions a similar division to what has preceded in his book &#8216;Zaad al-Ma&#8217;ad&#8217;. He mentions that from the different types of shaving the head there is one that is Shirk and one that is Bida’. <strong>Shirk being the one shaving his head for other than Allaah –Subhaanhu- such as those who follow shaykhs and who shave their heads for their shaykhs</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of them will say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;I have shaved my head for so-and-so and you have shaved your head for soand-so.’ This is the same as saying: ‘I have done Sadjah (prostration) for so- and-so,’ because shaving the head is done with humility, in worship and with submissiveness and it is done for the completion of Hajj.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he mentions that the misguided shaykhs deceive their followers by causing them to shave their heads for them, just as they mislead them into prostrating to them. [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this is clear Shirk and a great lie, we ask Allaah for security.</p>

<p><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Question</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Does &#8216;Umrah in the month of Ramadan satisfy for the obligation of Hajj due to the Messenger&#8217;s (صلى الله عليه وسلم) statement, &#8220;<strong>Whoever performs ‘Umrah in Ramadan is like the one who makes Hajj with me</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Shaykh Abdul- Azeez Bin Baaz:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umrah in Ramadan does not compensate for Hajj. However, it has the merit/virtue of Hajj due to his (صلى الله عليه وسلم) statement, &#8216;<strong>Umrah in Ramadan equals a Hajj&#8217;</strong> or he said &#8216;<strong>a Hajj with me</strong>&#8216;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means in regards to merit and reward and it does not mean it is equivalent to it and replaces it such that he does not have to perform Hajj. No, rather he still must perform the Hajj, the Hajj of Islam (the obligatory Hajj) even if he makes &#8216;Umrah in Ramadan according to all of the scholars. Thus, with &#8216;Umrah in Ramadan, the merit of Hajj is attained from the aspect of reward and excellence, but it does not compensate for the Hajj of Islam.</p>

<strong>Audio Source</strong>: <a href="http://urdu-islamic-audio.com/2015/05/28/my-umrah-selfie/" target="_blank">http://urdu-islamic-audio.com/2015/05/28/my-umrah-selfie/</a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Below is the Transcription of the above Video</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The question of the brother is that in these days a new <em>Fitnah</em> (trial) has begun.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> <strong>THE TAKING OF SELFIE PHOTOS</strong> &#8211; <strong>Allah’s aid is sought</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The strange thing is that you see this in the Haram, people standing in front of the Ka’bah taking selfies, behind them is the Ka’bah and they are taking photographs.  My brother, taking photographs is Haraam (forbidden).</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>This Haraam (forbidden act), outside of this House (of Allah) is also Haraam.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Its prohibition inside (of this Masjid) is increased even more!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>In front of the House of Allah its prohibition is increased even more!</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For what reason have these people come here? To show the world that I have come here to perform Umrah and here is my evidence for it! Then were has their intention gone!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you came for the pleasure of Allah, then why is there a need to announce to the world where you are?  Then they post it upon Facebook:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>“Look, I also went to Makkah.  Here is the proof, look the Ka’bah is behind me.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>إنا لله وإنا إليه راجعون</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>To Allah we belong and to Him we shall return.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So fear Allah and save yourself from this Fitnah… and a mobile phone is a mobile phone.  Some people have turned it in to, I don’t know what.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For some people within it, they have songs, music, movies a camera.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>HARAAM UPON HARAAM!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How many Muharamaat (forbidden things) are you carrying in your pocket!!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> <strong>So, FEAR ALLAH!!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Keep it within the limits of being a mobile phone.  Use it in a good manner for good (permissible) things.  But, since when has that taking of photographs been regard as making good use of it?</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Using it for something that is Haraam!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah has given you the ability, by Allah millions wish for the opportunity to visit the House of Allah.  In the world, millions of individuals, I swear by Allah. But, do they have the ability?  No they don’t have the ability. They don’t get the opportunity to come to the House of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>They die with this desire!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>And you come here having the pleasure of performing Umrah and you are taking <u>SELFIES</u>!!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Behind you walk’s a sister or someone’s mother and they too become a part of this selfie.  Do you have no shame!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nor do you have any shame with regards to the House of Allah and no shame with regards to the sister or daughter and neither any shame of yourself.  So for this reason this is a fitnah and it is not permissible, may Allah reward you with barakah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Dr Murtaza (حفظه الله تعالى) then explains the prohibition to our Moroccan brother (حفظه الله تعالى) who was present (in the Urdu lecture) to take opportunity to sit in a gathering where the remembrance of Allah was taking place).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(37. It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah, but it is <em><strong>Taqwa</strong> </em>from you that reaches Him. Thus have We made them subject to you that you may proclaim Allah&#8217;s greatness for His guidance to you. And give glad tidings to the doers of good.) </span>&#8211; Suratul Baqarah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says: this sacrifice is prescribed for you so that you will remember Him at the time of slaughter, for He is the Creator and Provider. Nothing of its flesh or blood reaches Him, for He has no need of anything other than Himself. During the time of Jahiliyyah, when they offered sacrifices to their gods, they would put some of the meat of their sacrifices on their idols, and sprinkle the blood over them. But Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah,)</strong> Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn Jurayj said, &#8220;The people of the Jahiliyyah used to put the meat of their sacrifices and sprinkle the blood on the House, and the Companions of the Messenger of Allah said, &#8220;<strong>We have more right to do that</strong>.&#8221; Then Allah revealed the words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah, but it is Taqwa from you that reaches Him.)</strong> That is what He will accept and reward for, as mentioned in the Sahih,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Allah does not look to your appearance or your colors, but He looks to your hearts and deeds.)</strong> And in the Hadith; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(Indeed charity falls in the Hand of Ar-Rahman before it falls in the hand of the one asking.)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Thus have We made them subject to you)</strong> meaning, `for this purpose We have subjugated the Budn for you,&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(that you may proclaim Allah&#8217;s greatness for His guidance to you.)</strong> means, that you may glorify Him for guiding you to His religion and His way which He loves and is pleased with, and has forbidden you to do all that He hates and rejects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And give glad tidings to the doers of good.)</strong> means, `give good news, O Muhammad, to those who do good,&#8217; i.e., whose deeds are good and who remain within the limits prescribed by Allah, who follow that which has been prescribed for them, who believe in the Messenger and follow that which he has conveyed from his Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Note) The Udhiyyah is Sunnah Mustahabbah One animal is sufficient on behalf of all the members of one household. Ibn `Umar said, &#8220;<strong>The Messenger of Allah continued to offer sacrifice for ten years</strong>.&#8221; This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi. Abu Ayyub said: &#8220;At the time of the Messenger of Allah , a man would sacrifice a sheep on behalf of himself and all the members of his household, and they would eat from it and feed others, until the people started boasting ﴿by sacrificing more than one﴾ and things reached the stage that you see now.&#8221; This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi, who graded it Sahih, and by Ibn Majah. `Abdullah bin Hisham used to sacrifice one sheep on behalf of his entire family; this was recorded by Al-Bukhari. Concerning how old the sacrificial animal should be, Muslim recorded from Jabir that the Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Do not sacrifice any but mature animals, and if that is not possible, then sacrifice a young sheep.)</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">In The Name of Allaah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">Preface</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">Praise be to Allaah, Lord of the Universe. May peace and blessings be upon Muhammad, the last of the prophets and messengers, and upon his family and esteemed companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">Hajj is one of the best forms of worship and is one of the most sublime deeds because it is one of the pillars of Islam that Allaah sent Muhammad (may the peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with. A servant&#8217;s religion is incomplete without it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">A form of worship is only acceptable when the following is true.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">1. One devotes it to Allaah alone, with a desire for the Hereafter. It cannot be done with the intention of being seen among men or for worldly gain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">2. One follows the Prophet&#8217;s example, in words deeds. This cannot accomplished except knowledge of the Sunnah.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">Forms of Pilgrimage</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are three forms of Hajj:<br />
<em><br />
Tamattu&#8217;-Ifraad-Qiran</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify"><strong><span style="color:#993300;"><em>Tamattu</em></span></strong>&#8216;: A pilgrim wears Ihram for Umrah only during the months of Hajj, which means when he reaches Makkah, he makes Tawaf and Sa&#8217;yi for Umrah. He then shaves or clips his hair. On the day of Tarwiya, which is the eighth of Dhul-Hijja, he puts on his Ihram for Hajj only and carries out all of its requirements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify"><em><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Ifraad</strong></span>:</em> A pilgrim wears Ihram for Hajj only. When he reaches Makkah, he performs Tawaf for his arrival and Sa&#8217;yi for Hajj. He doesn&#8217;t shave or clip his hair as he doesn&#8217;t disengage from Ihram. Instead, he remains in Ihram till after he stones Jamrah Al-Aqaba on the Eid day. It is permissible for him to postpone his Sa&#8217;yi for Hajj until after his Tawaf for Hajj.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify"><em><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Qiran</strong></span>:</em> A pilgrim wears Ihram for both Umrah and Hajj or he wears Ihram first for Umrah, then makes intentions for Hajj before his Tawaf for Hajj. The obligations on one performing Ifraad are the same as those on one performing Qiran, except that the latter must slaughter whereas the former is not obligated to do so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify"><strong>The best of the three forms is Tamattu&#8217;. It is the form that the prophet (may the peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) encouraged his followers to perform</strong>. Even if a pilgrim makes intentions to perform Qiran or Ifraad he is allowed to change his intentions to Tamattu&#8217;; he can do this even after he has performed Tawaf and Sa&#8217;yi.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">When the Prophet (may the peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) performed Tawaf and Sa&#8217;yi during the year of the Farewell Hajj with his companions, he ordered all those who hadn&#8217;t brought sacrificial animals to change their intentions for Hajj to intentions for Umrah. cut their hair, and disengage from Ihram till Hajj. He said, &#8221; If I hadn&#8217;t brought the sacrificial animal, I&#8217;d have done what I&#8217;ve ordered you to do.&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">The Umrah</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">If a pilgrim wishes to be ritually pure for Umrah, he should shed his clothing and bathe as he would after sexual defilement, if convenient. He should perfume his head and beard with the best oil he can find. There is no harm in what remains of it after Ihram.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">Bathing for Ihram is Sunnah for both men and women, including menstruating women and those experiencing postnatal bleeding. After bathing and preparing himself, a. pilgrim, other than those menstruating or experiencing postnatal bleeding, prays the obligatory prayer, if it is time. Otherwise, he makes his intention by praying the two Sunnah Rakaas which are made each time Wudhu is performed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">When he finishes his prayer he should say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">&#8220;Here I am for Umrah, here I am, Oh Allaah, here I am. Here I am. You have no partner. Here I am. Surely all praise, grace and dominion is yours, and you have no partner.&#8221; [Talbeeyah].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">A man raises his voice when saying this and a woman says it so that only one beside her may hear her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">One in Ihram should say the Talbeeyah as often as possible, especially when times and places change. For example: when descending or ascending during travel or when day or night approach. He should also ask Allaah for His pleasure, for Heaven and seek refuge in Allaah&#8217;s mercy from Hellfire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">One should say the Talbeeyah during Umrah, starting from the time he puts on his Ihram till he starts Tawaf. During Hajj he should say it starting from the time he puts on his Ihram till he starts to stone Jamrah Al-Aqaba on the Eid day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">When a pilgrim enters the Holy Mosque he puts forth his right foot first and says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">&#8220;In the name of Allaah, may peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allaah. Oh Allaah, forgive me my sins and open to me the doors of Your mercy. I seek refuge in Allaah the Almighty and in His Eminent Face and in His Eternal Dominion from the accursed Satan.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">He approaches the Black Stone, touches it with his right hand and kisses it. If this isn&#8217;t possible, he should face the Black Stone and point to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">It is best not to push and shove, causing harm and being harmed by other people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">When touching the Stone, a pilgrim should say the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">&#8220;In the name of Allaah, Allaah is the greatest. Oh, Allaah, with faith in you, belief in Your book, loyalty to you, compliance to the way of your Prophet Muhammad (may the peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">A pilgrim must walk, keeping the Ka&#8217;bah on his left. When he reaches the Rukn Al Yamani he should touch, but not kiss it, and say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">&#8221; Our Lord, grant us good in this life and good in the hereafter and save us from the punishment of the Hell fire. Oh Allaah, I beg of You for forgiveness and health in this life and in the Hereafter.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">Each time he passes the Black Stone he should say: &#8220;Allaah is the Greatest.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">During the remainder of his Tawaf he may say what he pleases of supplications, mentioning Allaah, and recitation of Quran. This is because Tawaf, Sa&#8217;yi, and Stoning the Jamrah have been devised for the purpose of mentioning Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify"><strong>During this Tawaf it is necessary for a man to do two things:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">1. <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Al-ldhtebaa&#8217;</strong></span> from the beginning of Tawaf until the end. Al-ldhtebaa&#8217; means placing the middle of one&#8217;s Reda&#8217; under his right arm and the ends of it over his left shoulder.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">When he is finished performing Tawaf, he may return his Reda&#8217; to its original state because the time for Idhtebaa&#8217; is only during Tawaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">2. <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Al-Raml</strong></span> during the first three circuits. Al-Raml means speeding up one&#8217;s pace with small steps. A pilgrim should walk at a normal pace during his last four circuits.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">When he completes seven circuits of Tawaf, he approaches Maqam Ibrahim and recites:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">&#8220;And take ye the station of Abraham as a place of Prayer&#8221; Chapter 2, Verse 125 [2:125].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">He prays two short Rakaas, as close as conveniently possible, behind Maqam Ibrahim. During the first Rakaa he recites Surah Al-Kafirun [Chapter 109] and during the second one Surah Al-lkhlas [Chapter 112].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">When he completes the two Rakaas he should return to the Black Stone and touch it, if convenient. He goes out to the Mesa&#8217;a and when he nears As-Safaa he recites:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">&#8220;Verily As-Safaa and Al-Marwah are among the shrines of Allaah &#8221; [2:158].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">He ascends As-Safaa until he is able to see the Ka&#8217;bah. Facing the Ka&#8217;bah and raising his hands, he praises Allaah and makes any supplications he chooses. The Prophet (may the peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed thus: &#8220;There is no Deity but Allaah alone,&#8221; three times, supplicating in between.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">He descends As-Safaa and heads for Al-Marwah at a normal pace until he reaches the green marker. He should then run fast until the next green marker. He continues toward Al-Marwah at a normal pace. When he reaches it, he ascends it, faces the Qibla, raises his hands and repeats what he said on As-Safaa. He descends Al-Marwah heading towards As-Safaa, taking care to walk where walking is designated, and run where running is designated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">He continues this procedure until he completes seven laps. Going from As-Safaa to Al-Marwah is a lap and returning is another lap.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">During his Sa&#8217;yi he may recite what he wills of supplications, recitation of Qur&#8217;an, and mentioning Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">In completion of Sa&#8217;yi he shaves his head. A woman clips her hair the length of a finger tip.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">Shaving is preferable, except when Hajj is near and there isn&#8217;t sufficient time for hair to grow back. In this case it&#8217;s best to clip so that hair will remain for shaving during Hajj.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">With that, Umrah is completed. and a pilgrim is free to dress in other clothing, wear perfume and engage in marital relations, etc.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">The Hajj</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">In the forenoon of the eighth day of Dhul-Hijja, a pilgrim purifies himself once again by bathing as he did before Umrah in the place in which he is staying, if convenient. He puts on his Ihram and says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">&#8221; Here I am for Hajj. Here I am, oh Allaah, here I am. Here I am. You have no partner. Here I am. Surely all praise, grace and dominion is yours, and you have no partners.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">If he fears that something will prevent him from completing his Hajj he should make a condition when he makes his intentions, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">&#8220;If I am prevented by any obstacle my place is wherever I am held up.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">If he has no such fear, he doesn&#8217;t make this condition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">A pilgrim goes to Mina and there prays Dhuhr, Asr, Magrib, Isha and Fajr, shortening his four unit prayers so as to make them two units each, without combining them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">When the sun rises, he goes to Arafah and there prays Dhuhr and Asr combined at the time of Dhuhr, making each one two units. He remains in Namira Mosque until sunset if possible. He remembers Allaah and makes as many supplications as possible while facing the Qibla.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">The Prophet (may the peace and blessing of Allaah be upon him) prayed thus:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">&#8220;There is no Deity but Allaah alone. He has no partner. All dominion and praise are His and He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">If he grows weary it is permissible for him to engage in beneficial conversation with his companions or reading what he can find of beneficial books, especially those concerning Allaah&#8217;s grace and abundant gifts. This will strengthen his hope in Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">He should then return to his supplications and be sure to spend the end of the day deep in supplication because the best of supplication is the supplication of the day of Arafah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">At sunset he goes from Arafah to Muzdalifah and there prays Magrib, Isha, and Fajr. If he is tired or has little water, it is permissible for him to combine Magrib and Isha. If he fears that he will not reach Muzdalifah until after midnight, he should pray before he reaches it for it is not permissible to delay prayer until after midnight. He remains there, in Muzdalifah, making supplications and remembering Allaah till just before sunrise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">If he is weak and cannot handle the crowd during Ar-Ramy, it is permissible for him to go to Mina at the end of the night to stone the Jamrah before the arrival of the crowd.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">Near sunrise, a pilgrim goes from Muzdalifah to Mina. Upon reaching it he does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">a) He throws seven consecutive pebbles at Jamrah Al-Aqaba which is the closest monument to Makkah, saying &#8220;Allaah is the Greatest,&#8221; as he  throws each pebble.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">b) He slaughters the sacrificial animal, eats some of it, and gives some to the poor. Slaughter is obligatory on the Mutamati and Qiran.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">c) He shaves or clips his hair; shaving is preferable. A woman clips her hair the length of a finger tip.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">These three should be done in the above order if convenient, but there is no restriction if one precedes another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">With that, one is allowed to come out of Ihram. He can wear other clothing and do everything that was lawful before Ihram except engaging in marital relations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">He goes to Makkah to perform Tawaf Al-lfadha and Sa&#8217;yi, also for Hajj. It is Sunnah to put perfume on before going to Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">With the completion of this Tawaf and Sa&#8217;yi, a pilgrim is allowed to do everything that was lawful before Ihram, including engaging in marital relations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">After performing Tawaf and Sa&#8217;yi, he returns to Mina to spend the nights of the eleventh and twelfth days there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">He stones the three Jamrah in the afternoon of both the eleventh and twelfth days. He starts with the first Jamrah, which is furthest from Makkah, then the middle one, and lastly Jamrah Al-Aqaba. Each one should be stoned with seven consecutive pebbles accompanied by Takbeer. He stops after the first and middle Jamrah to make supplications facing the Qibla. It is not permissible to stone before noon on these two days. It is best to walk to the Jamrah, but riding is permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">If he is in a hurry after stoning on the twelfth day, he leaves Mina before sunset. But if he wishes to prolong his stay, which is best, he spends the night of the thirteenth in Mina and stones that afternoon in the same manner as on the twelfth day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">When he is ready to return to his country, he makes Tawaf Al-Wadaa, which is seven circuits around the Ka&#8217;bah. Menstruating women and women experiencing postnatal discharge are not obligated to perform Tawaf Al-Wadaa.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">Visiting The Prophet&#8217;s Mosque</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">1. A pilgrim goes to Madina before or after Hajj with the intention of visiting the Prophet&#8217;s mosque and praying in it. Prayer there is better than a thousand prayers elsewhere except in the Holy Mosque in Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">2. Upon reaching the mosque he prays two Rakaas of salutation or performs any obligatory prayer that is due.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">3. He goes to the grave of the Prophet (may the peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and he stands before it. He greets him saying the &#8221; May the peace, mercy, and blessings of Allaah be upon you, oh Prophet. May Allaah grant you a good reward on behalf of your people. &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">He takes a step or two to his right to position himself before Abu-Bakr and greets him saying : &#8220;May the peace, mercy, and blessing of Allaah be upon you. oh Abu-Bakr, Caliph of the Messenger of Allaah. May Allaah be pleased with you and grant you a good reward on behalf of Muhammad&#8217;s people.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">Then he takes a step or two to his right to position himself before Umar and greets him saying: &#8221; May the peace, mercy and blessings of Allaah be upon you, oh Umar, Prince of the believers. May Allaah be pleased with you and grant you a good reward on behalf of Muhammad&#8217;s people.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">4. In a state of purity, he goes to pray in Qubaa Mosque.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">5. He goes to Al-Baqee to visit Uthman&#8217;s grave (may Allaah be pleased with him). He stands before it and greets him saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">&#8220;May the peace, mercy and blessing of Allaah be upon you, oh Uthman Prince of the believers. May Allaah be pleased with you and grant you a good reward on behalf of Muhammad&#8217;s people.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">He greets any other Muslims in Al-Baqee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify">6. He goes to Uhud and visits the grave of Hamza (may Allaah be pleased with him) and the other martyrs there with him. He greets them and preys to Allaah to grant them forgiveness, mercy, and pleasure.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:justify;">The Excellence of Hajj</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 1185 &amp; 1200 &#8211; On the authority of Ibn Abbas in a narration ascribed to the Prophet: &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Be regular with (in another narration: follow up) the Hajj and the Umrah since they wipe out poverty and sins, just as the furnace separates the slag from the iron.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Not Leaving Off Hajj for More than Five Years</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 1662 &#8211; The Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Indeed Allaah says: Verily I have made a slave’s body healthy and given him adequate livelihood yet five years have passed and he has not come to Me and redeemed himself, as a pilgrim.’</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Benefit: al-Mundhiri said in ‘al-Targheeb’ (2/134): Narrated by Ibn Hibban in his ‘Saheeh’ and by al-Bayhaqi who said: ‘Alee bin al-Mundhir said: Some of our companions narrated to me saying:</p>
<blockquote>

<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Ihram</h2>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">What is Avoided in Hajj is that which is Avoided in Umrah</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No.2765 &#8211; On the authority of Safwaan bin Umayyah who said: A man came to the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam: wearing a lot of coloured perfume on his clothing, he was wearing different pieces of clothing and he had already assumed Ihraam for Umrah. He said: ‘What do you order me to do, O Messenger of Allaah, in my Umrah?’ Then Allaah -Azza wa Jal- revealed: &lt;&lt;Complete the Hajj and Umrah for Allaah &gt;&gt; So the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: ‘Where is the person who asked the question about Umrah?’ The man said: ‘Here I am.’ So the Messenger said: ‘Remove your clothing and take a bath, clean off the perfume as much as you can and whatever you used to do for your Hajj, then do that in your Umrah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh<br />
Silsilah-Saheehah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Benefit: Ibn Hajr said in ‘al-Fath’ (3/394): Ibn al-Muneer said in ‘al-Hashiyah’: ‘What the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said was: “Wassna’,” (i.e. the Arabic word for ‘do, make’) which means: ‘To leave something,’ because the clarification meant what a Muhrim keeps away from. So, the benefit taken from this explanation is that ‘leaving something is an action in itself.’</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">The Prohibition of the Woman in Ihram Covering her Face with a Scarf</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2930 &#8211; On the authority of ‘Uqbah bin ‘Aamr al-Juhanee who said: ‘My sister vowed that she would walk to the Ka’bah barefoot and unveiled. So the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- came to her and said: ‘What is wrong with this woman?’ They said: She vowed to walk to the Ka’bah barefoot and unveiled! So he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> ‘Order her to take a ride, cover herself, perform the Hajj and slaughter an animal.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh<br />
Silsilah-Saheehah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘In this hadeeth there are some important benefits, from them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That the Ihram of the woman is for her face, so it is not permissible for her to cover her face with her Khimaar (scarf), rather she covers her head and chest. This is like the hadeeth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> ‘A woman in Ihram does not wear a Niqaab (face veil), nor does she wear gloves.’ </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Narrated by Bukhari and Muslim.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Important note: Shaykh al-Albaani said in his book: ‘The Rites of Hajj and Umrah’ (p.12)</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘It is permissible for the woman to cover her face with something like a Khimaar or Jilbaab, which she throws over her head and it sits on her face. What is correct is that it can touch her face, but she cannot tie it to her face. </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is similar to what Ibn Taymeeyah -Rahimahullaah said.]’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2617 -The Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘O Allaah this Hajj has no ostentation in it nor any hypocrisy.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">The Permissibility of the Person in Ihram Covering his Face if Needed.</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2899 &#8211; On the authority of Uthmaan bin ‘Affan –RadiAllaahu anhu- that</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘The Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- would cover his face while he was in a state of Ihram.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh<br />
Silsilah-Saheeha</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abdullaah bin ‘Aamir bin Rabeeh that</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>he saw ‘Uthmaan bin ‘Affan in a village near Madina with his face covered by a deep red coloured, velvet cloth on a summer’s day while he was a Muhrim (in the state of Ihram).</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Its chain is authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said: ‘So if you know that the chain of narration is authentic, then there is no contradiction between this hadeeth and the report which is Mawqoof (the Isnad only goes back to the Companion) at ‘Uthmaan, as is apparent. This is because there is nothing that conflicts with the acceptability of ‘Uthmaan doing that which it is possible the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is better (that the hadeeth and the Athar correspond) rather than attributing a mistake to one of the trustworthy narrators simply because ‘Uthmaan did an action that he narrated from the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam. Do you not also see that there is no difference between what ad-Daraqutni -Rahimullaah- noted, saying that the Mawqoof (the Isnad only goes back to the Companion) precedes the Marfoo’ (a narration ascribed to the Prophet), and those who invert the issue saying that the Marfoo’ precedes the Mawqoof.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The truth is that both of them are authentic, so neither of them opposes the other. Indeed there are many Aathaar narrated by the Companions, the Tabieen and the diligent Imaams which permit the person in a state of Ihram to cover his face if need be. Ibn Hazm uses these Aathaar as evidence in his book ‘al-Muhalla’ (7/91-93) so as to support the original stance. Al-Bayhaqi also narrated some of these Aathaar (5/54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth does not oppose the saying of the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallamregarding the person who dies while in a state of Ihram:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Wash him with water mixed with Acacia leaves, shroud him in his clothing and do not cover his face or head.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Muslim and other than him and it is narrated in the book ‘al-Irwaa’ (4/198-199).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verdict is specific to the one who dies in a state of Ihram but the hadeeth under discussion is regarding the living, so it (i.e. the ruling) is different.’</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">What Animals are Permissible for the Muhrim to Kill</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 193 -‘Five types of animals which, if a Muhrim kills, there is no blame upon him: a crow, a predatory bird, a rat, scorpion and a voracious dog.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhari and Muslim on the authority of Ibn Umar in a narration ascribed to the Prophet: -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘From what is clear in this hadeeth is the absence of blame, which shows the permissibility of killing them. It is not to be understood from this that it is recommended or obligatory to kill them or that it is better leave off killing them.’</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Talbeeyah</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 830 &#8211; On the authority of Zaid bin Khalid al-Juhanee, on the authority of the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Jibraeel came to me and said: O Muhammad! Order your Companions to raise their voices with the Talbeeyah (proclamation for Hajj or Umrah), since it is from the signs of Hajj.’ </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 1500 &#8211; On the authority of Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq who said that</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- was asked: ‘What is the best Hajj?’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>He answered ‘The one where you raise your voice reciting the Talbeeyah and you slaughter an animal.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 1621 &#8211; On the authority of Abu Huraira in a narration ascribed to the Prophet: -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘A person does not ever make Talbeeyah except that he is given glad tidings, nor does a person ever say Takbeer except that he is given glad tidings.’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> It was asked: ‘With Paradise?’ </strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Mina</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 804 &#8211; On the authority of Ibn Abbas: the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam used to visit the House (Ka’bah) every night from the nights of Mina.’</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Tawwaaf</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2725 &#8211; On the authority of Abdullaah bin Umar who said I heard the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Whoever makes seven circuits of Tawwaaf around the House (Ka’bah) and prays two Rakats, it is the same as freeing a slave.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Salutation of the House &#8211; for the person not in Ihram- is Two Rakah</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hadeeth has no chain &#8211; La Asl laha<br />
No.1012 ‘Salutation of the House is done with Tawwaaf.’<br />
The Hadeeth has no chain &#8211; La Asl laha</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Silsilah-Daeefah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I say: I do not know, neither from the sayings or actions of the Sunnah, that which attests the meaning of this hadeeth other than the general evidences which mention praying before sitting in the Masjid which then include the Masjid al-Haraam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The assertion that salutation of the Masjid al-Haraam is the Tawwaaf opposes the general evidence previously mentioned. So, this salutation cannot be accepted until it can be affirmed and how inconceivable is that? Especially as – due to experience &#8211; it is not possible for the person entering the Masjid al-Haraam during the days of the sacred seasons to perform the Tawwaaf every time he enters it, so praise be to Allaah Who has made the matter easy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And He has not placed any burden upon you in your religion&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed what must be brought to attention here regarding this verdict is that it is for the person who is not a Muhrim. As for the person who is in Ihram then the rightful Sunnah is that he begins with the Tawwaaf and then the two Rakah after it.’</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">The Hajj Pilgrimage is Only Made to the House of Allaah</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Da’eefah No. 265 Mawdoo- Fabricated</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O Abu Huraira! Teach the people the Quran and learn it, because if you died upon that, the Angels would visit your grave just as they visit the Ancient House (Ka’bah). Teach the people my Sunnah, even if they dislike it. If you would like not to stop on the bridge on the Day of Judgement, even for the blink of an eye until you enter Paradise, then do not innovate with your opinion.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mawdoo- Fabricated<br />
Silsilah-Daeefah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Ibn al-Jawzi mentions this narration in his book ‘al-Mawdoo’aat’ (The Fabricated Ahadeeth) (1/264) and he said: ‘Not authentic and Abu Hammam (one of the narrators) is Muhammad bin Mujeeb.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahya said: ‘He is a liar.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Haatim said: ‘He is lost in hadeeth (i.e. rejected).’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Sooyuti brings a similar narration but mentions the wording: ‘If death comes to you and you are in this state then the Angels perform Hajj (pilgrimage) to your grave just as the believers perform Hajj to the House of Allaah, the Haraam.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Sooyuti remained silent about this; but I have a more severe hatred for this wording than the first &#8211; due to what it mentions about performing Hajj to a grave &#8211; as it is an innovated statement which has no origin in the Sharia’. Also, performing Hajj to a visited thing other than the House of Allaah, the Haraam, is not mentioned in the Sharia’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for performing Hajj (Pilgrimage) to graves, then that is done by Ahl-ul-Bida’ (the people of Bida’) who aggrandize graves to extreme by journeying to them, spending nights there, performing Tawwaaf around them, making Dua’, begging and imploring of the graves and other similar things which are all symbols of the Hajj. Some of them even authored a book entitled ‘The Rites of Making Hajj to Shrines and Graves’ as a refutation of what Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah mentioned in his books!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is major misguidance and no Muslim who has smelt the fragrance of pure Tawheed will doubt that this is the thing most disliked by the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-. So how can it be conceived possible that the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- made this statement: ‘the Angels would visit your grave just as they visit the Ancient House (Ka’bah).’ O Allaah! Indeed the heart testifies that the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- never said even one of the letters from this statement. May Allaah disfigure the one who fabricated this.’</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Raml</h2>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">The Sharia’ Reasoning for the Brisk Walk During Tawwaaf</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2573 &#8211; On the authority of Ibn Abbas –RadiAllaahu anhu- ‘The Quraish said: ‘Indeed Muhammad and his Companions have been weakened by the fever of Yathrib.’ So in the year the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – performed Umrah he said to his Companions: ‘<strong>Walk briskly around the Ka’bah so the Mushrikeen can see your strength</strong>.’ So when they walked briskly the Quraish said: ‘It has not weakened them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh<br />
Silsilah-Saheehah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This chain is Saheeh according to the conditions of Imam Muslim. Bukhari narrates it without a complete chain in his ‘Saheeh’ (5/86) on the authority of Hamad bin Salamah in a narration similar to this, as does Hamad bin Zayd in a narration on the authority of Ayoob whose wording is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘The Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- commanded them to walk briskly for three circuits and walk calmly between the two corners so the Mushrikeen could see their strength and patience.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Mushrikeen said: ‘These are those whom you claimed had been weakened by the fever. They are stronger and more patient than such and such!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In ‘al-Musnad’ (1/305) via another chain which is narrated on the authority of Abu Tufail from Ibn ‘Abbas that when the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- stopped at a place not far from Makkah called ‘Marra az-Zahran’ on his way to Umrah, it reached the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- that the Quraish were saying: What has caused them to come here feeble and thin?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So his Companions said: ‘If we slaughter our camels, eat from their meat and make a broth from its soup, then we will be relaxed when we enter upon the people tomorrow.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger said: ‘Do not do that, but gather your provisions and bring them to me.’ So they gathered them for the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and spread out a tablecloth made from leather. They ate, and had eaten satisfactorily, then left and every one of them took some in their sacks. Then the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- turned and went ahead until he entered the Masjid – and the Quraish were sitting near the black stone. The Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- uncovered one of his shoulders through his top garment then said: ‘Do not let the people see you as deficient/weak.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He touched the corner and entered Tawwaaf, passing by the Yemeni corner and walking to the Black Stone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Quraish said: ‘Just walking in the Tawwaaf does not please them, but they leap and jump like gazelles.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- did that for three circuits and so it became the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Tufail said: ‘Ibn ‘Abbas informed me that the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- did this in his farewell Hajj.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Its chain is also authentic according to the conditions of Imam Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was also narrated by al-Bayhaqi in his book ‘Dala’il an-Naboowa’ (3/3/1) through two routes. Muslim narrated it (4/64) by way of al-Jareeri on the authority of Abu Tufail with a similar narration and it has been researched in ‘al-Irwaa’ (4/315).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was also narrated via ‘Atta on the authority of Ibn Abbas who said: ‘Indeed the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- walked, and he walked briskly, around the House (Ka’bah) to show the Mushrikeen his strength.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Benefit: Perhaps someone might say: ‘If the Sharia’ reason for the brisk walk during the Tawwaaf was to show the Mushrikeen the strength of the Muslims, then can it not be said that as the reason for doing the action has ceased, then the legislation of the brisk walk should cease<br />
too?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer: No, because the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – walked briskly in his Tawwaaf after that first Umrah, in his farewell Hajj, as is mentioned in the long hadeeth of Jabir and by other than him, such as this hadeeth of Ibn Abbas with the previous narration of Abu Tufail. This is why Ibn Hibban said in his book ‘Saheeh’ (6/47 al-Ihsaan): ‘So this objection has been cleared up and the brisk walk during Tawwaaf remains prescribed upon the Ummah of al- Mustafa &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – until the Day of Judgement.’</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Iltizaam</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No.2138- On the authority of Abdullaah bin ‘Amr who said</p>

<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Arafat</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2551 &#8211; On the authority of ‘Aeysha that the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: ‘</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>There is no other day in which Allaah frees more slaves from the fire than the Day of ‘Arafah. Indeed, He comes close to them then boasts about them to the Angels and then He says: ‘What do these people want?’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Jamaraat</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2515 &#8211; On the authority of Ibn Abbas who said that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> ‘If you stone the Jamaar (pillars) it will be as light for you on the Day of Judgement.’</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 1437 &#8211; The Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam said: ‘Stone the Jamarah with pebbles the size of chick peas.’</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Gathering the Pebbles for Stoning the Jamaraat from Mina and not from Muzdalifah</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2144 &#8211; On the authority of al-Fadl bin Abbas who said</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam said to the people when they left on the evening of ‘Arafat and Muzdalifah: ‘You should be tranquil.’ He said this while he was preventing his female camel from speeding until he entered Mina and descended in a place between Mina and Muzdalifah. Then he said: ‘You should take pebbles the size of chick peas, with which you can stone the Jamarah.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then al-Fadl said: ‘and the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- was demonstrating with his hand just as when a person throws.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh<br />
Silsilah-Saheehah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Benefit: Nisa’ee wrote a chapter heading for this hadeeth saying: ‘From where does one collect the pebbles?’ indicating by this that collecting pebbles takes place in Mina and the hadeeth regarding this is clear. This is because the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- ordered them to do this when he stopped at a place called ‘Muhassir’, while he was in Mina, as is mentioned in the narration of Muslim and al-Bayhaqi.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What also indicates this is the apparent hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbas who said: The Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said to me on the morning of ‘Aqabah while he was on his she-camel: ‘Collect small stones for me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I collected small pebbles for him which were like chickpeas and when I placed them in his palm, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘The likes of these (type and size stones), O you people. Beware of exaggerating in the Deen, as indeed what destroyed those before you was exaggeration in the Deen.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Nisa’ee, al-Bayhaqi and Ahmad (1/215,247) with an authentic chain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the evidence here is his saying: ‘early at ‘Aqabah’ by which he means the early morning in which you stone the large Jamarat al-‘Aqabah, and from what is apparent from the hadeeth is that the act of collecting the pebbles took place in Mina, near the Jamarah. As for what people do today, collecting pebbles in Muzdalifah, we do not know an origin for it in the Sunnah, rather it opposes these two ahadeeth and it contains burden and inconvenience with no benefit.’</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Does the Person Performing Hajj Walk to the Jamarah to Stone it?</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2072 &#8211; On the authority of Ibn Umar –RadiAllaahu anhu- that</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘The Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- would walk to the Jamarah if he wanted to stone it; he would walk to it and walk back from it.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh<br />
Silsilah-Saheehah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Benefit: Tirmidhi said at the end of this hadeeth: ‘Most of the people of knowledge implement this hadeeth while some of them say: He would ride on the day of an-Nahr (slaughtering) and would walk for the days other than the day of an-<br />
Nahr.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tirmidhi continues: ‘It is as if the person who said this statement intended to follow the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- in his action, because indeed what is narrated of the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- is that he rode on the day of an-Nahr to go to stone the Jamarah and only Jamarat ul-‘Aqabah is stoned on the day of an-Nahr.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say (Albaani): As for the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- stoning the Jamarat ul- ‘Aqabah while he was riding, then this is mentioned in the long hadeeth of Jaabir cited in the book ‘The Hajj of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam’ from the narration of Muslim and others. This is why the hadeeth of Ibn Umar (above) that when the Prophet intended ‘to stone the Jamarat, he would walk to it and walk back from it’ is explained to mean other than the stoning of the day of an-Nahr, thereby reconciling this hadeeth of Ibn Umar with the hadeeth of Jaabir, and Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I came across that which supports this opinion, from the narration of Abdullaah bin Umar on the authority of Nafi’ with the wording: ‘On the authority of Ibn Umar: that he used to come to the Jamaar during the three days after the day of an-Nahr, going back and forth walking and he mentioned that the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- used to do that.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Abu Dawood(1969) and Ahmad 92/156)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration by Ahmad (2/114,138):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Umar used to stone the Jamarat ul-‘Aqabah while riding on his animal on the day of an- Nahr and he never used to go to the other Jamaarat after that except that he would go back and forth walking. He asserted that the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- never used to go back and forth to the Jamaarat, except on foot.’</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Everything is Permissible After Stoning the Jamaarat al-‘Aqabah Except Women</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 239 &#8211; On the authority of Ibn Abbas –RadiAllaahu anhu- who said that: The Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘When you stone the Jamarah, then everything except women becomes permissible.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh<br />
Silsilah-Saheehah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Benefit: In this hadeeth is a clear proof that when the person on Hajj has stoned the Jamaarat al- ‘Aqabah then all the prohibitions of Ihraam are lifted except for the prohibition of intercourse with women; this is not permissible for him as has been unanimously agreed.’</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Slaughter</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 805- On the authority of Jaabir who said: we used to preserve the slaughtered meat and take it to Madina during the time of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.’</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">After the Completion of Hajj</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No.1379 – On the authority of ‘Aeysha in a narration ascribed to the Prophet: -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘When you have completed your Hajj then you should hasten your journey to your family, since it is greater in its reward.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 1451- On the authority of Ibn Umar in a narration ascribed to the Prophet: -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Appreciate this House (Ka’bah) since it has been destroyed twice and the third time it will be raised up.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 883- On the authority of ‘Aeysha that she would carry Zam-Zam water, and she would say that</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam used to carry Zam-Zam water in leather water sacks and jugs, and he used to pour it on the sick and give it to them to drink.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">The Permissibility of Visiting the Prophet’s -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- Grave</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2497 &#8211; On the authority of ‘Aasim bin Humaid as-Sakooni –RadiAllaahu anhu- that when the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- sent Mu’adh to Yemen, he came out with him to advise him. Mu’adh was riding and the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- was walking next to his riding animal. When the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; had advised him he said: O Mu’adh! Indeed you might not meet me after this year and perhaps you will pass by my Masjid and my grave.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh<br />
Silsilah-Saheehah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Benefit: ‘Dr. al-Booti uses this hadeeth in the last part of his book ‘Fiqh as-Seerah’ as evidence for the permissibility of visiting the Prophet’s -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- grave – claiming that Ibn Taymeeyah rejects this visiting!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though we do not oppose his use of this proof, as it is indeed clear, we notify the readers that this is a false claim and a lie against Ibn Taymeeyah -Rahimullaah. Indeed his books make clear and abundant mention of its legality and he even expounded on how to visit the grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What Ibn Taymeeyah rejected was intending a journey to visit the grave as is the meaning of the hadeeth: ‘Do not undertake a journey except to three Masajid…’ which I have explained in detail with the sayings of Ibn Taymeeyah himself in my refutation of al-Booti entitled: ‘In defense of the Prophetic hadeeth.’ So what does the doctor intend by persisting with this slander which is even in the latest print of his book? Intelligent readers know the answer.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 45 &#8211; ‘Whoever performs the Hajj of the House (Ka’bah) and does not visit me has indeed treated me badly.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fabricated- Mawdoo<br />
Silsilah-Daeefah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Benefit: From what indicates its being fabricated is that ill-treatment of the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- is from the major sins, if not disbelief. So if the one who does not visit the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- has committed a great sin, then this necessitates that this visit is obligatory, like Hajj, which no Muslim would say. This is because even though visiting the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- is from the actions that bring one closer to Allaah, it does not exceed the status of being only recommended by the scholars. So how can it be that the one who leaves off visiting it is harsh to the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallamand is one who turns away from him!?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, His family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from <a href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2014/09/02/sahih-bukhari-book-030/">Virtues of Madinah of Sahih Bukhari</a></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Medina is a sanctuary from that place to that.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Its trees should not be cut.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">No heresy should be innovated nor any sin should be committed in it.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Whoever innovates in it an heresy or commits a sin, or gives shelter to such an innovator in it will incur the curse of Allah,the angels, and all the people, none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet peace be upon him said, “I have made Medina a sanctuary between its two (Harrat) mountains.”</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Allah’s Apostle , peace be upon him, “Verily, Belief returns and goes back to Medina as a snake returns and goes back to its hole (when in danger).”</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">“None plots against the people of Medina but that he will be dissolved (destroyed) like the salt is dissolved in water.”</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">“The terror caused by Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal will not enter Medina and at that time Medina will have seven gates and there will be two angels at each gate guarding them.”</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">“There are angels guarding the entrances (or roads) of Medina, neither plague nor Ad-Dajjal will be able to enter it.”</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">“There will be no town which Ad-Dajjal will not enter except Mecca and Medina, and there will be no entrance (road) (of both Mecca and Medina) but the angels will be standing in rows guarding it against him, and then Medina will shake with its inhabitants thrice (i.e. three earth-quakes will take place) and Allah will expel all the nonbelievers and the hypocrites from it.”</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">“Medina is like a furnace, it expels out the impurities (bad persons) and selects the good ones and makes them perfect.”</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">“Medina expels the bad persons from it, as fire expels the impurities of iron.”</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet , peace be upon him, said, “O Allah! Bestow on Medina twice the blessings You bestowed on Mecca.”</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet , peace be upon him, said, “There is a garden from the gardens of Paradise between my house and my pulpit, and my pulpit is on my Lake Fount (Al-Kauthar).”</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Umar ,radhi Allaahu anhu,said, “O Allah! Grant me martyrdom in Your cause, and let my death be in the city of Your Apostle.”</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source:<strong> <a title="Lessons of Creed Acquired From The Hajj – By ‘AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-Badr" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2012/10/06/lessons-of-creed-acquired-from-the-hajj-by-abdurrazzaq-bin-abdul-muhsin-al-badr/" target="_blank">Lessons of Creed Acquired From The Hajj</a> – By ‘AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-Badr, </strong>Translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Chapter 8 : An Explanation of the Obligation to Adhere to the Sunnah and to Take from the Guidance of the Messenger of Allaah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed from the greatest benefits and lessons from Hajj for the pilgrims to the House of Allaah is knowing the importance of the Sunnah and limiting oneself to it in all actions of the Hajj. The importance of knowing the Sunnah becomes apparent from the state of many pilgrims who you see gathering together in circles of knowledge and remembrance. They ask the scholars many questions regarding the description of Hajj: how to perform it, its pillars and obligatory duties and those acts that negate it. These questions are asked with precision and enthusiasm, especially by those who, in their Hajj, are conscious of the saying of the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-: ‘Take your Hajj rites from me’ [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore Hajj will not be accepted by Allaah unless the Muslim does it in the manner of the Messenger of Allaah, adhering to his guidance in the Hajj and following his Sunnah &#8211; without excess or negligence, without going to extremes or being without purpose and without adding to or taking away from it. So if a Muslim adheres to the Sunnah of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- in his Hajj and limits himself to his guidance, he benefits from the knowledge that adhering to the Sunnah and following his -sall&#8217;Allaahu alayhi wasallam- guidance is obligatory in all acts of obedience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as it is necessary to take the rites of Hajj from the Messenger, it is also necessary for all Muslims to take the guidance of the Messenger in every act of obedience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said with regards to prayer: ‘pray as you have seen me praying.’ [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said in all matters of general obedience: ‘Whoever does an action which we have not commanded then it is rejected.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration: ‘Whoever innovates in this matter of ours, that which is not from it, it will be rejected.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus all actions which are not done in accordance to the guidance of the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- will not be accepted by Allaah, as is shown by his explicit statement -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam: ‘Whoever does an action which we have not commanded then it is rejected.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed this proves that every innovation (Bida’) introduced into the religion has no foundation in the Book or Sunnah, regardless of whether it is from knowledge-based verbal innovations or practical, worship-based innovations. So whoever informs of other than that which Allaah and His Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- have informed or worships in a way that Allaah and His Messenger have not permitted then this will be returned to the one who did it and it will not be accepted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth also implies the meaning that anyone who does an action in accordance to what Allaah and His Messenger have commanded i.e. is worshipping Allaah with correct creed and righteous actions from what is obligatory and recommended, then his action will be accepted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Abu Daawood, Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and others on the authority of al-Irbaad bin Sariyyah –RadhiAllaahu anhu- who said that the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- led us in prayer that day, then turned and faced us and gave us an admonition which caused hearts to tremble and eyes to shed tears.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we said: ‘It is as if this is a farewell speech, so advise us O Messenger of Allaah!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘I advise you to hear and obey, even if a slave rules over you. Indeed whosoever from you lives will see many differences, so hold on to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Khulafaah after me, bite on to it with your molar teeth. Beware of newly invented matters, since every Bida’ is misguidance.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- saying in the hadeeth ‘All Bida’ is misguidance’ then this is from his comprehensive, eloquent speech. This statement is a great principle from the principles of the Deen and it resembles the saying of the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam: ‘Whoever innovates anything in this matter of ours that which is not from it, will be rejected.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus anyone who innovates and ascribes something to the Deen which has no foundation to which it can be referred, then it is misguidance which the Deen is free from, the one who innovates has the innovation rejected and it is not accepted from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Deen of Allaah is built upon two great, strong principles and foundations. Firstly; That we do not worship except Allaah Alone who has no partner. Secondly; That we do not worship Him except with what He legislated on the tongue of His Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-. We do not worship Allaah according to our desires or Bida’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah Ta’ala said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Then We have put you on a plain way of (Our) commandment. So follow that and do not follow the desires of those who do not know. Verily, they can avail you nothing against Allaah &gt;&gt; [Al-Jathiyah : 18-19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah Ta’ala said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Or do they have partners with Allaah (false gods), who have instituted for them a religion which Allaah has not allowed. &gt;&gt; [Shura: 21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not allowed for anyone to worship Allaah except with what His Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- legislated from obligatory and recommended actions. We do not worship Him with newly invented matters which have no foundation in the Deen nor any basis for them in the Sharia’. It is not allowed for anyone to worship anything except Allaah Alone, so no-one is allowed to pray except to Allaah, nor fast except for Allaah, nor perform the Hajj except to His house, nor rely upon anyone except Him, nor can anyone direct any aspect of worship to anyone except Him.[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah combined these two great principles in His –<br />
Subhanhu- statement :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord.&gt;&gt;[Kahf :110]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A good action is that which is in agreement with the pure Sharia’ and is sincere i.e. that which is not done, except for Allaah’s Face. These are the two pillars for acceptance of actions. So if an action is done sincerely but is not correct then it will not be accepted and if the action is correct but is not done sincerely for Allaah, then it will not be accepted unless the action is sincere and correctwhere sincere means that it is done purely for Allaah and being correct means that it is done according to the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is obligatory on every Muslim who hopes for success and happiness for himself in this world and the hereafter is that he attaches himself to the guidance of the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-, that his action conforms to his &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- Sunnah and that he is wary of deviating from his guidance, opposing his Sunnah or following other than his path; since he -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- is a guide and example for his nation, as Allaah Ta’ala said regarding him :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a good example to follow for he who hopes in (the Meeting with) Allaah and the Last Day and remembers Allaah much. &gt;&gt; [Ahzab:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;The Prophet is closer to the believers than their ownselves &gt;&gt; [Ahzab: 6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means : ‘He has more right over them in all aspects of the Deen and worldly affairs and he is of greater importance to them than their ownselves or anyone else. It is obligatory upon them to give what he determines from their wealth even if they are in need of it. It is obligatory upon them to have more love for him than for their ownselves, and it is obligatory upon them to put his rulings first, before their own rulings for their ownselves. In brief, if the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- calls them to something and they themselves call to something else then it is obligatory for them to give precedence to what he calls them to and to defer what they themselves call to. It is obligatory upon them to have obedience to him which supersedes obedience to their ownselves and that they prefer obedience to him before that which their ownselves incline to and their inner selves desire.’ [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that this necessitates that the Muslim strives to know the Sunnah and sacrifices time in the path to knowing the guidance of the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- &#8211; which is done by questioning the people of knowledge, sitting in the circles of remembrance where the rules of Halaal and Haraam are explained and also by reading beneficial books and useful works which collect these issues. So after that a Muslim can establish a path whereby he can worship correctly on a sound methodology, in agreement with the guidance of the noble Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Chapter Nine : On the Day of ‘Arafah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that the day of ‘Arafah is a great day from the blessed days of Allaah and is a large gathering from the gatherings of goodness, Eemaan and Taqwaa. It is a season which is welcomed with great importance. A season from the seasons of obedience and worship, a day where the shedding of tears increases, where there are continuous supplications, where mercy descends and shortcomings are rectified, a day where mistakes are forgiven, a day of hope and humility, submissiveness and humbleness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed it is a noble blessed day. The sun never rose on a day better than the day of ‘Arafah. Indeed it has been specified with noble merits, great privileges and important characteristics. It is no easy task to encompass all its characteristics, nor is it possible to fully investigate them all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed it is the day on which Allaah completed this Deen for the Ummah and completed His favour for them, as on that day the saying of Allaah Ta’ala was revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you and have chosen for you Islaam as your religion.</strong></span>&gt;&gt; [al-Maida:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nothing about the Halaal or Haraam was revealed after that day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Bukhari and Muslim on the authority of Tariq bin Shihaab who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> ‘A man from the Jews came to Umar bin al-Khattab &#8211; radiAllaahu anhu &#8211; and said: ‘O Ameer ul-Mumineen, indeed you read an Ayaah in your Book and had this Ayaah been revealed to us, the Jewish nation, we would have taken that day as a festival.’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">So Umar -radiAllaahu anhu- said: ‘And which Ayaah is that?’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">So he replied: the saying of Allaah</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&lt;&lt;This day have I perfected your religion for you completed My favour upon you&gt;&gt;[al-Maida:3]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Then Umar said: I swear by Allaah, indeed I know on what day it was revealed to the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and the hour in which it was revealed to the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam. It was revealed in the evening of ‘Arafah on a Friday.’[1]</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On this noble blessed day, there are many of Allaah’s slaves who are saved from Hellfire. Allaah is generous to His believing slaves and He boasts about them in front of the Angels that are near Him. It has been narrated by Muslim in his authentic book of hadeeth on the authority of ‘Aeysha &#8211; radiAllaahu anha – that the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘There is no day on which Allaah frees as many slaves from the Hell-Fire as the day of ‘Arafah. Indeed He comes close to them, boasts about them to the Angels and then says: ‘What do they want?’</strong></span>[2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abdul Barr -Rahimullaah- said: ‘This indicates that they have been forgiven; because Allaah does not boast about the people who have mistakes and sins except after they have sought repentance and forgiveness.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been narrated by Imaam Ahmad in his Musnad on the authority of Abdullaah bin ‘Amr &#8211; radi Allaahu anhu – on the authority of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘ Indeed Allaah Ta’ala boasts to His Angels with the people of ‘Arafah on the evening of ‘Arafah and says: Look at My slaves. They come to Me with dishevelled hair and covered in dust.’</strong></span> [4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ibn al-Qayyim -Rahimullaah- said in his famous poetry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For Allaah is that great standing * Like the standing of the Day of Judgement, rather that is greater</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He The Jabbar –the Glorified- comes closer that Day * He boasts about them to what He possesses, but He is more generous</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He says: My slaves have come to Me with love * and I am to them more Generous and more Merciful</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I testify that I have indeed forgiven their sins * and I have given them what they had hoped for and bestowed blessings</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So be it glad tidings O people of that great place * by it Allaah forgives the sins and gives mercy</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Fudayl bin ‘Ayaad -Rahimullaah- stood in ‘Arafah and saw the sobbing and crying of the people during the evening of ‘Arafah, then said: ‘Do you not see if all these people came to a man and asked him for a small coin, would he refuse them?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said, ‘No,’ so he replied: I swear by Allaah, that Allaah forgiving them is easier than this man trying to fulfil their request of a small coin.’ 5(1)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is why it is necessary for the Muslim who desires profit and gain on this blessed day to be humble to his Lord -Subhanahu- to humble himself for Him, lower himself in honour of Allaah, feel powerless in front of Him, hope for His mercy and forgiveness, fear His punishment and that which He hates, repent to Him from every sin that one’s hands have earned and from every mistake one’s feet walked towards.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslim does not waste his time at this great place by going here and there or by chatting with this person and that person, rather he turns to his Lord and Protector, making much Dhikr (remembrance) and Dua’ (supplication), seeking forgiveness and begging from Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is established in the hadeeth of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- is that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">‘The best supplication is the supplication of the day of ‘Arafat and the best thing which I and the Prophets before me have said is:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah Alone, He has no partner and to Him belongs the Dominion. To Him belongs the praise and He is capable/has power over all things.’[6]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">La ilaha ‘illa Allaahu wahdahu la shareeka lahu, lahul mulku wa lahul hamdu wa huwa ala kulli shayin qadeer</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Day of ‘Arafah is a day of supplication and the best Dhikr (remembrance) is saying ‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah.’ The Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- used to say the best Dhikr (remembrance) abundantly on the best of the days, since the best of days is the day of ‘Arafah and the best of Adhkaar (plural of Dhikr) is saying ‘There is none worthy of worship except Allaah.’ So saying the best of Adhkaar plentifully on the best of days is the most appropriate aim and match.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the statement: ‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah,’ which the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- used to say a great deal on the day of ‘Arafah, is the best of words, the most magnificent of all statements, the firmest handhold and it is a statement of Taqwaa and the key to the land of eternal happiness. It is the principle of the Deen and its foundation, and the head of its matter. Due to ‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’ (There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah) the heavens and the earth were established, the creation was created, the Messengers were sent and the Divine Books were revealed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The excellence of these words and their status in the Deen are indescribable and greater than the claims of those who say they know its virtues. On the contrary, it has virtues and distinctions which could not ever enter one’s mind or one’s imagination. However, it is obligatory for the Muslim to know that ‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’ (There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah) is not accepted from the one who merely pays lip service to it, without establishing its rights and obligations or fulfilling its principles and conditions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, ‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’ (There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah), is not a statement with no meaning or reality, nor are they words without any content. Rather these great words indeed have a meaning which it is necessary to understand, which have to be comprehended and an aim which it is necessary to adopt. There is agreement amongst the people of knowledge that this statement is not beneficial if it is, either, merely pronounced without understanding its meaning, or if what it necessitates is not acted upon as Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#008000;">And those whom they invoke instead of Him have no power of intercession; except those who bear witness to the truth, and they know (the facts about the Oneness of Allaah)</span></strong>&gt;&gt; [az-Zuhkruf : 86]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">which means: except those who testify ‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah’ and their hearts know the meaning of what their tongues declare. There is no doubt that this matter is of utmost importance and that it is fitting that every Muslim should concern himself with it fully and pay complete attention to it. Indeed ‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’ (There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah) does not benefit except the one who knows its meaning, both the negation and affirmation, and believes in and acts by it. As for the one who says it and acts upon it outwardly without believing in it then he is a hypocrite. As regards the one who says it and acts contrary to it with Shirk then he is a disbeliever. Also the one who says it and then apostatises from Islaam by rejecting something of what it necessitates from its rights, then it does not benefit him even if he says it a thousand times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who says it and then directs any aspect of worship to other than Allaah, such that he supplicates to or seeks aid from other than Him or seeks 4help, assistance or victory from other than Allaah in those things where only Allaah has the capability, or other such similar acts of worship, then whoever directs away from Allaah that which is only befitting Him is a Mushrik, even if he says ‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah’. This is because this great statement entails making all worship purely for Allaah’s sake and not associating partners with Him, turning to Allaah Alone, without any partner, with humbleness and submissiveness, with striving and strong desire and turning repentantly with trust and reliance in supplication and request.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The companion of ‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah’ does not ask except from Allaah nor does he seek deliverance and rescue except from Allaah. He does not trust in or rely except upon Allaah nor does he have hope or longing for other than Allaah. He does not sacrifice except for Allaah nor does he avert any of the acts of worship to other than Allaah. He disbelieves in everything that is worshipped besides Allaah and he clears them away from<br />
Allaah.[7]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 12</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Having Sincerity for Allaah During Supplication</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed from the great acts of worship the Muslims increase upon and show great concern for during the Hajj is Dua’, which is the most important form and best type of worship. The Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- described in the authentic hadeeth that Dua’ in itself is worship due to its great status and lofty nature. This is why there are many texts from the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah showing the great importance and high status of Dua’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The texts comprise praise for making Dua’, encouragement to make Dua’ and inspire different ways to make Dua’, sometimes with a command to make Dua’, sometimes explaining its position and status, sometimes praising the people who make Dua’ and sometimes mentioning the great and different types of reward for those who make Dua’ and warning against those who neglect to make Dua’ or refuse to do so out of haughtiness or arrogance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta&#8217;ala says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Invoke your Lord with humility and in secret.  He likes not the aggressors. And do not do mischief on the earth, after it has been set in order and invoke Him with fear and hope; Surely, Allaah&#8217;s Mercy is (ever) near unto the good doers.</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [Araaf: 55-56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He is The Ever Living, Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), so invoke Him making your worship pure for Him Alone (by worshipping Him Alone, and none else, and by doing righteous deeds sincerely for Allaah&#8217;s sake only, and not to show off, and not to set up rivals with Him in worship). All the praises and thanks be to Allaah, The Lord of the all that exists</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [Ghafir: 65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And when My slaves ask you concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor). So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright</strong></span>. &gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah: 186]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord said: ‘Invoke Me, (and ask Me for anything) I will respond to your (invocation). Verily! Those who scorn My worship [i.e. do not invoke Me and do not believe in My Oneness,] they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!’</span></strong> &gt;&gt; [Ghafir:60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Ayaat with this meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What increases the pilgrims in their concern for Dua’ and strengthens them in it during the Hajj is that they have combined the virtue and honour of the place they are in with the virtue and honour of the time period they are in, along with what descends upon their hearts of gentleness, humility and turning towards Allaah, especially on the Day of ‘Arafat which is the greatest and most noble of days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah -Rahimullaah- said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Indeed it is known that on the evening of ‘Arafat Eemaan, mercy, light and blessings which cannot be expressed descend upon the hearts of the pilgrims.’</strong></span>[1]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is established on the authority of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- regarding the great matter of Dua’ on the Day of ‘Arafat and in explanation of its excellence, that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> ‘The best of Dua’ is the Dua’ of the Day of ‘Arafat.</strong></span>’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abdul Barr -Rahimullaah- said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘… and from the Fiqh of the previous hadeeth is that the Dua’ of the Day of ‘Arafat is better than all other Dua’. Also, in this hadeeth, is evidence that the Dua’s on the Day of ‘Arafat are all, generally, answered.’</strong></span>[3]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During Hajj there are specific places at which it is necessary for the Muslim to stop. It is appropriate to make Dua’ at these places emulating the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-, as it is established that the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- would stop there, face the Qiblah and supplicate to Allaah Azza wa Jal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>There are six places in particular:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) In ‘Arafat &#8211; as previously mentioned.<br />
(2) In the places of al-Haraam where the Hajj rites take place, as Allaah Ta&#8217;ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then when you leave ‘Arafat, remember Allaah at Mash&#8217;ar-il-Haram</strong></span>&gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah:198]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3,4) On as-Safa and al-Marwa as is established in Saheeh Muslim from the hadeeth of Jaabir -RadhiAllaahu anhu- that when the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- used to stand on as-Safa he would say Allaahu Akbar three times and would say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah Alone, He has no partners, to Him belongs the Dominion and for Him is all praise, and He is capable of all things.’</strong></span> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would do that three times and make Dua’ and would do likewise on al-Marwa.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(5,6) After the stoning the two Jamaraat (the small one and medium one) as it is established in Saheeh Bukhari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullaah bin Umar –Radhi Allaahu anhu- used to stone the small Jamaarah with seven small pebbles and used to recite Takbeer on throwing each stone. He then, would proceed further until he reached level ground, where he would stay for a long time, facing the Qibla to supplicate to Allaah whilst raising his hands. Then he would stone the medium Jamaarah similarly and would go to the left towards the level ground, where he would stand for a long time facing the Qibla to supplicate to Allaah whilst raising his hands. Then he would stone the big Jamaarah from the middle of the valley but he would not stay by it. Ibn Umar used to say: ‘This is what I saw the Messenger of Allaah doing.’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are the six places where it is established that the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-stood, made Dua’ and raised his hands. Dua’ is a great matter and has a high status in Hajj. Generally, Dua’ has an innate nature in all aspects of worship, it is the spirit and essence of worship and it is established from the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- that he said: ‘Dua’ is worship.’[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If making Dua’ has distinguished status and a high rank then it is obligatory upon the Muslim to have a great concern for the significance of Dua’. He should understand that he is bound by its conditions and should be refined by its manners. He should be on-guard to avoid any actions that would prevent a Dua’ from being answered and he should be aware of the times when Dua’ is most likely to be answered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most important matter in this great act that is necessary for the Muslim to check, is that his Dua’ is solely and sincerely for Allaah – Azza wa Jal. So he does not make Dua’ except to Allaah, he does not seek aid except from Allaah, nor does he request assistance, support and help or cure except from Allaah. This is because Dua’, as previously mentioned, is worship and directing any act of worship to other than Allaah is Major Shirk which takes a person outside of Islaam. We seek refuge in Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta&#8217;ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And invoke not besides Allaah any that will neither profit you, nor hurt you, but if (in case) you did so, you shall certainly be one of the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if Allaah touches you with hurt, there is none who can remove it but He; and if He intends any good for you, there is none who can repel His Favour which He causes to reach whomsoever of His slaves He will. And He is The Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful &gt;&gt; [Yunus : 106-107]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And whoever invokes (or worships), besides Allaah, any other ilâh (god), for whom he has no proof, then his reckoning is only with his Lord. Surely! the disbelievers will not be successful &gt;&gt; [al-Muminoon:117]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; He is The Ever Living, Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), so invoke Him making your worship pure for Him Alone (by worshipping Him Alone, and none else, and by doing righteous deeds sincerely for Allaah&#8217;s sake only, and not to show off, and not to set up rivals with Him in worship). All the praises and thanks be to Allaah, The Lord of the all that exists &gt;&gt; [Ghafir: 65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And the mosques are for Allaah (Alone), so invoke not anyone along with Allaah &gt;&gt;[Jinn : 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Again, there are many Ayaat with this meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the manners of making Dua’ is what Allaah Ta&#8217;ala mentioned in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Invoke your Lord with humility and in secret.  He likes not the aggressors. And do not do mischief on the earth, after it has been set in order and invoke Him with fear and hope; Surely, Allaah&#8217;s Mercy is (ever) near unto the good – doers &gt;&gt;[al-‘Aaraaf: 55-56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his Dua’, the Muslim combines bringing presence of the heart and the feeling of dire need of what is sought with the Dua’. He does this causing it to coincide with the best times for Dua’ along with Khushoo’ (humility) in the heart, subservience to his Lord, submission to Him, imploring Him, having graciousness, having faced the Qibla in a state of purification, raising his hands to Allaah, beginning with praise and exaltation of Allaah and joining this with prayer upon Muhammad -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- who is His slave and Messenger. After this, he puts forward, to Allaah, his requests of repentance and forgiveness, then beseeches Allaah, earnestly asking of Him with total subservience to Him, supplicating to Him with fervent desire and dread and seeking closeness to Him with His Names, Attributes and Tawheed. He makes this Dua’ with sincerity and so this Dua’ is not about to ever be rejected. This is especially so if all of this coincides with supplications the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- taught as well as the best times and places for the answering of supplications along with the greatest Name of Allaah, whereby if He is asked He bestows and if He is called with it, He answers the supplication.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the supplications established in the books of Sunnah is: that the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- heard a man saying: ‘O Allaah. I ask of You, whereby I testify that You are Allaah, there is no god except You, The One, The SelfSufficient, Who is not begotten nor does He beget and there is none that resembles Him.’ So the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: ‘Indeed you have asked Allaah with His greatest name which if He is asked by, He bestows, and if He is supplicated to with it, He answers.’[8]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 10</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Obligation of Having Sincerity When Slaughtering the Sacrificial Animal</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed from the great days of Allaah is the day of an-Nahr, the tenth day from the month of Dhul-Hijjah, the day of the blessed ‘Eid al-Adha. This day has been called the day of an-Nahr because the Muslims seek closeness to Allaah on that Day by slaughtering grazing livestock (sheep, camels, cattle, goats). Pilgrims on this day slaughter their sacrificial animals and the Muslims in every scattered part of the earth slaughter their sacrificial animals too, seeking closeness to Allaah by doing so, Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<em><span style="color:#008000;">And for every nation We have appointed religious ceremonies, that they may mention the Name of Allaah over the beast of cattle that He has given them for food. And your (God) is One (God &#8211; Allaah), so you must submit to Him Alone (in Islaam). And give glad tidings to the Mukhbitin [those who obey Allaah with humility and are humble from among the true believers of Islaamic Monotheism],</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Whose hearts are filled with fear when Allaah is mentioned; who patiently bear whatever may befall them (of calamities); and who perform the prayer and who spend (in Allaah&#8217;s Cause) out of what We have provided them.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And the Budn (cows, oxen, or camels driven to be offered as sacrifices by the pilgrims at the sanctuary of Makkah.) We have made for you as among the Symbols of Allaah, therein you have much good. So mention the Name of Allaah over them when they are drawn up in lines (for sacrifice). Then, when they are down on their sides (after slaughter), eat thereof, and feed the beggar who does not ask (men), and the beggar who asks (men). Thus have We made them subject to you that you may be grateful.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allaah, but it is piety from you that reaches Him. Thus have We made them subject to you that you may magnify Allaah for His Guidance to you. And give glad tidings to the Muhsinûn (doers of good).</span></em> &gt;&gt; [Hajj: 34-37]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of which is: The intent is not just slaughtering but, indeed what has been legislated for you is slaughtering this sacrifice so that you remember Allaah at the slaughter, as He indeed is The Creator and The Provider, it is not that He will take anything from its meat or its blood, for Allaah Ta’ala is in no need of other than Himself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&lt;&lt; but it is piety from you that reaches Him&gt;&gt;</span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of which is: to have sincerity, hope of gaining reward, a good intention and a desire for the Face of Allaah by performing good actions. In 1this is a great encouragement and motivation to have sincerity in slaughtering and that the intent should be the Face of Allaah alone, because Allaah Ta’ala does not accept actions except those that are sincere, with which one only desires the Face of Allaah –Subhanahu- as Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&lt;&lt;Say: &#8220;Verily, my prayer, my sacrifice, my living and my dying are for Allaah, The Lord of all that exists. He has no partner.  And of this I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims.&#8221;&gt;&gt;</span></em> [Anaam: 162-163]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer –Rahimullaah- said in explanation of this Ayaah: ‘Allaah Ta’ala commands the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- to inform the Mushrikeen who worship other than Allaah and slaughter in other than His name, that he is in opposition to them in this. Indeed his prayer is for Allaah and his sacrifices are in the name of Allaah alone, Who has no partner. This is like the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&lt;&lt;Verily, my prayer, my sacrifice&gt;&gt;</strong> [Anaam: 162]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">i.e. that your prayer and your slaughtering should be sincerely for Allaah. Indeed the Mushrikeen used to worship idols and slaughter for them, so Allaah Ta’ala ordered the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- to oppose them, to turn away from what they were upon and to face Allaah with purpose, intention and determination, doing so sincerely for Allaah Ta’ala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujahid said regarding Allaah’s saying <strong>&lt;&lt;my prayer, my sacrifice&gt;&gt;</strong> i.e. ritual: slaughtering in the Hajj and Umrah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ath-Thawri said on the authority of Sa’eed bin Jubair who said regarding the word:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&lt;&lt;my sacrifice&gt;&gt;</strong> : my slaughtering.</p>
<p>As-Saadi and Dhihaak also said the same thing.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Slaughtering is a great act from the different types of worship with which the Muslims seek nearness to their Lord –Azza wa Jal – fulfilling rites for the sake of Allaah Ta’ala from slaughtering the sacrificial animal to vows to other such things. So it is not permissible to direct these acts of worship to other than Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been established in the authentic book of hadeeth by Muslim from the hadeeth of the Ameer ul-Mumineen ‘Alee bin Abu Taalib –radhiAllaahu anhuwho said: the Messenger of Allaah-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- informed me of four statements:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> ‘Allaah’s curse is upon the one who slaughters for other than Allaah, Allaah’s curse is upon the one who curses his parents, Allaah’s curse is upon the one who gives shelter to an innovator and Allaah’s curse is upon the one who changes signposts which mark directions on the earth.’ [2]</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Accursedness meaning exiled and being distant from the Mercy of Allaah. The most dangerous of these four matters, such that the one who does it is deserving of this punishment, is slaughtering for other than Allaah. This is why the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- mentioned it first, which shows the great danger of this matter, as slaughtering for other than Allaah is Shirk, whereas the other points mentioned are from the major sins but they do not reach the level of Shirk. Any type of slaughtering done for other than Allaah is Shirk even if what is slaughtered -seeking closeness to Allaah- is insignificant or small such as a fly or something similar to that. So how about the one seeking closeness while he sacrifices the best and the finest of animals?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been narrated by Imaam Ahmad in his book ‘az-Zuhd’, by Abu Na’eem in his book ‘al-Hileeya’ and in other places on the authority of Salman alFarsi –RadhiAllaahu anhu- with an authentic chain stopping at him, that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">‘A man entered Paradise due to a fly and another man entered the Fire due to a fly. They asked, ‘How is that?’ He replied: Two men from before your time passed by some people who had an idol and none could pass by them except that he had to sacrifice to their idol.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">They said to one of the two men: Sacrifice something.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">He said: I don’t have anything.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">They said: Sacrifice something, even if it is a fly.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">So he sacrificed a fly and passed by, then entered the Hell-fire.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">They said to the other man: Sacrifice something.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">He said: I never sacrifice anything for other than Allaah –Azza wa Jal. So they chopped his head off and he entered Paradise.’[3]</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This shows the wickedness of Shirk and the severity of its danger that, even if it is with something small, it obligates entry into Hell-fire. So, when the first man sacrificed a despicable and the vilest of animals, a fly, for the idol his reward was the Fire due to him committing Shirk in the worship of Allaah. If this is the case of the one who sacrificed by slaughtering a fly, then what is the state of the one who fattens a camel or a sacrificial animal then slaughters it for the one he worships other than Allaah such as graves, tombs, stones, trees or anything else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ash-Shawakaani –Rahimullaah- said in his book ‘Sharh as-Sadoor’: ‘This is from the causes of extreme evil, by which the evil companion is thrown behind the wall of Islaam from the highest point of the Deen and lands on his skull. So much so that many of them come with the best of the livestock they possess and the most excellent of what they have of sheep and cattle, then they slaughter them at the graves seeking closeness to them and hoping that this (closeness) can be attained from the graves. So they sacrifice for other than Allaah and, as a result, they worship one from amongst the idols, because there is no difference between slaughtering for the erected stones they call idols and slaughtering for and at the grave of the deceased calling it a grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A simple difference in description does not affect something’s being Halaal or being Haram. The one who calls alcohol by other than its true name and drinks it has the same ruling as the one who calls alcohol by its name and drinks it, there is no difference of opinion amongst any of the Muslims in this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that slaughtering is one type from the different types of worship for Allaah, similar to slaughtering the sacrificial animal and atonement. So the one who seeks closeness to the inhabitant of the grave and slaughters for it does not have any other intent in so-doing except to glorify and honour the grave, to seek to attain goodness from it and to fend off evil due to it. This is, no doubt, worship and it suffices as evil just to hear of it. There is no power or might except with Allaah, The Most High, The Most Great, to Allaah we belong and to Him is our return. The Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: ‘In Islaam there is no slaughtering animals near graves.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdur-Razzaq Sanaani said: ‘They used to slaughter at the grave, i.e. cows and sheep’ as narrated by Abu Daawood with an authentic chain of narration on the authority of Anas ibn Maalik.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Imaam ash-Shawakaani –Rahimullaah- was very eloquent in his advice and very good in warning against this dangerous issue. We ask Allaah, The Most Noble that He saves us all from falling into any of this and that He makes all our actions sincerely for His Noble Face, in accordance with the Sunnah of His Prophet Muhammad -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam. Indeed Allaah is The Most Generous and The Most Noble.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Kissing the Black Stone and Touching the<em>Yemeni</em> Corner [1]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What preceded was a discussion of the excellence of <em>Tawaaf</em> of the House of Allaah <em>al-Haraam</em>, the great act of worship and important act of obedience which is a pillar from the pillars of <em>Hajj</em> and <em>Umrah</em> and that it is prescribed for this one place only, as Allaah<em>Ta’ala</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَلۡيَطَّوَّفُواْ بِٱلۡبَيۡتِ ٱلۡعَتِيقِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; and circumambulate the Ancient House (the <em>Ka’ba</em> at Makkah). &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">[Hajj: 29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So it is not permissible to make <em>Tawaaf</em> of domes, graves, tombs or other things; since these matters clash with the principles of the <em>Sharia’</em> and they oppose the reality of<em>Tawheed</em>, because it involves associating and equating the created with The Creator <em>-Subhanahu</em>.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The discussion of a part of this issue, with a brief explanation, has already preceded.  As for what we will discuss here, by Allaah’s permission, regarding another lesson and benefit for the Muslim is what happens when he reaches the House of Allaah <em>al-Haraam</em>to perform <em>Tawaaf</em> of it.  It is legislated at this place to kiss the black stone and touch the <em>Yemeni</em> corner in obedience to Allaah and in imitation of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>. There are very many proofs which explain the legality of it and show that the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> did this when he came to the House of Allaah <em>al-Haraam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been narrated by Bukhari and Muslim on the authority of Abdullaah bin Umar bin al-Khattab <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> who said : <strong>‘I saw the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> when he came to Makkah.  He touched the black corner (the black stone) at the beginning of his <em>Tawaaf</em> and he would jog the first three of the seven circuits</strong>.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Muslim in the hadeeth of Jaabir bin AbdAllaah, who said that: <strong>‘When the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> came to Makkah he entered the <em>Masjid</em> and touched the stone, he then began from the right hand side.  He jogged for three circuits and walked for four………..’</strong>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, the Muslims also kiss the stone imitating the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, following his guidance and adhering to his Sunnah; rejecting any belief that the Black Stone could bring benefit or harm or give or withhold.  This is why the <em>Ameer ul-Mumineen</em>, Umar bin al-Khattaab <em>-RadiAllaahu anhu- </em>said, as he kissed the Black stone:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Indeed I  know that you are a stone and you cannot cause benefit or harm.  If it were not that I saw the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>kiss you, I would not have kissed you.’</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhari and  Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jareer at-Tabaree <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Verily, Umar said this because the people had newly entered Islaam after having left the worship of idols.  So Umar feared that some of the ignorant people would take the act of touching of the stone to signify glorification of stones or rocks as had been the practice of previous Arabs in times of ignorance.  Umar intended to teach the people that he only touched this stone imitating the action of the Messenger of Allaah, not because the stone itself caused harm or benefit, which they had previously believed about their idols.’</strong>[4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for what has been narrated in the hadeeth of Abu Saeed that Alee, when Umar said this, responded by saying. ‘Indeed it does harm and benefit’ and went on to mention how Allaah took covenants from the sons of Aadam and they were written upon parchement which were devoured by the stone.  He continued, ‘I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘The black Stone will be brought on the Day of Judgment, it will have a tongue and it will testify for those upon <em>Tawheed</em> who touched it.’</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, this narration is not established from the Ameer ul-Mumineen, Alee bin Abu Taalib.  Hafidh Ibn Hajr said in Fath ul-Bari: ‘In its chain is Abu Haroon al-Abdee and he is very weak.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Haroon, the narrator of this narration is <em>Matrook</em> Hadeeth (his narrations are not accepted) according to the people of knowledge, some even call him a liar! an-Nisaee mentions that he is ‘<em>Matrook al-Hadeeth’</em>.  Hamaad Ibn Zayd said ‘Abu Haroon al-Abdee is a liar, in the morning he says one thing and  in the evening another!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al Jawzajani said of him ‘a slandering liar’ and Ibn Hibban said of him ‘I used to narrate from Abu Saeed that which was not narrated by him. It is not permissible to write his hadeeth except from the standpoint of amazement!!’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how can anyone support this narration if this, according to the people of knowledge, is the state of the narrator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus what is prescribed is kissing of the Black stone only and if you cannot do so then touching it.  If it is not possible to kiss or touch it then pointing to it is sufficient.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also legislated to touch the <em>Yemeni</em> corner, as found in the two authentic books.  On the authority of Abdullaah bin Umar bin al-Khattaab <em>–RadiAllaahu anhu-</em>  ‘I did not see the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> touch any part of the House except the two <em>Yemeni</em> corners.’[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This clarifies that it is not legislated to touch any part of the House other than the two<em>Yemeni</em> corners, namely the Black stone and the <em>Yemeni</em> corner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah said: ‘No corners other than the two <em>Yemeni</em> corners are to be touched and not the <em>Shami</em> corners.  The Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> specifically touched them because they are from the foundations laid by Ibraheem whilst the other corners are from inside the House.  Thus the Black stone is touched and kissed and the <em>Yemeni</em> corner is touched but not kissed.  The remaining two corners are not touched or kissed. <em>Al-Istislaam</em> is to touch with the hand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the remaining parts of the House and the Station of Ibraheem, the entire<em>masjid</em> and its walls, graves of Prophets and righteous people, such as the house of our Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, the cave of Ibraheem, the place in which our Prophet used to pray in and other places such as the graves of the Prophets and the righteous people and the stone in Bait al-Maqdis, then none of these are to be touched or kissed and the Imaams are all in agreement on this.’[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are great lessons and benefits which the Muslim derives from the fact that touching and kissing is only legislated at the above-mentioned specific place.  The evidence does not allow these acts to be performed at other than these two places.  Thus the Muslim does this in obedience to Allaah and imitating His Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.  The Muslim does not believe that in doing this (i.e. touching/kissing) he will receive any benefit or ward off any harm, as in the preceding explanation of the <em>Ameer ul-Mumineen</em>, Umar bin Khattab, where he kissed the Black stone and said as much in front of the people in order to teach and guide them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As previous texts have illustrated, touching or kissing the walls of the <em>Ka’ba</em> at other than the <em>Yemeni</em> corners or the Black stone is not from the Sunnah.  The texts show that touching or kissing the station of Ibraheem is, likewise, not from the Sunnah as nothing regarding this has been narrated from the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it (i.e. touching/kissing) is not permissible with the <em>Ka’bah</em> itself -whose sacredness over all other <em>Masajid</em> and places is well-known- then it is not permissible at the Station of Ibraeem, about which Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَٱتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبۡرَٰهِ&#x200d;ۧمَ مُصَلّٗىۖ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; And take the <em>Maqaam </em>(place) of Ibraheem [or the stone on which Ibraheem stood while he was building the Ka&#8217;bah] as a place of prayer&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">[al-Baqarah : 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though it is known that there is the Station of Ibraheem in Shaam, and other places, along with the other places of the Prophets lesser than this one, Allaah has only ordered us to take this particular, one station as a place of prayer.  Yet even so, we are not allowed to touch it or kiss it, as there is no evidence to sanction such an action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Know! That the rest of places cannot be made places of prayer nor can you touch or kiss any of them.  In fact there is no one thing on the face of this earth other than the Black stone that it has been made allowed to kiss.[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those ignorant people -who encourage one another to gather around shrines and tombs etc- they kiss, rub and touch them.  They seek blessings from them and request their help and aid.  All of this has nothing at all to do with the <em>Deen</em>.  On the contrary, it is clear misguidance and a great lie.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah said: ‘As for touching/rubbing a grave, regardless of whose it is, kissing it or placing one’s cheek upon it then this is prohibited by the consensus of the Muslims, even if they were the graves of the Prophets.  Neither anyone from the Salaf of this <em>Ummah</em> nor from the Imaams did it, rather this is from<em>Shirk</em>.’[10]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>Lessons of Creed Acquired From the Hajj<br />
</strong>By ‘AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-Badr<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Chapter Six</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tawwaf of the House of Allaah al-Haraam</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed from the great lessons that benefits the pilgrim is when he reaches the Ancient House and carries out that great act of worship which is: <em>Tawwaf</em> of the House of Allaah<em>al-Haraam</em>.  He sees all those pilgrims performing <em>Tawwaf</em> in obedience to Allaah and fulfilling His command.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What benefits him in this situation is that which is well-known; the important state and noble value of this worship and the great intensity with which it enters the hearts of the believers.  This is especially so when the large masses of believers are all dressed in one type of clothing and are of uniform appearance, circling the House of Allaah, saying: ‘SubhanAllaah, La illaah ill Allaah and Allaahu Akbar’ (Far is Allaah from imperfection, There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah and Allaah is the Greatest), supplicating to their Noble Lord, beseeching Him for success, asking of Him and turning to Him in prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every single one of them is making a <em>Tawwaf</em> of seven circuits, all of them beginning at the black stone and ending at it and this is what the <em>Tawwaf</em> is: going around the <em>Ka’ba</em>seven times with the intention of <em>Tawwaf</em>, in worship of Allaah, starting with the black stone and ending at it, with the <em>Ka’ba</em> on their left hand side.  The Muslims do this in obedience to Allaah and in imitation of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, and, for each person, the level of perfection for this act of worship is the equivalent to how much he followed the Noble Messenger<em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Tawwaf</em> is the first action a Muslim does when he reaches Makkah.  It is narrated by Bukhari and Muslim on the authority of ‘Ayesha <em>-radiAllaah anha &#8211;</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed the first action the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> performed when he reached Makkah was that he made <em>Wudhoo</em>, then he made the <em>Tawwaf</em>.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been narrated by Muslim in his authentic book on the authority of Jaabir ibn Abdullaah <em>&#8211; radiAllaah anhu – </em>who described the <em>Hajj</em> of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘…until we came to the House with the Prophet, where he touched the corner (black stone), then briskly walked the first three circuits and calmly walked four circuits.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has also been narrated by Bukhari and Muslim from the Hadeeth of Ibn Umar <em>&#8211; radiAllaah anhu-</em> ‘that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> if he made<em>Tawwaf</em> in the <em>Hajj</em> or <em>Umrah</em>, the first thing he would begin with was walking briskly for three circuits and walking the remaining four normally.  Then, he prostrated twice (i.e. he prayed two <em>rakahs</em>) and, next, walked between as-Safa and al-Marwah.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The evidences in the Book and the Sunnah showing the legislation of <em>Tawwaf </em>of the House of Allaah <em>al-Haraam</em> are numerous and there are multiple narrations from the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>. </em> This is proof that this action brings one closer to Allaah and it is obedience from Allaah’s slaves that He loves.  He has legislated it for them and commanded them with it, urged them to carry it out and made it a rite from the rites whereby His House <em>al-Haraam</em> is intended as He said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَأَذِّن فِي ٱلنَّاسِ بِٱلۡحَجِّ يَأۡتُوكَ رِجَالٗا وَعَلَىٰ كُلِّ ضَامِرٖ يَأۡتِينَ مِن كُلِّ فَجٍّ عَمِيقٖ ٢٧ لِّيَشۡهَدُواْ<br />
مَنَٰفِعَ لَهُمۡ وَيَذۡكُرُواْ ٱسۡمَ ٱللَّهِ فِيٓ أَيَّامٖ مَّعۡلُومَٰتٍ عَلَىٰ مَا رَزَقَهُم مِّنۢ بَهِيمَةِ ٱلۡأَنۡعَٰمِۖ فَكُلُواْ مِنۡهَا<br />
وَأَطۡعِمُواْ ٱلۡبَآئِسَ ٱلۡفَقِيرَ ٢٨ ثُمَّ لۡيَقۡضُواْ تَفَثَهُمۡ وَلۡيُوفُواْ نُذُورَهُمۡ وَلۡيَطَّوَّفُواْ بِٱلۡبَيۡتِ ٱلۡعَتِيقِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And proclaim to mankind the <em>Hajj</em>.  They will come to you on foot and on every lean camel, they will come from every deep and distant mountain highway (to perform<em>Hajj</em>).  That they may witness things that are of benefit to them and mention the Name of Allaah on the appointed days, over the livestock animals that He has provided for them.  Then eat thereof and feed therewith the poor having a hard time.  Then let them complete their prescribed duties and perform their vows, and circumambulate the Ancient House.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Hajj: 27-29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Allaah appointed His Prophet and friend, Ibraheem, along with his son Ismaeel, the Prophet of Allaah –<em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam</em>, to sanctify the House, build its foundations and prepare it for those who would perform <em>Tawwaf</em>, stand up for prayer, make <em>Rukoo</em> and make <em>Sujood</em>, Allaah says :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَعَهِدۡنَآ إِلَىٰٓ إِبۡرَٰهِ&#x200d;ۧمَ وَإِسۡمَٰعِيلَ أَن طَهِّرَا بَيۡتِيَ لِلطَّآئِفِينَ وَٱلۡعَٰكِفِينَ وَٱلرُّكَّعِ ٱلسُّجُودِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;and We commanded Ibraheem and Isma’eel that they should purify My House (the Ka’bahat Makkah) for those who are circumbulating it, staying (in it i.e. in <em>I’tikâf</em>), bowing or prostrating themselves (there, in prayer) &gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah : 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَإِذۡ بَوَّأۡنَا لِإِبۡرَٰهِيمَ مَكَانَ ٱلۡبَيۡتِ أَن لَّا تُشۡرِكۡ بِي شَيۡ&#x200d;ٔٗا وَطَهِّرۡ بَيۡتِيَ لِلطَّآئِفِينَ وَٱلۡقَآئِمِينَ وَٱلرُّكَّعِ ٱلسُّجُودِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;And (remember) when We showed Ibraheem the site of the (Sacred) House (the Ka’bah at Makkah) (saying): “Associate not anything (in worship) with Me, and sanctify My House for those who circumambulate it, those who stand up for prayer, and those who bow and prostrate (in prayer)”&gt;&gt;[Hajj: 26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It becomes clear from what has preceded that <em>Tawwaf</em> of the Ancient House is a noble act of worship and great act of obedience that Allaah loves from His slaves.  He has legislated it and ordained it for them.  He has prepared a great reward and many gains for those performing the <em>Tawwaf</em>.  <em>Tawwaf</em> of the House is a pillar from the pillars of<em>Hajj</em>, just as it is also a pillar from the pillars of <em>Umrah</em>.  This shows the great importance and high status of the <em>Tawwaf</em> with Allaah; since neither the <em>Hajj</em> nor the<em>Umrah</em> can be complete without it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, in this great act, the Muslim learns great lessons and attains significant benefits, which is that this significant act of worship – by which I mean the <em>Tawwaf</em> – was legislated for this place alone, around the House of Allaah <em>al-Haraam</em>, as preceding texts from the Book and Sunnah have shown and there are many other texts as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this, the Muslim comes to know that making <em>Tawwaf</em> in any place of the world other than this place is not legislated and there is nothing that proves its legislation.  Rather it is misguidance and false to make the houses of the creation equal with the House of the Creator; that place that He <em>-Subhanahu-</em> commanded to be established for His remembrance, obedience and to be faced in His <em>-Subhanahu-</em> worship.  There is no difference amongst the people of knowledge regarding the futility of making <em>Tawwaf</em>in any area or location other than the House of Allaah <em>al-Haraam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it  is not permissible to make <em>Tawwaf</em> around domed shrines or graves, nor around tombs, trees, stones or anything else, and there are many, many narrations from the people of knowledge regarding this.  Perhaps, if time allows, I will mention some of their statements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam an-Nawawee <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said in his book ‘al-Majmoo Sharh al-Muhadhib’: ‘and it is not permissible to make <em>Tawwaaf</em> of his grave <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continues after mentioning some points: ‘A person should not be deceived by many of the common people performing this <em>Tawwaf</em> because following the Sunnah and performing an action is only done by following the <em>Ahaadeeth</em> and the sayings of the scholars; no attention is paid to the innovations and ignorance of the common people or other then them.  It is affirmed in the two authentic books on the authority of ‘Ayesha <em>-RadiAllaah anha</em>: that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211;<em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>said<em>:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever innovates in this matter of ours that which is not from it then it is rejected.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in the narration of Muslim :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever does an action that we have not commanded then it will be rejected.’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And on the authority of Abu Huraira <em>&#8211; radiAllaah anhu &#8211;</em> who said that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Do not frequent my grave, and send prayers upon me, as your prayers reach me from wherever you are.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Aboo Dawood with an authentic chain,[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fudayl bin ‘Ayaad <em>-Rahimullaah-</em>  said the meaning of which is : ‘Follow the paths of guidance and you will not be harmed due to being a small number of followers.  Beware of the paths of misguidance and do not be deceived by the large number of ruined ones.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whosoever thinks that wiping his hands on graves and shrines, and other things similar to this, is more effective for receipt of blessings then this is from his ignorance and negligence; because receiving blessings can only be by way of that which is in accordance with the <em>Sharia’</em>, and how can good be achieved by opposing that which is correct.’[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said :  ‘And Indeed the Muslims are agreed that it is not legislated to make the <em>Tawaaf</em> except of <em>Bait-ul-Mamoor</em>.  It is not allowed to make <em>Tawaaf</em> of the rock of Bait ul-Maqdis, nor of the Prophet’s house <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, nor of the dome which is in the mountain of ‘Arafat, nor in any other place.’[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said : ‘There is no place on earth like the <em>Ka’ba</em> where you can make <em>Tawaaf</em>.  Whoever believes that making <em>Tawaaf</em> of other than the <em>Ka’ba</em> is legislated, then that is a worse evil than the one who believes that it is permissible to pray facing other than the <em>Ka’ba</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and the Muslims prayed facing Bait ul- Maqdis for eighteen months when he first migrated from Makkah to Madina.  That was the <em>Qiblah</em> of the Muslims for that period, then Allaah changed the<em>Qiblah</em> to the <em>Ka’ba</em> and revealed this in the Qur’aan as is mentioned in Sooratul Baqaraah.  The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and the Muslims prayed towards the <em>Ka’ba</em> and so it became a <em>Qiblah</em>.  It is the <em>Qiblah</em> of Ibraheem and other than him, from the Prophets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever today takes the rock as a <em>Qiblah</em> and prays facing it then he is a disbeliever, an apostate and he is made to repent- so he either repents or he is killed.  This is even though it used to be a <em>Qiblah</em> but has since been abrogated.  So what is the condition of one who takes it as a place for <em>Tawaaf</em>, just as one would make <em>Tawaaf</em>of the <em>Ka’ba</em>?  Making <em>Tawaaf</em> of other than the <em>Ka’ba</em> has not been legislated by Allaah in any way whatsoever……….’[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, with this research mentioned by Imaam an-Nawawee, Shaykh-ul- Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah and other then them from amongst the people of knowledge, the severe evil and danger of making <em>Tawaaf</em> of any place other than the House of Allaah<em>al-Haraam</em>&#8211; which Allaah gave permission to make <em>Tawaaf</em> around- becomes clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As far as what some of the ignorant people do where they make <em>Tawaaf</em> around graves, domes, shrines or anything else like this, then none of this is from the <em>Deen</em> of Allaah; rather it is from the whisperings of the Shaytaan and the legislation of Iblees; if it is not, then where is it to be found in the Book and the Sunnah: ‘make <em>Tawaaf</em> of the grave of so-and-so’ or of the tomb of so-and-so’, or things of this nature?  Allaah is The Most High above what they describe and He is far from the imperfection of what they associate with Him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Lessons of Creed Acquired From the Hajj<br />
</strong>By ‘AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-Badr </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Chapter Five</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>An Explanation of a Number of Benefits Gained From The <em>Talbiyaah</em></strong><strong><em><strong>[1]</strong></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the words in the proclamation relate to a very important matter and have a profound explanation.  We previously discussed the proof for the words of the<em>Talbiyaah</em> containing the implementation of <em>Tawheed</em> and the rejection of <em>Shirk</em>.  There is no doubt that these are great words which comprise important meanings with distinguished aims and many benefits.  The people of knowledge have pointed out the great significance of these words and the magnitude of what they comprise, of benefits and gains.  The Imaam and great scholar Ibn al-Qayyim mentioned a complete section, giving an extended explanation and discussion of this, in his book ‘Tahdeeb as-Sunnan’.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘And indeed the words in the <em>Talbiyaah</em> consist of great principles and magnificent benefits…’  and he mentioned twenty one benefits.  Here I will summarise a number of these magnificent benefits extracted from the <em>Talbiyaah</em> and from what Ibn al-Qayyim mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from these benefits is:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Your saying: ‘Labbayk’ (here I am).  This includes the response to your supplication by The One supplicated to and the response to your call by The One called upon.  It is not correct linguistically or intellectually that you call someone who does not speak or that you supplicate to someone who cannot answer you, so in this is the affirmation of the attribute of Allaah’s Speech.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>That the <em>Talbiyaah</em> includes love.  ‘Labbayk’ (here I am) is not said except to The One who is loved and glorified.  This is why it is said of its meaning: ‘I am directing myself towards You with what You love’, and it is said: a woman is beloved. i.e. beloved to her son.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>That the <em>Talbiyaah</em> comprises an adherence to a continuous (<em>al-Uboodiyah</em>) worship, so this is why it is said: the <em>Talbiyaah</em> is taken from the word <em>al-Iqamah</em> (establishment), i.e.: I am established on Your obedience.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>It includes humility and submissiveness, i.e. humility and more humility, in what they say: I am responding here in front of You, i.e. with humbleness and submissiveness.</li>
<li>It comprises <em>al-Ikhlaas</em> (sincerity), that is, it is said: the <em>Talbiyaah</em> is taken from the word <em>al-Lubb</em> (the core) and it is something pure.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the benefits of the <em>Talbiyaah</em> are that:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>It comprises an affirmation that Allaah, The Lord, hears; since it is impossible that a man will say ‘Labbayk’ (here I am) to someone who will not hear his supplication.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>It includes coming closer to Allaah, since it is said: that the <em>Talbiyaah</em> is taken from the word <em>al-ilbaab</em> (establishing) and that is seeking nearness.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>The <em>Talbiyaah</em> is used as a distinction between moving from one state to another and from one rite to another in <em>Ihraam</em>, just as the <em>Takbeer</em> (saying<em>Allaahu Ak</em><em>bar</em>) in the prayer is a cause for moving from one pillar of the prayer to another.  This is why it is the Sunnah to say the <em>Talbiyaah</em> up until the start of the <em>Tawaaf</em> at which point you break off from the <em>Talbiyaah</em>.  Then (after that), the pilgrim again begins to say the <em>Talbiyaah</em> until he stands at ‘Arafat, then he breaks off the <em>Talbiyaah</em>.  The pilgrim then resumes the <em>Talbiyaah</em> until he stands at Muzdalifah then he breaks off from it.  Then he makes the<em>Talbiyaah</em> until he stones the <em>Jamaraatul-‘Aqabah</em> (the Large Pillar) then he stops making <em>Talbiyaah</em>.  Therefore, the <em>Talbiyaah</em> is a sign of <em>Hajj</em> and a (sign of) change in the actions of its rites.  So, when the pilgrim moves from one action to another action he says: ‘Labbayk Allaahumma Labbayk’, just as the one praying says ‘<em>Allaahu Ak</em><em>bar</em>’ when he moves from one act to another.  So, when he completes his rites, he breaks off from the <em>Talbiyaah</em>, just as the one praying says the <em>Tasleem</em> (saying salaams at the end of the prayer) which cuts him off from his <em>Takbeer</em>.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>The <em>Talbiyaah</em> is a sign of <em>Tawheed</em> and the creed of Ibraheem – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam</em>, which is the spirit of <em>Hajj</em> and its purpose.  On the contrary, it is the spirit of all acts of worship and its purpose.  This is why the <em>Talbiyaah</em> is the key to this act of worship, wherewith a person enters into the <em>Hajj</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From its benefits is that it contains the key to Paradise and the door of Islaam whereby Paradise and Islaam are entered. It is also the statement of <em>al-Ikhlaas</em> and the testification for Allaah that He has no partners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the benefits of the <em>Talbiyaah</em> is that it includes the fact that all praise (<em>al-Hamd</em>) is for Allaah, which is the most beloved thing whereby a slave comes closer to Allaah.  It is the first thing that the people of Paradise will call with and ‘<em>al-Hamd</em>’ is the opening and completion of the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From its benefits is that it comprises the acknowledgement that all blessings belong to Allaah and this is why the word <em>an-Ni’ma</em> (الـنعـم) (the blessing) is in the definite form, meaning that it includes everything i.e. that all blessings are for You [O Allaah ] and You are The Lord of blessings and the One who gives blessings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From its (benefits); the <em>Talbiyaah</em> includes the acknowledgement that all the dominion belongs to Allaah Alone, thus there is, in actuality, no dominion for anyone other than Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from its benefits: The <em>Talbiyaah</em> includes a notification of the combination of <em>al-Mulk </em>(the dominion), <em>an-Ni’mah </em>(the blessings) and al-Hamd (the praise) and that all of these are for Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em>.  This is another type of praise for Allaah which is different to the praise which results from (only) one of any of these three, High attributes.  So combining the dominion, which constitutes capability, with the blessing- which constitutes the height of benefiting, doing good and mercy-, and the praise – which constitutes a general sublimity and honour which leads to loving Allaah- then this is a different type of praise and in it is a greatness and perfection and a glory which is better suited to Allaah and befitting for Him <em>–Subhanahu</em>.  So, when a slave  remembers Him and knows about his Lord then his heart is attracted to Allaah and turns towards Him, facing Him, professing all love for Him with that which is the reason for <em>al-Uboodiyaah</em> (worship) and its core.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From its benefits: the Prophet said, ‘The best thing which I and the Prophets before me have said is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَه،ُ لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْد،ُ وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaahu wahdahu la shareeka lahu, lahul mulku wa lahul hamdu wa huwa ala kulli shayin qadeer’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">(There is none worthy of worship except Allaah Alone, He has no partner, He has the Dominion and for Him is the praise and He has the capability over everything.)’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>Talbiyaah</em> consists of these words exactly and they include the same meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from the benefits: That the words in the <em>Talbiyaah</em> contain a refutation of everyone who negates Allaah’s Attributes and His <em>Tawheed</em>.  So the <em>Talbiyaah</em> nullifies the statements of the <em>Mushrikeen</em> however diverse their sects and statements. The<em>Talbiyaah</em> nullifies the statements of the philosophers and whoever is affected by them, from amongst those who nullify Allaah’s Attributes connected to <em>al-Hamd</em> (all praise).  The <em>Talbiyaah</em> ends the sayings of the <em>Qadireeyah</em>,  who are called the <em>Majoos</em> (fire-worshippers) of this <em>Ummah</em>, those who separate the actions of His slaves- from amongst the Angels, <em>Jinn</em> and mankind- from the dominion of The Lord and His capability.  They do not affirm that Allaah has power over them, nor do they make Him the Creator of this power over them.</p>
<blockquote><p>So, whoever comes to know the meaning of  the <em>Talbiyaah</em>, testifies to them and truly believes in them, then he will be unlike all the sects of the Muattilah (those who nullify the attributes of Allaah.)</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, from the benefits of the <em>Talbiyaah</em> is that repetition of the testification (<em>Shahaada</em>) in Allaah, ‘that He has no partner’, has a benefit which is that Allaah has informed him of the fact that He has no partner after the response to: ‘labbayk’ (Here I am), then he repeats it again after saying: ‘innal hamda wan-ni’mata laka wal mulka-la shareeka lak’ (Verily all praise is for You, and every bounty is from You, and all dominion is Yours – You have no partner.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This section of the <em>Talbiyaah</em> consists of the fact that Allaah has no partner in praise, blessing or dominion whereas the first part consists of the fact that Allaah has no partner in His response to this call (i.e. the <em>Talbiyaah</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is similar to the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">شَهِدَ ٱللَّهُ أَنَّهُۥ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ وَٱلۡمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ وَأُوْلُواْ ٱلۡعِلۡمِ قَآئِمَۢا بِٱلۡقِسۡطِۚ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ ٱلۡعَزِيزُ ٱلۡحَكِيمُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Allah bears witness that <em>Lâ ilâha illa Huwa</em> (none has the right to be worshipped but He), and the Angels, and those having knowledge (also give this witness); (He is always) maintaining His creation in Justice. <em>Lâ ilâh illa Huwa</em> (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the All-Mighty, the All-Wise. &gt;&gt; [al-Imraan: 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At the beginning of this Ayaah Allaah tells us that there is none worthy of worship in truth except Him, which is incorporated into His testimony (<em>la ilaha ill Allaah</em>) along with the testimony of the Angels and the people of knowledge, this is what has been attested to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah informs us that He maintains with justice and that He is just, then repeats the testification that there is none worthy of worship in truth except Him along with His maintainingeverything with justice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are just a number of great benefits and the precious harvest acquired from this distinguished statement, the <em>Talbiyaah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These benefits, without doubt, indicate the importance of concern for understanding the meaning of this statement and that if the slave of Allaah has correct concern for it then this will help him to perform this worship in the best and most correct way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>Lessons of Creed Acquired From the Hajj<br />
</strong>By ‘AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-Badr<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Chapter 3</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Proclamation of Tawheed is an Evidence of ‘Aqeedah</strong><strong>[1]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the most significant of the great lessons which benefits the Muslim in his <em>Hajj</em> to the House of Allaah the <em>al-Haram</em> is the obligation to have sincerity in all worship for Allaah Alone Who has no partners. So when the Muslim begins his <em>Hajj</em>, the first thing that he begins with is the proclamation of <em>Tawheed</em> and rejection of <em>Shirk</em> (associating partners with Allaah), when he says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">لَبَّيْكَ اللَّهُمَّ لَبَّيْكَ , لَبَّيْكَ لا شَرِيكَ لَكَ لَبَّيْكَ , إنَّ الْحَمْدَ وَالنِّعْمَةَ لَكَ وَالْمُلْكَ ، لا شَرِيكَ لَكَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">labbaykallaahumma labbaika, labbaika laa shareeka laka labbaika-innal hamda wan ni’mata laka wal mulka-la shareeka lak</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Here I am O Allaah, here I am, You have no partner, here I am, Verily all praise is for You, and every bounty is from You, and all dominion is Yours – You have no partner.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He repeats it and raises his voice with it whilst, at the same time, he is conscious of and feels what this proclamation indicates: the obligation to single out Allaah Alone with worship and keeping far away from <em>Shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since Allaah is Alone in His favours and His giving, having no partners, then likewise He is Alone in His <em>Tawheed</em> not having any equal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No one is supplicated to except Allaah, none is relied upon except Allaah, none is sought for aid except Allaah nor is any type of the different aspects of worship directed to anyone except Allaah. Just as the slave is required to make his intention for the <em>Hajj</em>completely for Allaah Alone, then in the same way he is required to make his intention in all the worship he performs and in all the acts of obedience by which he becomes closer to Allaah, for Allaah Alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whosoever directs anything from worship to other than Allaah then he has committed<em>Shirk</em> with Allaah, The Great, and he has suffered a clear loss, nullified his actions and Allaah will not accept his actions from him, neither his optional actions nor his obligatory actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Islaam came with this great proclamation, the proclamation of the <em>Tawheed</em> of Allaah, making the <em>Deen</em> sincerely for Allaah and distancing oneself from all types of<em>Shirk</em> large or small, minor or major.  Whereas the <em>Mushrikoon</em> (polytheists), the worshippers of idols and statues, used to make the declaration to enter into their<em>Ihraam</em> for <em>Hajj</em> with <em>Shirk</em> and abuse, they would say in their <em>Talbeeyaah</em>(proclamation):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Here I am O Allaah, here I am, You have no partner except for the partner who is Yours, whom you possess and what he possesses.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, in the proclamation, they included their false gods along with Allaah and they place – what they claim for their false gods – in the Hands of Allaah and this is the meaning of the saying of Allaah about them in the Qur’aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَمَا يُؤۡمِنُ أَكۡثَرُهُم بِٱللَّهِ إِلَّا وَهُم مُّشۡرِكُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; And most of them believe not in Allaah except that they attribute partners unto Him&gt;&gt; [Yusuf: 106]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: that most of them do not believe in Allaah, that He is The Creator, The Provider and The Disposer except that they associate partners with Him in worship – with idols who do not possess anything and statues that do not benefit or bring harm, nor do they give anything or prevent harm, rather they do not possess anything at all for themselves, let alone possess anything for anyone else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Ibn Jareer at-Tabaree on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas <em>-RadiAllaah anhu   – </em>who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It is from their <em>Eemaan</em>, that if it is said to them: ‘Who created the sky?’ ‘Who created the earth?’ and ‘Who created the mountains?’ They would say ‘Allaah’ yet they are still<em>Mushrikoon</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Ikrimaa that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Ask them who created the heavens and the earth, they will say: Allaah. That is their<em>Eemaan</em> in Allaah and yet they worship other than Him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, on the authority of Mujaahid who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Their <em>Eemaan</em> is their saying: Allaah is our Creator, He gives us provision and He takes our lives. So this is <em>Eemaan</em>, along with <em>Shirk</em> in their worship of other than Him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Ibn Zayd who said: ‘There is no-one that worships someone along with Allaah except that he believes in Allaah, knows that Allaah is His lord and that Allaah is his Creator and his Provider, but along with this he commits <em>Shirk</em> with Him. Do you not see how Ibraheem said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">قَالَ أَفَرَءَيۡتُم مَّا كُنتُمۡ تَعۡبُدُونَ ٧٥ أَنتُمۡ وَءَابَآؤُكُمُ ٱلۡأَقۡدَمُونَ ٧٦ فَإِنَّهُمۡ عَدُوّٞ لِّيٓ إِلَّا رَبَّ ٱلۡعَٰلَمِينَ ٧٧</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; He said: ‘Do you observe that which you have been worshipping – you and your ancient fathers? Verily they are enemies to me, except the Lord of the worlds. &gt;&gt; [ash-Shoora:75-77]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibraheem <em>– alayhi as-Sallam &#8211;</em> knew that they worshipped the Lord of the worlds along with those whom they used to worship.’ Then he said: there is none that commits <em>Shirk</em>except that he believes in Allaah, do you not see how the Arabs used to proclaim and say: ‘Here I am O Allaah, here I am, You have no partner except for the partner who is Yours, whom you possess and what he possesses.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what the <em>Mushrikoon</em> used to say.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the <em>Mushrikoon</em> at the time of the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> used to affirm that their Creator, Provider and The Disposer of their affairs was Allaah, but even with this affirmation they did not make the <em>Deen</em> sincerely for Allaah. Rather, they worshipped others along with Him in their worshipping of trees, stones and idols, besides other things. Allaah made this matter clear and explained it in many places in the Noble Qur’aan, such as His <em>-Subhanahu-</em> saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَلَئِن سَأَلۡتَهُم مَّنۡ خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضَ وَسَخَّرَ ٱلشَّمۡسَ وَٱلۡقَمَرَ لَيَقُولُنَّ ٱللَّهُۖ فَأَنَّىٰ يُؤۡفَكُونَ ٦١</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;And if you were to ask them: ‘Who has created the heavens and the earth and subjected the sun and the moon?’ They will surely reply ‘Allaah’. How then are they deviating (as disbelievers)? &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">[Ankabut: 61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Aayaat</em> with this meaning are many.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafidh Ibn Katheer <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said in his book of <em>Tafseer</em>: ‘Allaah Ta’ala speaks, affirming that there is none worthy of worship in truth except Him- because the<em>Mushrikeen</em> who worship Him, worship others along with Him- they acknowledge that He is Independent in His creation of the heavens and the earth, the sun and the moon and the change of the night and day and that He is The Creator and The Provider for His slaves, The One Who determines their different times of death, their different types of provision and the contrast between them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, from amongst them, are the rich and the poor and He knows best that which is befitting for everyone amongst them, he who deserves to be rich and he who deserves to be poor. It is mentioned that He is Independent in creating things and He is Alone in organising the creation.  So, if this is the case, then why is someone other than Him relied upon? Since He is Alone in possessing everything then He should be the only One worshipped. Many times Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> establishes His status as being worthy of being worshipped due to the recognition of the <em>Tawheed</em> of His Lordship. The<em>Mushrikoon</em> used to acknowledge this as they used to say in their proclamation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Here I am O Allaah, here I am, You have no partner, except for the partner who is Yours, whom You possess and what he possesses.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So why is someone else relied upon?[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many places in the noble Qur’aan which mention this meaning of establishing proof against the <em>Kuffar</em> of their obligation to have <em>Tawheed</em> of Him in His worship and making the <em>Deen</em> sincerely for Him due to their acknowledgement of the Lordship of Allaah <em>–Jala wa Oola</em>. Due to this, Allaah addresses them regarding the <em>Tawheed</em> of His Lordship with a rhetorical question. So, if they affirm His Lordship, He uses this as an evidence against them, that He is The One Who deserves to be worshipped Alone and He rebukes them, rejecting their association of others with Him, even though they acknowledge that He Alone is The Lord; because whoever acknowledges that He Alone is The Lord then it necessitates that all worship is performed sincerely for Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With this, it becomes clear that acknowledging that Allaah is The Creator, The Provider, The Benefactor, The One who controls and The Disposer of the affairs of the creation, (then this) is not sufficient for the (establishment of the) <em>Tawheed</em> of Allaah and it does not save anyone from the punishment of Allaah on the Day of Judgement, unless all worship is sincerely for Allaah Alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah does not accept the <em>Tawheed</em> of Lordship from His slaves unless they single Him out Alone in the <em>Tawheed</em> of <em>Ibaadah</em> (worship), such that they do not take an equal with Him, nor do they supplicate to anyone along with Him, nor do they rely upon anyone except Him, nor do they direct any form of worship to other than Him <em>-Subhanahu</em>, so just as He <em>-Subhanahu-</em> is The Only One to create then He is worshipped Alone with all types of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why Allaah Ta’ala said to those who turned their worship to other than Him, even though they knew that He is their Creator and Provider:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">فَلَا تَجۡعَلُواْ لِلَّهِ أَندَادٗا وَأَنتُمۡ تَعۡلَمُونَ ٢٢</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; Then do not set up rivals unto Allaah (in worship) while you know (that He Alone has the right to be worshipped)&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">[al-Baqarah: 22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Abbas <em>&#8211; RadiAllaah anhu –</em> said: ‘i.e. Do not associate others with Allaah assigning equals to Him, who do not bring any benefit, nor do they harm while you know that you have no Lord who provides for you other than Him. Indeed you have come to know that what the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>called you to, of Allaah’s <em>Tawheed</em>, then that is the truth wherein there is no doubt.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qatadah said: ‘You know that Allaah created you and He created the Heavens and the earth, then you ascribe equals unto Him.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the blessing upon the <em>Ummah</em> of Islaam is great; their being guided to the<em>Tawheed</em> of Allaah in His Lordship, worship and His Names and Attributes. The blessing of Allaah upon the Muslims is great in their being capable of proclaiming Allaah’s<em>Tawheed</em>, since others besides them proclaim <em>Shirk</em> and set up equals with Him.  So, for Allaah belongs the praise, <em>-Subhanahu-</em> for giving the ability, His blessings and guidance and to Him belong many good and blessed praises, such as our Noble Lord loves and is pleased with.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#993300;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="left"><strong>Chapter 2</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>An Explanation of  a Number of Benefits of Hajj</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As was mentioned in the previous discussion of the excellence of <em>Hajj</em> and its high stature, <em>Hajj</em> is from amongst the most distinguished acts of worship and the greatest means of seeking closeness to Allaah.  It is a pillar from the great pillars of Islaam and it is a principle from the strong foundations upon which Islaam stands and is built as was indicated previously when we mentioned the worldly and religious virtues and benefits of the <em>Hajj</em>, which a person can neither enumerate, nor limit nor is a person able to count them, and in this regard Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> says in the Noble Qur’aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَأَذِّن فِي ٱلنَّاسِ بِٱلۡحَجِّ يَأۡتُوكَ رِجَالٗا وَعَلَىٰ كُلِّ ضَامِرٖ يَأۡتِينَ مِن كُلِّ فَجٍّ عَمِيقٖ ٢٧ لِّيَشۡهَدُواْ<br />
مَنَٰفِعَ لَهُمۡ وَيَذۡكُرُواْ ٱسۡمَ ٱللَّهِ فِيٓ أَيَّامٖ مَّعۡلُومَٰتٍ عَلَىٰ مَا رَزَقَهُم مِّنۢ بَهِيمَةِ ٱلۡأَنۡعَٰمِۖ فَكُلُواْ مِنۡهَا<br />
وَأَطۡعِمُواْ ٱلۡبَآئِسَ ٱلۡفَقِيرَ ٢٨ ثُمَّ لۡيَقۡضُواْ تَفَثَهُمۡ وَلۡيُوفُواْ نُذُورَهُمۡ وَلۡيَطَّوَّفُواْ بِٱلۡبَيۡتِ ٱلۡعَتِيقِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And proclaim to mankind the <em>Hajj</em>.  They will come to you on foot and on every lean camel, they will come from every deep and distant mountain highway (to perform<em>Hajj</em>).  That they may witness things that are of benefit to them and mention the Name of Allaah on the appointed days, over the livestock animals that He has provided for them.  Then eat thereof and feed therewith the poor having a hard time.  Then let them complete their prescribed duties and perform their vows, and circumambulate the Ancient House.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Hajj: 27-29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore the <em>Hajj</em> is full of religious and worldly benefits, and the arabic letter Laam [ل ] in the saying of Allaah: &lt;&lt;…may witness things that are of benefit to them……&gt;&gt; is the arabic letter <em>Laam</em> which is used for purpose and reason which, here, is connected to the saying of Allaah: &lt;&lt;And proclaim to mankind the <em>Hajj</em>.  They will come to you on foot and on every lean camel………&gt;&gt;, which means; if the <em>Hajj</em> is proclaimed they will come to you walking and riding so that they can witness benefits; i.e. they can be present for their benefits, and the meaning of ‘be present’ is that they can achieve these benefits.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying &lt;&lt; منافع – benefits&gt;&gt; is the plural of &lt;&lt;منفعة – benefit &gt;&gt;, because Allaah intended benefits from this specific act of worship, religious and worldly benefits, which are not found in any other act of worship which is done together, communally.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abee Haatim narrated in his <em>Tafseer</em> on the authority of Ibn Abbas <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhumma-</em> who said regarding the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; may witness things that are of benefit to them&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Benefits in the world and benefits in the Hereafter.  As for benefits of the Hereafter then it is the pleasure of Allaah- <em>Azza wa Jal-</em> and as for benefits of the world then it is what they acquire of the meat of the goat and the slaughtered animals and business.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AbdurRazzaq narrated on the authority of Mujahid <em>–Rahimullaah- </em>regarding the statement of Allaah &lt;&lt;…may witness things that are of benefit to them&gt;&gt; he said: ‘Business and that which is pleasing to Allaah from the matters of the world and the Hereafter.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jareer at-Tabari narrated in his <em>Tafseer</em> on the authority of Mujahid <em>–Rahimullaah-</em> &lt;&lt;…may witness things that are of benefit to them.&gt;&gt;  He said: ‘The reward in the Hereafter and business in the worldly life.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the benefits which the pilgrims achieve and encounter in their <em>Hajj</em> to the House of Allaah the <em>al-Haram</em>, are many and varied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211;       Religious benefits of distinguished acts of worship and momentous acts of obedience which cannot take place except in the <em>Hajj</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211;       Worldly benefits of profits and achieving worldly gains, as Allaah mentions in the context of the <em>Ayaat</em> of <em>Hajj</em> in <em>Soorah</em> al-Baqarah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">لَيۡسَ عَلَيۡكُمۡ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَبۡتَغُواْ فَضۡلٗا مِّن رَّبِّكُمۡۚ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> &lt;&lt;There is no sin on you if you seek the bounty of your Lord &gt;&gt;[al-Baqarah : 198]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Abu Daawood and others on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas <em>&#8211; RadhiAllaah anhu  &#8211;</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘They used to be frightened to buy and sell and to conduct business during the prohibited season and during the <em>Hajj </em>because they would say ‘These are the days of<em>Dhikr</em> (remembrance).’ Then Allaah revealed :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">لَيۡسَ عَلَيۡكُمۡ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَبۡتَغُواْ فَضۡلٗا مِّن رَّبِّكُمۡۚ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> &lt;&lt;There is no sin on you if you seek the bounty of your Lord &gt;&gt;[al-Baqarah : 198]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas <em>-RadiAllaah anhu-</em> that he said, regarding the meaning of this Ayaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is no harm in you buying and selling before the <em>Ihraam</em> or after it.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad al-Ameen ash-Shanqitee <em>-Rahimullaahi-</em> said : ‘And the scholars of<em>Tafseer</em> are agreed on the meaning of the statement of Allaah : &lt;&lt;There is no sin on you if you seek the bounty of your Lord &gt;&gt; that there is no sin upon the person performing <em>Hajj</em> nor is there any harm if he desires to profit from business during the days of <em>Hajj</em> if this does not busy  him from performing the rituals of <em>Hajj</em>.’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from the worldly benefits for the people doing <em>Hajj</em> are what they gain from the sacrificial and slaughtered animals, as Allaah Ta’ala mentions :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; In them (cattle offered for sacrifice) are benefits for you for an appointed term and afterwards they are brought for sacrifice unto the Ancient House &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further to that is what the pilgrim gains of religious benefits, which cannot be compared to the worldly benefits since, in the <em>Hajj</em>, there are great rewards and plentiful expiations, forgiveness of sins, cancellation of bad deeds and many other great religious benefits which cannot be counted- all of which the pilgrim attains if he has Taqwa of Allaah during his <em>Hajj</em> by fulfilling His commands and keeping away from His prohibitions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What greater good can there be?  What can be more profitable than that the pilgrim departs from his <em>Hajj</em> and he is as he was on the day his mother gave birth to him, with no sin or mistake, as Allaah mentions :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">فَمَن تَعَجَّلَ فِي يَوۡمَيۡنِ فَلَآ إِثۡمَ عَلَيۡهِ وَمَن تَأَخَّرَ فَلَآ إِثۡمَ عَلَيۡهِۖ لِمَنِ ٱتَّقَىٰۗ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; But whosoever hastens to leave in two days, there is no sin on him and whosoever stays on, there is no sin on him, if his aim is to do good&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Baqarah :203]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jareer chose in his <em>Tafseer</em> of this <em>Ayaah</em>, after mentioning the sayings of the people of knowledge, the saying, that its meaning is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘So whosoever hastens the two days from the three days of Mina and he leaves on the second day, then there is no sin upon him since Allaah has purged him of his sins, if he had feared Allaah during his <em>Hajj</em>, avoided that which Allaah had ordered him to avoid, and done what Allaah had commanded him to do and had been obedient in performing the <em>Hajj</em> according to what Allaah had required from him, from His laws. Whosoever delays the <em>Hajj</em> until the third day ……..then there is no sin upon him, since Allaah has covered up what has preceded from his sins and crimes if he had <em>Taqwa</em> of Allaah whilst carrying out the <em>Hajj</em> within its limits.’[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Ibn Jareer mentions some clear narrations from the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> – with this meaning, and from them is his <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em> –</em> saying: ‘He who performs <em>Hajj</em> and does not commit intercourse nor is disobedient to Allaah then he returns cleansed from his sins just as the day his mother gave birth to him.’[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The  Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The reward of a complete <em>Hajj</em> is nothing but Paradise.’[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The  Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> – said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Perform the <em>Hajj</em> and the <em>‘Umrah</em> regularly since they do indeed negate poverty and sins just as the bellows get rid of the filth from iron.’[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these texts show that if the pilgrim performs <em>Hajj</em> within its limits according to what Allaah commanded then he has become free from all his sins, as Allaah &#8211;<em>Jala wa ‘Ala</em> – says :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">فَلَآ إِثۡمَ عَلَيۡهِۖ لِمَنِ ٱتَّقَىٰۗ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;there is no sin on him, if his aim is to do good &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Baqarah :203]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning; for the one who fears Allaah in his <em>Hajj</em> by carrying out the commands and keeping away from the prohibitions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that this is a great virtue and an amazing benefit which the believing hearts hasten to receive and the truthful souls desire to achieve.  By Allaah how great are His virtues and how great are the benefits.  When the pilgrim returns to his country after having carried out his <em>Hajj</em> and having his sins forgiven, he is left pure and clean from his sins and bad deeds, just as the day his mother gave birth to him, with no sin upon him nor any mistakes if he had <em>Taqwaa</em> of his Lord in his <em>Hajj</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In fact, from the great favours of the Lord – far is He from imperfection – and from His beautiful kindness to His pilgrim slaves, is that He boasts to His Angels about the pilgrims to His House <em>al-Haram</em> when they stand altogether on the plain of ‘Arafat and says: ‘Look at My slaves coming to Me from every deep valley with dishevelled hair, covered in dust and sacrificing , I take you as witnesses that I have indeed forgiven them.’[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By this, it becomes clear that the pilgrim returns from his <em>Hajj</em> with the greatest of profits and the biggest of gains and it is none other than forgiveness from his Lord for his sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, after his <em>Hajj</em> he begins a new, righteous life full of <em>Eemaan</em> and <em>Taqwaa</em>, filled with goodness, being upright and persistent in obedience, but achieving this reward is conditional on performing the <em>Hajj</em> correctly with sincerity and truthfulness and sincere repentance, coupled with avoiding anything of committing intercourse or disobedience to Allaah that cancels out the <em>Hajj</em>, as was mentioned earlier.  If he performs his <em>Hajj</em>like this, then it wipes out what was before it and the pilgrim departs from his <em>Hajj</em> in a wonderful state, like the day his mother gave birth to him without any sin or mistakes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#993300;">Lessons of Creed Acquired From the Hajj &#8211; ‘AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-Badr</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 1</h3>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">An Explanation Concerning the <em>Hajj</em> being a Great Centre of Learning</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that the <em>Hajj</em> is from the best acts of obedience and from the most magnificent ways by which the Muslim seeks closeness to his Lord. Rather, it is an act from the acts of worship, which Allaah has made obligatory and has made one of the five pillars upon which the upright religion of Islaam rests.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> explained this with his saying in the authentic hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Islaam is built upon five: The testification that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah and that Muhammad is His Messenger, establishing the prayer, payment of the<em>Zakaat</em>, the fasting of <em>Ramadan</em> and <em>Hajj</em> of the House.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The obligation of <em>Hajj</em> is established from him <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> in many ahaadeeth encouraging his <em>Ummah</em> to perform the <em>Hajj</em> and urging them to fulfil this great act of obedience. He explained the great rewards, the abundance of recompense and the forgiveness of sins they would profit from in the <em>Hajj</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim narrated in his authentic collection that the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam–</em> said to ‘Amr bin al-Aaas <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> when he became a Muslim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Did you not know that accepting Islaam wipes out what was before it, migration (<em>Hijra</em>) wipes out that what was before it, and that the <em>Hajj</em> wipes out what was before it.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been narrated by Bukhari and Muslim from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu- </em>who said: the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘He who performs <em>Hajj</em> and neither commits intercourse nor is disobedient to Allaah then he returns free from his sins just as the day his mother gave birth to him.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Muslim from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu- </em><em>that</em>the Messenger of Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The performance of <em>‘Umrah</em> is an expiation for the sins committed between it and the previous one and the reward of a complete <em>Hajj</em> is nothing but Paradise.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger performed <em>Hajj</em> with the people in the tenth year of his prophetic <em>Hijra</em>(migration) where he practically demonstrated for his <em>Ummah</em> how to perform this great obligation and urged them to learn everything that came from him <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> of actions and sayings. He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Take your <em>Hajj</em> rituals from me, perhaps I will not meet up with you after this year.’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was called the <em>Hajjatul Widdah</em> (the farewell <em>Hajj</em>) and during it the following statement of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> was revealed to the Messenger of Allaah<em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">ٱلۡيَوۡمَ أَكۡمَلۡتُ لَكُمۡ دِينَكُمۡ وَأَتۡمَمۡتُ عَلَيۡكُمۡ نِعۡمَتِي وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ ٱلۡإِسۡلَٰمَ دِينٗاۚ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;Today I have perfected your religion for you, completed my favour upon you and have chosen for you Islaam as your religion &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> [Soorah al-Ma’idah: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed it is obligatory upon every Muslim who comes to perform this great act of obedience, to exert himself and endeavour completely to learn about the Prophet’s <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> guidance regarding the <em>Hajj</em> and how to perform its rituals, thereby following the Prophet’s methodology.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also obligatory to tread along his path and imitate his way so that he can learn the rites from the Prophet and, therefore, accomplish the <em>Hajj</em> completely and with perfection since there is no way to perfect this act of obedience, nor any other act of obedience, except by following the traditions of the noble Messenger<em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> and by proceeding according to his methodology.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that every single Muslim on the face of the earth has his soul awakened in these blessed days where he desires to carry out this great act of worship, craving to fulfil this momentous ritual and loving to see the ancient House of Allaah, because indeed all the Muslims have a pledge to go to the House of Allaah, the <em>Haram</em>, and this began when the Muslim ascribed himself to the <em>Deen</em> of Islaam. So, this pledge remains as long as his soul is in his body.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For the child who is born into Islaam, one of the first things that is brought to his attention, from the obligations of Islaam, is that one of the five pillars is performing<em>Hajj</em> to the House of Allaah, the <em>Haram</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the disbeliever then, when he accepts Islaam and testifies that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger, then one of the first obligations of Islaam that faces him, after the two testifications, are the rest of the remaining pillars of Islaam, and they are: establishing the prayer, the giving of the <em>Zakaat</em>, the fasting of <em>Ramadan</em> and <em>Hajj</em> to the House of Allaah the <em>Haram</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first pillar after the two testifications is establishing the five prayers. Allaah has obligated this upon His slaves in every day and night and has made facing the House of Allaah, the <em>Haram</em>, a condition for the correctness of the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">قَدۡ نَرَىٰ تَقَلُّبَ وَجۡهِكَ فِي ٱلسَّمَآءِۖ فَلَنُوَلِّيَنَّكَ قِبۡلَةٗ تَرۡضَىٰهَاۚ فَوَلِّ وَجۡهَكَ شَطۡرَ ٱلۡمَسۡجِدِ<br />
ٱلۡحَرَامِۚ وَحَيۡثُ مَا كُنتُمۡ فَوَلُّواْ وُجُوهَكُمۡ شَطۡرَهُۥۗ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;Verily We have seen the turning of your face towards the heaven. Surely, We shall turn you to a <em>Qiblah</em> that shall please you, so turn in the direction of <em>Masjid al-Haram;</em>, and wherever you people are, turn your faces in prayer in that direction&gt;&gt; [Soorah al-Baqarah: 144]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Muslim’s connection to the House of Allaah, the <em>Haram,</em> remains continuous in every day and night; he faces it, if he has the capability, in every prayer that he performs whether it is an obligatory or optional prayer and he also faces it to supplicate.[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, this fortified link, which is acquired by this connection between the heart of the Muslim and the House of His Lord, and this continuous persistence inevitably drive the Muslim to a pressing desire to direct oneself towards the Ancient House, to gratify the eyes by gazing at it and to perform the <em>Hajj</em> that Allaah has made binding upon the Muslim if he has the means to perform it. So, when the Muslim has the means to perform the <em>Hajj</em>, he hastens to it in order to carry out this obligation with a desire to behold the House which he faces in all his prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">٩٦ فِيهِ ءَايَٰتُۢ بَيِّنَٰتٞ مَّقَامُ إِبۡرَٰهِيمَۖ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; In it are manifest signs (for example), the place of Ibraheem&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Soorah al-Imraan: 97]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So due to this, it is an obligation upon you my brother pilgrim that you increase in your praise of Allaah for His great blessing upon you of giving you the capability to perform this act of obedience, of your arrival to accomplish this worship and of being honoured to be permitted to see the Ancient House of Allaah which is the <em>Qiblah</em> of the Muslims from the east to the west of the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should exert yourself in completing the actions of the <em>Hajj</em> in the best way, with all its conditions, without any transgression or shortcoming, without any negligence or excessiveness, but rather, it should be upon guidance, upright, on a straight path following your noble Messenger &#8211;<em> sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should be seeking, by this action of yours, the pleasure of your Lord, seeking to earn reward from Him, forgiveness for sins and then returning to your country after this blessed journey with your sins forgiven and having had your sacrifices accepted. Also, returning having had your good actions accepted and blessed and returning with a new, good life full of <em>Eemaan</em> and <em>Taqwa</em>, full of goodness and steadfastness and beautified with eagerness and exerting oneself in obedience to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the <em>Hajj </em>is a great opportunity to increase the provisions for the Hereafter with repentance to Allaah, turning repentantly to Him, drawing closer to Him in obedience and seeking His pleasure during the <em>Hajj</em> by carrying out its rituals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The pilgrim has many opportunities to receive beneficial lessons, moving admonitions, important benefits and precious, ripe fruits in <em>‘Aqeedah</em>, worship and manners beginning with the very first action of <em>Hajj</em> which the worshippers carry out at the meeqaat and ending with the last rite of <em>Hajj</em>, which is the <em>Tawaaf</em> of seven circuits, where the pilgrim bids farewell to the House of Allaah,the <em>Haram</em>. Truly, it is a great school of education and <em>Eemaan</em> from which the God-fearing believers graduate. So, they witness great benefits in their <em>Hajj</em>, various lessons and touching sermons by which the hearts are given life and <em>Eemaan</em> is strengthened.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَأَذِّن فِي ٱلنَّاسِ بِٱلۡحَجِّ يَأۡتُوكَ رِجَالٗا وَعَلَىٰ كُلِّ ضَامِرٖ يَأۡتِينَ مِن كُلِّ فَجٍّ عَمِيقٖ ٢٧ لِّيَشۡهَدُواْ مَنَٰفِعَ لَهُمۡ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; And proclaim to mankind the Hajj. They will come to you on foot and on every lean camel, they will come from every deep and distant mountain highway (to perform Hajj). That they may witness things that are of benefit&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Soorah Al-Hajj: 27 – 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The benefits of Hajj cannot be counted, its virtues cannot be thoroughly investigated, nor can its beneficial events and lessons be completely defined. We will stop regularly during this booklet to examine a good number of valuable lessons and tremendous benefits of performing Hajj to the House of Allaah <em>al-Haram</em> and all capability lies with Allaah Alone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;">Taken from <em>‘Saheeh al-Targheeb wa Tarheeb’<br />
</em>By the Shaykh, <em>‘Allaama</em>, the <em>Muhadith</em> Muhammad Nasr ud-Deen al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya<strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated on the authority of Ibn Umar <em>&#8211; radiAllaahu anhuma &#8211;</em> who said:  I was sitting with the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> in the <em>masjid</em>in Mina when a man from the Ansaar came and a man from the Thaqeef, they gave <em>Salaam</em> and said, “O Messenger of Allaah, we came to ask you questions.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Messenger said:  “If you want I can inform you why you came and what you want to ask, and I will do so, and if you want I will hold back and you can ask me and I will answer you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said:  “Tell us O Messenger of Allaah!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man from Thaqeef said to the Ansaari:  “Ask.”  So the Ansaari man said:  “Inform me O Messenger of Allaah!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah said:  “You came to me, to ask about leaving your house and aiming for the <em>Bait-ul-Haraam</em> and the reward for it; about praying two <em>Rakah</em> after <em>Tawaaf</em> and the reward for it; going between as-Safa and Marwa and the reward for it; your staying the evening in Mina, and the reward for it; stoning the <em>Jamarah</em> and the reward for it; slaughtering an animal and the reward for it; and the <em>Tawaaf</em> of <em>al-Ifaadh</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man said:  “I swear by the One who sent you with the truth! This is what I came to ask you about.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“As for you leaving your homes aiming for the <em>Bait-ul-Haraam</em>:  then your she-camel does not place its foot nor does it raise it except that Allaah writes for you a reward due to it, and wipes off one of your sins.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As for the two <em>Rakah</em> after the <em>Tawaaf</em>, then it is equivalent to freeing a slave from the Children of Ismaeel.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As for your circuiting of as-Safa and al-Marwa, then it is the same as freeing 70 slaves.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As for you staying till the evening in Arafah, then Allaah descends to the sky of the <em>Duniya</em> and He boasts about you to the Angels, and says:  ‘My slaves have come to Me, looking rough, from every deep valley hoping for My mercy, so if your sins were equivalent to the amount of sand or the drops of rain or like the foam on the sea I will forgive them.  So go forth My slaves!  Having forgiveness and for what or who you have interceded for.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As for stoning the <em>Jamaar</em> (the pillars), then for every stone that you throw, it removes a big sin from the deadly sins.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As for your slaughtering, then it is saved for you with your Lord.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As for shaving your head, then there is a reward for every strand of hair that you shaved, and a sin is wiped off by it.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As for you performing <em>Tawaaf</em> of the House after all this, then by this time your are performing <em>Tawaaf</em> with no sin upon you and an Angel comes and places his hand between your shoulders saying: “Perform good deeds in what you face of the future for verily your past sins have been forgiven.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">Reported by at-Tabarani in his book “al-Kabeer” and by al-Bazaar. Shaykh Al-Albani graded it  <em>Hassan</em>.  Taken from ‘Saheeh al-Targheeb wa Tarheeb’.  Volume 2, Page 9-10, hadeeth no. 1112</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Hajj is an act of worship that must be devoted only to Allaah. It is a declaration and a manifestation of the belief in the Oneness (tawheed) of Allaah. It is a time to call upon Allaah to purify the self from any worship to other than Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslim who declares the talbiyah: (Labbaika allaahumma labbaik. labbaika laa shareeka laka labbaik; innal-hamda wan-ni&#8217;mata laka wal mulk, laa shareeka lak) understands that it is a du’aa that means: “Here I am O Allaah, here I am. Here I am, You have no partner, here I am. Surely all praise is due to You, and every bounty is from You, and all dominion is Yours, and You have no partner.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslim, therefore, should submit himself completely (mentally, spiritually, and physically) to Allaah Alone. No worship should be devoted to statues, tombs, religious leaders, righteous men (dead or alive) or any part of the creation!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tawheed of Allaah requires the Muslim to follow the perfect way of worship. This is the way (sunnah) of Muhammad sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam as understood by the sahaabah (the companions of the Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam), who were the best of mankind.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 align="Center"><a href="#">Imam Al-Nawawi&#8217;s Riyad-us-Saliheen</a><br />
Chapter 233<br />
The Obligation of Hajj (Pilgrimage) and its Excellence</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka`bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allah, those who can afford the expenses (for one&#8217;s conveyance, provision and residence); and whoever disbelieves [i.e., denies Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah), then he is a disbeliever of Allah], then Allah stands not in need of any of the `Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists).&#8221;</b></span><b> (3:97)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1271.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">(The superstructure of) Islam is based on five (pillars), testifying the fact that La ilaha illallah wa anna Muhammad-ar-Rasul-ullah [there is no true god except Allah, and Muhammad ((sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) is the Messenger of Allah], establishing As-Salat (the prayers), paying Zakat (poor due), the pilgrimage to the House [of Allah (Ka`bah)], and the Saum (fasting) during the month of Ramadan</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1272.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) delivered a Khutbah and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">O people! Hajj (pilgrimage to the House of Allah) has been made incumbent upon you, so perform Hajj.</span>&#8221; A man inquired: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, is it prescribed every year?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) remained silent till the man repeated it thrice. Then he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Had I replied in the affirmative, it would have surely become obligatory, and you would not have been able to fulfill it.</span>&#8221; Afterwards he said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do not ask me so long as I do not impose anything upon you, because those who were before you were destroyed on account of their frequent questioning and their disagreement with their Prophets. So when I order you to do something, do it as far as you can; and when I forbid you from doing anything, eschew it</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1273.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was asked: &#8220;Which deed is the best?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Faith in Allah and His Messenger</span>.&#8221; Then he was asked: &#8220;What is next?&#8221; He replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Jihad (holy fighting) in the Cause of Allah</span>.&#8221; Then he was asked, &#8220;What is after that?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Hajj Mabrur (an accepted pilgrimage</span>).&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1274.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Whoever performs Hajj (pilgrimage) and does not have sexual relations (with his wife), nor commits sin, nor disputes unjustly (during Hajj), then he returns from Hajj as pure and free from sins as on the day on which his mother gave birth to him</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1275.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;(<span style="color:#0000ff;">The performance of) `Umrah is an expiation for the sins committed between it and the previous `Umrah; and the reward of Hajj Mabrur (i.e., one accepted) is nothing but Jannah</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1276.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: I said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! We consider Jihad as the best deed, should we not then go for Jihad?&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The best Jihad for you women is Hajj Mabrur (i.e., one accepted by Allah</span>).&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1277.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">There is no day on which Allah sets free more slaves from Hell than He does on the Day of `Arafah</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1278.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">(The performance of) `Umrah during Ramadan is equal to Hajj (pilgrimage).&#8221; Or said, &#8220;Equal to the performance of Hajj with me</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1279.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: A woman came to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s obligation upon His slaves has become obligatory on my father in his old age. My father is very old and incapable of riding. May I perform Hajj on his behalf?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Yes</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1280.</b> Laqit bin `Amir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I came to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and said: &#8220;My father is a very old man and does not have strength to perform Hajj (pilgrimage) or `Umrah or to undertake the journey.&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Perform Hajj and `Umrah on behalf of your father</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1281.</b>  As-Sai&#8217;b bin Yazid (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: <span style="color:#008000;">I was seven years old when I was taken to perform Hajj (pilgrimage). This was during the time the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) performed the Hajjat-ul-Wada` (Farewell Pilgrimage)</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1282.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) came across a caravan at Ar-Rauha&#8217; and asked who the people in the caravan were. They replied that they were Muslims. They asked: &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">I am the Messenger of Allah</span>.&#8221; Then a woman lifted up a boy to him and asked: &#8220;Would this child be credited with having performed the Hajj (pilgrimage)?&#8221; Whereupon he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Yes, and you will have a reward</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1283.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: <span style="color:#008000;">The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) performed the pilgrimage on an unsaddled camel which also carried his provisions (i.e., his Zamilah)</span>.<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1284.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Ukaz, Mijannah and Dhul-Majaz were markets during the pre-Islamic period.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 7:</p>
<h3 align="center"><em>The Book of Pilgrimage (Kitab Al-Hajj) </em></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word Hajj means, literally, repairing to a place for the sake of visit (al-qasd li-ziyarah), and in the terminology of the Islamic Shari&#8217;ah, it implies the repairing to Bait-Allah (the house of Allah) to observe the necessary devotion (iqamat-an-li-nusuk) Bait-Allah is one of the names by which the Ka&#8217;ba is called.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hajj is not a new institution which Islam has introduced in its Shari&#8217;ah. This institution is as old as the Ka&#8217;ba itself which is called in the Holy Qur&#8217;an to be&#8221; the first House of Divine Worship appointed for men&#8221; (iii. 95). This verse of the Holy Qur&#8217;an corroborates the hadith which tells us that the Ka&#8217;ba was first built by Adam, the first man upon the earth. It was later on rebuilt by Hadrat Ibrahim and his illustrious son Hadrat Isma&#8217;il (peace be upon both of them). And when Ibrahim and Isma&#8217;al raised the foundations of the house, they said:&#8221; Our Lord! accept from us&#8221; (ii. 127). An earlier revelation makes it clear that the Ka&#8217;ba was already there when Hadrat Ibrahim left Hadrat Isma&#8217;il in the wilderness of Arabia:&#8221; Our Lord! I have settled a part of my offspring in a valley unproductive of fruit near Thy sacred House&#8221; (xiv. 37).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The whole ceremony of Hajj is commemorative of Hadrat Ibrahim and his family&#8217;s acts of devotion to God Almighty. This shows that the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) did not innovate this institution but purged it of all evil practices and made it an obligatory act of piety by which one can develop God-consciousness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is rightly said that it is the perfection of faith since it combines in itself all the distinctive qualities of other obligatory acts. It represents the quality of salat since a pilgrim offers prayers in the Ka&#8217;ba, the House of the Lord. It encourages the spending of material wealth for the sake of the Lord, the chief characteristic of Zakat. When a pilgrim sets out for Hajj, he dissociates himself from his hearth and home, from his dear and near ones to please the Lord. He suffers privation and undertakes the hardship of journey-the lessons we learn from fasting and i&#8217;tikaf. In Hajj one is trained to be completely forgetful of the material comforts and show of worldly thing. One has to sleep on stony ground, circumambulate the Ka&#8217;ba, run between Safa and Marwa and spend his night and day wearing, only two pieces of unsewn cloth. He is required to avoid the use of oil or scent or any other perfume. He is not even allowed to get his hair cut or trim his beard. In short, he is commanded to abandon everything for the sake of Allah and submit himself before his Lord, the ultimate aim of the life of a Muslim. In fact, physical pilgrimage is a prelude to spiritual pilgrimage to God, when man would bid goodbye to everything of the world and present himself before Him as His humble servant saying:&#8221; Here I am before Thee, my Lord, as a slave of Thine.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Down through the ages.&#8221; says Professor Hitti, &#8220;this institution has continued to serve as the major unifying influence in Islam and the most effective common bond among the diverse believers. It rendered almost every capable Moslem perforce a traveller for once in his lifetime. The socializing influence of such a gathering of the brotherhood of believers from the far quarters of the earth is hard to overestimate. It afforded opportunity for negroes, Berbers, Chinese, Persians, Syrians, Turks-rich and poor, high and low-to fraternize and meet together on the common ground of faith&#8221; (History of the Arabs, p. 136).</p>

The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Woe be upon them, as they also said: But one associate with Thee, you possess mastery over him, but he does not possess mastery (over you).

Upon this &#8216;Abdullab b. &#8216;Umar said: (So far as the touching of) the pillars is concerned, I did not see the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) touching them but only those situated on the side of yaman.

So far as the yellowness is concerned, I saw the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) dyeing (head, beard and cloth) with this colour and I love to dye (my head, beard or cloth) with this colour.

Some of us were in the state of Ihram and some of us were not. I saw my companions looking towards something, and as I saw I found It to be a wild ass. I saddled my horse and took up my spear and then mounted upon (the horse) and my whip, fell down. I said to my companions as they were in the state of Ihram to pick up the whip for me but they said: By Allah, we cannot help you in any (such) thing (i. e. hunting). So i dis- mounted (the horse) and picked it (whip) up and mounted again and caught the wild ass after chasing it. It was behind a hillock and I attacked it with my spear and killed it. Then I brought it to my companions. Some of them said: Eat it, while others said: Do not eat it. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) was in front of us.

His Companions entered upon the state of Ihram whereas he did not, for it was conveyed to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) that the enemy (was hiding at) Ghaiqa. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) went forward. He (Abu Qatada) said: Meanwhile I was along with his Companions, some of them smiled (to one another) As I cast a glance I saw a wild ass. I attacked It with a spear and held it, and begged for their (i. e. of his companions) assistance, but they refused to help me and we ate its meat. But we were afraid lest we should be separated (from the Messenger of Allah). So I proceeded on (with a view to) seeking the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). Some- times I&#8217;dashed my horse and sometimes I made it run at a leisurely pace (keeping pace with others). (In the meanwhile) I met a person from Banfu Ghifar in the middle of the night. I said to him: Where did you meet the messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)? He said: I left him at Ta&#8217;bin and he intended to halt at Suqya to spend the afternoon. I met him and said: Messenger of Allah. your Companions convey salutations and benedictions of Allah to you and they fear that they may not be separated from you (and the enemy may do harm to you), so wait for them, and he (the Holy Prophet) waited for them. I said: Messenger of Allah, I killed a game and there is left with me (some of the meat). The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) said to his people: Eat it. And they were in the state of Ihram.</p>

Ata&#8217; said: Jabir b. &#8216;Abdullah al&#8217;Ans-ari (Allah be pleased wa&#8217;th them) narrated to me that he peirforfned Hajj with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) in the year when he took sacrificial animals with him (i. e. during the 10th year of Hijra known as the Farewell Pilgrimage) and they had put on Ihram for Hajj only (as Mufrid). The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Put off Ihram and circumambulate the House, and (run) between al-Safa and al-Marwa. and get your hair cut and stay as non-Muhrims. When it was the day of Tarwiya, then put on Ihram for Hajj and make lhram for Mut&#8217;a (you had put on Ihram i f or Hajj, but take it off af ter perf orming Umra and then again put on Ihram for Hajj). They said: How should we make it Mut&#8217;a although we entered upon lhram in the name of Hajj? He said: Do whatever I command you to do. Had I not brought sacrificial animals with me, I would have done as I have commanded you to do. But it is not permissible for me to put off Ihram till tLe sacrifice is offered. Then they also did accordingly.</p>

I made a mention of it to Jabir b. Abdullih and he said: It is through me that this hadith has been circulated. We entered into the state of Ihram as Tamattu&#8217; with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). When &#8216;Umar was Installed as Caliph, he said: Verily Allah made permissible for His Messenger (may peace be upon him) whatever He liked and as Re liked. And (every command) of the Holy Qur&#8217;an has been revealed for every occasion. So accomplish Hajj and Umra for Allah as Allah has commanded you; and confirm by (proper conditions) the marriage of those women (with whom you have performed Mut&#8217;a). And any person would come to me with a marriage of appointed duration (Mut&#8217;a), I would stone him (to death). Qatada narrated this hadith with the same chain of transmitters saying: (That &#8216;Umar also said): Separate your Hajj from &#8216;Umra, for that is the most complete Hajj, and complete your Umra.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">FAREWELL PILGRIMAGE OF THE APOSTLE OF ALLAH (MAY PEACE BE UPON HIM)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as the first revelation in the cave of Hira&#8217; marks the advent of the apostolic mission of Muhammad (May peace be upon him), similarly his Farewell Pilgrimage marks its crowning glory. Opinions differ as to when Hajj became obligatory but the commonly accepted opinion is that it was in the eighth year of Hijra that Allah declared it as one of the five fundamentals of Islam. In the ninth year of Hijra the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) sent Abu Bakr as the leader of the Hajj delegation but he himself did not go. Hadrat Abu Bakr was later on joined by Hadrat Ali in order to make a sure declaration on behalf of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) which concerned the freedom from obligation in regard to those idolatrous tribes who had shown no respect for the treaties which they had entered into with the Holy Prophet (May peace be upon him). This declaration is contains in the opening verses of Sura Tauba.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Holy Prophet (May peace be upon him) spent this year in making preparations for the Hajj in the tenth year of Hijra which coincided with the sixty-third year (the last year) of his life. Every attempt was, therefore, made to take full advantage of this great assembly. Messengers were sent to all parts of Arabia inviting people to join him in this great Pilgrimage. It was necessary for them since they should learn by first-hand knowledge the several injunctions and practices of the Pilgrimage-free from all taints of ignorance-an ideal pattern which was to be kept intact in its pristine glory for all times to come. Not only the rites and rituals of the Pilgrimage were to be finally explained by the Holy Prophet (May peace be upon him) but all those things which had any concern with Islam had been finalized.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Holy Prophet (May peace be upon him) delivered a khutba on the 24th of Dhi-Qa&#8217;da on the occasion of the Friday prayer and gave the Muslims necessary instructions relating to Hajj. Next day, I. e. on the 25th of Dhi-Qa&#8217;da, he set out after Zuhr prayer on a journey for Hajj along with thousands of his devoted Companions. The &#8216;Asr prayer was offered at Dhu&#8217;l-Hulaifa. The caravan spent the night there and it was there after the Zuhr prayer that the Holy Prophet (May peace be upon him) and his Companions put on Ihram and proceeded towards Mecca. They reached their destination on the 4th of Dhu&#8217;l-Hijja pronouncing Talbiya (Labbaik, Labbaik, Allahumma Labbaik).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As the caravan moved on the number of participants swelled till, according to some of the narrators, it reached more than one lakh and thirty thousands. The Farewell Pilgrimage is one of the most important occasions in the sacred life of Muhammad (May peace be upon him). Apart from the rites and rituals, the addresses and speeches of the Holy Prophet (May peace be upon him) succinctly sum up the teachings of Islam.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ja&#8217;far b Muhammad reported on the authority of his father: We went to Jabir b. Abdullah and he began inquiring about the people (who had gone to see him) till it was my turn. I said: I am Muhammad b. &#8216;Ali b. Husain. He placed his hand upon my head and opened my upper button and then the lower one and then placed his palm on my chest (in order to bless me), and I was, during those days, a young boy, and he said: You are welcome, my nephew. Ask whatever you want to ask. And I asked him but as he was blind (he could not respond to me immediately), and the time for prayer came. He stood up covering himself in his mantle. And whenever he placed its ends upon his shoulders they slipped down on account of being short (in size). Another mantle was, however, lying on the clothes rack near by. And he led us in the prayer. I said to him: Tell me about the Hajj of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (May peace be upon him). And he pointed with his hand nine, and then stated: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) stayed in (Medina) for nine years but did not perform Hajj, then he made a public announcement in the tenth year to the effect that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was about to perform the Hajj. A large number of persons came to Medina and all of them were anxious to follow the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) and do according to his doing. We set out with him till we reached Dhu&#8217;l-Hulaifa. Asma&#8217; daughter of Umais gave birth to Muhammad b. Abu Bakr. She sent message to the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) asking him: What should 1 do? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Take a bath, bandage your private parts and put on Ihram. The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) then prayed in the mosque and then mounted al-Qaswa (his she-camel) and it stood erect with him on its back at al-Baida&#8217;. And I saw as far as I could see in front of me but riders and pedestrians, and also on my right and on my left and behind me like this. And the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was prominent among us and the (revelation) of the Holy Qur&#8217;an was descending upon him. And it is he who knows (its true) significance. And whatever he did, we also did that. He pronounced the Oneness of Allah (saying):&#8221; Labbaik,0 Allah, Labbaik, Labbaik. Thou hast no partner, praise and grace is Thine and the Sovereignty too; Thou hast no partner.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the people also pronounced this Talbiya which they pronounce (today). The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) did not reject anything out of it. But the Messenger of Allah (May peace. be upon him) adhered to his own Talbiya. Jabir (Allah be pleased with him) said: We did not have any other intention but that of Hajj only, being unaware of the Umra (at that season), but when we came with him to the House, he touched the pillar and (made seven circuits) running three of them and walking four. And then going to the Station of Ibrahim, he recited:&#8221; And adopt the Station of Ibrahim as a place of prayer.&#8221; And this Station was between him and the House. My father said (and I do not know whether he had made a mention of it but that was from Allah&#8217;s Apostle [May peace be upon him] that he recited in two rak&#8217;ahs:&#8221; say: He is Allah One,&#8221; and say:&#8221; Say: 0 unbelievers.&#8221; He then returned to the pillar (Hajar Aswad) and kissed it. He then went out of the gate to al-Safa&#8217; and as he reached near it he recited:&#8221; Al-Safa&#8217; and al-Marwa are among the signs appointed by Allah,&#8221; (adding: ) I begin with what Allah (has commanded me) to begin. He first mounted al-Safa&#8217; till he saw the House, and facing Qibla he declared the Oneness of Allah and glorified Him, and said:&#8221; There is no god but Allah, One, there is no partner with Him. His is the Sovereignty. to Him praise is due. and He is Powerful over everything. There is no god but Allah alone, Who fulfilled His promise, helped His servant and routed the confederates alone.&#8221; He then made supplication in the course of that saying such words three times. He then descended and walked towards al-Marwa, and when his feet came down in the bottom of the valley, he ran, and when he began to ascend he walked till he reached al-Marwa. There he did as he had done at al-Safa&#8217;. And when it was his last running at al-Marwa he said: If I had known beforehand what I have come to know afterwards, I would not have brought sacrificial animals and would have performed an &#8216;Umra. So, he who among you has not the sacrificial animals with him should put off Ihram and treat it as an Umra. Suraqa b. Malik b. Ju&#8217;sham got up and said: Messenger of Allah, does it apply to the present year, or does it apply forever? Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) intertwined the fingers (of one hand) into another and said twice: The &#8216;Umra has become incorporated in the Hajj (adding):&#8221; No, but for ever and ever.&#8221; &#8216;All came from the Yemen with the sacrificial animals for the Prophet (May peace be upon him) and found Fatimah (Allah be pleased with her) to be one among those who had put off Ihram and had put on dyed clothes and had applied antimony. He (Hadrat&#8217;Ali) showed disapproval to it, whereupon she said: My father has commanded me to do this. He (the narrator) said that &#8216;Ali used to say in Iraq: I went to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) showing annoyance at Fatimah for what she had done, and asked the (verdict) of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) regarding what she had narrated from him, and told him that I was angry with her, whereupon he said: She has told the truth, she has told the truth. (The Holy Prophet then asked &#8216;Ali): What did you say when you undertook to go for Hajj? I (&#8216;Ali) said: 0 Allah, I am putting on Ihram for the same purpose as Thy Messenger has put it on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: I have with me sacrificial animals, so do not put off the Ihram. He (Jabir) said: The total number of those sacrificial animals brought by &#8216;Ali from the Yemen and of those brought by the Apostle (may peace be upon him) was one hundred. Then all the people except the Apostle (may peace be upon him) and those who had with them sacrificial animals, put off Ihram, and got their hair clipped; when it was the day of Tarwiya (8th of Dhu&#8217;l-Hijja) they went to Mina and put on the Ihram for Hajj and the Messenger of Ailah (may peace be upon him) rode and led the noon, afternoon, sunset &#8216;Isha&#8217; and dawn prayers. He then waited a little till the sun rose, and commanded that a tent of hair should be pitched at Namira. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) then set out and the Quraish did not doubt that he would halt at al-Mash&#8217;ar al-Haram (the sacred site) as the Quraish used to do in the pre-Islamic period. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), however, passed on till he came to &#8216;Arafa and he found that the tent had been pitched for him at Namira. There he got down till the sun had passed the meridian; he commanded that al-Qaswa should be brought and saddled for him. Then he came to the bottom of the valley, and addressed the people saying: Verily your blood, your property are as sacred and inviolable as the sacredness of this day of yours, in this month of yours, in this town of yours. Behold! Everything pertaining to the Days of Ignorance is under my feet completely abolished. Abolished are also the blood-revenges of the Days of Ignorance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first claim of ours on blood-revenge which I abolish is that of the son of Rabi&#8217;a b. al-Harith, who was nursed among the tribe of Sa&#8217;d and killed by Hudhail. And the usury of she pre-Islamic period is abolished, and the first of our usury I abolish is that of &#8216;Abbas b. &#8216;Abd al-Muttalib, for it is all abolished. Fear Allah concerning women! Verily you have taken them on the security of Allah, and intercourse with them has been made lawful unto you by words of Allah. You too have right over them, and that they should not allow anyone to sit on your bed whom you do not like. But if they do that, you can chastise them but not severely. Their rights upon you are that you should provide them with food and clothing in a fitting manner. I have left among you the Book of Allah, and if you hold fast to it, you would never go astray. And you would be asked about me (on the Day of Resurrection), (now tell me) what would you say? They (the audience) said: We will bear witness that you have conveyed (the message), discharged (the ministry of Prophethood) and given wise (sincere) counsel. He (the narrator) said: He (the Holy Prophet) then raised his forefinger towards the sky and pointing it at the people (said):&#8221; O Allah, be witness. 0 Allah, be witness,&#8221; saying it thrice. (Bilal then) pronounced Adhan and later on Iqama and he (the Holy Prophet) led the noon prayer. He (Bilal) then uttered Iqama and he (the Holy Prophet) led the afternoon prayer and he observed no other prayer in between the two.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) then mounted his camel and came to the place of stay, making his she-camel al-Qaswa, turn towards the side where there we are rocks, having the path taken by those who went on foot in front of him, and faced the Qibla. He kept standing there till the sun set, and the yellow light had somewhat gone, and the disc of the sun had disappeared. He made Usama sit behind him, and he pulled the nosestring of Qaswa so forcefully that its head touched the saddle (in order to keep her under perfect control), and he pointed out to the people with his right hand to be moderate (in speed), and whenever he happened to pass over an elevated tract of sand, he slightly loosened it (the nose-string of his camel) till she climbed up and this is how he reached al-Muzdalifa. There he led the evening and &#8216;Isha prayers with one Adhan and two Iqamas and did not glorify (Allah) in between them (i. e. he did not observe supererogatory rak&#8217;ahs between Maghrib and &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayers). The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) then lay down till dawn and offered the dawn prayer with an Adhan and Iqama when the morning light was clear. He again mounted al-Qaswa, and when he came to al-Mash&#8217;ar al-Haram, he faced towards Qibla, supplicated Him, Glorified Him, and pronounced His Uniqueness (La ilaha illa Allah) and Oneness, and kept standing till the daylight was very clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then went quickly before the sun rose, and seated behind him was al-Fadl b. &#8216;Abbas and he was a man having beautiful hair and fair complexion and handsome face. As the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) was moving on, there was also going a group of women (side by side with them). Al-Fadl began to look at them. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) placed his hand on the face of Fadl who then turned his face to the other side, and began to see, and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) turned his hand to the other side and placed it on the face of al-Fadl. He again turned his face to the other side till he came to the bottom of Muhassir. 1680 He urged her (al-Qaswa) a little, and, following the middle road, which comes out at the greatest jamra, he came to the jamra which is near the tree. At this be threw seven small pebbles, saying Allah-o-Akbar while throwing every one of them in a manner in which the small pebbles are thrown (with the help of fingers) and this he did in the bottom of the valley. He then went to the place of sacrifice, and sacrificed sixty-three (camels) with his own hand. Then he gave the remaining number to &#8216;All who sacrificed them, and he shared him in his sacrifice. He then commanded that a piece of flesh from each animal sacrificed should be put in a pot, and when it was cooked, both of them (the Holy Prophet and Hadrat &#8216;All) took some meat out of it and drank its soup. The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) again rode and came to the House, and offered the Zuhr prayer at Mecca. He came to the tribe of Abd al-Muttalib, who were supplying water at Zamzam, and said: Draw water. O Bani &#8216;Abd al-Muttalib; were it not that people would usurp this right of supplying water from you, I would have drawn it along with you. So they handed him a basket and he drank from it.</p>

He said to me: Did you intend to perform Hajj? I said: Yes. He again said: With what intention have you entered into the state of Ihram (for Ifrad, Qiran or Tamattu&#8217;). I said: I pronounced Talbiya (I have entered into the state of Ihram ) with that very aim with which the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) is pronouncing Talbiya. He (the Holy Prophet) said; You have done well. Then circumambulate the House and run between al-Safa&#8217; and al-Marwa&#8217; and put off Ihram (as you have not brought the sacrificial animals along with you). So I circumambulated the House, and ran between al-Safa&#8217; and al-Marwa&#8217; and then came to a woman of the tribe of Qais and she rid my head of the lice. I again put on Ihram for Hajj. and continued giving religious verdict (according to this practice) till during the Caliphate of Umar (Allah be pleased with him) when a person said to him: Abu Musa, or Abdullah b. Qais, exercise restraint in delivering some religious verdict of yours, for you do not know what has been introduced after you by the Commander of the Believers in the rites (of Hajj). Thereupon he said: 0 people, whom we gave the religious verdict (concerning putting off Ihram ) they should wait, for the Commander of the Believers is about to come to you, and you should follow him. Umar (Allah be pleased with him) then came and I made a mention of it to him. whereupon he said: If we abide by the Book of Allah (we find) the Book of Allah has commanded us to complete the (. Hajj and &#8216;Umra), and if we abide by the Sunnah of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), we find that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) did not put off Ihram till the sacrificial animal was brought to its end (till it was sacrificed).</p>

He first put on Ihram for &#8216;Umra and then for Hajj. and then offered animal sacrifice. So he drove the sacrificial animals with him from Dhu&#8217;l-Hulaifa. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) commenced Ihram of Umra and thus pronounced Talbiya for &#8216;Umra. and then (put on Ihram for Hajj) and pronounced Talbiya for Hajj. And the people performed Tamattu&#8217; in the company of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). They put on Ihram for Umra (first) and then for Hajj. Some of them had sacrificial animals which they had brought with them, whereas some of them had none to sacrifice. So when Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to Mecca, he said to the people: He who amongst you has brought sacrificial animals along with him must not treat as lawful anything which has become unlawful for him till he has completed the Hajj; and he, who amongst you has not brought the sacrificial animals should circumambulate the House, and run between al-Safa&#8217; and al-Marwa and clip (his hair) and put off the Ihram, and then again put on the Ihram for Hajj and offer sacrifice of animals. But he who does not find the sacrificial animal, he should observe fast for three days during the Hajj and for seven days when he returns to his family. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) circumambulated (the House) when he came to Mecca: he first kissed the corner (of the Ka&#8217;ba containing the Black Stone), then ran in three circuits out of seven and walked in four circuits. And then when he had finished the circumambulation of the House he observed two rak&#8217;ahs of prayer at the Station (of Ibrahim), and then pronounced Salaam (for concluding the rak&#8217;ahs), and departed and came to al-Safa&#8217; and ran seven times between al-Safa&#8217; and al-Marwa. After that he did not treat anything as lawful which had become unlawful till he had completed his Hajj and sacrificed his animal on the day of sacrifice (10th of Dhu&#8217;l-Hijja). and then went back quickly (to Mecca) and performed circumambulation of the House (known as tawaf ifada) after which all that was unlawful for him became lawful; and those who had brought the sacrificial animals along with them did as Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had done.

And none amongst those who had passed away commenced (the rituals of Hajj) but by circumambulating the Ka&#8217;ba on their (first arrival) and they did not put off Ihram (without completing the Hajj), and I saw my mother and my aunt commencing (their Hajj) with the circumambulation of the House, and they did not put off Ihram. My mother informed me that she came and her sister, and Zubair and so and so for &#8216;Umra, and when they had kissed the corner (the Black Stone, after Sa&#8217;i and circumambulation), they put off Ihram.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim al-Qurri heardlbn &#8216;Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) saying that Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) entered into the state of Ihram for Umra and his Companions for Hajj. Neither Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) nor those among his Companions who had brought sacrificial animals with them put off Ihram, whereas the rest (of the pilgrims) did so. Talha b. Ubaidullah was one of those who had brought the sacrificial animals along with them so he did not put off Ihram.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) reported that they (the Arabs of pre-Islamic days) looked upon Umra during the months of Hajj as the greatest of sins on the earth. So they intercalated the month of Muharram for Safar and said: When the backs of their camels would become all right and traces (if the pilgrims) would be effaced (from the paths) and the month of Safar would be over, then Umra would be permissible for one who wants to perform it. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and his Companions came in the state of Ihram for performing Hajj on the fourth (of Dhu&#8217;l-Hijja) he (Allah&#8217;s Apostle) commanded them to change their state of Ihram (from Hajj) to that of &#8216;Umra. It was something inconceivable for them. So they said: Messenger of Allah, is it a complete freedom (of the obligation) of Ihram? Thereupon he said: It is a complete freedom (from Ihram).</p>

He said: Four Umras, one he performed during the month of Rajab. We were reluctant either to belie him or reject him. We heard the noise of brushing of her teeth by &#8216;A&#8217;isha in her apartment. &#8216;Urwa said: Mother of the Faithful, are you not hearing what Abfi &#8216;Abd al-Rahman is saying? She said: What is he saying? Thereupon he (&#8216;Urwa) said: He (Ibn &#8216;Umar) states that Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) performed four Umras and one of them during the month of Rajab. Thereupon she remarked: May Allah have merely upon Abu &#8216;Abd al-Rahman. Never did Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) perform &#8216;Umra in which he did not accompany him, and he (Allah&#8217;s Apostle) never performed &#8216;Umra during the month of Rajab.</p>

Is it due to your poverty or due to your close-fistedness? Thereupon Ibn &#8216;Abbas said: Allah be praised, it is neither due to poverty nor due to close-fistedness (but due to the fact) that Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) came here riding his she-came, and there was sitting behind him Usama. He asked for water, and we gave him a cup full of nabidh and he drank it, and gave the remaining (part) to Usama; and he (the Holy Prophet) said: You have done Food, You have done well. So continue doing like it So we do not like to change what Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had commanded us to do.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Ata&#8217; reported: The House was burnt during the time of Yazid b. Muawiya when the people of Syria had fought (in Mecca). And it happened with it (the Ka&#8217;ba) what was (in store for it). Ibn Zubair (Allah be pleased with him) felt it (in the same state) until the people came in the season (of Hajj). (The idea behind was) that he wanted to exhort them or incite them (to war) against the people of Syria. When the people had arrived he said to them: O people, advise me about the Ka&#8217;ba. Should I demolish it and then build it from its very foundation, or should I repair whatever has been damaged of it? Ibn &#8216;Abbas said: An idea has occurred to me according to which I think that you should only repair (the portion which has been) damaged, and leave the House (in that very state in which) people embraced Islam (and leave those very stones in the same state) when people embraced Islam, and over which Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) had raised it. Thereupon Ibn Zubair said: It the house of any one of you is burnt, he would not be contented until he had reconstructed it, then what about the House of your Lord (which is far more Important than your house)? I would seek good advice from my Lord thrice and then I would make up (my mind) about this affair. After seeking good advice thrice, he made up his mind to demolish it. The people apprehended that calamity might fall from heaven on those persons who would be first to climb (over the building for the purpose of demolishing it), till one (took up courage, and ascended the roof), and threw down one of its stones. When the people saw no calamity befalling him, they followed him, demolished it until it was razed to the ground. Then Ibn Zubair erected pillars and hung cartains on them (in order to provide facilities to the people for observing the time of its construction). And the walls were raised; and Ibn Zubair said: I heard &#8216;A&#8217;isha (Allah be pleased with her) say that Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) had observed: If the people had Rot recently (abandoned) unbelief, find I had means enough to reconstruct it, which I had not, I would have definitely excompassed in it five cubits of area from Hijr. And I would also have constructed a door for the people to enter, and a door for their exit. I today have (the means to spend) and I entertain no fearfrom the side of people (that they would protest against this change). So he added five cubits of area from the side of Hatim to it that there appeared (the old) foundation (upon which Hadrat Ibrahim had built the Ka&#8217;ba). and the people saw that and it was upon this foundation that the wall was raised. The length of the Ka&#8217;ba was eighteen cubits. when addition was made to it (which was in its breadth), then naturally the length appears to be) small (as compared with its breadth). Then addition of ten cubits (of area) was made in its length (also). Two doors were also constructed, one of which (was meant) for entrance and the other one for exit. When Ibn Zubair (Allah be pleased with him) was killed, Hajjaj wrote to &#8216;Abd al-Malik (b. Marwan) informing him about it, and telling him that Ibn Zubair (Allah be pleased with him) had built (the Ka&#8217;ba) on those very foundations (which were laid by Ibrahim) and which reliable persons among the Meccans had seen. &#8216;Abd al-Malik wrote to him: We are not concerned with the censuring of Ibn Zubair in anything. Keep intact the addition made by him in the side of length, and whatever he has added frem the side of Hijr revert to (its previous) foundation, and wall up the door which he had opened. Thus Hajjaj at the command of Abd al-Malik) demolished it (that portion) and rebuilt it on (its previous) foundations.</p>

Walid b. &#8216;Ata&#8217; has, however, made this addition to it:&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: I would have made two doors on the level of the ground (facing) the east and the west. Do you know why your people raised the level of its door (i. e. the door of the Ka&#8217;ba)? She said: No. He said: (They did it) out of vanity so that (they might be in a position) to grant admittance to him only whom they wished. When a person intended to get into it, they let him climb (the stairs), and as he was about to enter, they pushed him and he fell down.&#8221; &#8216;Abd al-Malik said to Harith; Did you yourself hear her saying this? He said: Yes. He (Harith) said that he (&#8216;Abd al-Malik) scratched the ground with his staff for some time and then said: I wish I had left his (Ibn Zubair&#8217;s) work there.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas b. Malik (Allah be pleased with him) reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to Abu Talha (Allah be pleased with him): Find for me a servant from amongst your boys to serve me. Abu Talha went out along with me and made me sit behind him. And I used to serve Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) whenever he got down from the camel. And in one hadith he said: He proceeded and when (the mountain of) Uhud was within sight, he said: This is the mountain which loves us and we love it. And as he came close to Medina he said: O Allah, I declare (the area) between the two mountains of it (Medina) sacred just as Ibrahim declared Mecca as sacred. O Allah, bless them (the people of Medina) in their mudd and sa&#8217;.</p>

And the protection granted by the Muslims is one and must be respected by the humblest of them. If anyone makes a false claim to paternity, or being a client of other than his own masters, there is upon him the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said (on the day of Idal-Adha), &#8220;The first thing we will do on this day of ours, is to offer the (&#8216;Id) prayer and then return to slaughter the sacrifice. Whoever does so, he acted according to our Sunna (tradition), and whoever slaughtered (the sacrifice) before the prayer, what he offered was just meat he presented to his family, and that will not be considered as Nusak (sacrifice).&#8221; (On hearing that) Abu Burda bin Niyar got up, for he had slaughtered the sacrifice before the prayer, and said, &#8220;I have got a six month old ram.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8216;Slaughter it (as a sacrifice) but it will not be sufficient for any-one else (as a sacrifice after you). Al-Bara&#8217; added: The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever slaughtered (the sacrifice) after the prayer, he slaughtered it at the right time and followed the tradition of the Muslims.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 454:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever slaughtered the sacrifice before the prayer, he just slaughtered it for himself, and whoever slaughtered it after the prayer, he slaughtered it at the right time and followed the tradition of the Muslims.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Uqba bin &#8216;Amir Al-Juhani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that the Prophet distributed among his companions some animals for sacrifice (to be slaughtered on &#8216;Id-al-Adha). &#8216;Uqba&#8217;s share was a Jadha&#8217;a (a six month old goat). &#8216;Uqba said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I get in my share of Jadha&#8217;a (a six month old ram).&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Slaughter it as a sacrifice.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 456:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that the Prophet entered upon her when she had her menses at Sarif before entering Mecca, and she was weeping (because she was afraid that she would not be able to perform the Hajj). The Prophet said, &#8220;What is wrong with you? Have you got your period?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;This is a matter Allah has decreed for all the daughters of Adam, so perform all the ceremonies of Hajj like the others, but do not perform the Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added: When we were at Mina, beef was brought to me and I asked, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; They (the people) said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle has slaughtered some cows as sacrifices on behalf of his wives.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 457:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said on the day of Nahr, &#8220;Whoever has slaughtered his sacrifice before the prayer, should repeat it (slaughter another sacrifice).&#8221; A man got up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! This is a day on which meat is desired.&#8221; He then mentioned his neighbors saying, &#8220;I have a six month old ram which is to me better than the meat of two sheep.&#8221; The Prophet allowed him to slaughter it as a sacrifice, but I do not know whether this permission was valid for other than that man or not. The Prophet then went towards two rams and slaughtered them, and then the people went towards some sheep and distributed them among themselves.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 458:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Time has come back to its original state which it had on the day Allah created the Heavens and the Earth. The year is twelve months, four of which are sacred, three of them are in succession, namely Dhul-Qa&#8217;da, Dhul Hijja and Muharram, (the fourth being) Rajab Mudar which is between Juma&#8217;da (ath-thamj and Sha&#8217;ban. The Prophet then asked, &#8220;Which month is this?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Allah and his Apostle know better.&#8221; He kept silent so long that we thought that he would call it by a name other than its real name. He said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the month of Dhul-Hijja?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Which town is this?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; He kept silent so long that we thought that he would call it t,y a name other than its real name. He said, &#8220;isn&#8217;t it the town (of Mecca)?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;What day is today?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; He kept silent so long that we thought that he would call it by a name other than its real name. He said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the day of Nahr?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He then said, &#8220;Your blood, properties and honor are as sacred to one another as this day of yours in this town of yours in this month of yours. You will meet your Lord, and He will ask you about your deeds. Beware! Do not go astray after me by cutting the necks of each other. It is incumbent upon those who are present to convey this message to those who are absent, for some of those to whom it is conveyed may comprehend it better than some of those who have heard it directly.&#8221; (Muhammad, the sub-narrator, on mentioning this used to say: The Prophet then said, &#8220;No doubt! Haven&#8217;t I delivered (Allah&#8217;s) Message (to you)? Haven&#8217;t I delivered Allah&#8217;s message (to you)?&#8221;</p>

I have got a domestic kid.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Slaughter it (as a sacrifice) but it will not be permissible for anybody other than you&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;Whoever slaughtered his sacrifice before the (&#8216;Id) prayer, he only slaughtered for himself, and whoever slaughtered it after the prayer, he offered his sacrifice properly and followed the tradition of the Muslims.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever slaughtered the sacrifice before the &#8216;Id prayer, should repeat it (slaughter another one).&#8221; A man said &#8220;This is the day on which meat is desired.&#8221; Then he mentioned the need of his neighbors (for meat) and the Prophet seemed to accept his excuse. The man said, &#8220;I have a Jadha&#8217;a which is to me better than two sheep.&#8221; The Prophet allowed him (to slaughter it as a sacrifice). But I do not know whether this permission was general for all Muslims or not.

I have already done it. The Prophet said, &#8220;That is something you have done before its due time.&#8221; Abu Burda said, &#8220;I have a Jadha&#8217;a which is better than two old sheep; shall I slaughter it?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes, but it will not be sufficient for anyone after you.&#8221;</p>

Masruq added, I heard the clapping of her hands behind the curtain. She said, &#8220;I used to twist the garlands for the Hadi of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and he used to send his Hadi to Ka&#8217;ba but he never used to regard as unlawful what was lawful for men to do with their wives till the people returned (from the Hajj).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.028.033"></a>Volume 3, Book 28, Number 33:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Abdullah bin Umar set out for Mecca intending to perform Umra, at the time of afflictions, he said, &#8220;If I should be prevented from reaching the Kaba, then I would do the same as Allah&#8217;s Apostle did, so I assume the lhram for Umra as Allah&#8217;s Apostle assumed the Ihram for Umra in the year of Hudaibiya.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 34:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That Ubaidullah bin &#8216;Abdullah and Salim bin &#8216;Abdullah informed him that they told Ibn &#8216;Umar when Ibn Az-Zubair was attacked by the army, saying &#8220;There is no harm for you if you did not perform Hajj this year. We are afraid that you may be prevented from reaching the Kaba.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said &#8220;We set out with Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the non-believers of Quraish prevented us from reaching the Ka&#8217;ba, and so the Prophet slaughtered his Hadi and got his head shaved.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;I make you witnesses that I have made &#8216;Umra obligatory for me. And, Allah willing, I will go and then if the way to Ka&#8217;ba is clear, I will perform the Tawaf, but if I am prevented from going to the Ka&#8217;ba then I will do the same as the Prophet did while I was in his company.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar then assumed Ihram for Umra from Dhul-Hulaifa and proceeded for a while and said, &#8220;The conditions of &#8216;Umra and Hajj are similar and I make you witnesses that I have made &#8216;Umra and Hajj obligatory for myself.&#8221; So, he did not finish the Ihram till the day of Nahr (slaughtering) came, and he slaughtered his Hadi. He used to say, &#8220;I will not finish the Ihram till I perform the Tawaf, one Tawaf on the day of entering Mecca (i.e. of Safa and Marwa for both &#8216;Umra and Hajj).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 35:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi: Some of the sons of &#8216;Abdullah told him (i.e. &#8216;Abdullah) if he had sta</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 36:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle was prevented from performing (&#8216;Umra) Therefore, he shaved his head and had sexual relations with his wives and slaughtered his Hadi and performed Umra in the following year.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 37:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Abdullah) bin &#8216;Umar used to say, &#8220;Is not (the following of) the tradition of Allah&#8217;s Apostle sufficient for you? If anyone of you is prevented from performing Hajj, he should perform the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and between As-Safa and Al-Marwa and then finish the Ihram and everything will become legal for him which was illegal for him (during the state of Ihram) and he can perform Hajj in a following year and he should slaughter a Hadi or fast in case he cannot afford the Hadi.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 38:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Miswar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle slaughtered (the Hadi) before he had his head shaved and then he ordered his Companions to do the same.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 39:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That Abdullah and Salim said to &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar, &#8220;(You should not go for Hajj this year).&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar replied, &#8220;We set out with the Prophet (to Mecca for performing &#8216;Umra) and e infidels of Quraish prevented us from reaching the Ka&#8217;ba. Allah&#8217;s Apostle slaughtered his Budn (camels for sacrifice) and got his head shaved.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 40:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar set out for Mecca with the intentions performing &#8216;Umra in the period of afflictions, he said, &#8220;If I should be prevented from reaching the Ka&#8217;ba, then I would do the same as we did while in the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221; So, he assumed the Ihram for &#8216;Umra since the Prophet had assumed the Ihram for &#8216;Umra in the year of Al-Hudaibiya. Then &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar thought about it and said, &#8220;The conditions for both Hajj and &#8216;Umra are similar.&#8221; He then turned towards his companions and said, &#8220;The conditions of both Hajj and &#8216;Umra are similar and I make you witnesses that I have made the performance of Hajj obligatory for myself along with &#8216;Umra.&#8221; He then performed one Tawaf (between As-Safa and Al-Marwa) for both of them (i.e. Hajj and (&#8216;Umra) and considered that to be sufficient for him and offered a Hadi.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 41:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Layla:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ka&#8217;b bin &#8216;Ujra said that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to him (Ka&#8217;b), &#8220;Perhaps your lice have troubled you?&#8221; Ka&#8217;b replied, &#8220;Yes! O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Have your head shaved and then either fast three days or feed six poor persons or slaughter one sheep as a sacrifice.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 42:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ka&#8217;b bin &#8216;Umra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood beside me at Al-Hudaibiya and the lice were falling from my head in great number. He asked me, &#8220;Have your lice troubled you?&#8221; I replied in the affirmative. He ordered me to get my head shaved. Ka&#8217;b added, &#8220;This Holy Verse:&#8211;&#8216;And if any of you is ill, or has ailment in his scalp (2.196), etc. was revealed regarding me. &#8220;The Prophet then ordered me either to fast three days, or to feed six poor persons with one Faraq (three Sas) (of dates), or to slaughter a sheep, etc (sacrifice) whatever was available.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 43:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Ma&#8217;qal:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I sat with Ka&#8217;b bin &#8216;Ujra and asked him about the Fidya. He replied, &#8220;This revelation was revealed concerning my case especially, but it is also for you in general. I was carried to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the lice were falling in great number on my face. The Prophet said, &#8220;I have never thought that your ailment (or struggle) has reached to such an extent as I see. Can you afford a sheep?&#8221; I replied in the negative. He then said, &#8220;Fast for three days, or feed six poor persons each with half a Sa of food.&#8221; (1 Sa = 3 Kilograms approx.)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 44:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Layla:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Reporting the speech of Ka&#8217;b bin Umra) Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw him (i.e. Ka&#8217;b) while the lice were falling on his face. He asked (him), &#8220;Have your lice troubled you?&#8221; He replied in the affirmative. So, he ordered him to get his head shaved while he was at Al-Hudaibiya. At that time they were not permitted to finish their Ihram, and were still hoping to enter Mecca. So, Allah revealed the verses of Al-Fidya. Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered him to feed six poor persons with one Faraq of food or to slaughter one sheep (as a sacrifice) or to fast for three days.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 45:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whoever performs Hajj to this House (Ka&#8217;ba) and does not approach his wife for sexual relations nor commits sins (while performing Hajj), he will come out as sinless as a newly-born child.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.029.047"></a>Volume 3, Book 29, Number 47:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Abu Qatada:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My father set out (for Mecca) in the year of Al-Hudaibiya, and his companions assumed Ihram, but he did not. At that time the Prophet was informed that an enemy wanted to attack him, so the Prophet proceeded onwards. While my father was among his companions, some of them laughed among themselves. (My father said), &#8220;I looked up and saw an onager. I attacked, stabbed and caught it. I then sought my companions&#8217; help but they refused to help me. (Later) we all ate its meat. We were afraid that we might be left behind (separated) from the Prophet so I went in search of the Prophet and made my horse to run at a galloping speed at times and let it go slow at an ordinary speed at other times till I met a man from the tribe of Bani Ghifar at midnight. I asked him, &#8220;Where did you leave the Prophet ?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I left him at Ta&#8217;hun and he had the intention of having the midday rest at As-Suqya. I followed the trace and joined the Prophet and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Your people (companions) send you their compliments, and (ask for) Allah&#8217;s Blessings upon you. They are afraid lest they may be left behind; so please wait for them.&#8217; I added, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I hunted an onager and some of its meat is with me. The Prophet told the people to eat it though all of them were in the state of Ihram.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 29, Number 48:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Abu Qatada:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That his father said &#8220;We proceeded with the Prophet in the year of Al-Hudaibiya and his companions assumed Ihram but I did not. We were informed that some enemies were at Ghaiqa and so we went on towards them. My companions saw an onager and some of them started laughing among themselves. I looked and saw it. I chased it with my horse and stabbed and caught it. I wanted some help from my companions but they refused. (I slaughtered it all alone). We all ate from it (i.e. its meat). Then I followed Allah&#8217;s Apostle lest we should be left behind. At times I urged my horse to run at a galloping speed and at other times at an ordinary slow speed. On the way I met a man from the tribe of Bani Ghifar at midnight. I asked him where he had left Allah&#8217;s Apostle . The man replied that he had left the Prophet at a place called Ta&#8217;hun and he had the intention of having the midday rest at As-Suqya. So, I followed Allah&#8217;s Apostle till I reached him and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have been sent by my companions who send you their greetings and compliments and ask for Allah&#8217;s Mercy and Blessings upon you. They were afraid lest the enemy might intervene between you and them; so please wait for them.&#8221; So he did. Then I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We have hunted an onager and have some of it (i.e. its meat) left over.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle told his companions to eat the meat although all of them were in a state of Ihram.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 29, Number 49:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Qatada:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were in the company of the Prophet at a place called Al-Qaha (which is at a distance of three stages of journey from Medina). Abu Qatada narrated through another group of narrators: We were in the company of the Prophet at a place called Al-Qaha and some of us had assumed Ihram while the others had not. I noticed that some of my companions were watching something, so I looked up and saw an onager. (I rode my horse and took the spear and whip) but my whip fell down (and I asked them to pick it up for me) but they said, &#8220;We will not help you by any means as we are in a state of Ihram.&#8221; So, I picked up the whip myself and attacked the onager from behind a hillock and slaughtered it and brought it to my companions. Some of them said, &#8220;Eat it.&#8221; While some others said, &#8220;Do not eat it.&#8221; So, I went to the Prophet who was ahead of us and asked him about it, He replied, &#8220;Eat it as it is Halal (i.e. it is legal to eat it).&#8221;</p>
<hr />

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Abu Qatada:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That his father had told him that Allah&#8217;s Apostle set out for Hajj and so did his companions. He sent a batch of his companions by another route and Abu Qatada was one of them. The Prophet said to them, &#8220;Proceed along the sea-shore till we meet all together.&#8221; So, they took the route of the sea-shore, and when they started all of them assumed Ihram except Abu Qatada. While they were proceeding on, his companions saw a group of onagers. Abu Qatada chased the onagers and attacked and wounded a she-onager. They got down and ate some of its meat and said to each other: &#8220;How do we eat the meat of the game while we are in a state of Ihram?&#8221; So, we (they) carried the rest of the she-onager&#8217;s meat, and when they met Allah&#8217;s Apostle they asked, saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We assumed Ihram with the exception of Abu Qatada and we saw (a group) of onagers. Abu Qatada attacked them and wounded a she-onager from them. Then we got down and ate from its meat. Later, we said, (to each other), &#8216;How do we eat the meat of the game and we are in a state of Ihram?&#8217; So, we carried the rest of its meat. The Prophet asked, &#8220;Did anyone of you order Abu Qatada to attack it or point at it?&#8221; They replied in the negative. He said, &#8220;Then eat what is left of its meat.&#8221;</p>

Allow me to tell you what Allah&#8217;s Apostle said on the day following the Conquest of Mecca. My ears heard that and my heart understood it thoroughly and I saw with my own eyes the Prophet when he, after Glorifying and Praising Allah, started saying, &#8216;Allah, not the people, made Mecca a sanctuary, so anybody who has belief in Allah and the Last Day should neither shed blood in it, nor should he cut down its trees. If anybody tells (argues) that fighting in it is permissible on the basis that Allah&#8217;s Apostle did fight in Mecca, say to him, &#8216;Allah allowed His Apostle and did not allow you.&#8217; &#8220;Allah allowed me only for a few hours on that day (of the conquest) and today its sanctity is valid as it was before. So, those who are present should inform those who are absent (concerning this fact.&#8221; Abu Shuraih was asked, &#8220;What did &#8216;Amr reply?&#8221; He said, (&#8216;Amr said) &#8216;O Abu Shuraih!

It was made legal for me (i.e. I was allowed to fight in it) for a few hours of a day. It is not allowed to uproot its shrubs or to cut its trees, or to chase (or disturb) its game, or to pick up its luqata (fallen things) except by a person who would announce that (what he has found) publicly.&#8217; Al-&#8216;Abbas said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Except Al-ldhkhir (a kind of grass) (for it is used) by our goldsmiths and for our graves.&#8217; The Prophet then said, &#8216;Except Al-idhkhir.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Ikrima said, &#8216;Do you know what &#8220;chasing or disturbing&#8221; the game means?

The obligation of Hajj enjoined by Allah on His devotees has become due on my father and he is old and weak, and he cannot sit firm on the Mount; may I perform Hajj on his behalf?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Yes, you may.&#8221; That happened during the Hajj-al-Wida (of the Prophet ).</p>

The Prophet asked Ali, &#8220;With what intention have you assumed Ihram?&#8221; Ali replied, &#8220;I have assumed Ihram with the same intention as that of the Prophet.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;If I had not the Hadi with me I would have finished the Ihram.&#8221; Muhammad bin Bakr narrated extra from Ibn Juraij, &#8220;The Prophet said to Ali, &#8220;With what intention have you assumed the Ihram, O Ali?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;With the same (intention) as that of the Prophet.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Have a Hadi and keep your Ihram as it is.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 630:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sent me to some people in Yemen and when I returned, I found him at Al-Batha. He asked me, &#8220;With what intention have you assumed Ihram (i.e. for Hajj or for Umra or for both?&#8221;) I replied, &#8220;I have assumed Ihram with an intention like that of the Prophet.&#8221; He asked, &#8220;Have you a Hadi with you?&#8221; I replied in the negative. He ordered me to perform Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba and between Safa and Marwa and then to finish my Ihram. I did so and went to a woman from my tribe who combed my hair or washed my head. Then, when Umar came (i.e. became Caliph) he said, &#8220;If we follow Allah&#8217;s Book, it orders us to complete Hajj and Umra; as Allah says: &#8220;Perform the Hajj and Umra for Allah.&#8221; (2.196). And if we follow the tradition of the Prophet who did not finish his Ihram till he sacrificed his Hadi.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 631:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Qasim bin Muhammad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216; Aisha said, &#8220;We set out with Allah&#8217;s Apostles in the months of Hajj, and (in) the nights of Hajj, and at the time and places of Hajj and in a state of Hajj. We dismounted at Sarif (a village six miles from Mecca). The Prophet then addressed his companions and said, &#8220;Anyone who has not got the Hadi and likes to do Umra instead of Hajj may do so (i.e. Hajj-al-Tamattu) and anyone who has got the Hadi should not finish the Ihram after performing &#8216; Umra). (i.e. Hajj-al-Qiran). Aisha added, &#8220;The companions of the Prophet obeyed the above (order) and some of them (i.e. who did not have Hadi) finished their Ihram after Umra.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle and some of his companions were resourceful and had the Hadi with them, they could not perform Umra (alone) (but had to perform both Hajj and Umra with one Ihram). Aisha added, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me and saw me weeping and said, &#8220;What makes you weep, O Hantah?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I have heard your conversation with your companions and I cannot perform the Umra.&#8221; He asked, &#8220;What is wrong with you?&#8217; I replied, &#8216; I do not offer the prayers (i.e. I have my menses).&#8217; He said, &#8216; It will not harm you for you are one of the daughters of Adam, and Allah has written for you (this state) as He has written it for them. Keep on with your intentions for Hajj and Allah may reward you that.&#8221; Aisha further added, &#8220;Then we proceeded for Hajj till we reached Mina and I became clean from my menses. Then I went out from Mina and performed Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; Aisha added, &#8220;I went along with the Prophet in his final departure (from Hajj) till he dismounted at Al-Muhassab (a valley outside Mecca), and we too, dismounted with him.&#8221; He called &#8216; Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr and said to him, &#8216; Take your sister outside the sanctuary of Mecca and let her assume Ihram for &#8216; Umra, and when you had finished &#8216; Umra, return to this place and I will wait for you both till you both return to me.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216; Aisha added, &#8216; &#8216; So we went out of the sanctuary of Mecca and after finishing from the &#8216; Umra and the Tawaf we returned to the Prophet at dawn. He said, &#8216;Have you performed the &#8216; Umra?&#8217; We replied in the affirmative. So he announced the departure amongst his companions and the people set out for the journey, and the Prophet: too left for Medina.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 632:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Aswad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216; Aisha said, We went out with the Prophet (from Medina) with the intention of performing Hajj only and when we reached Mecca we performed Tawaf round the Kaba and then the Prophet ordered those who had not driven the Hadi along with them to finish their Ihram. So the people who had not driven the Hadi along with them finished their Ihram. The Prophet&#8217;s wives, too, had not driven the Hadi with them, so they too, finished their Ihram.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;I got my menses and could not perform Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; So when it was the night of Hasba (i.e. when we stopped at Al-Muhassab), I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Everyone is returning after performing Hajj and &#8216;Umra but I am returning after performing Hajj only.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Didn&#8217;t you perform Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba the night we reached Mecca?&#8217; I replied in the negative. He said, &#8216;Go with your brother to Tan&#8217;im and assume the Ihram for&#8217;Umra, (and after performing it) come back to such and such a place.&#8217; On that Safiya said, &#8216;I feel that I will detain you all.&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;O &#8216;Aqra Halqa! Didn&#8217;t you perform Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba on the day of sacrifice? (i.e. Tawaf-al-ifada) Safiya replied in the affirmative. He said, (to Safiya). &#8216;There is no harm for you to proceed on with us.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;(after returning from &#8216;Umra), the Prophet met me while he was ascending (from Mecca) and I was descending to it, or I was ascending and he was descending.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">We set out with Allah&#8217;s Apostles (to Mecca) in the year of the Prophet&#8217;s Last Hajj. Some of us had assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra only, some for both Hajj and &#8216;Umra, and others for Hajj only. Allah&#8217;s Apostle assumed Ihram for Hajj. So whoever had assumed Ihram for Hajj or for both Hajj and &#8216;Umra did not finish the Ihram till the day of sacrifice. (See Hadith No. 631, 636, and 639).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 635:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people (of the Pre-lslamic Period) used to think that to perform &#8216;Umra during the months of Hajj was one of the major sins on earth. And also used to consider the month of Safar as a forbidden (i.e. sacred) month and they used to say, &#8220;When the wounds of the camel&#8217;s back heal up (after they return from Hajj) and the signs of those wounds vanish and the month of Safar passes away then (at that time) &#8216;Umra is permissible for the one who wishes to perform it.&#8221; In the morning of the 4th of Dhul-Hijja, the Prophet and his companions reached Mecca, assuming Ihram for Hajj and he ordered his companions to make their intentions of the Ihram for&#8217;Umra only (instead of Hajj) so they considered his order as something great and were puzzled, and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What kind (of finishing) of Ihram is allowed?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Finish the Ihram completely like a non-Muhrim (you are allowed everything).&#8221;</p>

Why have the people finished their Ihram after performing &#8216;Umra but you have not finished your Ihram after performing &#8216;Umra?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I have matted my hair and garlanded my Hadi. So I will not finish my Ihram till I have slaughtered (my Hadi). &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Jamra Nasr bin &#8216;Imran Ad-Duba&#8217;i said, &#8220;I intended to perform Hajj-at-Tamattu&#8217; and the people advised me not to do so. I asked Ibn Abbas regarding it and he ordered me to perform Hajj-at-Tammatu&#8217;. Later I saw in a dream someone saying to me, &#8216;Hajj-Mabrur (Hajj performed in accordance with the Prophet&#8217;s tradition without committing sins and accepted by Allah) and an accepted &#8216;Umra.&#8217; So I told that dream to Ibn Abbas. He said, &#8216;This is the tradition of Abu-l-Qasim.&#8217; Then he said to me, &#8216;Stay with me and I shall give you a portion of my property.&#8217; &#8221; I (Shu&#8217;ba) asked, &#8220;Why (did he invite you)?&#8221; He (Abu Jamra) said, &#8220;Because of the dream which I had seen.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Shihab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I left for Mecca for Hajj-at-Tamattu&#8217; assuming Ihram for &#8216;Umra. I reached Mecca three days before the day of Tarwiya (8th Dhul-Hijja). Some people of Mecca said to me, &#8220;Your Hajj will be like the Hajj performed by the people of Mecca (i.e. you will lose the superiority of assuming Ihram from the Miqat). So I went to &#8216;Ata&#8217; asking him his view about it. He said, &#8220;Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah narrated to me, &#8216;I performed Hajj with Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the day when he drove camels with him. The people had assumed Ihram for Hajj-al-Ifrad. The Prophet ordered them to finish their Ihram after Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba, and between Safa and Marwa and to cut short their hair and then to stay there (in Mecca) as non-Muhrims till the day of Tarwiya (i.e. 8th of Dhul-Hijja) when they would assume Ihram for Hajj and they were ordered to make the Ihram with which they had come as for &#8216;Umra only. They asked, &#8216;How can we make it &#8216;Umra (Tamattu&#8217;) as we have intended to perform Hajj?&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;Do what I have ordered you. Had I not brought the Hadi with me, I would have done the same, but I cannot finish my Ihram till the Hadi reaches its destination (i.e. is slaughtered).&#8217; So, they did (what he ordered them to do).&#8221;</p>

Why don&#8217;t you rebuild it on its original foundation laid by Abraham?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Were it not for the fact that your people are close to the pre-lslamic Period of ignorance (i.e. they have recently become Muslims) I would have done so.&#8221; The sub-narrator, &#8216;Abdullah (bin &#8216;Umar ) stated: &#8216;Aisha &#8216;must have heard this from Allah&#8217;s Apostle for in my opinion Allah&#8217;s Apostle had not placed his hand over the two corners of the Ka&#8217;ba opposite Al-Hijr only because the Ka&#8217;ba was not rebuilt on its original foundations laid by Abraham.</p>

I further said, &#8220;What is wrong with them, why have they not included it in the building of the Ka&#8217;ba?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see that your people (Quraish) ran short of money (so they could not include it inside the building of Ka&#8217;ba)?&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What about its gate? Why is it so high?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Your people did this so as to admit into it whomever they liked and prevent whomever they liked. Were your people not close to the Pre-lslamic Period of ignorance (i.e. they have recently embraced Islam) and were I not afraid that they would dislike it, surely I would have included the (area of the) wall inside the building of the Ka&#8217;ba and I would have lowered its gate to the level of the ground.&#8221;</p>

Were your nation not close to the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance, I would have had the Ka&#8217;ba demolished and would have included in it the portion which had been left, and would have made it at a level with the ground and would have made two doors for it, one towards the east and the other towards the west, and then by doing this it would have been built on the foundations laid by Abraham.&#8221; That was what urged Ibn-Az-Zubair to demolish the Ka&#8217;ba. Jazz said, &#8220;I saw Ibn-Az-Zubair when he demolished and rebuilt the Ka&#8217;ba and included in it a portion of Al-Hijr (the unroofed portion of Ka&#8217;ba which is at present in the form of a compound towards the north-west of the Ka&#8217;ba). I saw the original foundations of Abraham which were of stones resembling the humps of camels.&#8221; So Jarir asked Yazid, &#8220;Where was the place of those stones?&#8221; Jazz said, &#8220;I will just now show it to you.&#8221; So Jarir accompanied Yazid and entered Al-Hijr, and Jazz pointed to a place and said, &#8220;Here it is.&#8221; Jarir said, &#8220;It appeared to me about six cubits from Al-Hijr or so.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked &#8216;Urwa bin Az-Zubair (regarding the Hajj of the Prophet ). &#8216;Urwa replied, &#8220;Aisha narrated, &#8216;When the Prophet reached Mecca, the first thing he started with was the ablution, then he performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and his intention was not &#8216;Umra alone (but Hajj and &#8216;Umra together).&#8217; &#8221; Later Abu Bakr I performed the Hajj and the first thing he started with was Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and it was not &#8216;Umra alone (but Hajj and &#8216;Umra together). And then &#8216;Umar did the same. Then &#8216;Uthman performed the Hajj and the first thing he started with was Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and it was not &#8216;Umra alone. And then Muawiya and &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar did the same. I performed Hajj with Ibn Az-Zubair and the first thing he started with was Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and it was not &#8216;Umra alone, (but Hajj and &#8216;Umra together). Then I saw the Muhajirin (Emigrants) and Ansar doing the same and it was not &#8216;Umra alone. And the last person I saw doing the same was Ibn &#8216;Umar, and he did not do another &#8216;Umra after finishing the first. Now here is Ibn &#8216;Umar present amongst the people! They neither ask him nor anyone of the previous ones. And all these people, on entering Mecca, would not start with anything unless they had performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, and would not finish their Ihram. And no doubt, I saw my mother and my aunt, on entering Mecca doing nothing before performing Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, and they would not finish their lhram. And my mother informed me that she, her sister, Az-Zubair and such and such persons had assumed lhram for &#8216;Umra and after passing their hands over the Corner (the Black Stone) (i.e. finishing their Umra) they finished their Ihram.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 706:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Urwa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked &#8216;Aisha : &#8220;How do you interpret the statement of Allah,. : Verily! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah, and whoever performs the Hajj to the Ka&#8217;ba or performs &#8216;Umra, it is not harmful for him to perform Tawaf between them (Safa and Marwa.) (2.158). By Allah! (it is evident from this revelation) there is no harm if one does not perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;O, my nephew! Your interpretation is not true. Had this interpretation of yours been correct, the statement of Allah should have been, &#8216;It is not harmful for him if he does not perform Tawaf between them.&#8217; But in fact, this divine inspiration was revealed concerning the Ansar who used to assume lhram for worship ping an idol called &#8220;Manat&#8221; which they used to worship at a place called Al-Mushallal before they embraced Islam, and whoever assumed Ihram (for the idol), would consider it not right to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When they embraced Islam, they asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) regarding it, saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We used to refrain from Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.&#8221; So Allah revealed: &#8216;Verily; (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah.&#8217; &#8221; Aisha added, &#8220;Surely, Allah&#8217;s Apostle set the tradition of Tawaf between Safa and Marwa, so nobody is allowed to omit the Tawaf between them.&#8221; Later on I (&#8216;Urwa) told Abu Bakr bin &#8216;Abdur-Rahman (of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s narration) and he said, &#8216;i have not heard of such information, but I heard learned men saying that all the people, except those whom &#8216;Aisha mentioned and who used to assume lhram for the sake of Manat, used to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah referred to the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and did not mention Safa and Marwa in the Quran, the people asked, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We used to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa and Allah has revealed (the verses concerning) Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and has not mentioned Safa and Marwa. Is there any harm if we perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa?&#8217; So Allah revealed: &#8220;Verily As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;It seems that this verse was revealed concerning the two groups, those who used to refrain from Tawaf between Safa and Marwa in the Pre-lslamic Period of ignorance and those who used to perform the Tawaf then, and after embracing Islam they refrained from the Tawaf between them as Allah had enjoined Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and did not mention Tawaf (of Safa and Marwa) till later after mentioning the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8217;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;When Allah&#8217;s Apostle performed the first Tawaf he did Ramal in the first three rounds and then walked in the remaining four rounds (of Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba), where as in performing Tawaf between Safa and Marwa he used to run in the midst of the rain-water passage,&#8221; I asked Nafi&#8217;, &#8220;Did &#8216;Abdullah (bin &#8216;Umar) use to walk steadily on reaching the Yemenite Corner?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;No, unless people were crowded at the Corner; otherwise he would not leave it without touching it.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amr bin Dinar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We asked Ibn &#8216;Umar whether a man who, while performing &#8216;Umra, had performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba; and had not yet performed Tawaf between Safa and Marwa, could have sexual relation with his wife, Ibn &#8216;Umar replied &#8220;The Prophet (p.b.u.h) reached Mecca and performed the seven rounds (of Tawaf) of the Ka&#8217;ba and then offered a two-Rakat prayer behind Maqam ibrahim and then performed the seven rounds (of Tawaf) between Safa and Marwa.&#8221; He added, &#8220;Verily! In Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) you have a good example.&#8221; We asked Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah (the same question) and he said, &#8220;He (that man) should not come near (his wife) till he has completed Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.&#8221;</p>

In Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) you have a good example. &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Asim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Anas bin Malik: &#8220;Did you use to dislike to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, as it was of the ceremonies of the days of the Pre-lslamic period of ignorance, till Allah revealed: &#8216;Verily! (The two mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah. It is therefore no sin for him who performs the pilgrimage to the Ka&#8217;ba, or performs &#8216;Umra, to perform Tawaf between them.&#8217; &#8221; (2.158)</p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 712:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was menstruating when I reached Mecca. So, I neither performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, nor the Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. Then I informed Allah&#8217;s Apostle about it. He replied, &#8220;Perform all the ceremonies of Hajj like the other pilgrims, but do not perform Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba till you get clean (from your menses).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 713:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet and his companions assumed Ihram for Hajj and none except the Prophet (p.b.u.h) and Talha had the Hadi (sacrifice) with them. &#8216;Ali arrived from Yemen and had a Hadi with him. &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;I have assumed Ihram for what the Prophet has done.&#8221; The Prophet ordered his companions to perform the &#8216;Umra with the lhram which they had assumed, and after finishing Tawaf (of Ka&#8217;ba, Safa and Marwa) to cut short their hair, and to finish their lhram except those who had Hadi with them. They (the people) said, &#8220;How can we proceed to Mina (for Hajj) after having sexual relations with our wives?&#8221; When that news reached the Prophet he said, &#8220;If I had formerly known what I came to know lately, I would not have brought the Hadi with me. Had there been no Hadi with me, I would have finished the state of lhram.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha got her menses, so she performed all the ceremonies of Hajj except Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, and when she got clean (from her menses), she performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba. She said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! (All of you) are returning with the Hajj and &#8216;Umra, but I am returning after performing Hajj only.&#8221; So the Prophet ordered &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr to accompany her to Tan&#8217;im and thus she performed the &#8216;Umra after the Hajj.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 714:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hafsa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(On &#8216;Id) We used to forbid our virgins to go out (for &#8216;Id prayer). A lady came and stayed at the Palace of Bani Khalaf. She mentioned that her sister was married to one of the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle who participated in twelve Ghazawats along with Allah&#8217;s Apostle and her sister was with him in six of them. She said, &#8220;We used to dress the wounded and look after the patients.&#8221; She (her sister) asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle , &#8220;Is there any harm for a woman to stay at home if she doesn&#8217;t have a veil?&#8221; He said, &#8220;She should cover herself with the veil of her companion and she should take part in the good deeds and in the religious gatherings of the believers.&#8221; When Um &#8216;Atiyya came, I asked her. &#8220;Did you hear anything about that?&#8221; Um &#8216;Atiyya said, &#8220;Bi Abi&#8221; and she never mentioned the name of Allah&#8217;s Apostle without saying &#8220;Bi Abi&#8221; (i.e. &#8216;Let my father be sacrificed for you&#8217;). We asked her, &#8220;Have you heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying so and so (about women)?&#8221; She replied in the affirmative and said, &#8220;Let my father be sacrificed for him. He told us that unmarried mature virgins who stay often screened or unmarried young virgins and mature girls who stay often screened should come out and take part in the good deeds and in the religious gatherings of the believers. But the menstruating women should keep away from the Musalla (praying place).&#8221; I asked her, &#8220;The menstruating women?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;Don&#8217;t they present themselves at &#8216;Arafat and at such and such places?&#8221;</p>

On the Day of &#8216;Arafat, when the sun declined at midday, Ibn &#8216;Umar came along with me and shouted near Al-Hajjaj&#8217;s cotton (cloth) tent. Al-Hajjaj came Out, wrapping himself with a waist-sheet dyed with safflower, and said, &#8220;O Abu Abdur-Rahman! What is the matter?&#8221; He said, If you want to follow the Sunna (the tradition of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ) then proceed (to &#8216;Arafat).&#8221; Al-Hajjaj asked, &#8220;At this very hour?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Please wait for me till I pour some water over my head (i.e. take a bath) and come out.&#8221; Then Ibn &#8216;Umar dismounted and waited till Al-Hajjaj came out. So, he (Al-Hajjaj) walked in between me and my father (Ibn &#8216;Umar). I said to him, &#8220;If you want to follow the Sunna then deliver a brief sermon and hurry up for the stay at &#8216;Arafat.&#8221; He started looking at &#8216;Abdullah (Ibn &#8216;Umar) (inquiringly), and when &#8216;Abdullah noticed that, he said that he had told the truth.</p>

The Hums used to give clothes to the men who would perform the Tawaf wearing them; and women (of the Hums) used to give clothes to the women who would perform the Tawaf wearing them. Those to whom the Hums did not give clothes would perform Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba naked. Most of the people used to go away (disperse) directly from &#8216;Arafat but they (Hums) used to depart after staying at Al-Muzdalifa. &#8216;Urwa added, &#8220;My father narrated that &#8216;Aisha had said, &#8216;The following verses were revealed about the Hums: Then depart from the place whence all the people depart&#8211;(2.199) &#8216;Urwa added, &#8220;They (the Hums) used to stay at Al-Muzdalifa and used to depart from there (to Mina) and so they were sent to &#8216;Arafat (by Allah&#8217;s order).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah;- performed the Hajj and we reached Al-Muzdalifa at or about the time of the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer. He ordered a man to pronounce the Adhan and Iqama and then he offered the Maghrib prayer and offered two Rakat after it. Then he asked for his supper and took it, and then, I think, he ordered a man to pronounce the Adhan and Iqama (for the &#8216;isha&#8217; prayer). (&#8216;Amr, a sub-narrator said: The intervening statement &#8216;I think&#8217;, was said by the sub-narrator Zuhair) (i.e. not by &#8216;Abdu-Rahman). Then &#8216;Abdullah offered two Rakat of &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer. When the day dawned, &#8216;Abdullah said, &#8220;The Prophet never offered any prayer at this hour except this prayer at this time and at this place and on this day.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah added, &#8220;These two prayers are shifted from their actual times &#8212; the Maghrib prayer (is offered) when the people reached Al-Muzdalifa and the Fajr (morning) prayer at the early dawn.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah added, &#8220;I saw the Prophet doing that.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar used to send the weak among his family early to Mina. So they used to depart from Al-Mash&#8217;ar Al-Haram (that is Al-Muzdalifa) at night (when the moon had set) and invoke Allah as much as they could, and then they would return (to Mina) before the Imam had started from Al-Muzdalifa to Mina. So some of them would reach Mina at the time of the Fajr prayer and some of them would come later. When they reached Mina they would throw pebbles on the Jamra (Jamrat-al-Aqaba) Ibn &#8216;Umar used to say, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave the permission to them (weak people) to do so.&#8221;</p>

Has the moon set?&#8221; I replied in the negative and she again prayed for another period and then asked, &#8220;Has the moon set?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; So she said that we should set out (for Mina), and we departed and went on till she threw pebbles at the Jamra (Jamrat-al-Aqaba) and then she returned to her dwelling place and offered the morning prayer. I asked her, &#8220;O you! I think we have come (to Mina) early in the night.&#8221; She replied, &#8220;O my son! Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave permission to the women to do so.&#8221;</p>

He took his supper in between the two prayers. He offered the Fajr prayer as soon as the day dawned. Some people said, &#8220;The day had dawned (at the time of the prayer),&#8221; and others said, &#8220;The day had not dawned.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah then said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;These two prayers have been shifted from their stated times at this place only (at Al-Muzdalifa); first: The Maghrib and the &#8216;Isha&#8217;. So the people should not arrive at Al-Muzdalifa till the time of the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer has become due. The second prayer is the morning prayer which is offered at this hour.&#8217; &#8221; Then &#8216;Abdullah stayed there till it became a bit brighter. He then said, &#8220;If the chief of the believers hastened onwards to Mina just now, then he had indeed followed the Sunna.&#8221; I do not know which proceeded the other, his (&#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s) statement or the departure of &#8216;Uthman .

<p style="text-align:justify;">During the last Hajj (Hajj-al-Wada&#8217;) of Allah&#8217;s Apostle he performed &#8216;Umra and Hajj. He drove a Hadi along with him from Dhul-Hulaifa. Allah&#8217;s Apostle started by assuming Ihram for&#8217;Umra and Hajj. And the people, too, performed the &#8216;Umra and Hajj along with the Prophet. Some of them brought the Hadi and drove it along with them, while the others did not. So, when the Prophet arrived at Mecca. he said to the people, &#8220;Whoever among you has driven the Hadi, should not finish his Ihram till he completes his Hajj. And whoever among you has not (driven) the Hadi with him, should perform Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and the Tawaf between Safa and Marwa, then cut short his hair and finish his Ihram, and should later assume Ihram for Hajj; but he must offer a Hadi (sacrifice); and if anyone cannot afford a Hadi, he should fast for three days during the Hajj and seven days when he returns home. The Prophet performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba on his arrival (at Mecca); he touched the (Black Stone) corner first of all and then did Ramal (fast walking with moving of the shoulders) during the first three rounds round the Ka&#8217;ba, and during the last four rounds he walked. After finishing Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, he offered a two Rakat prayer at Maqam Ibrahim, and after finishing the prayer he went to Safa and Marwa and performed seven rounds of Tawaf between them and did not do any deed forbidden because of Ihram, till he finished all the ceremonies of his Hajj and sacrificed his Hadi on the day of Nahr (10th day of Dhul-Hijja). He then hastened onwards (to Mecca) and performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and then everything that was forbidden because of Ihram became permissible. Those who took and drove the Hadi with them did the same as Allah&#8217;s Apostle did.</p>

Then he went out and when he reached Al-Baida&#8217;, he assumed Ihram for Hajj and &#8216;Umra (together) and said, &#8220;The conditions (requisites) of Hajj and &#8216;Umra are the same.&#8221; He, then brought a Hadi from Qudaid.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Qasim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard my father who was the best man of his age, saying, &#8220;I heard &#8216;Aisha saying, &#8216;I perfumed Allah&#8217;s Apostle with my own hands before finishing his Ihram while yet he has not performed Tawaf-al-Ifada.&#8217; She spread her hands (while saying so.)&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 810:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people were ordered to perform the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba (Tawaf-al-Wada&#8217;) as the lastly thing, before leaving (Mecca), except the menstruating women who were excused.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 811:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet offered the Zuhr, &#8216;Asr, Maghrib and the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayers and slept for a while at a place called Al-Mahassab and then rode to the Ka&#8217;ba and performed Tawaf round it .</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 812:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Safiya bint Huyay, the wife of the Prophet got her menses, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle was informed of that. He said, &#8220;Would she delay us?&#8221; The people said, &#8220;She has already performed Tawaf-al-Ifada.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Therefore she will not (delay us).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 813:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ikrima:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of Medina asked Ibn Abbas about a woman who got her menses after performing Tawaf-al-Ifada. He said, &#8220;She could depart (from Mecca).&#8221; They said, &#8220;We will not act on your verdict and ignore the verdict of Zaid.&#8221; Ibn Abbas said, &#8220;When you reach Medina, inquire about it.&#8221; So, when they reached Medina they asked (about that). One of those whom they asked was Um Sulaim. She told them the narration of Safiya (812).</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 814:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A menstruating woman was allowed to leave Mecca if she had done Tawaf-al-Ifada. Tawus (a sub-narrator) said from his father, &#8220;I heard Ibn &#8216;Umar saying that she would not depart. Then later I heard him saying that the Prophet had allowed them (menstruating women) to depart.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 815:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We set out with the Prophet with the intention of performing Hajj only. The Prophet reached Mecca and performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and between Safa and Marwa and did not finish the Ihram, because he had the Hadi with him. His companions and his wives performed Tawaf (of the Ka&#8217;ba and between Safa and Marwa), and those who had no Hadi with them finished their Ihram. I got the menses and performed all the ceremonies of Hajj. So, when the Night of Hasba (night of departure) came, I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! All your companions are returning with Hajj and &#8216;Umra except me.&#8221; He asked me, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you perform Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba (Umra) when you reached Mecca?&#8221; I said, &#8220;No.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Go to Tan&#8217;im with your brother &#8216;Abdur-Rahman, and assume Ihram for &#8216;Umra and I will wait for you at such and such a place.&#8221; So I went with &#8216;Abdur-Rahman to Tan&#8217;im and assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra. Then Safiya bint Huyay got menses. The Prophet said, &#8221; &#8216;Aqra Halqa! You will detain us! Didn&#8217;t you perform Tawaf-al-Ifada on the Day of Nahr (slaughtering)?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Yes, I did.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Then there is no harm, depart.&#8221; So I met the Prophet when he was ascending the heights towards Mecca and I was descending, or vice-versa.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 816:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdul-Aziz bin Rufai:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Anas bin Malik, &#8220;Tell me something you have observed about the Prophet concerning where he offered the Zuhr prayer on the Day of Tarwiya (8th Dhul-Hijja).&#8221; Anas replied, &#8220;He offered it at Mina.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Where did he offer the Asr prayer on the Day of Nafr (day of departure from Mina)?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;At Al-Abtah,&#8221; and added, &#8220;You should do as your leaders do.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 817:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet offered the Zuhr, &#8216;Asr, Maghrib and &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayers and slept for a while at a place called Al-Mahassab and then he rode towards the Ka&#8217;ba and performed Tawaf (al-Wada&#8217;).</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 818:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It (i.e. Al-Abtah) was a place where the Prophet used to camp so that it might be easier for him to depart.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 819:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Staying at Al-Mahassab is not one of the ceremonies (of Hajj), but Al-Mahassab is a place where Allah&#8217;s Apostle camped (during his Hajjat-ul-wida).</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 820:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Umar used to spend the night at Dhi-Tuwa in between the two Thaniyas and then he would enter Mecca through the Thaniya which is at the higher region of Mecca, and whenever he came to Mecca for Hajj or &#8216;Umra, he never made his she camel kneel down except near the gate of the Masjid (Sacred Mosque) and then he would enter (it) and go to the Black (stone) Corner and start from there circumambulating the Ka&#8217;ba seven times: hastening in the first three rounds (Ramal) and walking in the last four. On finishing, he would offer two Rakat prayer and set out to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa before returning to his dwelling place. On returning (to Medina) from Hajj or &#8216;Umra, he used to make his camel kneel down at Al-Batha which is at Dhu-l-Hulaifa, the place where the Prophet used to make his camel kneel down.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 821:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Khalid bin Al-Harith:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Ubaidullah was asked about Al Mahassab. &#8216;Ubaidullah narrated: Nafi&#8217; said, &#8216;Allah&#8217;s Apostles, &#8216;Umar and Ibn &#8216;Umar camped there.&#8221; Nafi&#8217; added, &#8220;Ibn &#8216;Umar used to offer the Zuhr and &#8216;Asr prayers at it (i.e. Al-Mahassab).&#8221; I think he mentioned the Maghrib prayer also. I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt about &#8216;Isha&#8217; (i.e. he used to offer it there also), and he used to sleep there for a while. He used to say, &#8216;The Prophet used to do the same.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 822:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216; Abbas :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dhul-Majaz and &#8216;Ukaz were the markets of the people during the pre-lslamic period of ignorance. When the people embraced Islam, they disliked to do bargaining there till the following Holy Verses were revealed:&#8211; There is no harm for you If you seek of the bounty Of your Lord (during Hajj by trading, etc.) (2.198)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 823:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216; Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Safiya got her menses on the night of Nafr (departure from Hajj), and she said, &#8220;I see that I will detain you.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Aqra Halqa! Did she perform the Tawaf on the Day of Nahr (slaughtering)?&#8221; Somebody replied in the affirmative. He said, &#8220;Then depart.&#8221; (Different narrators mentioned that) &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;We set out with Allah&#8217;s Apostle (from Medina) with the intention of performing Hajj only. When we reached Mecca, he ordered us to finish the Ihram. When it was the night of Nafr (departure), Safiya bint Huyay got her menses. The Prophet said, &#8220;Halqa Aqra! I think that she will detain you,&#8221; and added, &#8220;Did you perform the Tawaf (Al-Ifada) on the Day of Nahr (slaughtering)?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Then depart.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have not (done the Umra).&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Perform &#8216;Umra from Tan&#8217;im.&#8221; My brother went with me and we came across the Prophet in the last part of the night. He said, &#8220;Wait at such and such a place.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaani was born in the Ashkodera, capital of Albania in 1914 C.E. While he was young his parents migrated with him to Damascus, Syria. From an early age he became fascinated by the sciences of Hadith and thereafter spent his time devoted to seeking the knowledge. In later life he was given professorship of Hadith at the Islamic University of Madinah. He is well known to students and scholars for his knowledge and writings. He has many well-known students and has visited places throughout the MiddleeEast and Europe. He was forced to migrate to Syria to Jordan, then to Syria, then to Lebanon, then to the Emirates, then finally back to Jordan. He has been of enormous service to the Prophetic Hadith, taking great pains to check and sort out the authentic from the weak and fabricated narrations. He has produced many pamphlets and books, some of them running into many volumes &#8211; on topics of great importance to Muslims &#8211; and has fully checked many of the famous books of Hadith &#8211; the Sunan of Tirmidhee, Aboo Daawood, An-Nasaa&#8217;ee and Ibn Maajah, along with Suyootis huge &#8216;Jaami su-Sugheer&#8217; and Mishkat ul-Masaabeeh&#8217;. He is the foremost scholar of Hadith and related science of this age.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Text of Translation</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Verily all praise is for Allaah, we praise Him and seek His aid, and we ask for His forgiveness, and we seek refuge in Allaah from the evils of our own selves and from our evil deeds. Whomsoever Allaah has guided, none can misguide him, and whomsoever Allaah has mis- guided, none can guide him, and I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, without any partner, and I testify that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Verily the desire to make Knowledge easily accessible to the public has called me to explain the rites of Hajj and to do that by extracting these from my original book: <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>&#8220;the Hajj of the Prophet as narrated by Jaabir radhi Allaahu anhu &#8220;</strong></span> &#8211; in the same way that I produced an abridgement of my book on the Prophet&#8217;s manner of Prayer &#8211; except that I have here in included many important additions not found in the original &#8211; and I have been careful to record their source and authenticity &#8211; along with other additions with I have added in accordance with the method used in my other books as regards quoting the standard Hadith along with its source &#8211; in abridged form &#8211; while usually referring the reader to my other books &#8211; some of which have been published and some of which have not. As for what is to be found in my original book on Hajj, then I have not quoted the sources in full herein &#8211; regarding it as sufficient that reader should refer back to the original as it is widely available to the honorable readers &#8211; so anyone who wishes to check on such a point will find it easy to refer back to and I will refer to it as <strong>&#8216;The Original&#8217;</strong>. And to add to the usefulness of the book I have ended it with a brief mention of the innovations connected with Hajj and visiting Madinah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I have called it <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>&#8220;The Rites of Hajj and &#8216;Umrah&#8221; from the Book and the Sunnah and Narrations from the Pious Predecessors</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah the Blessed and Most High to make all my work good and sincerely for His Face and that should be no sharer in that with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaani</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Damascus, 21st Sha&#8217;baan 1395</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Advice for those about to perform Hajj</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are some pieces of advice and useful points which I offer to our brothers about to make Hajj.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Firstly.</b> The pilgrim must <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>fear his lord</strong></span> by obedience to Him, and must be very careful not to fall into that which Allaah has forbidden as Allaah ta&#8217;la says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">For Hajj are the months well-known. If anyone undertaken that duty therein, let there be no obscenity nor wrangling in the Hajj</span></strong>.&gt;&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Surat-al-Baqarah ayah 197]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He who performs Hajj and does not speak obscenely or commit evil then he returns from his sins just as the day his mother gave birth to him</strong></span>&#8220;,</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and if he did so then his Hajj would be accepted and Rasoolullaah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;<strong>The accepted Hajj &#8211; there is no less a reward for it than Paradise&#8221; </strong></span>(1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he must be aware of what many are affected by because of their ignorance or misguidance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(A) Directing any form of worship to other than Allaah (<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>shirk</strong></span>). And we have seen many of the people falling into shirk &#8211; like praying fro the removal of distress or aid from the Prophets and the pious instead of from Allaah alone, and their taking oath by them in veneration of them &#8211; so by their actions they completely nullify their Hajj. As Allaah ta&#8217;ala says:(Soorat-ul-Zumar ayah 65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>If you were to join gods with Allaah, truly fruitless will be you work (in life)</strong></span>.&gt;&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(B) Some men <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>shaving off their beards</strong></span> &#8211; as it is a sinful deed &#8211; and doing it involves four separate sins &#8211; as I have explained in &#8216;The Original&#8217;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(C) The wearing of <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>gold rings by men</strong></span> &#8211; and this is Haraam &#8211; even more so those which are known as <strong><span style="color:#000000;">wedding-rings</span></strong> as that includes the further sin of imitating the Christians.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Secondly.</b> Everyone who intends to make Hajj and has not brought the sacrificial animal (Hadee) with him (2) then he should intend to perform Hajj of Tamattu&#8217; [see the Glossary] &#8211; as the Prophet ordered his companions to do in the end, and as he became angry when some did not immediately carry out this order to change the intention from Hajj to an &#8216;Umrah and he صلى الله عليه و آله وسلم said: &#8220;I have entered the `Umarah into the Hajj until the Day of Resurrection&#8221;, and when some of the Companions asked whether he had done that only for that year or forever, the Prophet joined his fingers together and said: &#8220;I have entered the &#8216;Umrah into the Hajj until the Day of Resurrection, not just for a time, rather forever.(3) And because of this he ordered Fatimah and also all his wives &#8211; may Allah be pleased with them all &#8211; to leave the state of iHraam after finishing the &#8216;Umrah, and therefore Ibn &#8216;Abaas رضي الله عنه used to say: Whomsoever makes tawaaf of the House &#8211; then he has left iHraam &#8211; the Sunnah of your Prophet &#8211; even if you are averse to it.(4) So everyone who has not brought the sacrificial animal with him, should call out that he is going to make &#8216;Umrah &#8211; in the three months of Hajj, and he who has declared his intention to do Hajj Mufrad (Hajj on its own) or Hajj Qaarin then hears of the Prophet to change it &#8216;Umrah &#8211; then he should quickly obey even after reaching Makkah and Sa&#8217;ee between Safaa and Marwah &#8211; then he should leave the state of iHraam &#8211; then declare the intention for Hajj on the Day of Tarwiyyah &#8211; the 8th of Dhul Hijjah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you who believe! Give you response to Allaah and His Messenger, when He calls you to that which will give you life&#8230;</strong></span>&gt;&gt;[Soorat-ul-Anfal ayah 24].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Thirdly.</b> You must not leave off <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>staying the night at Mina</strong></span> on the night before &#8216;Arafah as it is obligatory (waajib) &#8211; the Prophet did it and ordered it with his saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Take from me your rites of pilgrimage</span></strong>.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And you must also <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>stay the night at Muzdalifah until you pray Fajr prayer</strong></span>, and if you miss this staying then you must at least pray Fajr there &#8211; as that is even more obligatory &#8211; rather it is one of the rukn (pillar) of Hajj according to the most correct saying according to the scholars &#8211; except upon the woman and the weak &#8211; for it has been allowed for them to leave after half of the night has passed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Fourthly.</b> And be very careful not <strong><span style="color:#000000;">to walk directly in front of anyone praying in the Haraam</span> </strong>mosque, not to speak of other mosques and prying places as the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;If the one walking between the hands of one praying knew what were upon him then it would be better for him to stand still for forty (&#8230;) than that he should walk between his hands. </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Maalik, al-Bukhaaree, Muslim, the 4 Sunan of Abu Juhaim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is a general text covering everyone walking in front, and everyone praying &#8211; and there is no authentic Hadith to make any exception for the one doing so in the Haraam Masjid &#8211; and you should pray therein like any other place towards a sutrah &#8211; according to the general nature of the Hadith regarding that &#8211; and there are also some narrations from the Companions particularly about the Masjid-ul-Haraam &#8211; which I have mentioned in &#8216;The Original&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Fifthly.</b> The people of knowledge should <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>teach the pilgrims the rites of Hajj and its commands according to the Book and the Sunnah</strong></span> whenever meeting with them, and that should not stop them from calling to Tawheed which is the essence of Islaam and was the reason for sending of the Prophets, and the sending down of revealed books, as most of the people whom we have met &#8211; even some of those who are supposed to be seeking knowledge &#8211; we have found to be in complete ignorance of the real meaning of oblivious to the necessity of the return of the Muslims &#8211; upon their differing madhabs (schools of thoughts) and various parties &#8211; to unification and joining ranks upon the basis of the Book and the Sunnah, &#8211; in belief (Aqeedah) and Regulations (Ahkaam) and transactions, and behaviour, and politics and economic affairs and all other aspects of life. And they must remember that any voice raised or any movement made to reform which is based upon any foundation other than this firm splitting and weakening of the Muslims &#8211; and will increase their shamefulness and humiliation &#8211; and the present state of affairs is the greatest proof of that &#8211; and Allaah is the One Whose help is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is nothing wrong with debating in the best way &#8211; when required, as the kind of argumentation that is forbidden in Hajj is useless argument which is also forbidden outside Hajj, just like the eveil-doing that is forbidden in Hajj &#8211; for that is not the debating which is commanded in Allaah ta&#8217;ala&#8217;s saying [Soorat-un-Nahi aya 125].</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Invite (all) to the way of your Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching, and argue with them in ways that are best and most gracious..</span></strong>.&gt;&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, it should be noticed that if it appears that there is no benefit in the discussion because of the other persons blindly sticking to his madhab or own opinion &#8211; and if he were to continue then there is fear of going into that which is not permissible &#8211; then it is better to leave that argument with him as the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;I am a claimant for a house in the outskirts of Paradise for one who leaves off arguing even if he is in the right&#8230;&#8221;</strong> </span>(6)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>No Difficulty</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the one who is inviting to the truth should always make things easy for the people in general and the pilgrims in particular as this making things easy is one of the principles of the kind of Sharee&#8217;ah &#8211; as is known &#8211; as long as there is no text against the point, for when there is a specific text then it is not permissible to make things easy by opinion. And this is the just and middle way which it is binding for every caller to the truth to adopt. And there is no need to take any notice to the people&#8217;s objecting after that and saying: He is too strict, he is too lenient.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there are various actions which are <b>permissible</b> for the pilgrims which they have become used to avoiding due to some people&#8217;s fatawa going against the aforementioned principle. So I decided to make note of those:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Bathing</strong></span>, without need to because of (e.g.) wet dreams (iHtilaam), even if it involves rubbing the head &#8211; as it is authentically reported from the Prophet in Bukhaaree and Muslim and others from the narration of Aboo Ayyoob rahimahullaah (7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Scratching the head</strong></span>, even if some hair falls out as shown by the preceding hadith of Aboo Ayyoob &#8211; and it is the saying of Shaikhul-Islaam Taimiyya (rahimahullaah ).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Cupping/Blood-letting (iHtijaam)</strong></span> even if some of the hair is shaved off in the place required, as the Prophet had it done on the center of his head while in iHraam &#8211; and that is not possible without shaving some of the hair. And this is also the saying of Ibn Taymiyyah &#8211; and the Hanbali scholars also &#8211; however, they say that he must make a sacrifice to make up for it, and they have no proof of this. Rather that is rejected by the Prophet&#8217;s cupping &#8211; and had he made a sacrifice because of having done that then the narrator would have reported that &#8211; and his not having done so shows that it did not happen &#8211; so the correct position is the saying of Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah ).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Smelling sweet smelling plants</strong></span> and <strong><span style="color:#000000;">pulling off broken nails</span></strong> &#8211; and there is narrations about that mentioned in &#8216;The Original&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Taking the shade of a tent, or upheld garment</strong></span> &#8211; as this is proven from the Prophet, and in the same way using the camel-litter in the old days or an umbrella or car &#8211; even sitting inside &#8211; these days. And making it obligatory to make up for that with a sacrifice is a harshness for which there is no proof, rather there is no difference between seeking the shade of a tent which is proven from the Sunnah and seeking shade from the camel-litter &#8211; and its like, and this is a narration from Imaam AHmad as occurs in &#8216;Manaar us-Sabeel&#8217; (1/2460). And what some people do regarding removing the roofs of their cars is entering into religion something that the Lord of the worlds has not allowed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Wearing a belt around the izaar</strong></span> and tying it when necessary, and <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>wearing rings</strong></span> &#8211; as occurs in some narrations. And like it is wearing a <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>watch</strong> </span>or <strong><span style="color:#000000;">spectacles</span> </strong>and <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>money-pouch</strong></span> around the neck.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of those things fall under the aforementioned principle &#8211; furthermore some of them also being supported by hadith from the Prophet, or by narrations from the Companions &#8211; and Allaah ta&#8217;ala says: [Soorat-ul-Baqarah ayah 185].</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He (Allah) intends every facility for you, He does not want to put you into difficulties</strong></span>.&gt;&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And all praise is for Allaah Lord of the worlds.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Assuming Iharaam</b> (Ihraam is the state entered into at the Meeqat in which certain acts and types of clothing are forbidden).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. It is mustaHabb for anyone going for Hajj or &#8216;Umrah to take a <strong>ghusl</strong> (bath) for iHraam &#8211; even if a woman is in her period or in after-birth confinement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Then the men may wear whatever clothes he wishes that are not made in the shape of the body &#8211; and these clothes are called by the fuqahaa (religious scholars) &#8220;<strong>ghair al mukheet (unstitched)</strong>&#8220;. So he wears a ridaa (upper garment) and izaar (lower garment) or whatever, and sandals or any footwear that <span style="text-decoration:underline;">does not cover the ankle-bone</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. He does not wear a <strong>hat or an &#8216;imaamah (turban)</strong> or anything like that which fits onto and covers the head &#8211; this referring only to men. As for the women &#8211; she does not remove anything of the clothes that are prescribed for her in the Shari&#8217;ah, except that she should not tie on the <strong>niqaab</strong> (8) (face-veil) or the burqa&#8217; or the lithaam (lower face cover, up to the eyes) or handkerchief and she should not wear <strong>gloves </strong>(9). And the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و آله وسلم) said :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The muHrim should not wear the shirt, or the &#8216;imaamah, or the hooded cloak, or trousers, or garment touched by wars (dyes with saffron) or saffron; or leather socks &#8211; unless he cannot find sandals) then in that case he may wear leather socks),(10)&#8221; </span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The woman muHrim should not affix a face veil and should not wear gloves(11). </span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is permissible to for the women to cover her face &#8211; even if it touches her face according to the correct opinion &#8211; however, she should not tie it on, as Ibn Taymiyyah says.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. He may put on the <strong>clothing of iHraam before the meeqat</strong> even in his own house as the Prophet and his Companions did. And this makes it easier for those making Hajj by aeroplane for whom it is not possible to put on iHramm at the meeqat &#8211; so it is permissible for them to embark on the plane in iHraam, but they do not make the <strong>intention of iHramm</strong> until very shortly before the meeqat &#8211; in order that they do not go past the meeqat without iHraam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. He may use <strong>body oil and perfume himself</strong> with any perfume he please which was has <strong>odor but not color</strong>, however, women use that which has color not but no odor &#8211; and all this to be before he makes intention of iHraam at the meeqat &#8211; after that is Haraam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Ihraam and Niyya (intention)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. So when he comes t the meeqat it becomes waajib (obligatory) for him to assume iHraam &#8211; and the mere wish and intention to perform Hajj is not sufficient as that has been with him since leaving his own land &#8211; rather he must perform by word and action what will cause him to be muhrim. So when he recites `talbiyyah&#8217; intending to enter into iHraam then his iHraam is concluded &#8211; as agreed upon by the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. And he does not say anything more than the <strong>talbiyyah</strong> such as their saying: &#8220;O Allah, I intend to make Hajj or `Umrah so make it easy for me and accept it from me&#8230;&#8221; as none of this is reported from the Prophet &#8211; just like speaking with the intention for wudoo and salaat and Fasting &#8211; all of this being from the newly invented matters and is well-known the Prophet said: &#8220;&#8230;for every newly invented matter is an innovation, and every innovation is a going astray and every going astray is in HellFire.&#8221; [Tirmidhee &#8211; saHeeh]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Meeqaats</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. The meeqaats (places for assuming iHraam) are five: Dhul Hulaifah, Al-Juhfah, Qarn-ul manaazil, Yalamlam and Dhaatu `Irq. They are for those who live there and those who pass by them intending Hajj or &#8216;Umrah. And he whose house is nearer than them to Makkah then he makes iHraam from his house, the people of Makkah making iHraam from Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">DHUL HULAIFAH is the place for the people of Madinah and is a village six or seven miles away &#8211; and it is the furthest meeqaat from Makkah &#8211; being ten riding stations away &#8211; or less depending on the route, there being many routes from there to Makkah as Ibn Taimiyyah points out. And it is called ((<strong>waadi ul `Aqeeq</strong>,)) and its masjid is called ((<strong>Masjid-ush-shajarah</strong>)) (mosque of the Tree), and there is spring there called `<strong>the spring of `Ali</strong>&#8216; by the ignorant masses &#8211; believing that `Ali : killed a jinn there &#8211; and that is a lie.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And AL-JUHFAH is a village between Madinah and Makkah &#8211; about three travel stages away. It is the meeqat for the people of Madinah if they come by this route. Ibn Taimiyyah said: &#8220;It is the meeqaat for those who make Hajj from the direction of the west, like the people of Shaam (Greater Syria) and Egypt and the rest of the West. And it is today ruined and deserted, therefore the people now go into iHraam before it in the place called &#8220;<strong>Raabigh</strong>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Qarn UL MANAAZIL &#8211; which is also called &#8220;Qarn-uth-Tha&#8217;aalib&#8221; is near Makkah &#8211; being a day and night&#8217;s journey away &#8211; and is the meeqaat for the people of Najd.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And YALAMLAM is a place two nights distant from Makkah, thirty miles away and is the meeqaat for the people of Yemen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And DHAATU TRQ is a place out in the desert, marking the border between Najd and Tihaamah, being forty-two miles from Makkah. It is the meeqaat for the people of Iraq.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Prophet&#8217;s order to perform Hajj UT-TAMATTU</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. So when he wishes to make iHraam and is making Hajj-ul-Qirran, having brought the sacrificial animal with him, he should say: <b>labbaikallaahumma bi-hajjah wa umrah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Here I am O Allah making Hajj and `Umraah). So if he hasn&#8217;t brought the sacrificial animal &#8211; and that is better &#8211; then he says talbiyyah for `Umrah only and that he must do, saying <b>labbaikallaahumma bi-`umrah</b>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if he has already made talbiyyah for Hajj only, he cancels that and makes it into an `Umrah &#8211; as the Prophet ordered that and also said: &#8220;I have entered the Hajj until the Day of Judgment&#8221; and he joined his fingers together (as in the Hadith that has preceded).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said: &#8220;O family of Muhammad &#8211; whoever from you makes Hajj, then let him say talbiyyah of an &#8216;Umrah in Hajj(12)&#8221; and this is At-Tamattu&#8217; of `Umrah with Hajj.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Making condition</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. And if he wishes when making talbiyyah he may state a condition to Allah fearing that which may prevent him (from completion of the Hajj) whether illness or fear &#8211; saying as the Prophet taught: <b>allaahumma mahillee haithu habastanee</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Allah my place is wherever you prevent me).(13) So if he does that and is then prevented or becomes ill &#8211; then he may leave iHraam of the Hajj or `Umrah &#8211; and there is no recompensatory sacrifice due upon him and he does not have to do the Hajj again, except and unless it was his first Hajj &#8211; then he has to repeat it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. There is no special prayer for iHraam, however if it is time for prayer before iHraam, then he should pray and then put on iHraam following the example of the Rasoolullah who put on iHraam after prying zuhr.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Prayer in waadee ul&#8217;aqeeq</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. However he whose meeqaat is Dhul Hulaifah &#8211; then it is mustahabb for him to pray there, not for iHraam, but because of the place and its being blessed. As al-Bukhaari has narrated from Umar &#8211; may Allah be pleased with him &#8211; who said : &#8220;I heard the Rasoolullah say in waadi ul &#8216;Aqeeq:&#8221; &#8220;Someone came to me this night from my Lord and said: Pray in this blessed valley, and say `Umrah with Hajj(14)&#8221; And Ibn &#8216;Umar narrates from the Prophet: &#8220;&#8230;that he saw, when alighting for sleep at the end of the night in Dhul Hulaifah in the center of the valley, one saying to him: you are in the blessed stony ground.&#8221;(15)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Talbiyyah and raising the voice</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. then he said he should stand(16) facing the Qiblah, and say talbiyyah for `Umrah or Hajj as has preceded, and say:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>allaahumma haadhihi hajjah, laariyaa&#8217;a feehaa wa laa sum&#8217;ah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(O Allah this is a Hajj, there being no ostentation in it or hypocrisy).(17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. And he should say the talbiyyah of the Prophet:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) <b>labbaikallaahumma labbaika labbaika laa shareeka laka labbaika-innal hamda wan na&#8217;mata laka wal mulka-la shareeka laka</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Here I am O Allah, here I am, there is no partner for You, here I am, Verily all praise for You, and every bounty is from You, and all dominion is Yours &#8211; You have no partner.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) And he also said: <b>labbaika ilaahal haqq</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Here I am O God of Truth.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15. And it is better to stick to the talbiyyah of the Prophet, even though it is permissible to increase upon it &#8211; as the Prophet approved of those who did so, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;labbaika dhal ma&#8217;aarij, labbaika dhal fawaadil&#8221;.<br />
(of the Ways of Ascent, Here I am Owner of Excellence.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Ibn `Umar used to also say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;labbaika wa sa&#8217;daika wal khairu biyadaika war-raghabaa&#8217;u ilaika wal `amalu&#8221;<br />
(Here I am and blessed by You, and all good is in Your Hands, and desire and action are directed towards You.)(18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16. And the one saying the talbiyyah is ORDERED to <strong>raise his voice</strong> with it, as the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Jibreel came to me and ordered me to ordered my companions and those with me to raise their voices with talbiyyah.&#8221;</strong></span>(19)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;the best Hajj is shouting out and spilling blood&#8221;</strong></span> (20)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore the companions of the Prophet when they entered into iHraam, by the time they reached `arRauhaa&#8217; their voices had tired out.(21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;It is as if I am looking at Musa, upon whom be peace, descending from the mountain pass raising his voice with talbiyyah&#8230;&#8221;</strong></span>(22)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">17. And women, as regards the talbiyyah, are like men &#8211; as the two preceding hadith are general &#8211; so they should raise their voices as long as their is no fear of fitnah. And `Aa&#8217;ishah used to raise her voice until the men could hear her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu `Atiyyah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I heard `Aa&#8217;ishah saying: Verily I know how was the talbiyyah of Rasoolullah, then I heard her after that saying: Labbaikallaahumma labbaika&#8230;&#8221;(23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Qaasim ibn Muhammad said: Mu&#8217;aawiyyah went out at night and heard the voice of someone making talbiyyah, so he said: `Who is that?&#8221; It was said: &#8220;`Aa&#8217;ishah, Mother of the Believers, making `Umrah from at-Tan&#8217;eem.&#8221; So that was mentioned to `Aa&#8217;ishah so she said: &#8220;If he had asked me I would have told him.&#8221;(24)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">18. And he <strong>continually repeats the talbiyyah</strong> as it is &#8220;from the signs of Hajj&#8221;(25) and because of the Prophet&#8217;s saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;There is no one who makes talbiyyah except that whatever is on his right and left &#8211; trees and stones also make talbiyyah until the earth resounds from here and here &#8211; meaning &#8211; on his right and left.&#8221;</strong></span>(26)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Especially whenever he ascends a high place or descends a valley &#8211; according to the hadith which has preceded: &#8220;It is as if I am looking at Musa &#8211; upon whom be peace &#8211; coming down from the mountain pass&#8230;.loudly reciting talbiyyah&#8221; and in the other hadith: &#8220;It is if I am looking towards him when he descends in the valley reciting talbiyyah&#8221;.(27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19. And he may also <strong>recite along with it &#8220;La ilaaha illallaah&#8221;</strong> and talbiyyah according to the saying of Ibn Mas&#8217;ood may Allaah be pleased with him &#8211; &#8220;I went out Rasoolullah and he did not leave off the talbiyyah until he stoned Jamrat-ul&#8217; Aqabah &#8211; except when he mixed it with reciting talbiyyah or &#8220;La ilaaha illallaah&#8221;.(28)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">20. So when he reaches the haram of Makkah and sees the houses of Makkah he leaves off the talbiyyah to concentrate on the following actions:(29)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Taking Ghusl for entring Makkah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">21. And whoever can talk a ghusl (bath) before entering Makkah then he should do so. And he should enter Makkah in the day following the example of Rasoolullah.(30)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">22. And he should enter from the upper part of Makkah which today has Bab ul Mi&#8217;laah as the Prophet entered from the upper pass (Kadaa&#8217;)(31) above the graveyard, and he entered the masjid from Bab Bani Shaibah as that was the nearest way to the Black Stone (Al-Hajrul-Aswad).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">23. And he is allowed to enter by any path as the Prophet said: All of the mountain passes of Makkah are a pathway and place for slaughter and in another hadith, All of Makkah is a pathway. He enters from here and leaves from here.(32)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">24. So if you enter the masjid do not forget to enter by the right foot,(33) and say:(34)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>allallhumma salli `alaa muhammadin wa sallim &#8211; allaahumma aftah lee abwaaba rahmatika</b> or <b>a&#8217;oodhu billaahil `azeemi wa biwajhihil kareem wa sultaanihil qadeemi minash shaitaanir rajeem.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">25. And when he sees the Ka&#8217;bah he raises his hands if he wants to &#8211; as it is established from Ibn `Abbaas.(935))</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">26. And there is no du&#8217;aa established from the Prophet at this point. So he may make du&#8217;aa with Whatever he can if he wishes with the du&#8217;aa which is established from `Umar:(36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>allaahumma anta salaamu wa minkas salaamu fahayyinaa rabbanaa bissalaam</b></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Tawaaf of Quadoom (arrival)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">27. Then he should go straight to the Black Stone and facing it make takbeer. And he may say `Bismillah&#8217; before it &#8211; as it is authentically reported from Ibn `Umar, although not from the Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">28. Then he touches the Black Stone with his hand and kisses it also, and makes sajda upon it also &#8211; as Rasoolullah did that, and `Umar, and Ibn `Abbaas.(37)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">29. If he is not able to kiss it then he touches it with his hand then kisses his hand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">30. Then if he cannot touch it he should make a sign towards it with his hand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">31. And he does that in every circuit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">32. And he should not push and crowd to get to it according to the Prophet&#8217;s saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>O`Umar, you are a strong man, so do not harm the weak, and when you wish to touch it, then when it become free then touch it, and if not then face it and say takbeer</strong>.(38)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">33. And there is in touching the Black Stone a great excellence as the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;Allaah will raise up the Stone on the Day of Judgement, and will have two eyes with which it will see, and a tongue which it talks with, and it will give witness in favor of everyone who touched it in truth.&#8221;</strong>(39)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Touching the Black Stone and the Yemeni corner removes sins.&#8221;</strong>(40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;The Black Stone is from Paradise, and it used to be whiter that snow, but the sins of the idolaters turned it black.&#8221;</strong>(41)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">34. Then he should begin making tawaaf around the Ka&#8217;bah &#8211; it being to his left &#8211; and he goes around past the Stone seven times &#8211; from the Stone to the Stone being one, wearing the iHraam under his right armpit and over the left (called al-idtibaa&#8217;)(42) throughout the tawaaf. And walking quickly and with boldness (ramal &#8211; a strong walk in which the shoulders are thrust forwards) in the first three, from the Stone to the Stone &#8211; then he walks normally in the rest.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">35. And he touches the Yemeni corner with his hand each time he passes and does not kiss it, and if he is not able to touch it then he should not make any sign towards it with his hand at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">36. And he should say between the two corners:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O Allaah gives us good in this life, and good in the Hereafter and save us from the Punishment of the Fire.&#8221;</strong>(43)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Rabbanaa aatinaa fid-dunyaa hasanatan wa feel aakhirati hasanatan wa qinaa &#8216;adhaaban naar</strong><br />
[Soorat-ul-Baqarah ayah 201]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Our Lord! Give us good in this world and good in the Hereafter, and defend us from the torment of the Fire.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">37. And he does not touch the two shaami corners at all following the sunnah of the Prophet.(44)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Iltizaam Between The Corner And The Door</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">38. And he may cling to the place between the corner and the Door &#8211; placing his chest and face and forearms upon this place.(45)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">39. And there is no particular dhikr for tawaaf &#8211; so he may read Qur&#8217;an or say any dhikr he pleases, according to the Prophet&#8217;s saying :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tawaaf around the House is prayer, except that Allah has allowed speech in it, so he who speaks then let him not say except, good things and in a narration : so let him limit his talk in it.&#8221;</strong>(46)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">40. And it is forbidden for a naked person or a mentruating woman to make tawaaf of the House, as he said :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A naked person may not make tawaaf of the House.&#8221;</strong>(47)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying to &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah when she came to make &#8216;Umrah in the final Hajj :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Do as anyone making Hajj does, except do not make tawaaf of the House (and do not pray) until you become clean.</strong>(48)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">41. So when he finished the seventh round he covers his right shoulder and moves to the Place of Ibrahim and recites:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Wattakhidhoo min-maqaami ibraaheema musalla</strong> [Soorat-ul-Baqarah ayah 125]<br />
<strong>(And take you the Station of Abraham as a place of prayer.)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">42. And he places the Maqaami Ibraheem (Place of Abraham) between himself and the Ka&#8217;bah and then prays two rak&#8217;ahs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">43. And he recites therein Surat-ul-Kaafiroon and Surat-Qul Huwallaahu Ahad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">44. And he should not walk between the hands of any praying person there, nor allow anyone to walk in front of him while he is praying &#8211; as the ahadith forbidding that are general &#8211; and there is no established exception for the Haram Masjid, let alone the rest of Mukkah.(49)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">45. Then after praying he goes to Zamzam and drinks thereof,and pours some of the water onto his head, as he said :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Zamzam water is for what it drunk for&#8221;</strong>(50)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and he said</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;It is blessed and it is a food and a cure for illness&#8221;</strong>(51)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and he said :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The best water upon the face of the earth is Zamzam water, in it is nourishment and a cure from illness.</strong>(52)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">46. Then he returned to the Black Stone, says takbeer and touches it &#8211; as before.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Sa&#8217;ee Between Safaa And Marwah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">47. The he goes off for sa&#8217;ee between Safaa and Marwah (two small hills). And when he reaches the foot of Safaa he reads Allaah ta&#8217;ala&#8217;s saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Innas-safaa wal marwata min sha&#8217;aa&#8217;irillaahi faman hajjal baita &#8216;awi`tamara falaa janaaha &#8216;alaihi an yattawwafa bihimaa wa man tatawwa&#8217;a khiran fa&#8217;innallaaha shaakirun &#8216;aleemun</strong> [Soorat-ul-Baqarah ayah 158]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Behold! Safa and Marwa are among the Symbols of Allah. So if those who visit the House in the Season or at other times should compass them round, it is no sin in them, and if any one obeys his own impulse to good, be sure that Allaah is He Who recognizes and knows.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Nabda&#8217;u bimaa bada&#8217;allaahu bihi<br />
</strong><strong>(We begin with what Allaah began with.)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">48. Then he begins with as-Safaa &#8211; climbing upon it until he can see the Ka&#8217;bah.(53)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">49. Then he faces the Ka&#8217;bah &#8211; and makes tauheed of Allaah and takbeer, saying :(54)</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allaahu akbar allaahu akbar allaahu akbar &#8211; laa illaaha illallahu wahdau laa shareekalahu &#8211; lahul mul ku wa lahul hamdu &#8211; yuheeu wa yumeetu wa huwa &#8216;alaa kulli shai&#8217;in qadeer &#8211; laa ilaaha illallahu wahdahu laa shareekalahu &#8211; anjaza wa&#8217;dahu wa nasara &#8216; abdahu wa hazamal ahzaaba wahdahu</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saying that three times and making du&#8217;aa after each time.(55)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">50. Then he descends for sa&#8217;ee between Safaa and Marwah, as Rasoolullah said : Make sa&#8217;ee as Allah has prescribed sa&#8217;ee for you.(56)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">51. So he walks till he reaches the green sign-post &#8211; on the right and left &#8211; then runs quickly till he reaches the next sign-post. And this place was in the time of the Prophet a dried river bed covered with small stones, and the Prophet said:(57)</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> (The river bed is not crossed except with vigour.) </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he walks up to Marwah and ascends it and does upon it as he did upon as-Safaa &#8211; facing the Qiblah, saying takbeer and tahleel and making du&#8217;aa(58) and that forms one complete circuit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">52. Then he returns till he ascends as-Safaa &#8211; walking in the place for walking, and running in the place for running &#8211; and that is a second circuit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">53. Then he returns to Marwah &#8211; and so on till he completes seven circuits finishing upon Marwah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">54. And it is permissible for him to go between Safaa and Marwah While riding. However the Prophet preferred to walk.(59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">55. And if he makes du&#8217;aa in sa&#8217;ee, saying :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Rabbighfir warham innaka antal a&#8217;azzul akram<br />
</strong>(O lord forgive and have mercy,verily You are the Most Mighty, Most Noble)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">then there is no harm as it is authentically reported from a group of the Salaf.(60)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">56. Then when he finishes from the seventh circuit upon al-Marwah he shortens the hair of his head(61) thus ending the &#8216;Umrah &#8211; and everything that became forbidden to him upon entering iHraam now becomes permissible again &#8211; and he remains in the state of hill (being out of iHraam) until Yaum ut-Tarwiyyah (8th Dhul-Hijjah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">57. And he who made iHraam not intending to make &#8216;Umrah before the Hajj &#8211; and not having brought the hadi (sacrificial animal) from outside sacred precincts then should also leave the state of iHraam in obedience to the Prophet&#8217;s order and in avoidance of his anger. Those, however, who have bought the sacrificial animal with them remain in iHraam and do not leave that state until after the stoning on the Day of Sacrifice (Yaum-un-Nahr) (10th Dhul-Hijjah).</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Ihlaal (Calling Aloud With Tal-Biyyah) For Hajj On Yaum Ut-Tarwiyyah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">58. So when it is Yaum ut-Tarwiyyah and that is the 8th of Dhul Hijjah &#8211; he puts on iHraam and calls out with the talbiyyah of Hajj, and does as he did when assuming iHraam for &#8216;Umrah which he did from the meeqaat &#8211; as regards bathing and putting on perfume, and wearing the ridaa and izaar (upper and lower garments) and reciting talbiyyah &#8211; which he does not cease to do until he has stoned Jamrat ul-Aqaha (on 10th Dhul-Hijjah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">59. And he assumes iHraam form the place he is resident in &#8211; the people resident in Makkah doing so from Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">60. Then he goes off to Minaa and prays there the Zuhr prayer and remains there, spending the night there and praying the rest of the five daily prayers &#8211; shortening them (to two ra&#8217;kahs) but without combining them.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Proceeding To &#8216;Arafah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">61. So after the sun rises on the Day of &#8216;Arafah (10th Dhul-Hijjah) &#8211; he moves off towards &#8216;Arafah (a large plain to the south-east of Makkah), while reciting talbiyyah of takbeer &#8211; as both of these were practised by the Companions of the Prophet while making Hajj with him &#8211; and he did not critize either (those reciting tal-biyyah of those reciting takbeer.) (62)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">62. Then he stops at Namirah (63) &#8211; and it is a place near to &#8216;Arafah but not forming part of it &#8211; and he remains there until noon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">63. So When the sun passes its zenith he moves to &#8216;Uranah and settles there,(64) and it is next to &#8216;Arafah &#8211; and here the Imaam should give an appropriate Khutbah to the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">64. Then he prays with the people Zuhr and &#8216;Asr shortening and combining them in the time of the Zuhr prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">65. And one adhaan is given and two iqaamahs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">66. And he does not pray anything between the two prayers.(65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">67. And he who is not able to pray along with the Imaam &#8211; then he prays them in the same way on his own &#8211; or with those in similar situation around him.(66)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Standing In &#8216;Arafah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">68. Then he goes off to &#8216;Arafah and if able stands upon the rocks beneath the Mount of Mercy (Jabal ur-Rahmah) and if not then all of &#8216;Arafah is place of standing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">69. And he stands facing the Qiblah, raising his hands making du&#8217;aa and reciting talbiyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">70. And he recites much &#8216;La ilaha illallaah&#8217; as it is the best du&#8217;aa on the Day of &#8216;Arafah as the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The best thing that I and the Prophets have said on the evening of &#8216;Arafah is :<br />
<strong>Laa ilaha illallaahu wahdahu laa shareeka lahu lahul mulk wa lahul hamdu wa huwa &#8216;alaa kulli shay&#8217;in qadeer</strong>.(67)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">71. And if he adds in the talbiyyah occasionally (all good is the good of the Hereafter) then that is permissible.(68)</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Innamaal Khairu Khairul Aakhirati</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">72. And it is sunnah for the one standing in &#8216;Arafah not to fast that day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">73. And he remains in that state, remembering Allaah reciting talbiyyah, making du&#8217;aa as he wishes &#8211; hoping from Allaah that He will make him one of those whom He boasts of (those whom He frees from Fire) to the Angels as occurs in the hadith :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;There is no day on which Allaah frees more of His slaves from Fire than the Day of &#8216;Arafah, and He verily draws near then boasts of them before the angles, saying :&#8217;What do they seek?&#8217; &#8220;</strong>(69)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and in another hadith :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Verily Allaah boasts of the people of &#8216;Arafah before the people of heaven (the angels), saying : &#8216;Look to my servants who have come to Me dishevelled and dusty.'&#8221;</strong>(70)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and he remains in that state until the sun sets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Leaving &#8216;Arafah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">74. So when the sun has set he leaves &#8216;Arafah for Muzdalifah &#8211; going with calmness and tranquility, not jostling or pushing the people with himself or his riding beast or his vehicle, rather whenever he finds room then he goes faster.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">75. And when reaching Muzdalifah he gives adhaan and iqaamah then prays the three ra&#8217;kahs of Maghrib, then gives iqaamah and prays &#8216;Ishaa &#8211; shortening it &#8211; and joining the two prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">76. And if he separates the two prayers for some necessity then there is no harm in that.(71)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">77. And he does not pray anything between them or after &#8216;Ishaa.(72)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">78. Then he sleeps until Fajr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">79. Then when the dawn first appears he prays Fajr in the first part of its time with adhaan and iqaamah.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Fajr Prayer In Muzdalifah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">80. And all of the pilgrims pray Fajr prayer in Muzdalifah (a place between &#8216;Arafah and Minaa) except the weak and the women &#8211; it being permissible for them to leave after half of the night has passed for fear of the crush of people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">81. Then he comes to the <strong>Mash&#8217;ar al-Haraam</strong> (a small mountain in Muzdalifah) and climbs upon it and faces the Qiblah &#8211; then recites tahweed,takbeer, tahleel &#8211; and declares Allaah&#8217;s Unity and makes du&#8217;aa until the sky becomes very bright.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">82. And all Muzdalifah is a place of standing &#8211; so wherever he stands then it is permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">83. Then he leaves for Minaa before the sun rises, calmly while reciting talbiyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">84. So when he comes to the river <strong>valley of Mu-Hassir</strong> he hurries if possible &#8211; and it is a part of Minaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">85. Then he takes the middle road which takes him to the Jamrat ul Aqabah.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Stoning (Ar-Ramee)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">86. And he picks up in Minaa stones with which he intends to do the stoning of Jamrat-ul-&#8216;Aqabah &#8211; and it is the last of the Jamraat and the nearest one to Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">87. And he faces the Pillar (Jamrah), having Makkah to his left and Minaa to his right.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">88. Then he stones it with seven small stones, like the Stones of Khadhf &#8211; which are slightly longer than the chick-pea.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">89. And he recites takbeer while throwing each stone.(73)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">90. And he ceases reciting talbiyyah when throwing the last stone.(74)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">91. And he he does not perform this stoning until after sunrise, even the women or weak who were allowed to leave Muzdalifah after half the night, as this is one thing and the stoning is something else.(75)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">92. And he may perform this stoning after noon even up to the night if he finds difficulty in performing this stoning before noon as is established in the hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">93. So when he has stoned the Jamrah everything becomes lawful for him again except women, even if he has not sacrificed or shaved his head &#8211; so he may wear his clothes and use perfume.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">94. However he should perform Tawaaf-ul-Ifaada on the same day (before Maghrib) if he wishes to continue in his state of having left iHraam &#8211; otherwise, if he has not made Tawaaf before the evening (before Maghrib) then he returns to the state of iHraam as he was before the stoning &#8211; so he should remove his clothes and put on iHraam according to the Prophet&#8217;s saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Verily on this day has been allowed for you, when you have stoned the Jamrah, that was prohibited for you except women (sexual intercourse). Verily on this day everything that you were prohibited from (by iHraam) has been allowed for you, when you have stoned the Jamrah, except the women (sexual intercourse) &#8211; so if evening comes upon you before you have made Tawaaf of this House then you revert to the state of iHraam as you were before stoning the Jamrah &#8211; until you make the Tawaaf.</strong> (76)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Sacrifice</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">95. Then he comes to the place of sacrifice in Minaa and sacrifices his animal &#8211; and that is the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">96. However, it is permissible for him to slaughter in any other part of Minaa or Makkah as the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>I have slaughtered here and all of Minaa is a place for slaughtering, and all of the mountain pass approaches, so slaughter on your place of stopping.</strong>(77)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">97. And the Sunnah is to do the dhabh (slaughter by a horizontal cut through the throat) or Nahr (slaughter by a vertical movement of the spear to the lower part of the throat) with own hand if possible, and if not, then to depute someone else to do it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">98. And he should make the animal face the Qiblah when slaughtering(78), making it lie down on its left side and putting his right foot upon its right side.(79)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">99. As for the camel then he should slaughter it by means of Nahr..while it is standing having its left leg tied, standing on its others(80) with its face towards the Qiblah.(81)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">100. And he says when slaughtering:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Bismillaahi Wallaahu Akbar Al-Laahumma Inna Hadha Minka Wa Laka(82) Al Lahumma Taqabbal Minnee(83)<br />
</b>(In the name of Allah and Allah is greater. O Allah this is from You and for You. O Allah accept it from me.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">101. And the time for slaughter is the four days of &#8216;Eid &#8211; Yaum-un-Nahr, and that is called &#8216;Yaum ul-Jajj-ul-Akbar&#8217; (Day of the greatest Hajj)(84) and the three days of Tashreeq, as the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Allthe days of Tashreeq are for sacrifice.&#8221;</strong> (85)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">102. And he may eat from the meat of his sacrificial animal and take some back with him to his land as the Prophet did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">103. And he should give some it to feed the poor and the needy as Allah ta&#8217;ala says:(86)</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(The sacrificial camels We have made for you as among the Symbols from Allah: in them is (much) good for you: then pronounce the name of Allah over them as they line up (for sacrifice): when they are down on their side (after slaughter), eat ye thereof, and feed such as (beg not you) live in contentment and such as beg with due humility.)</strong>[Soorat-ul-Hajj ayah 36]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">104. And seven people may share in one camel or cow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">105. And he who cannot afford a sacrificial animal should fast three days in Hajj and seven when he returns to his family.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">106. And he may fast the three days of Tashreeq according to the hadith of &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah and Ibn &#8216;Umar &#8211; may Allah be pleased with them &#8211; who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;No permission was given for us to fast the days of Tashreeq except for those who could not afford a sacrificial animal.</strong>(87)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">107. Then he shaves all of his hair off or shortens it. &#8211; and the first is better as the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O Allah have mercy on those who save their heads. They (the people) said &#8216;And those who shorten their O Rasoolullah.&#8217; He said: O Allah have mercy on those who save their heads. They said: &#8216;And those who shorten their hair O Rasoolullah&#8217; He added on the fourth time: And those who shorten their hair&#8221;</strong>(88)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">108. And the Sunnah is for the barber to begin with the right side of the head as occurs in the hadith of Anas.(89)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">109. And shaving the hair is just the for men and not for the women &#8211; they have to shorten only as the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;There is no shaving of the hair for women, verily upon women is shortening of the hair.&#8221;</strong>(90)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So she should together her hair and shorten it by the length of a finger-joint.(91)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">110. And it is Sunnah for the Imaam to give a khutbah on the Day of Sacrifice in Minaa(92) between the Jamaraat(93) in the forenoon(94) to teach the people to rites of Hajj.(95)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Tawaaf ul Ifaadah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">111. The he goes off that day to the House and makes Tawaaf &#8211; seven times around &#8211; as has preceeded in the Tawaaf of arrival &#8211; <span style="color:#ff0000;">except that he does not wear iHraam under his right shoulder &#8211; nor does he perform raml</span> in this Tawaaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">112. And it is from the Sunnah to pray two ra&#8217;kahs behind the Station of Ibrahim &#8211; as Az-Zuhree(96) said, and Ibn &#8216;Umar did so(97), and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;For every seven times around there are two ra&#8217;kahs.&#8221;</strong>(98)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">113. Then he walks and runs between Safaa and Marwah as before &#8211; except for one doing Hajj of Qiraan or Ifraad &#8211; the first sa&#8217;ee being enough for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">114. And after this tawaaf everything again becomes lawful for him that became unlawful due to iHraam &#8211; even the woman (sexual intercourse).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">115. And he prays Zuhr at Makkah, and Ibn &#8216;Umar says: At Minaa.(99)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">116. And he comes to Zamzam and drinks from it.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Staying Overnight At Minaa</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">117. Then he returns to Minaa and remians there for the days of Tashreeq and their nights.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">118. And he stones the three Jamaraat with seven small stones in each of those days, after noon, as has preceeded concerning the stoning on the Day of Sacrifice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">119. He begins with the first Jamrah, which is the nearest to <strong>Masjid &#8211; al-Khaif</strong>, and after stoning it he moves onward and stands facing the Qiblah for a long while making du&#8217;aa while raising his hands.(100)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">120. Then he comes to the second Jamarah and stones it in the same way, then he moves to the left and stands for a long while facing the Qiblah making du&#8217;aa while raising his hands.(101)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">121. The he comes to the third Jamarah and it is Jamrat al-Aqabah &#8211; and he stones it in the same way &#8211; standing so that Ka&#8217;bah is to his left and Minaa to his right and does not stand there (making du&#8217;aa) afterwards.(102)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">122. Then on the second day he repeats this stoning and on the third day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">123. An if he leaves after stoning on the second day not remaining for the third day&#8217;s stoning, then that is permissible as Allaah ta&#8217;ala says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Celebrate the praises of Allah during the Appointed Days, but if anyone hastens to leave in two days, there is no blame on him, and if anyone stays on, these is no blame on him if his aim is to do right,) </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However remaining for the third day&#8217;s stoning is better as it is the Sunnah.(103)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">124. And the Sunnah is to do the previous actions of Hajj in order: the stoning, then slaughter, then shaving the head, then Tawaaf of Ifaadah, the Sa&#8217;ee for the one doing Hajj at-Tamattu&#8217;; however if he brings something forward in the order or delays something in the order (doing things out of order) then that is permissible as the Prophet said: &#8220;There is no harm, there is no harm.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">125. And regarding stoning, the following is allowed to those who have a valid excuse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) The permission not to have to spend the night in Minaa according to the hadith of Ibn &#8216;Umar: &#8220;Al &#8216;Abbaas sought permission of Rasoolullah to spend the night of Minaa in Makkah as he was responsible for supplying Zamzam water there, so he gave him the permission.&#8221;(104)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) To combine two days&#8217; stoning in one day, according to the hadith of &#8216;Aasim ibn &#8216;Adiyy who said: &#8220;Rasoolullah made concession for the camel drivers in Bairootah that they could stone on the Day of Sacrifice, the combine two days&#8217; stoning after that &#8211; performing it in one of the two days.&#8221;(105)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(c) To perform the stoning at night as the Prophet said: The shephered may stone at night, then look after his flock in the daytime.(106)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">126. And it is lawful for him to visit the Ka&#8217;bah and make Tawaaf during each of the nights of Minaa as the Prophet did so.(107)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">127. And the pilgrim during the Days of Minaa must take care to pray the five daily prayers with the congregation &#8211; and it is best to pray the Masjid of Khaif if he is able to, as the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Seventy Prophets have prayed in the Masjid of Khaif</strong>.</span>(108)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">128. So after completing the stoning on the second day or third day of the days of Tashreeq &#8211; then he has completed the rites of Hajj and therefore returns to Makkah &#8211; and remains there for as long as Allaah has written for him to remain &#8211; and he should take care to perform the prayer with the congregation &#8211; especially in the Masjid-ul-Haraam, and <strong>a single prayer in the Masjid-ul-Haraam is better than a hundred thousand prayers in other mosques</strong>.(109)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">129. And he should perform much of prayer and Tawaaf at any time he pleases of the day or night as the Prophet said about the two corners &#8211; the Black Stone and Yemeni corner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Touching them takes away sins, and he who performs Tawaaf does not raise or lower his foot (while walking) except that Allaah writes it for him as a good deed, and wipes off bad deed for him, and writes for him an extra rank and whoever does it even times round [check Sharh of at-Tirmidhee] it is as if he had freed a slave.&#8221;</strong>(110)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;&#8221;O tribe of &#8216;Abd Manaaf! Do not prevent anyone from making Tawaaf of this house or from prayer at any hour of the day or night he pleases.&#8221;&#8221;</strong>(111)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Farewell Tawaaf (Tawaaf ul Wadaa)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">130. So when he has finished all that he has to do and has decided to travel then he has to make a farewell Tawaaf of the house, as Ibn &#8216;Abbas narrated: &#8216;The people used to head off in every direction so the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;None of you should depart until he makes as his last act Tawaaf of the House.&#8221;</strong>(112)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">131. And the menstruating woman was at first ordered to wait until she became clean of it in order to make Tawaaf ul Wadaa'(113) then it was permitted for her to leave without waiting according to the hadith of Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;That the Prophet gave concession for the menstruating women that she should depart before (Farewell) Tawaaf as long as she had made Tawaaf of Ifaadah.&#8221;</strong> (114)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">132. And he may carry away with him whatever he can of Zamzam water because of the blessing therein, as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Rasoolullah used to carry it with him in water skins and containers &#8211; and he used to pour (it) upon the sick and give it to them to drink.&#8221;</strong></span>(115)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Before Makkah was conquered he used to send the message to Suhail ibn &#8216;Amr: that he should bring Zamzam water for us and not leave it &#8211; so he would send to him two large bag fulls.&#8221;</strong>(116)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">133. So when he finishes the Tawaaf he leaves the mosque like the rest of the people &#8211; not walking backwards &#8211; and he leaves putting out his left foot first(117), saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Allaahuma salli &#8216;alla muhammadin wa sallim &#8211; allaahumma innee &#8216;as&#8217;aluka min fadhlika<br />
</b>(O Allaah send blessings and peace upon Muhammad. O Allaah I ask You for Your bounty.)</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><b>PREFACE</b></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dear pilgrim brothers and sisters,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Assalamu alaikumwa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu. </i>Congratulations and welcome on your arrival at these sacred precincts, on this blessed journey as guests of Allah, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This brief but comprehensive Guide is presented to you to outline the obligatory rites of <i>Hajj </i>and <i>&#8216;umrah </i>with which you ought to be familiar. It begins with some important advice. This advice is, first of all, for ourselves, and then it is offered to you in accordance with what Allah, the Most High, says concerning those of His servants who receive salvation and success in this world and the Hereafter: &#8220;They counsel each other of the truth and counsel each other of patience.&#8221; It is further to put into practice His saying: &#8220;Cooperate with each other in goodness and fear of Allah, and do not cooperate in sin and transgression.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask you to read this booklet before you begin the rites of <i>Hajj </i>in order that you may acquaint yourself with what is to be done. You will f Ind in It answers to many of your questions. We hope that you will keep this booklet with you as a reference for this year, and possibly for later years as well if It Is Allah&#8217;s will that you return again for <i>Hajj.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask you to share this booklet with other Muslims in order that they may also benefit from reading its contents. We ask Allah to accept from all of us our <i>Hajj, </i>our striving, and our good deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Wassalamu &#8216;alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu.</i></p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;">IMPORTANT ADVICE</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dear pilgrims, we praise Allah for having guided you to the <em>hajj</em> of His House and to the visit of the Sacred Precincts. May He accept from all of us our good deeds and increase His reward for us and for you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following advice is being offered to you in the hope that Allah will accept from all of us our hajj and our striving.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Remember that you are on a blessed journey. This journey, which is a migration toward Allah, is based on belief in His Unity <i>(tawheed), on </i>sincerity toward Him, on responding to His call, and on obedience to His commands. There is no greater reward than that of a <em>hajj</em> which<i> is </i>acceptable to Allah Ta&#8217;alah-the reward of the Garden of Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Be on your guard against the mischief of Satan, who intends to cause dissension among you. Love each other as brothers and avoid disputes and disobedience to Allah. Know that the Messenger of Allah (may peace and blessings of Allah be on him) said, &#8220;<strong>None of you has truly believed unless he likes for his brother what the likes for himself</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Whenever you have a question concerning religious matters or concerning the <i>hajj, </i>ask knowledgeable Muslims until you receive a satisfactory answer. This is in accordance with what Allah has said: &#8221; <strong>If you realize this not, ask of those who possess The Message</strong>.&#8221; it is also in accordance with what the Prophet (peace be on him) has said. &#8220;<strong>When Allah intends good for someone, He gives him understanding of the religion</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Know that Allah has made certain acts <i>fard </i>(obligatory) and other acts <i>sunnah </i>(according to the practice of the Prophet, peace be on him). Allah does not accept a <i>sunnah </i>which violates some fard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some pilgrims ignore this fact when they harm believing men and women in their zeal to kiss the <i>Black Stone, </i>to hasten in their circuits around the K&#8217;abah, to make <i>salah </i>behind the Station of lbraheem, to drink from Zamzam,.and similar practices. These practices are <i>sunnah. </i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>To </i>harm any believer in doing them is <i>haram </i>(prohibited). How is it possible to carry out a <i>sunnah </i>observance while doing a <i>haram </i>deed? Therefore, avoid hurting each other, and Allah will grant you His mercy and will increase your reward.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>We would also like to emphasize the following:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) It is not fitting that a Muslim man performs his Salat next to, or behind a woman in the holy Mosque or at any other place if it is at all possible to avoid doing so. Women should pray behind men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) The doors and entrances to the holy Mosque are for traffic and should not be blocked by people praying there, even though if it is to join the congregational prayer that may be in progress.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(c) It is not permissible to block the free flow of people around the K&#8217;abah by sitting near the K&#8217;abah, by praying near it, or by standing near the Black Stone, or al-Hijr or at the Station of lbraheem, especially when the place is crowded, as this is a source of harm to other people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(d) While safeguarding the dignity of Muslims is a <i>fard, </i>kissing the Black Stone is a <i>sunnah. A fard </i>cannot be sacrificed for a <i>sunnah. </i>When the area is crowded, it is sufficient to point to the Black Stone, saying <i>&#8220;Allahu akbar.&#8221; </i>and to continue to move with the flow of people without causing a break in the lines. indeed, keeping an easy flow during circuits is the most commendable thing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(e) It is not a sunnah to kiss the Yamani corner, but to touch it with the right hand, if it is not overcrowded, and say: <i>&#8220;Bismillahi w</i>al-lahu <i>akbar. &#8221; But </i>if it is difficult to touch it, then move on, do not point to it with your hand, or say <i>takbir. </i>For it is not reported of the Prophet. It is mustahabb (good) to recite the following supplication in between the Yamani corner and the Black Stone:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">رَبَّنَا آتِنَا فِي الدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةً وَفِي الآخِرَةِ حَسَنَةً وَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>&#8220;Rabbana atina fid-donya hasanatan wa fil- akhirati hasanatan wa qina adhaban-nar&#8221;.</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally, the best advice we can give you is that you follow the Book of Allah and the <i>sunnah</i><b><i> </i></b>of His Messenger (peace be on him) in all what you do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Obey Allah and the Messenger in order that you may receive mercy.&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><b>VIOLATIONS OF ISLAM</b></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Brother and sister Muslim, you must be aware that there are matters which nullify your Islam. We will mention here the ten most common violations. Please be mindful of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The First</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Associating partners with Allah (shirk). Allah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>Truly, if anyone associates partners with Allah, Allah will forbid him the garden and his abode will be the Fire; the wrongdoers will have no helpers</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Calling upon the dead, asking their help, or offering them gifts or sacrifices are all forms of <i>shirk.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Second</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Setting up intermediaries between oneself and Allah, making supplication to them, asking their intercession with Allah, and placing one&#8217;s trust in them is unbelief (kufr).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Third</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who does not consider polytheists <i>(mushrikeen)</i> to be unbelievers, or who has doubts concerning their unbelief, or considers their way to be correct, is himself an unbeliever (kafir).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Fourth</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who believes any guidance other than the Prophet&#8217;s guidance to be more perfect, or a decision other than the Prophet&#8217;s decision to be better, is an unbeliever. This applies to those who prefer the rule of <i>Evil (Taghout) </i>to the Prophet&#8217;s rule. Some examples of this are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) To believe that systems and laws made by human beings are better than the <i>Shari&#8217;ah </i>of Islam; for example,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that the Islamic system is not suitable for the twentieth century.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that Islam is the cause of the backwardness of Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or that Islam is a relationship between Allah and the Muslim. It should not interfere in other aspects of life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) To say that enforcing the punishments prescribed by Allah, such as cutting off the hand of a thief or stoning an adulterer, is not suitable in this day and age.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(c) To believe that it is permissible to give a rule from that which Allah did not reveal in Islamic transactions or matters of law, punishments or other affairs. Although one may not believe such rulings to be superior to the <i>Shari&#8217;ah </i>he in effect affirms such a stand by declaring a thing which Allah has totally prohibited, such as adultery, drinking alcohol or usury, to be permissible. According to the consensus of Muslims, one who declares such things to be permissible is an unbeliever (kafir).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Fifth</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who hates any part of what the Messenger of Allah (may peace and blessings of Allah be on him) has declared to be lawful has nullified his lslam, even though he may act in accordance with it. Allah the Most High, says: &#8220;<strong>Because they disliked what Allah has revealed. their deeds are brought to nothing</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Sixth</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who ridicules any aspect of the religion of the Messenger of Allah (peace be on him), or any of its rewards or punishments, becomes an unbeliever. Allah. the Most High, says: &#8220;<strong>Say: Do you ridicule Allah, His revelations and His Messenger? Make no excuse; you have disbelieved after your (profession of) faith&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>The Seventh</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The practice of magic included in this is causing a rift between a husband and wife by turning his love for her into hatred, or tempting a person to do things he dislikes by using black arts. One who engages in such a thing or is pleased with it is outside the pale of Islam. Allah the Most High, says, &#8220;<strong>The two (angels, Harut and Marut) did not teach anyone (magic) without warning them, &#8216;Indeed. we are a trial; then do not disbelieve.</strong>&#8220;&#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The <i>Eighth</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Supporting and aiding polytheists against the Muslims. Allah the Most High, says: &#8220;<strong>The one from among you who supports them belongs to them. Truly. Allah does not guide the people who do wrong</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>The Ninth</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who believes that some people are permitted to deviate from the <i>Shari&#8217;ah of </i>Muhammad (peace be on him) is an unbeliever by the word of Allah, the Most High: &#8220;<strong>If anyone seeks a religion other than al-Islam it will not be accepted from him, and in the Hereafter he will by among the losers&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>The Tenth</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To turn completely away from the religion of Allah, neither learning its precepts nor acting upon it. Allah the Most High, says: &#8220;<strong>Who does greater wrong than the one who is reminded of the revelations of his Lord and turns away from them. Truly, We shall recompense the guilty</strong>,&#8221; and He also says: &#8220;<strong>But those who disbelieve turn away from that about which they are warned</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It makes no difference whether such violations are committed as a joke, in seriousness or out of fear, except when they are done under compulsion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We seek refuge in Allah from such deeds as entail His wrath and severe punishment.<b> </b></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Brother and sister Muslims:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are three ways of performing the hajj:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Hajj </i>al-tamatt&#8217;u (interrupted)<br />
<i>Haii </i>al-qiran (combined)<br />
<i>Haii al- ifrad </i>(single)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><i>Hajj al-Tamatt&#8217;u</i></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means entering into ihram for the &#8216;umrah during the months of <i>Haji, </i>i.e., the months of Shawwal, Dhul-Q&#8217;idah and the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah; to take off ihram after performing the &#8216;umrah; and then to take ihram again for the hajj from Makkah on the 8th day of Dhul-Hijjah during the same year in which the &#8216;umrah was performed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><i>Hajj al-Qiran</i></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This denotes entering into ihram for both the &#8216;umrah and the hajj at the same time, not taking off the ihram until the Day of Sacrifice (the 10th of Dhul-Hijjah). Alternatively, one may first enter into <i>ihram </i>for the <i>&#8216;umrah, </i>and before beginning one&#8217;s tawaf may make the intention of <i>ihram </i>for the <i>hajj </i>as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><i>Hajj al-lfrad</i></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This signifies donning <i>ihram</i> for the <i>hajj </i>either from the prescribed Station of <i>lhram (al-miqat), </i>from Makka if one resides there, or from a place in between al-migat and Makkah in the event that one has brought a sacrificial animal with him, and to remain in <i>ihram </i>until the Day of Sacrifice. If one has not brought an animal for sacrifice, he is required to come out of <i>ihram </i>after performing <i>&#8216;umrah; </i>that is, he makes the (Sa&#8217;ye)&#8221;around the K&#8217;abah (tawaf), performs the (Sa&#8217;ye) the running between Safa and Marwah. cuts some of his hair and then comes out of <i>ihram, </i>resuming his usual clothing and state. This is what the, Prophet (peace be on him) prescribed for those people who had entered into <i>ihram</i> for the hajj without bringing a sacrificial animal; they then re-entered into ihram on the 8th of Dhul-Hijjah. The same applies to a person who is performing hajj al-qiran in the event that he has not brought with him an animal to sacrifice; it is required that he comes out of ihram after the &#8216;umrah, as described above.<b> </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE PERFORMANCE OF &#8216;UMRAH</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. When you reach the prescribed Station (<b>al-miqat</b>), make ghusl (a shower or full washing of the whole body), use perfume if available, and then put on the two-piece garment of <b>ihram </b>( izar and rida ), which preferably should be of white cloth. This applies to men only. A woman also makes ghusl but she does not use make up, and she may wear any clothes she has available as long as they do not display her adornments; she should be completely covered except for her face and hands. Then make your <b>intention</b> to perform &#8216;Umrah by saying; Labbayka &#8216;Umrah, or: Labbayk Allahumma Umrah, as follows:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><i>Labbayk, Allahumma. Labbayk</i></td>
<td>Here I am at Your service. O Lord, here I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>Labbayk. La shareeka laka. Labbayk.</i></td>
<td>Here I am. No partner do You have. Here I am,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>lnnal-hamda wan-n &#8216;imata laka wal- mulk.</i></td>
<td>Truly, the praise and the favor is Yours, and the dominion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>La shareeka lak&#8217;</i></td>
<td>No partner do You have</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Men should utter this aloud while women should say it silently. Repeat this <b>talbiyyah</b> frequently, and engage in the praise of Allah, in supplications for forgiveness, and in the enjoining of what is good and forbidding of what is evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. When you reach Makkah, make seven circuits <i>(<b>Tawaf</b>) </i>around the K&#8217;abah, beginning at the <b>Black Stone</b> with <b><i>t</i></b><b><i>akbir</i></b> (utterances of <i>&#8220;<b>Allahu akbar&#8217;</b>) </i>and ending each at the same place. While making your <i>(Tawaf) you </i>may praise Allah and make supplications to Him in any words you please. it is preferable to end each with the words.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b><i>&#8220;Rabbana, atina fid-dunya hasanatan wa fil-akhirati hasanstan wa qina adhaban-nar.&#8221;<br />
</i></b>(Our Lord, give us good in this world and good in the Hereafter. and save us from the punishment of the Fire.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After completing the seventh cirucit, pray <b>two <i>rak&#8217;ats</i></b> behind the <b>Station of Ibraheem <i>(Maqam lbraheem)</i></b><i> if </i>It is possible, even though you may be a little far from it. Otherwise at any other place within the Sacred Mosque.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. You then go to <b>as-safa</b> and climb on it. Facing the K&#8217;abah, praise Allah, raising your hands, say <i>takbir (&#8221;Allahu akbar&#8221;) </i>three times. Then make supplication to Allah, repeating your supplication three times as this is the <i>sunnah. </i>Then say</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b><i>&#8220;La ilaha illal- Lah, wahdahu La sharika La. &#8221;<br />
</i></b><em><strong>Lahul-mulk wa Iahul-hamd, wa huwa &#8216;ala kulli Shayin qadeer&#8221;.</strong></em><br />
<b><i>&#8220;La illahe illal-lah, wahdahu. Anjaza wadahu Wanasara abdahu wa hazama alahzab wahdahu. &#8220;</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(There is no deity except Allah, the One without a partner.<br />
His is the dominion and His is the praise. and He is powerful over everything.<br />
There is no deity except Allah, completed His promise, supported His Slave and defeated the parties Alone.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is preferable to utter this supplication three times but there is no harm in saying it less than three times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You then descend from as-Safa and do the sa&#8217;ye of the umrah seven times. Increase your pace between the green posts, but walk at a normal pace before and after them. When you climb on the Marwah, praise Allah and do as you did at as-Safa, repeating your supplications, if you can conveniently do so, three times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are no required formulas or supplications for tawaf and sa&#8217;ye. It is up to the worshipper to praise Allah or supplicate Him in his own words, or he may recite portions of the Our&#8217;an, with due regard to the supplications which the Prophet (peace be on him) recited during the performance of these rites.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. After sa&#8217;ye end your &#8216;umrah by shaving or shortening your hair. After this, the prohibitions pertaining to the state of ihram are lifted and you may now resume your normal life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you are doing hajj al-tamatt&#8217;u the sacrifice of a sheep or the seventh part of a camel or a cow becomes obligatory for you on the Day of Sacrifice (the 10th of Dhul-Hijjah) .If you cannot afford this sacrifice, it is obligatory for you to fast ten days, three of them during the hajj and seven after returning home.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you are performing hajj al-tamatt&#8217;u or hajj al-qiran, it is preferable to fast these three days before the Day of &#8216;Arafat (the 9th of Dhul-Hijjah).<b> </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE PERFORMANCE OF HAJJ</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. If you are performing hajj al-ifrad or hajj al-qiran (i.e., hajj combined with &#8216;umrah), you enter into ihram at the &#8216;station of ihram (al-miqat) through which you pass on your way to Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you do not pass through any Station of ihram on your way to Makkah, you enter into ihram from your residence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you are performing <i>hajj </i>al-tamatt&#8217;u (the interrupted <i>haii), you </i>enter into ihram for hajj from your residence in Makkah on the 8th of Dhul-Hijjah. Perform ghusl (shower or washing of the entire body), perfume yourself if possible, and put on the two garments of ihram. This applies to men. Women likewise perform ghusl but are not to use perfume. They may wear any suitable clothes they have as long as they do not show their adornments and cover every part of their bodies excepting the hands and face. For woman, if she is in the presence of other men who are not her immediate relatives like her husband, father, brother or son then she should cover her face. After putting on ihram make your niyyah (intention) by Saying: <i>Labbayk Hajjan </i>then recite <i>talbiyyah</i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>&#8220;Labbayk, Allahumma. Labbayk.<br />
Labbayk. La shareeka laka. Labbayk.<br />
lnnal-hamda wan-n&#8217;imata laka wal-mulk. La shareeka lak&#8217;.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(Here I am at Your service, O Lord, here I am. No partner do You have. Here Iam. Truly, the praise and the favor is Yours, and the dominion. No partner do You have.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. You then go to Mina, where you pray the Dhuhr, &#8216;Asr, Maghrib, &#8216;Isha and Fajr prayers at their proper times, shortening prayers of four rak&#8217;as to two rak&#8217;as. Do not combine these prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. When the sun has risen on the 9th of Dhul-Hijjah, proceed toward &#8216;Arafat in a dignified manner and without harming your fellow pilgrims. At&#8217;Arafat, pray the Dhuhr and &#8216;Asr prayers, shortened and combined during the time of Dhuhr with one adhan and two iqamahs</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Make sure that you are within the boundaries of &#8216;Arafat. Stay within the boundaries of &#8216;Arafat, except the valley of Oranah, reciting the praise of Allah the Most High, and offering supplications facing qiblah with upraised hands, as was the practice of Prophet Muhammad (may peace and blessings of Allah be on him). Remain at &#8216;Arafat until after sunset.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. When the sun has set, proceed toward Muzdalifah in a peaceful and dignified manner, reciting <i>talbiyyah. </i>Do not harm or cause any discomfort to your fellow Muslims. When you arrive at Muzdalifah, pray the <i>Maghrib </i>and <i>&#8216;lsha </i>prayers combined, shortening <i>&#8216;Isha </i>to two <i>rak&#8217;ats. </i>Stay at Muzdalifah until you have prayed the <i>Fair </i>prayer. Then wait until the brightness of the morning is wide spread, supplicate facing <i>qiblah </i>with upraised hands, following the practice of the Prophet (peace be on him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For women or weak individuals, it is permissible to proceed to Mina at any time after midnight.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Muzdalifah, pick up only seven pebbles to throw at the Stone Pillar of &#8216;Aqabah. Other pebbles can be picked up at Mina. There is no harm even if the seven pebbles to be thrown at the Stone Pillar of &#8216;Aqabah are also picked up at Mina.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. When you arrive at Mina, do the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) At the Stone Pillar of &#8216;Aqabah (this is the pillar nearest to Makkah) throw the seven pebbles one after the other, saying <i>&#8220;Allahu akbar&#8221; </i>at each throw.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) If you are required to sacrifice, slaughter your sacrificial animal. You are to eat some of its meat and distribute the major part of it to the needy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(c) Shave your head or cut some hair from it. Shaving is preferable for men, while for women the length of hair to be cut is that of a fingertip.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above-mentioned order of doing things is preferred, however, if they are done in some other order, there is no harm in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After you have thrown the pebbles and shaved or cut some of your hair, the prohibitions of <i>ihram </i>are lifted, excepting the prohibition of sexual intercourse with your spouse. This is the first <strong>tahallul</strong>, i.e., returning to one&#8217;s normal state. You are now to wear your usual clothes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. Then you go to Makkah and perform the tawaf al-ifadah (the tawaf which is an essential part of the Hajj). If you are doing hajj al-tamatt&#8217;u, you also perform sa&#8217;ye. If you are performing hajj al- ifrad or hajj al-qiran and you did not perform sa&#8217;ye with tawaf al- qudum (the Tawaf of Arrival), you must do sa&#8217;ye now. After this, the prohibition of marital relations is also lifted and you return to a completely normal life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible to delay the tawaf al-ifadah until the days spent at Mina are over, going to Makkah for this tawaf after all three Pillars have been stoned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. After performing your tawaf al-ifadah on the Day of Sacrifice, return to Mina and spend there the nights preceding the 11th, 12th and 13th days of Dhul-Hijjah (the three days following the Day of Sacrifice which are known as ayyamu-tashreeq. It is however, permissible to spend only two nights in Mina instead of three.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. At any time in the afternoon of each of the two or three days of your stay in Mina, stone each of the three Pillars, starting with the first Pillar( i.e., the one which is farthest from Makkah), followed by the middle Pillar and lastly the Pillar of &#8216;Aqabah. Throw seven pebbles, one by one, at each of these Pillars, saying <i>&#8220;Allahu </i>akbar&#8221; at each throw.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you stay in Mina for only two days, you must leave Mina before the sun sets on the second day. if the sun should set before you are able to depart, remain in Mina for the third night and throw pebbles again the next day. In any case, it is preferable to remain in Mina for three nights.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible for the sick and the weak to appoint a proxy to throw their pebbles. The proxy first throws his own pebbles, followed by the pebbles of the person he represents while at the same pillar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. If you decide to return to your Country after completing the rites of <i>hajj, you </i>perform the Farewell Tawaf (tawaf al-wida &#8216; ) before leaving Makkah. No one is excused from this except women who are menstruating or in the period of discharge following childbirth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>OBLIGATIONS DURING IHRAM</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the state of <i>ihram </i>for <i>hajj </i>or &#8216;Umrah, the following are obligatory;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. To faithfully observe all that Allah has made obligatory, such as the daily prayers at their proper times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. To avoid what Allah has prohibited, such as wrongdoing, quarreling and committing sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. To guard against injuring the Muslims by deed or by word.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. To abstain from what is prohibited during <i>ihram, </i>namely:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) Do not cut your nails or pull out hair. There is no blame on you if these break or come off by themselves without your intending it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) Do not use scent, whether on the clothes or on the body, or in food or drink. There is no harm if the effect of scent applied before putting on ihram remains.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(c) Do not kill, frighten or assist in hunting any land game as long as you are in ihram.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(d) Within the precincts of al-Haram no one, in the state of ihram or not, is allowed to cut trees, pluck vegetables or collect a lost property except for the sake of identifying it for its owner. For the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(e) Do not propose to a woman or contract marriage either for yourself or on behalf of others. Sexual intercourse is prohibited too, so is touching the apposite sex with desire. All these actions are-prohibited during the period of ihram.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All these prohibitions apply equally to men and women alike.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In particular</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man may not put any covering on his head. However, the shade of an umbrella or the roof of a car is permissible. There is no harm in carrying something on the head.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man may not wear a shirt or anything else which is sewn, such as a burnoose, turban, trousers, <i>khuff </i>(short, thin boot), on the whole or a part of his body. However, if an <i>izar </i>(one of the two garments of <i>ihram, </i>worn on the lower part of the body) is not available, trousers may be worn, and if sandals are not available <i>khuff </i>may be worn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is forbidden for a woman to wear gloves on her hands or to cover her face with a face-veil <i>(niqab) </i>or <i>burqa </i>(drape) during the state of <i>ihram. </i>However, if male strangers are around her, she should conceal her face with her head-covering or something similar. These rules apply until she comes out of <i>ihram</i><i>..</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a person wears a sewn garment or covers his head (for men), uses perfume, pulls out some hairs, or cuts his nails through forgetfulness or due to ignorance, there is no <i>fidyah </i>(expiation) for him. He should stop doing such things as soon as he remembers or is reminded of then.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible to wear sandals, a ring, a pair of glasses, a hearing aid, a wrist watch, and a belt or a girdle which protects one&#8217;s money or documents.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible to change one&#8217;s clothes and to wash them, as well as to wash one&#8217;s hair and body, and it does not matter if some hair inadvertently falls out during washing.<b> </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>VISITATION OF THE PROPHET&#8217;S MOSQUE</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Going to Madinah at any time with the intention of visiting the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque is a sunnah, as is performing <i>salah </i>in it, According to a <i>hadith of the Prophet </i>(may peace and blessing of Allah be on him). A salah performed in the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque is better than a thousand salats in any other place excepting the Sacred Mosque (Masjid al-Haram) in Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. There is no <i>ihram</i> nor <i>talbiyah </i>for the visit to the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque, and it should be emphasized that there is no connection whatsoever between this visit and the <i>hajj.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. When you enter the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque, enter with your right foot first, saying the name of Allah the Most High, and invoking blessings on His Prophet (may His peace and blessings be on him), and ask Allah to open the gates of His mercy for you. The recommended words for entering any mosque, including the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque, are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;A&#8217;udhu billahil-adheem wa wajhi hil-kareem wa sultanihil- qadeem mina &#8211; shaytani-rajeem. Allahhumma, iftah li abwaba rahmattk.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(I seek refuge in Allah the Al-mighty, and in His noble countenance and in His eternal power, from Satan the Rejected. 0 Allah, open to me the doors of Your mercy.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Perform two <i>rak&#8217;ats </i>of <i>tahiyyat al-masjid </i>(the <i>salat </i>of &#8220;greeting of the mosque&#8221;) after entering the Mosque, preferably in the <i>Rawdah </i>or otherwise anywhere else in the Mosque.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Then go to the grave of the Prophet (may the peace and blessing of Allah be on him), and standing in front of it and facing it, say in a respectful and hushed voice:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>&#8220;Assalamu &#8216;alaika, ayyuhan-nabiyya wa rahmat al lahi wa barakatuhu. &#8221;<br />
</i><em>(Peace be on you, O Prophet, and the mercy and blessings of Allah), </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and call for the blessings of Allah on him. There is no harm if you add:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8220;Allahumma, atihil-waseelata wal-fadeelata wab-&#8216;athul-maqamal-mahmoudal-ladhee wa-adtahu. Allahumma, ajzih &#8216;an ummatihi afdalal- jaza&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(O Lord, give him the right (of intercession) and the favor, and raise him to the praiseworthy station which you promised to him.O Allah, reward him on behalf of his ummah (people) with the best of rewards.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then move a little to the right to stand before the grave of Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him). Greet him and supplicate Allah to bestow His mercy and forgiveness on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Again move a little to the right to stand before the grave of &#8216;Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), and greet him and make supplication for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. It is sunnah to have (Taharah), and visit the Mosque of Quba and offer salat in it, as the Prophet (peace be on him) prayed there and encouraged others to do the same.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. It is sunnah to visit the graves of al-Baqe&#8217;e cemetery, and the grave of Uthman (May Allah be pleased with him) and the martyrs of &#8216;Uhud, and the grave of Hamzah (May Allah be pleased with them.); to greet them and to pray for the mercy of Allah upon them. The Prophet (peace be upon him) used to visit all these graves and pray for the souls of those who were buried there. He taught his companions when visiting graves to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>&#8220;Assalamu &#8216;alaikum, ahlal-diyar minal-mu&#8217;mineen wal-muslimeen,<br />
wa inna insha-Allah bikum lahiqoon.<br />
Nasalal-laha lans wa lakumul-&#8216;afiyah.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(Peace be on you, O dwellers of this place from among the Believers and the Muslims,<br />
and we <i>will insha-&#8216;Allah </i>join you.<br />
We ask Allah for security (from the Fire of Hell) for ourselves and for you.)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(Reported by Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to the <i>Shari&#8217;ah </i>besides the mosques and other places mentioned above, there are no other mosques or places in Madinah which are to be visited. Therefore, do not burden yourself by visiting places for which there is no reward or for which, in fact, there might be some blame for doing so. And Allah is the source of guidance.<b> </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>ERRORS OFTEN COMMITTED BY PILGRIMS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>First: Errors Related to lhram</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some pilgrims bypass the designated Station of <i>lhram </i>on their route without either being in <i>ihram </i>or entering into <i>ihram </i>there, proceeding until they reach Jeddah or some other place within the precincts of the Stations, at which they enter into <i>ihram. </i>This is against the command of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be on him), which stipulates that every pilgrim should enter into <i>ihram</i> at the Station of <i>ihram </i>which lies on his route.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this happens to someone, he must either go back to the Station of ihram lying on his route and there enter into ihram, or he must make expiation by sacrificing a sheep in Makkah and feeding all its meat to the poor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This applies to all pilgrims regardless of whether one passes the Station of ihram by air, by sea or by land.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one did not pass through one of the five designated Stations of lhram, he should enter into ihram at a point which is nearest to the Station of ihram on his route.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Second: Errors Related to Tawaf</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Starting the tawaf at some point other than the site of the Black Stone, while it is obligatory to begin tawaf from the Black Stone</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Doing one&#8217;s tawaf inside the Hijr of lsma&#8217;il, which means going around a portion of the K&#8217;abah rather than the whole of it since the Hijr of Isma&#8217;il is a part of the K&#8217;abah which would then be left out of tawaf<b>. </b>Such a tawaf is invalid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Doing ramal (i.e., taking quick short steps) during alI seven circuits while ramal is to be done only during the first three of the Tawaf of Arrival (tawaf <i>al-qudum).</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Struggling vehemently to kiss the Black Stone in this process and hitting or pushing people. Such acts, which are injurious to Muslims, are not permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It should be noted that the tawaf remains perfectly valid without kissing the Black Stone. If one does not or cannot kiss the Black Stone. it is sufficient simply to point to it, saying &#8220;Allahu <i>akbar&#8221; when </i>one comes parallel to it, although one may be at a distance from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Wiping one&#8217;s hand over the Black Stone, seeking &#8220;blessings&#8221; <i>(barakah) thereby </i>is an innovation <i>(bid&#8217;a) </i>with no basis in the <i>Shari&#8217;ah </i>of Islam. The <i>sunnah is </i>to touch it or kiss it only when it can be done easily.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. Touching the four corners of K&#8217;abah or its walls, and wiping one&#8217;s hands against them. The Prophet (peace be on him) did not touch any part of K&#8217;abah except the Black Stone and the Yemeni Corner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. Saying specific formulas of supplications reserved for each circuit. The Prophet (peace be on him) did not specify any supplications except to say &#8220;Allahu <i>akbar&#8221; </i><i>when when </i>he reached the Black Stone and, at the end of each circuit between the Yamani Corner and the Black Stone, he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b><i>&#8220;Rabbana, </i>atina&#8217; <i>fid-dunya hasanatan wa fil-akhirati hasana wa qina adhaban-nar. &#8221;<br />
</i></b>(Our Lord, give us good in this world and good in the Hereafter and save us from the punishment of the Fire.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. Raising one&#8217;s voice above the voices of others; whether in following or leading the tawaf as it causes confusion among the worshippers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. Struggling to pray at the Station of lbraheem. This is contrary to the <i>sunnah, </i>besides being injurious to other worshippers. it is sufficient to pray the two <i>rak&#8217;ats of tawaf </i>after completing one&#8217;s tawaf anywhere within the Sacred Mosque.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Third: Errors Related to Sa&#8217;ye</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. When climbing upon Safa and Marwah, some pilgrims face the K&#8217;abah and gesticulate toward it with their hand while saying <i>&#8220;Allahu akbar&#8221; </i>as if they were saying <i>takbir for </i>salat salat. This gesticulating is an error because the Prophet (peace be on him) raised his palms only for supplication. Here you may glorify and magnify Allah the Most High, supplicating Him in any words you wish while facing the direction of the K&#8217;abah. It is preferable to recite the <i>dhikr</i> which the Prophet (peace be on him) recited at Safa and Marwah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Accelerating one&#8217;s pace throughout the entire distance between the two hills. The <i>sunnah </i>is to accelerate one&#8217;s pace only between the two green posts, while walking at normal pace the remainder of the way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Fourth: Errors Related to &#8216;Arafat</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Some pilgrims camp outside the boundaries of &#8216;Arafat and remain there until the sun has set; then they depart for Muzdalifah without standing at &#8216;Arafat properly. This is a serious error which invalidates their hajj since standing in Arafat is the essence of <i>haji, </i>and it is obligatory to be within its boundaries and not outside them, if it is not easy to do that, they may enter before sunset and remain there until sunset. It is quite acceptable to stand in Arafat during the night of sacrifice in particular.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Departing from &#8216;Arafat before the sun has set is not permissible, because the messenger of Allah (peace be on him) stayed at &#8216;Arafat until the sun had set completely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Struggling through crowds in order to climb Mount &#8216;Arafat is not permissible, because it causes much harm and injury to others. The entire Plain of &#8216;Arafat is a place of standing, and neither climbing Mount &#8216;Arafat nor making <i>salah </i>there has been recommended.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Making supplications facing Mount &#8216;Arafat is incorrect because the <i>sunnah </i>is to face <i>qiblah while </i>making supplication.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Making heaps of earth or pebbles: during the day of &#8216;Arafat, at particular places, by some people, has no bases in the <i>Shariah of </i>Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Fifth: Errors Related to Muzdalifah</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some pilgrims start collecting <i>pebbles to </i>throw at the Stone Pillars in Mina as soon as they arrive in Muzdalifah prior to praying the <i>Maghrib and </i>&#8216;lsha prayers. This is not correct. Nor is the practice that ail the pebbles must be collected at Muzdalifah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The correct position is that the pebbles can be collected anywhere within the boundaries of al-Haram (the territory or precincts of Makkah ). It is known that the Prophet (peace be on him) did not ask that the pebbles for Jamratul Aqabah be picked up for him from Muzdalifa. They were picked up for him, in the Morning, after leaving Muzdalifa and on entering Mina. The rest of the pebbles were picked up for him, from Mina too. Some pilgrims wash the pebbles, but this is not recommended.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#993300;">Error Related to Throwing the Pebbles</span><i><br />
</i></b><br />
1. Some pilgrims are under the impression that when they are throwing pebbles at the Stone Pillars, they are actually throwing them at <i>shayateen (devils): </i>hence they hurl them with rage and force. However, the throwing of the pebbles has been merely prescribed as a means of remembering Allah the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Some people throw big stones, shoes or pieces of wood. This is an excess in matters of religion which the Prophet (peace be upon him) prohibited, what is allowed is to throw pebbles the size of good beans.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Crowding and fighting with others at the Pillars while throwing the pebbles is not permissible. What is prescribed is to be gentle and to throw the pebbles without hurting anyone as much as possible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Throwing all the pebbles at one time is an error. Scholars have said that this would be counted as only one throw. The <i>Shari&#8217;ah prescribes </i>throwing the pebbles one by one, saying <b><i>&#8220;Allahu akbar&#8221; </i></b>at each separate throw.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Appointing a proxy to throw the pebbles, simply due to fear of the crowds or of hardship, while one is capable of doing it himself. Only sick or weak individuals are permitted to have a proxy for this act.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Seventh: Errors Related to the Farewell Tawaf (Tawaf -al- Wida)</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. On the day of their departure, some pilgrims go.to Makkah to perform their Farewell Tawaf before throwing the pebbles at the Pillars. Then they return to Mina to throw the pebbles, and depart from Mina for their respective countries. Thus their final rite becomes that of throwing the pebbles at the Pillars and not of the tawaf of K&#8217;abah. This is an error as the Prophet (peace be on him) said, No one should depart without his last visit being to the House (K&#8217;abah) &#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, the Farewell Tawaf must take place after one has completed all the rites of hajj (and before starling his journey for home). After this tawaf one should not stay in Makkah except during the time it takes to prepare to depart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. After finishing the Farewell <i>Tawaf, </i>some people walk backwards, facing the K&#8217;abah, as they exit from the Sacred Mosque, under the impression that this is a veneration of the K&#8217;abah. This act is an innovation <i>(bid&#8217;a) </i>in the religion and is without any basis.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. After finishing the Farewell <i>Tawaf, </i>some pilgrims halt at the door of the Sacred Mosque to make supplications. This is also an innovation with no basis in the <i>Shari&#8217;ah of </i>Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Eighth: Errors Related to the visit of the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Touching and wiping one&#8217;s hands on the walls and iron grilles, tying threads to the gratings, and other acts of this sort while visiting the grave of the Prophet (may peace and blessings of Allah be on him) in order to receive blessings <i>(barakah) </i>are an innovation (bid&#8217;a). Blessings come from following what Allah and His Messenger (peace be on him) have prescribed, and not from following innovations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Going to the caves of Mount Uhud or to the caves of Hira or Thaur near Makkah and hanging pieces of cloth or making supplications there have not been prescribed by Allah. All these are unnecessary hardships, innovations in the religion, and are without any basis in the <i>Shari&#8217;ah.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Likewise, visiting certain sites under the impression that these constitute &#8220;relics&#8221; of the Prophet (peace be on him), as for example the place where his camel sat, the Well of &#8216;Uthman or the Well of the Ring, and gathering soil from these places to obtain &#8220;blessings&#8221;, are all innovations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Calling upon the dead while visiting the graves at the Baqi&#8217; Cemetery or the graves of the martyrs of Uhud, and throwing coins in order to seek the blessings of the place or of the people buried there, is a grievous error indeed. it is <i>shirk </i>(ascribing partners to Allah the Most High), as has been pointed out by scholars. It is clear from the Book of Allah and the <i>sunnah </i>of His Messenger (peace be on him) that all forms of worship are for Allah alone. It is not permissible to call upon, or to offer sacrifice, give vow or any other form of <i>ibadah </i>(worship) except for Allah alone. Allah the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b><i>&#8220;and they were commanded nothing except to worship Allah (only), purifying the religion for Him alone,&#8221;</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and He also says,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>&#8220;<strong>Verily, the places of worship are for Allah (alone), so do not call on anyone else apart from Allah</strong>.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah, the Most High, to improve the condition of the Muslims and to give them understanding of the religion. and to turn all of us away from errors and deviations Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Responding.<b> </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>WHAT IS REQUIRED OF THE PILGRIMS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. To repent sincerely of all sins, and to spend on the hajj or &#8216;umrah out of his lawful earnings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. To guard one&#8217;s tongue from lying, backbiting and slandering.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3, To purify the intention to perform <i>hajj </i>or &#8216;<em>umrah</em> solely to seek the pleasure of Allah the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. To learn what actions are prescribed&#8217;by the Shari&#8217;ah or hajj and &#8216;umrah, and in the event of any difficulty or problem to ask those who know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. When the pilgrim arrives at al-miqat (station of ihram) he is free to choose one of the three types of hajj (ifrad, tamatt&#8217;u or qiran). Tamatt&#8217;u is preferable for a person who has not brought his sacrificial animal with him, while qiran is preferable for one who has his animal with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. If the person entering ihram is afraid he may not be able to complete all the rites because of sickness or fear, he should make the condition: &#8220;I will return to the normal state in case I am obliged to.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. The hajj of children is valid, but it does not fulfill their lslamic obligation of <i>hajj.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. During the state of ihram, one may take bath or wash his head or scratch it if need be.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. A woman may veil her face with her headcovering if she fears that men are looking at her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. Many women wear a headband under the veil to keep it away from the face. This action has no basis.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. It is permissible to wash the ihram garments and to wear them again, or to change into other ihram garments.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. If, during the state of ihram, one should wear a sewn garment, cover his head, or use scent due to forgetfulness or ignorance, no expiation (penalty or redemptive offering) is required of him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. If one is performing hajj al-tamatt&#8217;u or &#8216;umrah, he should stop reciting <i>talbiyyah upon </i>arriving at the K&#8217;abah before beginning his tawaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. Walking with quick, short steps and baring the right shoulder is not permissible during tawaf except during the first three circuits of the Tawaf of Arrival (tawaf <i>al-qudum</i><i>). </i>This<i> </i>applies to men only.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15. If the pilgrim forgets how many circuits he has performed, i.e., whether three or four, he should count them as three (that is, the lesser of the two numbers). The same procedure is to be followed for sa&#8217;ye.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16. In case of large crowds, there is no harm in performing the circuits beyond the Station of lbraheem or even further beyond, as the whole of the Sacred Mosque is a place of tawaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">17. It is prohibited for a woman to make tawaf showing her adornments, using perfume, or not covering properly what the <i>Shari&#8217;ah </i>requires her to be covered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">18. If a woman&#8217;s menses begins or she gives birth after entering into ihram, it is not permissible for her to make tawaf until the flow of blood ceases and she is cleansed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19. A woman may wear any dress for ihram as long as it does not resemble men&#8217;s clothing, show her adornments, or cause temptation to men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">20. To verbalize the intentions for acts of worship other than the hajj or &#8216;umrah is an innovation <i>(bid&#8217;a), and </i>to say it aloud is even more incorrect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">21. If a Muslim has the intention of making <i>hajj or </i>&#8216;<em>umrah</em>, it is forbidden for him to pass by the appointed Station of lhrem (al- miqat) without entering into ihram.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">22. If the pilgrim for <i>hajj or </i>&#8216;<em>umrah</em> is arriving by air, he enters into ihram on the plane when he passes parallel to the Station of ihram on his route. He is to prepare himself, for entering into ihram during the flight before boarding the plane.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">23. If one resides in Makkah, or between Makkah and the Stations of <i>Ihram </i>he need not go anywhere to take <i>ihram. </i>In this case, he is to take his <i>ihram </i>for either <i>hajj </i>or <i>&#8216;umrah </i>at his place of residence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">24. In order to increase the number of their <i>&#8216;umrahs, </i>some people go to al-Tan&#8217;im or al-J&#8217;iranah after the <i>hajj </i>and subsequently return for <i>&#8216;umrah. No </i>support for this practice exists in the <i>Shari&#8217;ah.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">.25. The pilgrim who is performing <i>hajj al-tamatt&#8217;u </i>re-enters <i>ihram</i> on the 8th of Dhul-Hijjah at the place in which he is staying in Makkah. It is not necessary for him to take <i>ihram </i>from any specified place within Makkah (such as al-Mizab), as many people do, nor is there any Farewell <i>Tawaf </i>for going out of Makkah at this time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">26. It is preferable to go to &#8216;Arafat from Mina on the 9th of Dhul- Hijjah after the sun has risen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">27. It is not permissible to depart from &#8216;Arafat on the 9th of Dhul- Hijjah before the sun has set. When the pilgrim departs after sunset, he should do so with ease and dignity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">28, The <i>Maghrib </i>and <i>&#8216;Isha </i>prayers are to be performed after arriving at Muzdalifah, whether at the time of <i>Maghrib </i>or during the period of <i>&#8216;lsha.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">29. It is permissible to gather the pebbles for stoning the Pillars from any place within the boundaries of Makkah <i>(al-Haram), </i>not necessarily from Muzdalifah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">30. It is not recommended to wash the pebbles. No report exists to the effect that the Prophet (peace be on him) or his Companions ever did this. Nor are the used pebbles to be used again.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">31. It is permissible for women, children and weak individuals to proceed to Mina at the end of the night.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">32, When the pilgrim arrives in Mina on the Day of &#8216;Eid (the 10th of Dhul-Hijjah), he should stop reciting <i>talbiyyah. </i>The pebbles are to be thrown successively, one by one, at the Stone Pillar of &#8216;Aqabah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">33. It is not required that the pebbles remain where they are thrown; it is only necessary that they be thrown at the Pillar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">34. According to the opinion of scholars, the period of sacrifice extends to the sunset of the third day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">35. Tawaf <i>al-ifadah or al-ziyarah </i>on the day of &#8216;Eid (the 10th of Dhul-Hijjah) is an essential part of the <i>hajj </i>and <i>hajj </i>is not complete without it. However, it is permissible to delay it until the end of the stay in Mina.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">36. The person making qiran between <i>hajj </i>and <i>&#8216;umrah </i>offers one <i>Sa,ye </i>only. The same is true in the case of ifrad, if the person keeps his <i>ihram </i>until the day of <i>an-Nahr.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">37. On the Day of Sacrifice, it is preferable that the pilgrims do things in the following order: begins by throwing pebbles at the Pillar of &#8216;Aqabah; then Offers his sacrifice; then shaves or clips his hair, he then makes tawaf of the K&#8217;abah followed by sa&#8217;ye Changing this order is, however, permissible<b>.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">38. Returning to full normal state is attained after one has done the following: (a) thrown the pebbles at the Pillar of &#8216;Aqabah; (b) shaved his head or clipped some of his hair; (c) done tawaf al-ifada with sa&#8217;ye.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">39. If the pilgrim decides to shorten his stay in Mina, it is necessary that he departs from Mina before the sunset.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">40. For a child who cannot do the throwing of pebbles, his guardian throws on his behalf after throwing his own pebbles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">41. A person who is not capable of going to the throwing due to old age, illness or pregnancy it is permitted to appoint someone else (his proxy) to do the throwing on his or her behalf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">42. The proxy first throws his own pebbles and thereafter, without leaving the place, throws the pebbles on behalf of the person whom he represents at each of the three Pillars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">43. Except for the residents of the Sacred Mosque, it is obligatory on anyone who is doing <i>hajj a</i> l-tamatt&#8217;u or hajj al-qiran to sacrifice a sheep or to share in the seventh part of a camel or a cow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">44. If the pilgrim is unable to make this sacrifice, he must fast three days during the <i>hajj </i>and seven days after returning home.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">45. It is preferable that these three days of fasting be completed before the Day of &#8216;Arafat so that he is not fasting on that day, or otherwise that he fast on the 11 th, 12th and 13th of Dhul-Hijjah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">46. It is permissible to fast these three days either consecutively or separately, and the same applies to the seven days of fasting at home.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">47. The Farewell <i>Tawaf (tawaf al-wida&#8217;) is </i>obligatory for every pilgrim excepting menstruating or post-partum women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">48. To visit the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque in Madinah is a <i>sunnah, </i>whether it is done before the <i>haii </i>or after it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">49. When you enter the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque, it is <i>sunnah </i>to pray two <i>rak&#8217;ats </i>of tahiyyat <i>al-masjid </i><i>(the (the </i>salah of greeting the mosque). Although you can perform this salah anywhere in the Mosque, it is preferable to perform it in the Rawdah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">50. Visiting the graves of the Prophet (peace be on him) and others is allowed for Males only, and not for females, so that they would not have to travel for such a visit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">51. Rubbing and wiping one&#8217;s hands against the walls of the chamber containing the Prophet&#8217;s tomb, kissing it, or doing circuits around it are all innovations which are prohibited. Such things were not done by our upright ancestors. in particular, making <i>tawaf </i>around the chamber <i>is shirk </i>(ascribing partners to Allah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">52. it is also shirk to call upon the Prophet (peace be upon him) for the fulfilment of a need or to remove a grief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">53. The Prophet&#8217;s life in his grave is in the state at <i>barzakh </i>(the state of existence between death and resurrection on the Day of Judgement) and is in no way similar to his life on earth before his death. The nature and reality of the life of <i>barzakh is </i>known only to Allah the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">54. People who stand in front of the Prophet&#8217;s grave, raising their hands and making supplications, are doing something alien to Islam. This is an innovation in the religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">55. Visiting the grave of the Prophet (peace be on him) is neither obligatory nor a condition for the completion of the <i>hajj, </i>as some people believe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">56. The <i>hadiths </i>cited by some people prescribing visitation of the Prophet&#8217;s grave either have weak authority or are fabricated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Some Supplications Which May Be Recited At &#8216;Arafat, at The Sacred Sites, and at Other Places Of Supplication</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allah! Bless me in my sight, in my hearing, in my soul, In my body, In my conduct; bless me in my life, in my family, in my work; accept my good deeds, and I ask of You a high rank in the Garden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allah! I seek refuge In You against difficulties, calamities, troubles, oppression and the ridicule of enemies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allah! O Controller of the Hearts!; Keep my heart firm in Your religion; keep it contented with Your worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allah! Grant us increase and not decrease, honor and not dishonor; give us Your favors and do not deprive us; prefer us, let not others be preferred to us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allah! Grant us the best of outcomes in all our affairs, and save us from disgrace in this world and from punishment in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allah! Grant us such fear of Your as will come between us and acts of disobedience to You; such obedience to You as will bring us to Your Garden; and such certainty that the calamities of this world will be made easy for us by You. Let us enjoy our hearing, our sight and our faculties as long as You grant us life, and let it be, the last to be taken away from us. Avenge us from those who have wronged us and help us against our enemies. Let no calamity be fall our religion; let not worldly affairs be our greatest care or all about which we know; and Let not those who have no fear of You and who do not show mercy toward us rule over us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allah! I ask You to bestow Your mercy on me, to forgive me, to protect me from every sin, to give me a share of every good, and to grant me the attainment of the Garden and salvation from the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allah! Leave not for us a sin which You have not forgiven, nor a shortcoming which You have not concealed, nor a wary which You have not removed, nor a debt which You have not paid, nor a need from among the needs of this world or the Hereafter, the fulfillment of which is beneficial for us and pleasing to You, which You have not fulfilled, O Most Merciful of all show us mercy!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allah! I ask for a mercy from You by which You will guide my heart, settle my affairs, remove my worries, protect me from what is unseen to me, make my face radiant, purify my deeds, inspire me with wisdom, avert calamities from me, and protect me from every evil,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allah! I ask You for success on the day of judgment, and a life of happiness, and the rank of the martyrs, the companionship of the prophets, and victory over the enemies.O Allah! I ask You for correctness of belief: for a faith which leads to good conduct, for a success which results in eternal felicity: for mercy, health and forgiveness from You, and for Your pleasure.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allah! I ask You for health, for integrity, for good character, and that I may be pleased with my portion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allah! I seek refuge in You from the evil of my self, and from the evil of every creature which You are grasping by its forelock. O my Lord, keep me on the straight path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allah! You hear my words, You behold my situation, You know what is open and what is hidden within me; nothing is hidden from You. It is me alone who is in need, a humble seeker of Your forgiveness. I beseech You with humility in my heart, with trembling and fear, in prostration and utter helplessness. O Allah! Grant me soundness of belief, goodness of character, forgiveness of my sins, and Your eternal pleasure in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah&#8217;s blessings be upon Muhammad and his family and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: <strong>Al-Istiqaamah Magazine</strong>, Issue No.6 &#8211; Dhul-Qa&#8217;dah 1417H / March 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By the Grace of Allaah we have started the month of<i> Dhul-Hijjah </i>(the month of<i> Hajj</i> or Pilgrimage), in which Allaah has marked out, for both the pilgrims and the non-pilgrims, some very blessed days. So we shall mention here some of the virtues and rewardful acts that are connected to these blessed days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> DOING GOOD DEEDS IN GENERAL:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first ten days of<i> Dhul-Hijjah </i>are the best and most virtuous days of the year. They are the days in which Allaah the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; most loves the doing of good deeds. About this the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, “<strong>The best days in the world are the ten days.</strong>” [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibnul-Qayyim (d.751H) &#8211; <i> rahimahullaah</i> – said, “Indeed, its days are the most excellent of all the days with Allaah. And it has been confirmed in <i>Saheehul-Bukhaaree</i> (2/382), from Ibn ’Abbaas (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhumaa</i>) who said, that Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, “There ore no days during which good deeds are more beloved to Allaah than these (ten) days.” He was then asked, ‘Not even <i>jihaad</i> in the path of Allaah?’ So he replied, “Not even <i>jihaad</i> in the path of Allaah, except for a person who goes out with his self and his wealth, and comes back with nothing.” And it is these ten days that Allaah has taken an oath by in His Book, by His saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<b>By the Dawn and by the Ten Nights.</b>” [Sooratul-Fajr 89:1-2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why it is recommended to increase in making <i>takbeer</i> (saying <i>Allaahu akbar</i>), <i>tahleel</i> (saying<i> Laa ilaaha illallaah</i>) and <i>tamheed</i> (saying<i> Alhamdulillaah</i>) during these days &#8230;”[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, “There are no days that are greater with Allaah, and in which good deeds are more beloved to Him, than these ten days. So increase in making<i> tasbeeh </i>(saying <i>Subhaanallaah), tahmeed</i>,<i> tahleel and takbeer</i>, during them.”[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> FASTING THE DAY OF ’ARAFAH:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ninth day of<i> Dhul-Hijjah </i> is the day of ’Arafah, since it is on this day that the pilgrims gather at the mountain plain of ’Arafah, praying and supplicating to their Lord. It is <i> mustahabb</i> (highly recommended) for those who are not pilgrims to fast on this day, since the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) was asked about fasting on the day of ’Arafah, so he said, “It expiates the sins of the past year and the coming year.” [4] Likewise, the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, ‘There is no day on which Allaah frees people from the Fire more so than on the day of ’Arafah. He comes close to those (people standing on ’Arafah), and then He revels before His Angels saying, ‘What are these people seeking.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam at-Tirmidhee (d.275H) &#8211; <i> rahimahullaah</i> – said, “The People of Knowledge consider it recommended to fast on the day of ’Arafah, except for those at ’Arafah.” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><b> SLAUGHTERING ON THE DAY OF AN-NAHR AND ’EEDUL-ADHAA OR THE FOLLOWING THREE DAYS:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tenth day of<i> Dhul-Hiijah </i> is known as the day of <i>an-Nahr</i> (slaughtering), since it marks the ending of the major rites of<i> Hajj</i> (Pilgrimage), and commemorates the bounty and mercy of Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; in that He gave His beloved Prophet Ibraaheem &#8211; <i>’alayhis-salaam</i> &#8211; a ram to sacrifice in place of his firstborn son Ismaa’eel &#8211; <i>’alayhis-salaam</i>. And out of the ten best days of the year, it is the day of <i>an-Nahr</i> which is the most excellent day of the year with Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> – said, “The most excellent day of the week is the day of Friday, by the agreement of the Scholars. And the most excellent day of the year is the day of <i>an-Nahr</i>. And some of them said that it is the day of ’Arafah. However, the first opinion is the correct one, since it is related in the <i>Sunan</i> collections that the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, “<strong>The most excellent days with Allaah is the day of an-Nahr, then the day of al-Qarr (the day that the Muslims reside in Minaa)</strong>.” [7]” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>The greatest day of the<i> Hajj </i>(Pilgrimage) is the Day of an-Nahr (Slaughtering).</strong>” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The day of <i>an-Nahr</i> is also known as ’Eedul-Adhaa (the Festivity of Sacrifice) and is one of the two major festivals that Allaah has granted to this<i> Ummah</i>. Anas (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhu</i>) said, ‘The Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) came to al-Madeenah and the people of al-Madeenah had &#8211; since the times of <i>jaahiliyyah</i> (Pre-lslaamic Ignorance) &#8211; two days which they marked out for play and amusement. So the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, ‘I came to you, and you had two days of play and amusement in the times of <i>jaahiliyyah</i>. But Allaah has replaced them with something better for you: The day of al-Adhaa (sacrificing) and the day of al-Fitr (ending the Fast).” [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) also said, “The day of al-Fitr, and the day of an-Nahr, and the days of <i>at-</i>Tashreeq (the three days after an-Nahr) are our days of <i> ’Eed </i>(festivity); and they are days of eating and drinking.” [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">’Eedul-Adhaa, is a day in which the Muslims slaughter a camel, cow, sheep or goat, in commemoration of the sacrifice of Ibraaheem &#8211; <i>’alayis-salaam</i>. And this sacrifice is an obligation upon all those who have the means to do so &#8211; according to the most correct opinion of the Scholars. [12] The basis of this is the Prophet’s (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) saying, “One who has the ability to sacrifice, but chooses not to do so, should not approach our place of (<i>’Eed</i>) Prayer.” [13] And his (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) saying, “Whosoever sacrificed before the Prayer, then let him do so again. But whosoever has not sacrificed, then let him sacrifice.” [14] So this order refers to those who have the ability to do so &#8211; and Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards those who intends to sacrifice &#8211; normally the head of the household &#8211; then they are prohibited from cutting their hair or nails, starting from the first day of<i> Dhul-Hijjah </i> up until after the sacrifice. Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, “When the ten days start, and one of you intends to sacrifice, then let him not cut his hair or his nails.” [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> GLORIFYING ALLAAH WITH THE TAKBEER:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the day of ’Arafah (the 9th of<i> Dhul-Hijjah</i>), up until the<i> ’Asr </i>Prayer on the thirteen day, are days in which the <i>takbeeraat</i> (saying<i> Allaahu Akbar</i>) should be said. Imaam al-Khattaabee (d.456H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> – said, “The wisdom behind saying the <i>takbeeraat</i> in these days is that in the times of <i> jaahiliyyah</i> (pre-lslaamic ignorance), they used to slaughter for their <i> tawaagheet </i>(false objects of worship). So the <i>takbeeraat</i> were prescribed in order to indicate that the act of slaughtering is directed to Allaah alone, and by mentioning only His &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; Name.” [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah &#8211; <i> rahimahullaah</i> – said, “All praise be to Allaah. The most correct saying concerning the <i>takbeer</i> &#8211; that which the majority of the <i>Salaf</i> (Pious Predecessors), and the Scholars from the Companions and Imaams were upon &#8211; is to begin making the <i>takbeer</i> from <i>Fajr</i> (dawn) on the day of ’Arafah, up until the last day of <i>at-Tashreeq</i> (the thirteenth of<i> Dhul-Hijjah</i>), after every Prayer.” [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abee Shaybah relates, “That ’Alee (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhu</i>) used to make the <i>takbeer</i> beginning after the <i>Fajr</i> Prayer on the day of ’Arafah, up until after the ’Asr Prayer on the last day of <i>at-Tashreeq</i>.” [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards the actual wording of the <i>takbeeraat</i>, then nothing authentic has been related from the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>). However, certain wordings have been authentically related from a group of Companions. From them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas’ood (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhu</i>) would say, “Allaah is great, Allaah is great. None has the right to be worshipped except Him. And Allaah is great, Allaah is great. And to Him belongs all praise. [<i>Allaahu akbar</i>,<i> Allaahu akbar</i>,<i> Allaahu akbar</i>,<i> Laa ilaahaa illallaah</i>,<i> wallaahu akbar</i>,<i> Allaahu akbar wa lillaahil-hamd</i>.]” [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ’Abbaas (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhu</i>) said, “Allaah is great, Allaah is great, Allaah is great, and to Allaah belongs all praise. Allaah is greater and Sublime. Allaah is greater to what He has guided us to. <i>[Allaahu akbar</i>,<i> Allaahu akbar</i>,<i> Allaahu akbar</i>,<i> wa lillaahil-hamd</i>.<i> Allaahu akbar wa ajalla</i>.<i> Allaahu akbar ’alaa maa hadaanaa</i>.]” [20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unfortunately, many Muslims have neglected the <i>takbeer</i> established from our <i>Salaf</i> (Pious Predecessors) and have instead resorted to additions which have no basis at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr (d.856H) &#8211; <i> rahimahullaah</i> – said, “Indeed, additions have been invented upon this day, which have no basis at all.” [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And may Allaah have mercy upon the one who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<i>Every good is in following the Salaf; And every evil is in the innovations of the late-comers.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And all praise is for Allaah, Lord of the worlds. And may Allaah extol and send the choicest blessings of peace upon our Leader, Muhammad, and upon his Family, his Companions, and all those who follow them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">source:<em> Silsilat ul-ahaadeeth us-saheeha</em> – the series of authentic narrations – <em>hadeeth </em>no. 43<br />
assaheeha translations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “O <em>‘Aaisha</em>, if your people had not recently been polytheists (and new converts to <em>Islaam</em>), and if I had enough means to reconstruct it, I would have spent the treasure of the <em>Ka’bah</em> in the way of Allaah, and I would have demolished the <em>Ka’bah</em> and made it at a level with the ground. Then I would have rebuilt it on its original foundations laid by <em>Ibraaheem</em> (Abraham) and made two doors for it – a door facing the east, for the people to enter, and a door facing the west, for their exit… And I would expand (the <em>Ka’bah</em>) by six cubits (around three meters) of area from <em>al-Hijr</em> (the unroofed portion of the <em>Ka’bah</em> which is at present in the form of a semi-circular, wall-surrounded area in the north side of the <em>Ka’bah</em>); (in [another] narration: I would have included the space of <em>al-Hijr</em> in it ), for when the <em>Quraish</em> had rebuilt the<em> Ka’bah</em>, they reduced its (area). And if your people would take initiative after me in rebuilding it, then come along with me so that I could show you what they have left out of it.” He [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] showed her about seven cubits (three and a half meters) of area (from the side of <em>al-Hijr</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In [another] narration from her (<em>‘Aaisha</em>), she said: “I asked the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) about the wall (i.e., <em>al-Hijr</em>): ‘Is it regarded as part of the House (the <em>Ka’bah</em>)?’ He [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] replied, ‘Yes.’ I said: ‘Then why did they not include it in the House?’ He [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] said, ‘Your people ran short of the means/money (to do so).’ I said: ‘Why is it that the level of its door is raised high?’ He [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] said, ‘Your people did it to admit whomever they liked, and prevent whomever they disliked; (in [another] narration: (They did it) out of vanity so that (they might be in a position) to grant admittance to only whom they wished. So when a person intended to enter it, they called him to climb (the stairs), and when he was about to enter, they pushed him and he fell down). Were your people not close to the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance (i.e. they have recently embraced<em> Islaam</em>) and were I not afraid that their hearts might deny (my action), then surely I would have included the (area of the) wall inside (the building of) the House and I would have made its gate touch the ground.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, when <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> ruled, he demolished it and made two doors for it. (In [another] narration: That was what urged <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr </em>to demolish (the <em>Ka’bah</em>). <em>Yazeed bin Rumaan</em> said: ‘I saw <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> when he demolished it, rebuilt it and included <em>al-Hijr </em>in it. And I saw the original foundations of <em>Ibraaheem</em> (<em>‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) which were of stones joined together resembling the humps of camels.’)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>*</strong>the translation of the above <em>hadeeth</em>, for the most part, was taken directly from the already translated text of <em>saheeh al-bukhaari </em>and<em> saheeh muslim</em><strong>*</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>shaykh al-albaani </em>(<em>rahimahullaah</em>) summarizes a number of benefits from the above narration:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This <em>hadeeth</em> indicates two things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First: that it is obligatory to delay carrying out rectification, if an evil greater than [its good] results from it. And from it, the scholars of <em>fiqh</em> took their famous principle: ‘<strong>Repelling the evil [comes] before bringing the good</strong>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second: that the honorable <em>Ka’bah</em> is now in need of the reconstructions that the <em>hadeeth</em> includes, due to the disappearance of the reason for the sake of which the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) left that – and (the reason) is that the hearts of those who were recently polytheists in his time (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) would have a dislike [for it]. And <em>Ibn Battaal </em>has reported from some of the scholars that: ‘the dislike that he (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) feared was that they would accuse him of boasting by himself over them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is possible to list those reconstructions in what follows:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>1- Expanding the <em>Ka’bah</em> and building it upon the foundation of <em>Ibraaheem </em>(<em>‘alayhi ssalaat wa ssalaam</em>), and that is by adding approximately six cubits (three meters) of <em>al-Hijr</em></li>
<li>2- Leveling its ground with the surface of the <em>Haram</em> (<em>Al-Masjid ul-Haraam</em>)</li>
<li>3- Opening another door for it from the Western side</li>
<li>4 – Making the two doors low with the ground to organize and facilitate entering it and exiting from it for everyone who wishes</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed,<em> ‘Abdullaah bin uz-Zubayr </em>(<em>radi Allaahu ‘anhumaa</em>) had carried out the fulfillment of this reconstruction completely during his rule in <em>Makkah</em>, but the unjust political administration returned the <em>Ka’bah</em> after him to its previous state!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">the<em> shaykh </em>then mentions the following <em>hadeeth</em> as narrated by <em>Muslim</em> and <em>Abu Nu’aym</em> on the authority of <em>‘Ataa</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The House was burnt during the time of <em>Yazeed bin Mu’aawiya</em> when the people of <em>Shaam</em> had fought (in <em>Makkah</em>), and it happened with it (the<em> Ka’bah</em>) what was (in store for it). <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> left it (in the same state) until the people came in the season (of <em>Hajj</em>) – he wanted to encourage them or urge them on (to war) against the people of <em>Shaam</em>. When the people had arrived, he said to them, ‘O people, advise me about the <em>Ka’bah</em>. Should I demolish it and then build it from its very foundation, or should I repair whatever has been damaged of it?’ <em>Ibn ‘Abbaas</em> [<em>radi Allaahu &#8216;anhu</em>] said, ‘An idea has occurred to me, according to which I think that you should only repair whatever has been damaged for it, and leave the House (in the same state) in which people embraced<em> Islaam</em>, (and leave) the stones (in the same state) in which people embraced<em> Islaam</em> and upon which the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) was sent.’ So, <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr </em>said, ‘If the house of any one of you was burnt, he would not be pleased until he had reconstructed it, then how about the House of your Lord (which is far more important than your house)?! Indeed, I will seek good advice from my Lord thrice and then I will make up my mind about this affair.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After seeking good advice thrice, he made up his mind to demolish it. The people were suspicious and fearful that calamity might fall from heaven on those persons who would be first to climb over it (for the purpose of demolishing it), until a man climbed it and threw down one of its stones. When the people saw no calamity befalling him, they followed him and demolished it until they leveled it to the ground. Then, <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> erected pillars and hung curtains on them until the walls were raised. And <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr </em>said, ‘Indeed I heard<em> ‘Aaisha </em>say that the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: (he then mentioned the first portion of the <em>hadeeth</em> [mentioned in the beginning], then he said) – I today have the means to spend and I don’t fear the people (that they would protest against this change).’ So he expanded it by five cubits (around two and a half meters) of area from the side of <em>al-Hijr</em> until it appeared as the original foundation (upon which <em>Ibraaheem</em> had built the <em>Ka’bah</em>), and the people saw it; and it was upon this foundation that he raised the wall. The length of the <em>Ka’bah</em> was eighteen cubits (around nine meters), and when he had expanded it, he found it to be short (since the addition was made to its width, so naturally the length appeared to be small compared to its width). Therefore, he expanded its length by ten cubits (around five meters). He also constructed two doors, one of which (was meant) for entrance and the other one for exit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, when <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> was killed, <em>al-Hajjaaj </em>wrote to <em>‘Abd ul-Malik bin Marwaan </em>informing him about it, and telling him that <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> had built (the<em> Ka’bah</em>) on the very foundation (which was laid by <em>Ibraaheem</em>) and which reliable persons among the people of <em>Makkah</em> had seen. Then, <em>‘Abd ul-Malik</em> wrote to him: ‘Indeed, we are not concerned with disgracing <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> in anything. As for what he added in the side of its length, keep it intact; and as for what he added from the side of <em>al-Hijr</em>, return it to its (previous) foundation, and close up the door which he opened.’ Thus, he (<em>al-Hajjaaj</em>) demolished it (that portion) and rebuilt it on its (previous) foundation.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>*</strong>the translation of the above <em>hadeeth</em>, for the most part, was taken directly from the already translated text of <em>saheeh</em><em> muslim</em><strong>*</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>shaykh al-albaani</em> continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“That is what <em>al-Hajjaaj</em> the oppressor did by the command of<em> ‘Abd ul-Malik</em> the mistaken one, and I don’t think that his regret later on clears him of his mistake. <em>Muslim</em> and <em>Abu Na’eem</em> have also narrated from <em>‘Abdullaah bin ‘Ubayd</em> who said: <em>Al-Haarith bin ‘Abdillaah</em> came to <em>‘Abd ul-Malik bin Marwaan</em> as an envoy during his <em>Khilaafa</em> (Caliphate), and<em> ‘Abd ul-Malik</em> said, ‘I don’t think that<em> Abu Habeeb</em> (i.e., <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em>) heard from<em> ‘Aaisha</em> that which he claimed to hear from her.’ <em>Al-Haarith</em> said: ‘But yes, I [myself] heard it from her.’ He (<em>‘Abd ul-Malik</em>) said, ‘You heard her saying what?’ He (<em>Al-Haarith</em>) said, ‘She said: the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: (he then mentioned the <em>hadeeth</em>).’ <em>‘Abd ul-Malik </em> said to <em>Al-Haarith</em>, ‘You heard her saying this?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ Then, he (<em>‘Abd ul-Malik</em>) scratched the ground with his staff for a while and then said, ‘I wish that I had left it and not changed [the reconstructions carried out by<em> Ibn uz-Zubayr</em>].’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is in [another] narration from them both (<em>Muslim and Abu Na’eem</em>) from <em>Abu Qaz’ah </em>that: While <em>‘Abd ul-Malik</em> <em>bin Marwaan </em>was going around the House, he at that time said, ‘May Allaah fight <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> since he uttered a lie upon the mother of the believers, saying: I heard her say: (he then mentioned the <em>hadeeth</em>).’ So, <em>Al-Haarith bin ‘Abdillaah bin Rabee’ah</em> said, ‘Don’t say this O leader of the believers, for I [myself] heard the mother of the believers saying this.’ He (<em>‘Abd ul-Malik</em>) said, ‘If I had heard it before I demolished it (the <em>Ka’bah</em>), I would have left it upon what <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> had built.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (<em>Shaykh al-Albaani</em>) say: it was (obligatory) upon him, before the demolition, to verify and to <strong>ask the people of knowledge</strong> about that, whether it was allowed for him to criticize <em>‘Abdullaah bin uz-Zubayr</em> and accuse him of uttering a lie upon the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>). And his truthfulness (<em>radi Allaahu ‘anhu</em>) became clear to<em> ‘Abd ul-Malik</em> by <em>Al-Haarith</em>‘s agreeing with it, as many a group from <em>‘Aaisha</em> (<em>radi Allaahu ‘anhaa</em>) agreed with it. And I have collected their narrations…in this <em>hadeeth</em>, and the <em>hadeeth</em> is detailed from<em> ‘Aaisha</em>. Therefore, I indeed fear that <em>‘Abd ul-Malik</em> had prior knowledge about the <em>hadeeth</em> before he demolished the House, but he pretended that he did not hear about it except through <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em>. So when <em>Al-Haarith bin ‘Abdillaah</em> opposed him, that he also had heard it (the <em>hadeeth</em>) from <em>‘Aaisha</em>, he (<em>‘Abd ul-Malik</em>) showed regret at what he had done, [but] it was too late for regrets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, it has reached us that there is an idea or plan to expand the area of <em>tawaaf </em>(circumambulation) around  the <em>Ka’bah</em> and transfer the <em>Maqaam Ibraaheem</em> (the Standing Place of <em>Ibraaheem</em>) (<em>‘alayhi ssalaat wa ssalaam</em>) to another place. So in relation to this, <strong>I suggest to those responsible (for the <em>Ka’bah</em>) that they hasten to expand the <em>Ka’bah</em> before everything (else) and rebuilt it upon the foundation of <em>Ibraaheem </em>(<em>‘alayhi ssalaat wa ssalaam</em>)</strong>, fulfilling the noble, honorable Prophetic wish in this<em> hadeeth</em>, and saving the people from the problems of crowding at the door of the <em>Ka’bah</em> which is witnessed every year, and from the domination of the guard over the door who prevents whoever he wishes from entering and allows whoever he wishes, for the sake of a few dirhams!”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A History of Hajj (Pilgrimage)<br />
</strong>Invitation to Islam Newsletter, Issue 1, May 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hajj literally means &#8216;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>to set out for a place</strong></span>&#8216;. Islamically however it refers to the annual pilgrimage that Muslims make to Makkah with the intention of performing certain religious rites in accordance with the method prescribed by the Prophet Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hajj and its rites were first ordained by Allaah in the time of the Prophet lbraaheem [Abraham] (alayhis-salaam) and he was the one who was entrusted by Allaah to build the Ka&#8217;ba &#8211; the House of Allaah &#8211; along with his son Ismaa&#8217;eel [Ishmael] at Makkah. Allaah described the Ka&#8217;ba and its building as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;And remember when We showed Ibraaheem the site of the [Sacred] House [saying]: Associate not anything [in worship] with Me and purify My House for those who circumambulate it [i.e. perform tawaaf] and those who stand up for prayer and those who bow down and make prostration [in prayer etc.].&#8221;</span><strong> </strong>[<em>Surah Al-Hajj 22:26</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>After building the Ka&#8217;ba, Ibraaheem (alayhis-salaam) would come to Makkah to perform Hajj every year, and after his death, this practice was continued by his son</strong></span>. However, gradually with the passage of time, both the form and the goal of the Hajj rites were changed. As idolatry spread throughout Arabia , the Ka&#8217;ba lost its purity and idols were placed inside it. Its walls became covered with poems and paintings, including one of Jesus and his mother Maryam and eventually over 360 idols came to be placed around the Ka&#8217;ba.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the Hajj period itself, the atmosphere around the sacred precincts of the Ka&#8217;ba was like a circus.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Men and women would go round the Ka&#8217;ba <strong>naked</strong>, arguing that they should present themselves before Allaah in the same condition they were born.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Their prayer became devoid of all sincere remembrance of Allaah and was instead reduced to a series of <strong>hand clapping, whistling and the blowing of horns</strong>.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Even the <strong>talbeeyah [2] was distorted</strong> by them with the following additions: <em>&#8216;No one is Your partner except one who is permitted by you. You are his Master and the Master of what he possesses&#8217;.</em></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sacrifices were also made in the name of God. However, <strong>the blood of the sacrificed animals was poured onto the walls of the Ka&#8217;ba and the flesh was hung from pillars around the Ka&#8217;ba</strong>, in the belief that Allaah demanded the flesh and blood of these animals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Singing, drinking, adultery</strong> and other acts of immorality was rife amongst the pilgrims and the poetry competitions, which were held, were a major part of the whole Hajj event. In these competitions, poets would praise the bravery and splendour of their own tribesmen and tell exaggerated tales of the cowardice and miserliness of other tribes. Competitions in generosity were also staged where the chief of each tribe would set up huge cauldrons and feed the pilgrims, only so that they could become well-known for their extreme generosity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus the people had totally abandoned the teachings of their forefather and leader Ibraaheem (alayhis-salaam). The House that he had made pure for the worship of Allaah alone, had been totally desecrated by the pagans and the rites which he had established were completely distorted by them. This sad state of affairs continued for nearly two and a half thousand years. But then after this long period, the time came for the supplication of Ibraaheem to be answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Our Lord! Send amongst them a Messenger of their own, who shall recite unto them your aayaat (verses) and instruct them in the book and the Wisdom and sanctify them. Verily you are the &#8216;Azeezul-Hakeem [the All-Mighty, the All-Wise].&#8221; </span>[<em>Surah Al-Baqarah 2:129</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sure enough, a man by the name of Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdullaah (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was born in the very city that Ibraaheem (alayhis-salaam) had made this supplication centuries earlier. For twenty-three years, the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) spread the message of Tawheed [true monotheism] &#8211; the same message that Ibraaheem and all the other Prophets came with &#8211; and established the law of Allaah upon the land. He expended every effort into making the word of Allaah supreme and his victory over falsehood culminated in the smashing of the idols inside the Ka&#8217;ba which once again became the universal centre for the worshippers of the one True God.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Not only did the Prophet rid the Ka&#8217;ba of all its impurities, but he also reinstated all the rites of Hajj which were established by Allaah&#8217;s Permission, in the time of Ibraaheem (alayhis-salaam). Specific injunctions in the Qur&#8217;aan were revealed in order to eliminate all the false rites which had become rampant in the pre-Islamic period. All indecent and shameful acts were strictly banned in Allaah&#8217;s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;There is to be no lewdness nor wrangles during Hajj.&#8221;</span><strong> </strong>[<em>Surah al-Baqarah 2:197</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Competitions among poets in the exaltations of their forefathers and their tribesmen&#8217;s&#8217; achievements were all stopped. Instead, Allaah told them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;And when you have completed your rites [of Hajj] then remember Allah as you remember your forefathers; nay with a more vigorous remembrance.&#8221;</span><strong> </strong>[<em>Surah al-Baqarah 2:200</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Competitions in generosity were also prohibited. Of course, the feeding of the poor pilgrims was still encouraged as this was done in the time of Ibraaheem (alayhis-salaam) but Allaah commanded that the slaughtering of the animals which was done for this purpose should be done seeking the pleasure of Allaah rather than fame and the praise of the people. He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;So mention the name of Allaah over these animals when they are drawn up in lines. Then, when they are drawn on their sides [after the slaughter], eat thereof and feed the beggar who does not ask, and the beggar who asks.&#8221;</span><strong> </strong>[<em>Surah al-Hajj 22:36</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the deplorable practice of spattering blood of the sacrificed animals on the walls of the Ka&#8217;ba and hanging their flesh on alters, then Allaah clearly informed them that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allaah, but it is Taqwaa (piety) from you that reaches Him.&#8221;</span><strong> </strong>[<em>Surah al-Hajj 22:37</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) also put a stop to the practice of circling the Ka&#8217;ba in a state of nudity and the argument that the pagans put forward to justify this ritual was sharply rebutted in Allaah&#8217;s question:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Say: Who has forbidden the adornment [i.e. clothes] given by Allaah which He has produced for His Slaves?&#8221;</span><strong> </strong>[<em>Surah al-A&#8217;raaf 7:32</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another custom which was prohibited through the Qur&#8217;aan was that of setting off for Hajj without taking any provisions for the journey. In the pre-Islamic period, some people who claimed to be <strong>mutawakkiloon</strong> (those having complete trust in Allaah) would travel to perform Hajj begging food the whole journey. They considered this form of behaviour a sign of piety and an indication of how much faith they had in Allaah. However Allaah told mankind that to have sufficient provisions for the journey was one of the preconditions for making Hajj. He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;And take a provision [with you] for the journey, but the best provision is at-Taqwaa (piety).&#8221;</span><strong> </strong>[<em>Surah al-Baqarah 2:197</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this way, all the pre-Islamic practices, which were based in ignorance, were abolished and Hajj was once more made a model of piety, fear of Allaah, purity, simplicity and austerity. Now, when the pilgrims reached the Ka&#8217;ba, they no longer found the carnivals and the frolic and frivolity that had once occupied the minds of the pilgrims there before. Now, there was the remembrance of Allaah at every step and every action and every sacrifice was devoted to Him alone. It was this kind of Hajj that was worthy of the reward of paradise, as the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: <em>&#8220;The reward for an accepted Hajj is nothing less than paradise.&#8221; </em>[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah grant us all the ability to visit His House and perform the Hajj in the manner of the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم). Aameen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Author:Shaikh Muhammad Ibn Jameel Zaynoo<br />
</span>Source:Al-Asaalah Magazine Issue 11 (pg. 45-47) </span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">Translator:isma&#8217;eel alarcon &#8211; al-ibaanah.com</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know, my fellow brother, that there are certain etiquettes to the Hajj, which one must abide by and adorn himself with, such as:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Maintain cleanliness</strong></span> in your clothes, your tent, the place where you stay, and in your food and drink. This is because keeping clean will aid in preserving your health and in repelling sicknesses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Beware of dropping filth or spoiled food</strong></span> in the roads that people use, for it will cause those performing Hajj to be bothered, and it will cause diseases to spread. So one must remove harmful objects from the road and put them in their proper place (i.e. garbage).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Bear the harm that comes from your neighbors with patience</span></strong>, and do not (let that cause you to) harm any of your brothers. Instead, repel their harm in a manner that is better, such as by using kind words.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Avoid sexual relations, committing sins, arguing and debating with falsehood, so that your Hajj can be accepted. Listen to the words of Allaah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“So whoever intends to perform Hajj therein (in the months of Hajj), then he must NOT have sexual relations, nor commit sin, nor debate unjustly during Hajj.”</strong> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 197]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Whoever goes to Hajj and he does not have sexual relations in it nor does he commit sin, he returns back (from Hajj) like the day when his mother gave birth to him (i.e. free from sins).”</strong> [Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Be lenient in your buying and selling, and show good manners</strong></span>. And do not deal with anyone in a manner that he is not pleased with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Beware of smoking, displaying bad manners and insulting others</span></strong>, for reviling a Muslim is sinfulness and fighting against him is disbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Do not waste your time in the market places</span></strong> – buying and selling – or in gossiping with the “he said/she said” talk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. Be gentle with those around you when performing Tawaaf, kissing the Stone, the Sa’ee, and when throwing the stones (<em>Ramee</em>) and so on. This is from the gentleness that is required, for Allaah’s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Whoever is deprived of gentleness, he is deprived of all kinds of good.”</strong> [Reported in Saheeh Muslim]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Do not raise your voice out loud when making du’aa</strong></span> (supplication) during Tawaaf, because it disturbs the others making Tawaaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Do not push and shove people</strong></span>, especially when kissing the Black Stone. If it is too crowded and there is too much shoving, it is enough for you to just point in its direction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when casting the stones (<em>Ramee</em>), it is not permissible for you to use large stones, because this has been forbidden in the religious texts and because it will cause harm to those standing (in front of you).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, do not throw your shoes (instead of rocks) – as some ignorant people do – for this is a reprehensible act!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Avoid touching the glass surrounding the Prophet’s grave, and avoid touching the walls of the Ka’abah. Rather what is to be touched and kissed from it is (only) the Black Stone. The Yemeni Corner is also touched. [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. You must shave your head or cut your hair very short when in the state of <em>Hill</em> (out of Ihraam), but beware of shaving the beard off, for that is forbidden according to the unanimous agreement of the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“…with (the hair on) their heads shaven or cut short…”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Trim the moustaches and leave the beards to grow – Do the opposite of the Majoos.”</strong> {Reported by Muslim]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. Beware of supplicating and calling out to other than Allaah, such as calling to deceased people or others not present. This is from the types of Shirk that Allaah has forbidden in His saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And do not call besides Allaah that which can neither bring you benefit nor cause you harm. If you do that, then you will be from the wrong-doers.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is meant by <strong>“wrong-doers”</strong> in this ayah are the polytheists (those who commit shirk). If a Muslim commits Shirk, his good deeds become nullified and his Hajj is lost, as Allaah says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And if you commit Shirk, We will surely cancel out your good deeds and you will indeed be from the losers.”</strong> [Surah Az-Zumar: 65]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Beware of <em>Riyaa</em>,</strong></span> which is doing a deed for the sake of being seen or heard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of this when someone goes to Hajj so that it can be said of him <strong>“Hajji so and so.”</strong> The title Hajji (or Al-Hajj in Arabic) was not a term that was known to the righteous predecessors (Salaf as-Saalih), so we cannot hear from any of them that he said about his brother <strong>“Hajji so and so.”</strong> Rather, this is from the innovations of those in recent times. So have sincerity in your Hajj and say as Allaah’s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O Allaah, (this is) a Hajj with no <em>riyaa </em>or <em>sam’ah</em> in it.”</strong> [2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. Increase in your recitation of the Qur’aan and acting on what is in it, your performing of Tawaaf, your sending of Salaat on the Prophet. And make a lot of supplication, especially at night, because Allaah’s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Whoever wakes in the night and says when he awakens: ‘<em>Laa Ilaaha IllAllaah wahdahu laa shareeka lahu. Lahul-Mulk wa lahul-Hamd wa Huwa ‘alaa Kulli shay’in Qadeer. SubhaanAllaah wal-Hamdu Lillaah wa Laa Ilaaha IllAllah wa-Allaahu Akbar wa laa Hawla wa laa Quwata Illaa Billaah</em>.’[3] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And then he says: ‘<em>Allaahumma Ighfir Lee</em>’ or some supplication, he will be answered. And if he makes ablution and prays, his prayer will be accepted.”</strong> [Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s Note: The Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Touching the Black Stone and the Yemeni Corner removes sins.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by At-Timrimidhee and Ibn Khuzaimah and authenticated by Al-Albaanee in his book on Hajj.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Translator’s Note: Riyaa means doing deeds to be seen and Sam’ah means doing deeds to be heard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Translator’s Note: This means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“There is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah – alone and with no partner. To Him belongs the Dominion and the Praise and He is Able over all things. Glory be to Allaah, all praise be to Allaah, and there is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah. And there is no movement nor power except by Allaah’s permission.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The next phrase means: <strong>“O Allaah, forgive me.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:Are there any authentic Hadeeths that mention the virtues of Zamzam water?<strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are Hadeeths which indicate that Zamzam water is noble and blessed. In a Hadeeth confirmed in the Sahih, the Prophet (sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) said about Zamzam water:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed it is blessed, and that like food, it fills.&#8221; (Muslim no. 2473)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in Abu Dawud&#8217;s narration, there is this addition:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And a cure for illness.&#8221; (Abu Dawud At-Tiyalsi 2nd Volume no. 61)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this Hadeeth proves its virtues, that it is a <strong>filling food, a cure for illness, and that it is blessed.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sunnah is to drink it as the Prophet (sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) drank it, but it is also <em><strong>permissible to make ablution with it, to use it to purify yourself after you have relieved yourself, and if necessary, to take a shower using it when you are Junub (impure).</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is confirmed that on one occasion, water poured forth from between the Prophet&#8217;s fingers, and then people took what they needed from that water, using it to drink, to make ablution, to wash their clothes, or to purify themselves after relieving themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zamzam water may not be the same as the water that poured forth from between the Prophet&#8217;s fingers, but it is also not more blessed, for each has its place as pure water. If it is permissible to use the water that miraculously poured forth from between the Prophet&#8217;s fingers for all the purposes mentioned above, then it is also permissible in the case of Zamzam.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> </b><b> Q 11:</b><b> What is the ruling on a person who performs `Umrah (lesser pilgrimage) before Hajj, although the former is only an act of Sunnah? </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> A: </b><span style="color:#008000;">The correct view of the two rulings of the scholars is that `Umrah is obligatory, because Allah states:Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 196<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" /><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span style="color:#008000;"> And perform properly (i.e. all the ceremonies according to the ways of Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him) the Hajj and â€˜Umrah (i.e. the pilgrimage to Makkah) for AllÃ¢h. </span></a><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" />There are also other Hadiths narrated in this regard. If a Muslim performs `Umrah before Hajj during the months of Hajj and performs Hajj in the same year, then he has performed Tamattu` Hajj (combining Hajj and `Umrah with a break in between) which is better than the Ifrad Hajj (performing Hajj only) and Qiran Hajj (combining Hajj and `Umrah simultaneously) for the one who has not brought a hadiy with him. It is reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) told the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) who did not bring sacrificial animals:<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" /><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span style="color:#008000;"> Make it `Umrah, for if I had formerly known what I came to know lately, I would not have driven the Hadiy with me and would have finished the state of Ihram along with the people when they finished it. </span></a><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" /></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fatwa by Shaykh Ibn Baz Fatawa Islamiyah , Darussalam, Vol 4, Page 127</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q. Is it better for the Muhrim to cover the two shoulders or to uncover one of them during the Ihram?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. The sunnah for the Muhrim is that he places the Rida&#8217; (upper garment) over both of his shoulders and put its ends on his chest. This is the Sunnah and it is what the Prophet (Sallalahu Alahi wa Sallam) did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if the person wants to perform the Tawaf of Arrival (Tawaful-Qudum) , he does Al-Idhtiba&#8217;. This is by him placing the center of his Rida&#8217; under his right armpit and its edges over his left shoulder. Thus he uncovers his right shoulder. This is specifically for the Tawaf of Arrival, meaning when the person first arrives in Makkah for Hajj or &#8216;Umrah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then when he completes the Tawaf, he adjusts the Rida&#8217; and places it over both of his shoulders, and he prays two Rak&#8217;ahs of Tawaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The person who always keeps one shoulder uncovered, this is opposed to the Sunnah, and so is uncovering both of the shoulders. The Sunnah is only to cover both of them with the Rida&#8217; while the person is in Ihram. If the person takes off the Rida&#8217; and does not cover his shoulders while he is sitting or eating or talking with his brothers, there is no harm in that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the Sunnah is that when the person wears the Rida&#8217;, it should be over his two shoulders and its ends should be on his chest.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Iltizaam Between The Corner And The Door</b> ( from Rites of Hajj and Umrah &#8211; by Shaik Nasiruddin Albanee )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">38. And he may cling to the place between the corner and the Door &#8211; placing his chest and face and forearms upon this place.(45)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is narrated by two isnaads from the Prophet by which the hadith reaches the level of hasan &#8211; and is increased in strength by the fact that a group of the Sahaabah acted on it &#8211; from them Ibn &#8216;Abbaas &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with him &#8211; who said: &#8220;<strong>This is the Multazam between the Corner and the Door</strong>. And it is authentically narrated from &#8216;Urwah ibn az-Zubair also &#8211; see &#8216;As-Sahaabah, no.2138.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Ibn Taimiyyah said in his &#8216;Mansak&#8217; (p.387): &#8220;And if he wishes to come to the Multazam &#8211; and that is what is between the Black stone and the Door &#8211; and he places upon it his chest and face and forearms and hands &#8211; and makes du&#8217;aa &#8211; and he asks Allaah for whatever he needs &#8211; then he may do so. And he may do so before the Farewell Tawaaf there being no difference in this being at that time or any other &#8211; and the Sahaabah used to do so when they entered Makkah &#8211; and if he stands near the Door making du&#8217;aa without iltizaam of the House then that is also good, and when he leaves he does not stand or turn or walk backwards.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen</strong> (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a matter concerning which the scholars differed, although it was not narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) (i.e. that was not narrated in a saheeh hadeeth, as the ahaadeeth that were narrated concerning this were deemed to be da’eef or weak). Rather it was narrated from some of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them). So is iltizaam (clinging) Sunnah? When should it be done – upon arrival or when about to leave, or at any time?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason for this difference of opinion among the scholars is that it is not narrated in the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), rather the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) used to do that when they arrived in Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fuqaha’ said: He (the pilgrim) should do that when about to leave, and should cling to the multazam, which is the area between the corner where the Black Stone is located and the door…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Based on this, there is nothing wrong with iltizaam (clinging to the Ka’bah in this area) so long as that does not involve annoying others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 7/402, 403.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">

<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Ajwa Dates Keep Away Harm, Poison And Magic</h3>
<p>Ajwa (عجوة) is a soft dry variety of date fruit from Saudi Arabia. It is cultivated at Madina . A delightfully soft and fruity date with fine texture.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) said, “Whoever has seven Ajwa dates every morning he will not be harmed on that day by poison or magic.” [Saheeh al-Bukhaaree (5445) (5768) (5769) (5779)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) said, “Ajwa dates are from paradise.” [Tirmidhee (2068) he said hasan Saheeh and it was authenticated by Shaikh al-Albaani].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Referring to eating seven Ajwa dates, the Messenger (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) said, “He will not be harmed by anything until he reaches the evening.” [Saheeh Muslim (2047)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These dates cost around 70 Saudi Riyals per KiloGram.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are also &#8220;imitations&#8221; or some sold an inferior quality dates and &#8220;conned&#8221; the customers as &#8220;AJWA dates&#8221; To know whether its AJWA, look closely at the dates. There are very fine white lines on the dates.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Madina Dates Keep Away Harm</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) said, “Whoever has seven dates between the two areas (the east and west of Madina) as soon as he wakes up every morning, he will not be harmed on that day by poison until the evening.” [Saheeh Muslim (154) (2047)].</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Dates In One’s Home</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) said, “O Aisha! A house that has no dates in it their family is hungry. Oh Aisha! A house that has no dates in it their family is hungry.” [Saheeh Muslim (153), (2046)]</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Innovations of Hajj, Umrah and visiting Medina</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I decided to add an appendix, setting forth the innovations regarding Hajj and visiting Madinat-ul-Munawwara, and Bait-ul-Maqdis (Jerusalem) (118) as many people do not know these things and so fall into them &#8211; so I wished to advise them by explaining and warning them against these things &#8211; as Allaah the Blessed and Exalted does not accept any action unless it fulfils two conditions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Firstly: That it done sincerely for the Face of Allaah, the Honored, the Exalted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Secondly: That it is correct &#8211; and it is not correct until it is in accordance with the Sunnah, not at variance with it &#8211; and as the people of knowledge have agreed &#8211; everything claimed by the people to be part of worship which Rasoolullah did not prescribe by his saying, nor drew nearer to Allaah by performing it &#8211; then that is at variance with his Sunnah as his Sunnah is of two kinds:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) Sunnah of action (Sunnah Fi&#8217;liyyah &#8211; actions which he did) and<br />
(b) Sunnah of neglect (Sunnah Tarkiyyah) &#8211; acts which he did not do)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those things pertain to worship, the Prophet did not do &#8211; then it is from the Sunnah to leave them &#8211; for example: calling Adhaan for the &#8216;Eid prayers and for burying the dead, even though it is a means of making mentioning of Allaah and glorifying Him, it is not permissible do it as a means of drawing nearer to Allah, the Exalted, the Glorious &#8211; and that is only because it is something which Rasoolullah refrained from doing &#8211; and this point was understood by his companions &#8211; so they often warred against innovation in general &#8211; as is mentioned in its proper place &#8211; and Hudhaufah ibn al Yamaan (ra) said: &#8220;Every worship that has not been done by the companions of Rasoolullah, then do not do it.&#8221; And Ibn Mas&#8217;ood (ra)said: &#8220;Follow (the Sunnah) and do not innovate, and that is enough for you &#8211; stick to the old way.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how fortunate is the one to whom Allaah gives the good fortune of making his worship sincerely for Him and following of the Sunnah of His Prophet (sas) in it &#8211; not mixing it with innovation &#8211; for such a one then let him have good tidings of Allaah&#8217;s acceptance of his obedience &#8211; and his admission to His Paradise. May Allah make us those who bear the word and follow the best of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And you should know that these innovations are traceable to the following factors:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) Weak (da&#8217;eef) Ahaadith &#8211; which are not permitted to be used as evidence, nor is it, according to your saying, permissible to act on them &#8211; as I have explained in the introduction of &#8216;Sifat-Salaat un-Nabee&#8217; (The Prophet&#8217;s Manner of Prayer) &#8211; and this is the position of a group of the people of knowledge &#8211; from them Ibn Taimiyya.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) Fabricated (maudoo&#8217;) Ahaadith &#8211; or narrations which have no basis &#8211; some scholars remaining unaware of their true nature &#8211; and therefore basing religious verdicts upon them &#8211; their being the core of innovation and novelties!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(iii) The decisions of some scholars or their regarding certain things to be commendable &#8211; especially the later scholars &#8211; not basing these on any proofs (from the Qur&#8217;an of Sunnah), rather treating them as indisputable matters &#8211; until they become Sunnahs adhered to and followed. And it will not remain hidden from one who has insight into his religion &#8211; that it is not correct to follow such things -as nothing is part of the Sharee&#8217;ah except what Allaah has prescribed &#8211; and it is enough for the one who makes something desirable &#8211; if he is mujtahid &#8211; that it is permissible for him to act according to what he sees as desirable &#8211; and that Allaah will not punish him for that &#8211; But as for other people taking that as something prescribed and as Sunnah &#8211; then not definitely not! And how can that be when some of these things conflict with the Sunnah &#8211; as will be noted later of Allaah wills?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(iv) Customs and superstitions which have no evidence from the Sharee&#8217;ah, and are not even supported by the intellect &#8211; even if some ignorant people act upon them and take them to be part of the sharee&#8217;ah &#8211; sometimes finding support from others &#8211; sometimes from some people claiming to be from the people of knowledge &#8211; and actually having their appearance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then you should know that the danger of these innovations is not of one level &#8211; rather they are of different degrees. Some of them being clear shirk and kufr &#8211; as you will see, and some of them are less than that &#8211; however, you must be aware that the slightest innovation that someone brings into the religion is haraam (forbidden) after it is exposed as an innovation &#8211; as there is no innovation that is only makrooh (disapproved), as some people think &#8211; and how can that be when Rasoolullah (sas) said: &#8220;Every innovation is a going astray. And every going astray is in the Fire&#8221;. That is the one who does it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Imaam ash-Shaatibee has fully explained this point in his important book &#8216;Al I&#8217;tisaam&#8217; &#8211; and because of this the innovation is something very dangerous &#8211; and most people remain heedless of this, except for a small group of the people of knowledge and enough as a proof of the seriousness of innovation is the saying of the Prophet : &#8220;Verily Allah has refused to admit the repentance of anyone committing an innovation, until he gives up the innovation&#8221;. Narrated by Tabraanee and ad-Diyaa-ul-Maqdisee in &#8216;al Ahaadith ul-Mukhtaarah&#8217; and others &#8211; with saheeh isnaad &#8211; and was declared by al-Mundharee to be hasan. (119)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I complete this with word of advice which I convey to the readers from a great Imaam from the first scholars of the Muslims &#8211; Shaikh Hasan ibn &#8216;Ali al Barbahaaree &#8211; one of the companions of Imaam Ahmad &#8211; and died in the year 329 H, he &#8211; may Allaah be please with him &#8211; said: &#8220;And beware of the smallest of the newly-invented matters, as the small innovations due to repetition become large innovations, and in that way every innovation introduced in this Ummah began as a small innovation &#8211; resembling something correct and thus is the one who falls into it enticed &#8211; then he is not able to leave it &#8211; some of it grows and becomes part of the religion, practiced as such. So examine &#8211; may Allaah have mercy upon you &#8211; everything that people of your time say and do not made haste (in accepting it) until you ask and find out: Did any of the companions of the Prophet or any of the people of knowledge speak about it? So if you find a narration from the, then accept it and do not leave it for anything &#8211; and do not prefer anything- and do not prefer anything over it and thus fall into the Fire. And you should know &#8211; may Allaah have mercy upon you &#8211; that a worshipper&#8217;s Islaam is not complete until he is follower (of proof), consenting and submitting (to the Truth). So whoever claims that anything remains of Islaam which the companions of Rasoolullah did not fully explain to us &#8211; then he has invented a lie against them, and that is enough for him that he has reviled them &#8211; so he is an innovator, misguided and misguiding, introducing into Islaam what does not belong to it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Al-Albaani) say : And may Allah have mercy upon Imaam Maalik who said : &#8220;The last part of this Ummah will not be corrected except by that which corrected its beginning, so that which was not part of the religion then &#8211; is not part of the religion today.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And may Allah send blessing upon our Prophet (sas) who said : &#8220;I have not left any thing that will draw you nearer to Allah &#8211; except that I have enjoined it upon you. And I have not left anything that will take you away from Allah and draw you to the Fire except that I have forbidden it for you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And all praise is for Allaah by Whose blessing Good actions are completed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Innovations Before Ihraam</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Abstaining from travel in the month of Safar, and abstaining from beginning any action such as marriage or building in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Abstaining from travel in the second half of the month or because the moon is positioned in the constellation of the Scorpion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Abstaining from cleaning the house and sweeping it because a traveller is about to leave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Praying two ra&#8217;kahs when leaving for Hajj &#8211; reciting in the first Surat-ul-Kaafiroon and in the second Surat-ul-Ikhlaas, then after finishing saying : &#8220;O Allaah I have gone out for You and am heading towards You&#8230;&#8221; then reciting Ayat-ul-Kursi and Surat-ul-Ikhlaas, and the Last two surahs &#8211; and other things which occur in certain fiqh books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Praying four ra&#8217;kahs before leaving.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. Reciting by the one intending Hajj of the end of Surah Al Imraan, Ayat ul Kursi, Surat uz-Zilzall a and Surat ul-Faatihah -when leaving the house &#8211; claiming that thus will all his problems of this world and the next solved.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. Making Dhikr and Takbeer loudly upon the leaving or arrival of the pilgrims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. Giving adhaan upon departure of the pilgrims.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">170. Their claim that there is in the rock the Prophet&#8217;s fooprint, and the trace of his `imaamah (turban) and some of them think that it is the footprint of the Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">171. Visiting the place which they claim is the cradle of Isa &#8211; peace be upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">172. They claim that the Siraat (Bridge) and the Scales (meezan) are there, and that the wall that will be placed between the people of Pradise and the people of the Fire is the wall built to the east of the mosque.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">173. Venerating the rock where al-Buraaq is alleged to have been tethered or its place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">174. Praying by the grave of Ibrahim &#8211; peace be upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">175. Gathering in Masjid ul Aqsa at the time of Hajj to sing and play the &#8216;Daff&#8217; (an instrument made of a small circle of wood with a skin stretched over one side).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and this is all that I have been able to gather from innovations of Hajj and visiting. I ask Allaah the Blessed and Most High to make it an aid to the Muslims in giving preference to and following the example of the best of the Messengers and accepting his guidance.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">2. As is the case with most pilgrims these days &#8211; and it is very rare for one of them to bring the sacrificial animal along with him as the Prophet did. So he who does so, then there is no blame upon him &#8211; however one who does not bring it with him and still does Hajj Qaarin or Faarid &#8211; then he has gone against the Prophet&#8217;s action and his command &#8211; even though the people may be averse to this point. As Ibn Abbas said- reported by Muslim(4/58) and AHmad(1/278,342).</span></p>

And his basis for saying that is the saying of the Prophet: Verily Allaah has entered the &#8216;Umrah into this Hajj of yours, so when you come &#8211; then he who has made tawaaf of the House and between Safaa and Marwah &#8211; then he has become Halaal(left iHraam) except he who had the sacrificial animal with him.(Sahih A.D., nos.1573,1580).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">5. And that does not negate what is narrated from &#8216;Umar and others that Hajj Muffrad is better because of what I have stated in the Original.

If she pulls it up to her eyes then it is called &#8216;Al-Waswasah&#8217; or &#8216;Al-Burqa&#8217;. If she pulls it down to below the eye socket then it is &#8216;Al-Niqaab&#8217;, and if it is upon the end of her nose it is &#8216;Al-Lukfaam&#8217;.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">42. Al-Idtibaa&#8217; is bid&#8217;ah before this tawaaf, and after it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">43. Abu Dawud and others. Authenticated by many scholars. See Saheeh Abi Dawud,(no.1653).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">44. Shaikh ul Islaam ibn Taimiyyah says: &#8220;As for the other parts of the House, and the Place of Ibraheem, and whatever is in the rest of the world mosques and their walls, and the graves of the prophets and good people &#8211; like the room of our Prophet, and cave of Ibraheem, and the place where our Prophet used to pray &#8211; and all other such places, and the rock at Jerusalem, then none of these are to be touched at all or kissed &#8211; by total agreement of the scholars. And as for tawaaf of these things &#8211; then it is one of the greatest and most forbidden bid&#8217;ahs &#8211; and he who takes that as part of his religion should be asked to repent &#8211; and if he refuses he killed&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">And &#8216;Abdur Razzaaq (no.8945) and AHmad and al-Baihaqi port from Ya&#8217;laa ibn Umayyah who said: &#8220;I made tawaaf with Umar ibn ul-Khattaab ( and in a narration: with &#8216;Uthuzza) &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with him &#8211; so when I came to the corner of the Door I started to touch it so he said &#8216;Have you not made tawaaf with Rasoolullaah?&#8217; I said: Yes. He said: &#8216;Then did you see him touch it?&#8217; I said: No. He said: &#8216;Then do likewise for there is for you in Rasoolullah a good example'&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">45. This is narrated by two isnaads from the Prophet by which the hadith reaches the level of hasan &#8211; and is increased in strength by the fact that a group of the Sahaabah acted on it &#8211; from them Ibn &#8216;Abbaas &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with him &#8211; who said: &#8220;This is the Multazam between the Corner and the Door. And it is authentically narrated from &#8216;Urwah ibn az-Zubair also &#8211; see &#8216;As-Sahaabah, no.2138. And Ibn Taimiyyah said in his &#8216;Mansak&#8217; (p.387): &#8220;And if he wishes to come to the Multazam &#8211; and that is what is between the Black stone and the Door &#8211; and he places upon it his chest and face and forearms and hands &#8211; and makes du&#8217;aa &#8211; and he asks Allaah for whatever he needs &#8211; then he may do so. And he may do so before the Farewell Tawaaf there being no difference in this being at that time or any other &#8211; and the Sahaabah used to do so when they entered Makkah &#8211; and if he stands near the Door making du&#8217;aa without iltizaam of the House then that is also good, and when he leaves he does not stand or turn or walk backwards.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">46. At-Tirmidhee and others, and the other narration is Tabraanis. And it is Saheeh: See also &#8216;Al-Irwaa&#8217; (no.21). Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah said: &#8220;And there is no particular dhikr narrated from the Prophet, not by his order, or his saying, or by his teaching, rather he should make du&#8217;aa with any authentic du&#8217;aas &#8211; and the particular du&#8217;aas which many people mention like that for below the water-spout, etc. &#8211; there is no basis for them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">47. Bukharee and Muslim from Abu Hurairah, and Tirmidhee from &#8216;Alee and Ibn &#8216;Abbaas &#8211; see &#8216;Al-Irwaa'(no.1102)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">48. Bukharee and Muslim from &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah, and Bukharee from Jaabir &#8211; and the addition is his. See &#8216;Al-Irwaa'(no.191).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">49. See the Introduction and the Original Book, (pp.21,23 and 135).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">50. Saheeh hadith &#8211; as a number of scholars have said. see &#8216;Al-Irwaa&#8217; (no.1123) and &#8216;as-Saheehah&#8217; (no.883).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">51. Saheeh hadith narrated by at-Tayaalisee and others. See &#8216;as-Saheehah&#8217; (no.1056).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">52. Narrated by &#8216;ad-Diyaa&#8217; in &#8216;Al-Mukhtaarah&#8217; and others. See &#8216;as-Saheehah&#8217; (no.1056)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">53. It is not easy these days to see the Ka&#8217;bah except from certain points on as-Safa; it can be seen from the pillar which supports the second storey of the mosque, so he who is able to do so has attained the Sunnah, and if not then let him try his best and there is no harm.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">54. (An-Nawawi) adds in &#8216;Al-Adhkaar&#8217;: Laa ilaaha illallaahu walaa na&#8217;budu illaa iyyaahu, and I do not find this addition in any narration of the hadith- either Muslim or anyone else who records the hadith&#8230;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">55. That is after the tahleels &#8211; making du&#8217;aa for whatever he wishes from the good of this world and the Hereafter &#8211; and the best thing is that it should be something reported from the Prophet or the pious predecessors (ssalaf ul-Saalih).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">56. And contrary to what some mistakenly say it is a sahih hadith. See &#8216;Al-Irwaa'(no.1072).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">57. Reported by an-Nasaa&#8217;ee and others &#8211; see &#8216;Al-Hajj ul-Kabeer. Note:The following text appears in &#8216;al-Mughnee&#8217;of Ibn Qudaamah al-Maqdisee (3/394): &#8220;And all the woman&#8217;s tawaaf and sa&#8217;ee is done walking, Ibn al-Mundhir says: Scholars are agreed that there is no reaml(walking quickly) upon the women around the Ka&#8217;bah or between Safaa and Marwah &#8211; nor uncovering the right shoulder (idtibaa&#8217;). And that is because the principle of it is uncovering the skin &#8211; and that is not desired from women &#8211; what is required from them is to cover &#8211; and in walking quickly (raml) and idtibaa&#8217; uncovering occurs.&#8221; And in &#8216;Al-Majmoo&#8217; of an-Nawawee(8/75) there appears what shows that there is difference of opinion in the matter between the Shafi&#8217;i scholars, he says:&#8221; There are two sayings in that. Firstly, and this is correct upon which the Jumhoor (majority) of scholars agree: That she should not run at all &#8211; but walk whether in the night or day. Secondly, that it is mutahabb for her to run at night when there is no one around (to see her) in the place of running &#8211; just as for men.&#8221; I (Al-Albanee) say: &#8220;And perhaps that is more cprrect &#8211; as the origin of sa&#8217;ee (running) is the sa&#8217;ee of Haajar mother of Imaa&#8217;eel &#8211; seeking water for her thirsty son as occurs in the hadith of Ibn &#8216;Abbaas: &#8220;And she found as-Safaa to be the nearest hill to her so she stood upon it, then turned towards the river-bed to see if she could see anyone &#8211; so she went down from as-Safaa till she reached the river-bed, raising up the border of her dress &#8211; and running fast till she crossed the river-bed then she came to Marwah and stood upon it to see if she could see anyone, and she could not see anyone &#8211; and she did that seven times. Ibn &#8216;Abbaas said: The Prophet said:&#8217;And that is the sa&#8217;ee of the people between these two'&#8221;. (Narrated by Bukharee in the Book of the Prophets)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">58. As for seeing the Ka&#8217;bah &#8211; it is not possible now because of the building between it and the Ka&#8217;bah &#8211; so should try his best to face the Ka&#8217;bah and not do as the confused people do, who raise up their eyes and hands to the sky!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">59. Narrated by Abu Nu&#8217;aim in his &#8216;Mustakhraj of Sahih Muslim&#8217;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">60. Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaibah(4/68.69) from Ibn Mas&#8217;ood and Ibn &#8216;Umar &#8211; May Allah be pleased with them &#8211; with two sahih isnaads. And from Al-Musayyib ibn Raafi&#8217; al-Kaahilee and &#8216;Urwah ibn az-Zubair. And at-Tabraani narrates it from the Prophet but its isnaad is da&#8217;eef (weak) &#8211; &#8216;Al-Mujmi'(3/248).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">61. Or shaves it if there is sufficient time between his &#8216;Umrah and Hajj for his hair to grow enough (see Fath ul Baari,3/444).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">62. Narrated by Bukharee and Muslim</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">63. 64. 63,64. This stopping and that after it may be difficult to perform these days due to the crowd of people, so if he goes past it to &#8216;Arafah then it is alright insh&#8217;allah. Shaikh ul Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah says in &#8216;al-Fataawaa&#8217; (26:128): As for that which is from the sunnah of Rasoolullah &#8211; staying in Minaa on Yaum -ut-Tarwiyyah and for that night, then stopping at &#8216;Urahah&#8217;, which is between the Mash&#8217;ar ul Haraam and going from there to &#8216;Arafah, and the giving of Khutbah and the two prayers on the way in the middle of &#8216;Uranah&#8217;- then this is as agreed upon by scholars &#8211; whereas many writers do not bring it to notice &#8211; and most people do not know due to the prevalence of invented practices.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">65. I say: &#8220;And also it is not reported that the Prophet prayed anything before Zuhr or after &#8216;Asr in this place &#8211; or in any of his journeys &#8211; and it is not established that he prayed any supplementary prayers in any of his journeys except the two sunnahs of Fajr and the Witr.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">66. Bukharee narrates it from Ibn &#8216;Umar with mu&#8217;allaq isnaad. See &#8216;Mukhtasar-al-Bukhari'(3/89/25).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">67. Hasan or Sahih hadith. With more than one isnaad &#8211; refer to &#8216;As-Saheehah,(no.1503)&#8217;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">68. As that is established from the Prophet &#8211; as is explained in the Original.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">69. Narrated by Muslim and others. See &#8216;At-Targheeb'(2/129).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">70. Narrated by AHmad and others &#8211; and authenticated by a number of scholars &#8211; as I have explained in &#8216;Takhreej ut-Targheeb&#8217;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">71. This was said ny Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah, its being established from the Prophet and his companions, in al-Bukhari (25/94/801) (Mukhtasar al-Bukhari).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">72. Ibn Taimiyyah says: &#8220;And when he reaches Muzdalifah he prays Maghrib before making the camels kneel down if possible, then after making them kneel they pray &#8216;Ishaa &#8211; and if they delay the &#8216;Ishaa somewhat then there is no harm.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">73. As for the addition &#8220;Allahummaj&#8217;alhu Hajjan mabrooran&#8230;.&#8221; which some writers mention &#8211; it is not established from the Prophet as I have explained in &#8216;Ad-Daee&#8217;fah&#8217; (no.1107).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">74. Narrated in Ibn Khuzaimah&#8217;s &#8216;Saheeh&#8217; &#8211; where he says: Hadith saheeh, and explaining with this narration what is unclear in others and that what is intended by &#8216;until he stoned Jamrat ul &#8216;Aqabah&#8217; is &#8216;finished stoning it&#8217; (Fath ul Baaree, no.1426).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">75. And this point has been fully explained in the Original &#8211; so refer to that if you wish to receive the proof of the matter (p.30).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">76. And this hadith is sahih and has been authenticated by a number of scholars, from among them Ibn ul Qayyim, as I have explained in &#8216;Sahih Abi Dawud&#8217; (no.1745). And when some of the distinguished scholars came upon this hadith before the spread of this treatise- they regarded it as something strange &#8211; some of them quickly declaring it to be weak &#8211; as I myself did in some of my earlier works &#8211; based upon Abu Dawud&#8217;s isnaad &#8211; eventhough Ibn ul Qayyim strengthened it in his &#8216;Tahdheeb&#8217; of Abi Dawud, and as did Al-Haafiz (Ibn Hajr) in &#8216;At-Talkhees&#8217; &#8211; by keeping silent about it. And I have found other chains of narration for it which will convince anyone looking into the matter of its being raised from the level of da&#8217;eef to level of its being saheeh. However due to there being in a reference work not in common use by the large majority &#8211; and that is Imaam at-Tahaawis &#8216;Sharh Ma&#8217;aanee ul &#8216;Athaar&#8217;- these people quickly declared its something strange or being da&#8217;eef and they were encouraged in this by the fact that they found that some of the earlier scholars had said: &#8216;And I do not know any scholar who has ruled according to that.&#8217; And that is a negation of something &#8211; it is not a piece of definite known amongst the scholars that lack of knowledge of something does not mean absence of knowledge of it. So when a hadith is established to have come from Rasoolullah and is a relevant proof &#8211; as this is &#8211; then it is obligatory to act upon it straight away, not waiting to see if the scholars know of it or not, just as Imaam ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee said &#8220;A narration is to be accepted as soon as it is confirmed even if none of the scholars are acting upon it like the narrations which they accept &#8211; for the hadith of Rasoolullah is confirmed on its own not by anyone&#8217;s acting on it afterwards.&#8221; I say: So the hadith of Rasoolullah is above needing to be attested to by the actions of scholars according to it, as it is a source (of knowledge) by itself, judging not being judged. And along with that, indeed, some of the scholars have acted upon this particular hadith &#8211; from them &#8216;Urwah ibn az-Zubair &#8211; the greatest Taabi&#8217;ee &#8211; so can there remain any excuse for anyone to leave action according to this hadith: So verily therein is a warning for any who have a perceptive heart or listens attentively. And this is more fully explained in the Original. And you should be aware that the stoning of the Jamrah is for the pilgrims as the &#8216;Eid prayer for the rest of the people, therefore, Imaam AHmad liked that the time for the &#8216;Eid prayer in different parts should be that of the time of sacrifice in Minaa, And the Prophet gave Khutbah on the Day of Sacrifice after the stoning just as he used to give the Khutbah in Madinah after &#8216;Eid prayer &#8211; so some people holding it as being desirable to offer &#8216;Eid prayer in Minaa, taking as their evidence the word of general profs or analogy &#8211; is a mistake and neglect of the Sunnah &#8211; As neither the Prophet nor the khulafaa after him ever prayed the &#8216;Eid prayer at Minaa. See &#8216;Fatawaa Ibn Taimiyyah'(26:180).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">77. I say: And there is in this hadith two great allowancesfor the pilgrims &#8211; and a solution for most of the problems of the piling up of slaughtered animals in the slaughter- house &#8211; which has led to those in control there to have to bury some in the earth &#8211; and he who wishes to see the matter more fully laid out should return to the Original (pp.82-988).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">78. And there is a hadith from the Prophet narrated by Jaabir &#8211; reported by Abu Dawud and others &#8211; see &#8216;AL-Irwaa'(no.1138) and another by Baihaqee (9/289). And it is narrated from Ibn &#8216;Umar that he liked the animal to be made to face the Qiblah when slaughtered. And Abdur-Razzaaq(no.8585) narrates with sahih isnaad from ibn &#8216;Umar, that he disliked to eat from an animal slaughtered facing other than the Qiblah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">79. Al-Haafiz (Ibn Hajr) says (10/16): &#8220;That it will be easier for the one slaughtering to take the knife in his right hand, and to hold its head with his left.&#8221; I say: And causing it to die down and placing the foot on its side is what is narrated by Bukharee and Muslim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">80. Sahih Abi Dawud (no.1550). And there is after it a supporting hadith from Ibn&#8217;Umar like it &#8211; narrated by Bukharee and Muslim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">81. Narrated by Maalik with sahih isnaad reaching Ibn &#8216;Umar and Bukharee brings it in a chapter heading while signifying its authenticity Mukhtasar of Bukharee no.330).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">82. Reported by Abu Dawud and others narrated by Jaabir &#8211; and it has support from the hadith of Abu Sa&#8217;eed al Khudnee reported by Abu Ya&#8217;laa &#8211; as occurs in &#8216;al-Majma&#8217; (4/22) &#8211; see &#8220;Al-Irwaa&#8217; (no.1118).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">83. Reported by Muslim and others from &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah &#8211; see &#8216;AL-Irwaa&#8217; &#8211; and Ibn Taimiyyah in his book &#8216;Al-Mansik&#8217; added: &#8220;&#8230;&#8230;..(As You accepted from Ibrahim whom You took as a chosen friend)&#8221;, and I cannot find it in any of the books of Sunnah which are with me.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">84. Reported by Bukharee with mu&#8217;allaq isnaad (see Glossary). Its isnaad is joined by Abu Dawud and others. See Sahih Abi Dawud (nos.1700,1701).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">85. Reported by AHmad, authenticated by Ibn Hibbaan, and I hold it to be authentic due to its multiple lines of transmission. See &#8216;As-Saheehah'(no.2476).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">86. Al Qaani&#8217; is the one who asks. And Al Mu&#8217;tarr is the one who begs by displaying the weakness of his body.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">87. Narrated by Bukharee and others. See &#8216;Irwa ul Ghaleel&#8217; (no.964). As for Ibn Taimiyyah&#8217;s saying (p.388) &#8220;And the Mutamatti&#8217; must fast part of the three days before putting of the iHraam for Hajj on the Day of Tarwiyya&#8221; &#8211; I do not know any proof for it. Rather it seems to go against the clear meaning of the ayah and hadith, and Allah knows best.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">88. Reported by Bukharee and Muslim and others from the hadith of Ibn &#8216;Umar and others &#8211; see &#8216;Al-Irwaa&#8217; (no.1084).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">89. Reported by Muslim and others, see &#8216;Al-Irwaa&#8217; (no.1089), and Sahih Abi Dawud (no.1730). And this is one of those matters in which Ibn al Hammaam the Hanaafi scholar agrees that the Hanaafi scholars have gone against the Sunnah. So what have the blind followers to say of that?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">90. Sahih hadith &#8211; &#8216;Al Ahaadith us-Saheehah&#8217; (no.605), Sahih Abi Dawud (no.1732).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">91. Ibn Taimiyyah says: &#8220;And if he shortens it he draws it together and shortens it up to the length of a finger joint or less &#8211; or more, and the woman does not shorten in excess of that &#8211; as for the man he may shorten it as much as he pleases.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">92. Report by Bukharee and Abu Dawud from a number of the companions &#8211; see Sahih Abi Dawud (nos.1705,1707,1709,1710) and &#8216;Mukhtasar ul-Bukharee&#8217; (no.847).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">93. Narrated by Bukharee with mu&#8217;allaq isnaad &#8211; connected by Abu Dawud. See Sahih Abi Dawud (no.1700) and &#8216;Irwaa ul Ghaleel&#8217; (no.1064).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">94. 95. 94,95. Narrated by Abu Dawud and others. See Sahih Abi Dawud (no.1710)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">96. Narrated by Bukharee with mu&#8217;allaq isnaad. Connected by Ibn Abi Shaibah and others. See &#8216;Mukhtasar al Bukharee&#8217; (no.319,1/p.386).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">97. Narrated by Bukharee with mu&#8217;allaq isnaad. Connected by Abdur-Razzaaq. See &#8216;Mukhtasar al Bukharee'(no.318).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">98. Narrated by &#8216;Abd ur-Razzaaq (no.9012) with sahih isnaad from Ibn &#8216;Umar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">99. I say: And Allaah knows better which of them Rasoolullah did &#8211; and it may be that he prayed twice with them &#8211; the first being Fard and the second nafl as he did in some of his battles.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">100. 101. 102. 100,101,102. All of this is established in the hadith of Ibn Mas&#8217;ood reported by Bukharee and Muslim and others &#8211; and as for what occurs in some Hajj books that he should face the Qiblah upon stoning Jamrat-ul-Aqabah, then that contradicts this authentic hadith &#8211; and whatever contradicts it is shaadh (Glossary), or rather munkar (Glossary) as I have explained in &#8216;Ad-Da&#8217;eefah'(no.4864).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">103. Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah says: &#8220;So if the sun sets and he is still in Minaa &#8211; then he must remain for the stoning on the third day&#8221;. I say: And the great majority of scholars agree on that &#8211; contrary to what Ibn Hazm says in &#8216;Al-Muhallaa&#8217; (7.185). And An-Nawaawi drives proof for them(the majority) from what is understood from Allaah ta&#8217;alas saying: faman ta&#8217;ajjala fee yaumaini falaa ithma &#8216;alaihi (8:283): &#8220;And the day (al-Yaum) is a name for the daytime not including the night&#8221;. And using what is confirmed from &#8216;Umar and his son &#8216;Abdullah who both said : &#8220;Whoever is at Minaa on the second day and the evening comes upon him &#8211; then let him stay until the next day and leave together with the people.&#8221; And the wording of &#8216;Al-Muwatta&#8217; from Ibn &#8216;Umar is: &#8220;Then let him not leave until he has stoned the Jamaraat on the next day.&#8221; And Imaam Muhamad in his Muwatta (p.233) narrates it from Imaam Maalik and says: &#8220;And that is what we accept, and it is the saying of Abu Hanifah and people in general.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">104. Reported by Bukharee and Muslim and others &#8211; see &#8216;Al-Irwaa&#8217; (no.1097). And I have pointed out there that my narrating it as being from the hadith of Ibn &#8216;Abbaas in the Original is a mistake.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">105. Reported by Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasaa&#8217;ee and Ibn Maajah &#8211; and authenticated by a group of the scholars. See &#8216;Al-Irwaa'(no.1080).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">106. Hadith hasan reported by Al-Bazzaar and Al-Baihaqi and others from Ibn &#8216;Abbaas &#8211; Ibn Hajr declaring its isnaad to be hasan, and it has supporting narrations which I have quoted in &#8216;As-Saheehah&#8217; (No.2477).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">107. Reported with Mu&#8217;allaq isnaad by Bukharee (Mukhtasar al Bukharee, no.287) joined by a number of scolars whom I have named in &#8216;As-Saheehah&#8217; (no.803).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">108. Reported by Tabraani and Diyaa-al-Maqdisee in &#8216;Al-Mukhtara&#8217; and &#8216;Al-Mundhari&#8217; declares its isnaad to be hasan. And it is as he said as it has another chain of transmission as I have shown in &#8216;Tahdheer us-Saajid&#8230;&#8217; (pp.106-107 2nd edition).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">109. Reported by AHmad and others from the hadith of Jaabir from the Prophet with saheeh isnaad &#8211; and authenticated by a number of scholars whom I have mentioned in &#8216;Al-Irwaa&#8217; (no.1129).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">110. Reported by Tirmidhee and others &#8211; authenticated by Ibn Khuzaimah and Ibn Hibbaan and al-Haakim and others &#8211; see &#8216;Al-Mishkaat&#8217; (no.258) and &#8216;at-Targheeb&#8217; (no.2/120,122).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">111. Reported by Abu Dawud, Tirmidhee, an-Nasaaiee Ibn Maaja and others &#8211; authenticated by Tirmidhee and al-Haakim and adh-Dhahbee &#8211; see &#8216;Al-Irwaa&#8217; (no.481).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">112. Reported by Muslim and others &#8211; and a similar hadith by Bukharee. see &#8216;Al-Irwaa'(no.1086) and &#8216;Saheeh Abi Dawud&#8217; (no.1747).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">113. Established in the hadith of al-Haarith Ibn &#8216;Abdullah Ibn Aus, reported by AHmad and others. See Sahih Abi Dawud (no.1749)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">114. Reported by AHmad with a sahih isnaad to the standard of Bukharee and Muslim &#8211; who also both narrate a similar hadith &#8211; see &#8216;Al-Irwaa&#8217; (no.1086). And they also narrate a witness to it from the hadith of &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah &#8211; see Sahih Abi Dawud (no.1748).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">115. Reported by Bukharee in his &#8216;Taareeq and Tirmidhee who declared it to be hasan &#8211; from the hadith of &#8216;Aa&#8217;isha &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with her &#8211; see &#8216;Al-Ahaadeeth-as-Saheehah&#8217; (no.883).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">116. Reported by Baihaqi with a good sahih isnaad from Jaabir &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with him. And it has an authentic mursal narration as a witness to it reported by &#8216;Abd-ur-Razzaaq in his &#8216;Musannaf'(no.9127). And Ibn Taimiyyah narrates that the salaf used to transport it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">117. See note 24.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">118. May Allaah return it and the rest of the Muslim land to them, and may Allah inspire them to work with the rulings of the religion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">119. See &#8216;Silsilat-ul-Ahaadeeth as-Saheehah&#8217; (no.1620)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">120. And this innovation was stopped many years ago-al-hamdulillah-however the one after it remains in its place and in Al-Baajoorees explanation of Ibn ul-Qaasim (1/41) there occurs: &#8220;And it is forbidden to go for a pleasure trip to see the carrying of the Ka&#8217;bahs covering and the coverings of the Station of Ibrahim,etc.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">121. And this and the one after it are some of the most wicked innovations because of what they contain regarding use of tricks to get around the shaaree&#8217;ah and the risk of falling into shameful actions as is obvious.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">122. see 121.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">123. And it is authentically reported from &#8216;Umar &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with him &#8211; that he saw some people while on the way to Hajj going to a certain place, so he said: What is this? So it was said: A place where Rasoolullah prayed. So he said: In this way where the People of the Book destroyed. They took the places connected with there Prophets as a place of prayer. Whomsoever of you reaches such a place at the time of prayer then let him pray, otherwise he should not do so.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">124. This appears to refer to wiping the face and chest with the two hands resembling a cross.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">125. For the greeting for the Haraam Mosque is tawaaf, then the praying behind the Station of Ibrahim and has preceded from the Prophet, from his action. And see &#8216;Al-Qawaa&#8217;id an-Nooraneeyah&#8217; of Ibn Taimiyyah (pg.101)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">126. What has been authentically reported as a practice of Ibn Mas&#8217;ood and Ibn &#8216;Umar is the same that has preceded (see point no.55).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">127. This du&#8217;aa besides being a novelty also contains that which contradicts the sunnah and that is using as a means of approach to Allaah the &#8216;right of the Mush&#8217;ar-ul-Haraam and the ka&#8217;bah &#8230;&#8217;but rather than one should use Allaahs names and attributes as a means of approach (wasilah) to Him. And the Hanafi scholars have declared that is hated to say: &#8220;Allaah I ask You by the right of the Mash&#8217;aral Haraam&#8230;etc&#8221; As occurs in &#8216;Haashiyat Ibn &#8216;Aa-bideen&#8217; and other books. see &#8216;at-Tawassul&#8217; Anwa&#8217;uhu wa ah-kaamuhu&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">128. And this is one of the worst innovations because of what it involves regarding twisting the shari&#8217;ah which is clearly shown in the Book and Sunnah merely on account of opinion. And the chief responsibility for the lack of total use of the meat lies upon the pilgrims themselves, because they do not when sacrificing take account of the directions of the Wise Legislator &#8211; as is shown in the Original (pg.87-88)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">129. And the Sunnah is to go to visit the mosqe as the Prophet said: do not journey accept to three mosques&#8230;so when he reaches it and prays upon entering then he may go to the grave. And it should be known that traveling to visit his grave &#8211; peace and blessings be upon him &#8211; and other graves is one thing, and visiting without traveling is something else &#8211; contrary to what has become widespread amongst the later people &#8211; among them holders of doctorates who have confused the two &#8211; and have further declared that Ibn Taimiyyah in particular and the salafis in general deny the authenticity of visiting the Prophets graves &#8211; and this is a clear untruth. See the matter fully explained in our refutation of Doctor Bootee who produced a succession of such sayings in the magazine &#8216;Islamic civilization&#8217;. Then I produced a particular treatise called &#8216;in defense of the Prophetic hadith&#8230;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">130. And al-Ghazali-may Allaah have mercy upon him-did well in speaking against this kissing (1/244) and said: &#8220;it is a habit of Christians and Jews&#8221; So is there anyone to take heed?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">131. And what is correct is to say: &#8220;assalaamu&#8217;alaika yaa rasoolullaahi wa rahmatullaahi wa barakaatuhu &#8211; assalaamu &#8216;alaika yaa abaa bakr &#8211; assalaamu &#8216;alaika ya &#8216;umar&#8221; as Ibn &#8216;Umar used to. And if he adds something slight as he feels at the time &#8211; not always doing it &#8211; then it is alright insha&#8217;Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">132. And this is in addition to its being an innovation and exaggeration in religion, and in contradiction to the Prophet&#8217;s saying: Do not take my grave as a festival, and send blessings upon me and it is a reason for many Sunnahs being lost and many benefits &#8211; and that it is the dhikr after the prayer recited after giving salaam &#8211; for they leave all of these and hurry to this innovation So may Allaah have mercy upon the one who said: &#8220;No innovation is brought to life except that a Sunnah is killed off &#8220;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">133. And there is absolutely no benefit in these two as they were only put there for decoration and to charm the people &#8211; and they have lately been removed &#8211; alhamdulillaah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">134. And the hadith about that id da&#8217;eef &#8211; and cannot be an evidence for it is as I have explained in &#8216;Ad-Ad-Da&#8217;eefah&#8217; (no.364). So it is not permissible to act on it as it is Sharee&#8217;ah &#8211; especially as it may cause trouble to some pilgrims as I myself once found &#8211; thinking that the hadith about it was authentic &#8211; and he might miss some prayers and thus be a hardship &#8211; which Allaah has delivered him from. And one honorable person holds this hadith to be strong &#8211; based upon the attestation of Ibn Hibbaan in favour of one of its unknown narrators &#8211; and the scholars of Hadith criticism do not accept this type of attestation. Among them the aforementioned honorable person as he himself has stated in his refutation of Shaikh al-Ghumaaree in the &#8216;Journal of the Salafi University&#8217; which comes from India.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allah</strong> commanded our father <em>Ibraaheem</em> saying,</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“And proclaim to mankind the Hajj (pilgrimage). They will come to you on foot and on every lean camel, they will come from every deep and distant (wide) mountain highway (to perform Hajj).</span></em> [Soorah al-Hajj :27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And proclaim to mankind the Hajj” meaning, announce the pilgrimage to mankind and call them to perform pilgrimage to this House which We have commanded you to build. It was said that <em>Ibraaheem</em> said: &#8220;O Lord, how can I convey this to people when my voice will not reach them&#8221; It was said: &#8220;Call them and We will convey it.&#8221; So Ibraaheem stood up and said, &#8220;O mankind! Your Lord has established a House so come on pilgrimage to it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is said that the mountains lowered themselves so that his voice would reach all the regions of the earth, and those who were still in their mothers&#8217; wombs and their fathers&#8217; loins would hear the call. The response came from everyone in the cities, deserts and countryside, and those whom <strong>Allah</strong> has decreed will make the pilgrimage, until the Day of Resurrection: &#8220;At Your service, O <strong>Allah</strong>, at Your service.&#8221; This is a summary of the narrations from <em>Ibn ‘Abbaas</em>, <em>Mujaahid</em>, <em>`Ikrimah</em>, <em>Sa’id bin Jubayr</em> and others among the <em>Salaf</em>. And Allah knows best. This was recorded by<em> Ibn Jarir</em> and by<em> Ibn Abi Hatim</em> at length.<strong> [Tafseer Ibn Kathir]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With the time of Hajj upon us, our <em>Shaykh Hasan al-Banna (hafidhahullah)</em> will enlighten us with respect to the story of <em>Hajj</em> according to the Book, the <em>Sunnah</em> and the narrations of our <em>Salaf-us-Saalih.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask <strong>Allah</strong> to accept the <em>Hajj</em> of all our brothers and sisters and that He <em>Al-Ghafoor</em>, <em>Ar-Raheem</em> forgives us our sins and shortcomings.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him and his father) also reported that the Prophet <em>(sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam)</em> said: &#8220;There is no deed more precious in the sight of <strong>Allaah</strong>, nor greater in reward, than a good deed done during the ten days of Sacrifice.&#8221; He was asked, &#8220;Not even <em>jihaad</em> for the sake of <strong>Allaah</strong>?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Not even <em>jihaad</em> for the sake of <strong>Allaah</strong>, except in the case of a man who went out to fight giving himself and his wealth up for the cause, and came back with nothing.&#8221; [Reported by al-Daarimi, 1/357; its isnaad is hasan as stated in al-Irwaa’, 3/398]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are just two of the many evidences mentioned by our <em>Shaykh Fu&#8217;ad al-&#8216;Amri</em> <em>(hafidhahullaah) </em>in this highly beneficial reminder</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">It was reported in <em>Sahih Muslim</em> that the Prophet, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, said to Abu Dharr, who had stayed near the <em>Ka&#8217;bah</em> and its coverings for forty days and nights with no food or drink other than (Zamzam), &#8220;How long have you been here?&#8221; Abu Dharr said, &#8220;I have been here for thirty days and nights.&#8221; The Prophet, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, said, &#8220;Who has been feeding you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have had nothing but Zamzam water, and I have gotten so fat that I have folds of fat on my stomach. I do not feel any of the tiredness or weakness of hunger and I have not become thin.&#8221; The Prophet, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, said, &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Verily, it is blessed, it is food that nourishes</strong></span>.&#8221; [Narrated by <em>Imam</em> Muslim, 2473]</p>

<h5 style="text-align:justify;" align="Center"><span style="color:#993300;">Imam Al-Nawawi’s Riyad-us-Saliheen : Chapter 226</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">The Excellence of As-Saum (The Fast) during the first ten Days of Dhul-Hijjah</span></h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) said, “There are no days during which the righteous action is so pleasing to Allah than these days (i.e., the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah).” He was asked: “O Messenger of Allah, not even Jihad in the Cause of Allah?” He (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) replied, “Not even Jihad in the Cause of Allah, except in case one goes forth with his life and his property and does not return with either of it.” [Al-Bukhari].</p>
<h5><span style="color:#993300;">Imam Al-Nawawi’s Riyad-us-Saliheen : Chapter 227</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">The Excellence of Observing <em>Saum</em> on the Day of ‘Arafah, ‘Ashura’ and Tasu’a (i.e., 9th of Muharram)</span></h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Qatadah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) was asked about the observance of <em>Saum</em> (fasting) on the day of `Arafah. He said, “<strong>It is an expiation for the sins of the preceding year and the current year.</strong>” [Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:small;">The first ten days of<i> Dhul-Hijjah </i>are the best and most virtuous days of the year. They are the days in which Allaah the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; most loves the doing of good deeds. About this the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, <span style="color:#008000;"><em>“The best days in the world are the ten days.”</em></span> [1]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:small;"><strong>Imaam Ibnul-Qayyim</strong> (d.751H) &#8211; <i> rahimahullaah</i> – said, “Indeed, its days are the most excellent of all the days with Allaah. And it has been confirmed in <i>Saheehul-Bukhaaree</i> (2/382), from Ibn ’Abbaas (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhumaa</i>) who said, that Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said,<em><span style="color:#008000;"> “There ore no days during which good deeds are more beloved to Allaah than these (ten) days.”</span></em> He was then asked, ‘Not even <i>jihaad</i> in the path of Allaah?’ So he replied, <em><span style="color:#008000;">“Not even jihaad in the path of Allaah, except for a person who goes out with his self and his wealth, and comes back with nothing.”</span></em> And it is these ten days that Allaah has taken an oath by in His Book, by His saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:small;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“<b>By the Dawn and by the Ten Nights.</b>”</span></em> [Sooratul-Fajr 89:1-2]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:small;">This is why it is recommended to increase in making <i>takbeer</i> (saying <i>Allaahu akbar</i>), <i>tahleel</i> (saying<i> Laa ilaaha illallaah</i>) and <i>tamheed</i> (saying<i> Alhamdulillaah</i>) during these days &#8230;”[2]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:small;">The Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, <em><span style="color:#008000;">“There are no days that are greater with Allaah, and in which good deeds are more beloved to Him, than these ten days. So increase in making tasbeeh (saying Subhaanallaah), tamheed, tahleel and takbeer, during them.”</span></em>[3]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:small;color:#808080;">[2] Refer to <i> Zaadul-Ma’aad</i> (1/56).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small;color:#808080;">[3] <b>Saheeh:</b> Related by at-Tabaraanee in <i>al-Kabeer</i> (3/110/1) It was authenticated by al-Mundharee in <i>at-Targheeb wat-Tarheeb</i> (2/24).</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><a href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-1sS" target="_blank"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The Term ‘al-Munawarah’</strong></span></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Hamad al-Ansaari</strong> (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I searched for the origin of what people say these days of al-Madina ‘al-Munawarah’ and I found that the first people to label it ‘al-Munawarah’ were the ‘Uthmaanyoon’.  As for the Companions and the Successors and those after them, then for many centuries they called it al-Madina an-Nabaweeyah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>AbdulAwal bin Hamad al-Ansaari</strong> commented:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I noticed from my father -Rahimullaah- that if he saw a person write ‘al-Munawarah’, he would say to him to wipe out the word ‘al-Munawarah’ and write ‘an-Nabaweeyah.’[28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed the people of knowledge apply the term ‘an-Nabaweeya’ to al-Madina.’[29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Applying the word ‘al-Munawarah’ after the word al-Madina was introduced by the non-Arabs.  What was well known by the Companions and the Successors was the addition ‘an-Nabaweeyah’. Likewise, adding the term ‘<strong>al-Mukkarama</strong>’ to Makkah is not known.’[30]</p>
