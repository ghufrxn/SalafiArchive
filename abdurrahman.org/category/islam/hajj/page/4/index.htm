		<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>Lessons of Creed Acquired From the Hajj<br>
</strong>By ‘AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-Badr<br>
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Chapter Seven</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Kissing the Black Stone and Touching the<em>Yemeni</em> Corner [1]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What preceded was a discussion of the excellence of <em>Tawaaf</em> of the House of Allaah <em>al-Haraam</em>, the great act of worship and important act of obedience which is a pillar from the pillars of <em>Hajj</em> and <em>Umrah</em> and that it is prescribed for this one place only, as Allaah<em>Ta’ala</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَلۡيَطَّوَّفُواْ بِٱلۡبَيۡتِ ٱلۡعَتِيقِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; and circumambulate the Ancient House (the <em>Ka’ba</em> at Makkah). &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">[Hajj: 29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So it is not permissible to make <em>Tawaaf</em> of domes, graves, tombs or other things; since these matters clash with the principles of the <em>Sharia’</em> and they oppose the reality of<em>Tawheed</em>, because it involves associating and equating the created with The Creator <em>-Subhanahu</em>.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The discussion of a part of this issue, with a brief explanation, has already preceded.  As for what we will discuss here, by Allaah’s permission, regarding another lesson and benefit for the Muslim is what happens when he reaches the House of Allaah <em>al-Haraam</em>to perform <em>Tawaaf</em> of it.  It is legislated at this place to kiss the black stone and touch the <em>Yemeni</em> corner in obedience to Allaah and in imitation of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>. There are very many proofs which explain the legality of it and show that the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> did this when he came to the House of Allaah <em>al-Haraam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been narrated by Bukhari and Muslim on the authority of Abdullaah bin Umar bin al-Khattab <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> who said : <strong>‘I saw the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> when he came to Makkah.  He touched the black corner (the black stone) at the beginning of his <em>Tawaaf</em> and he would jog the first three of the seven circuits</strong>.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Muslim in the hadeeth of Jaabir bin AbdAllaah, who said that: <strong>‘When the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> came to Makkah he entered the <em>Masjid</em> and touched the stone, he then began from the right hand side.  He jogged for three circuits and walked for four………..’</strong>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, the Muslims also kiss the stone imitating the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, following his guidance and adhering to his Sunnah; rejecting any belief that the Black Stone could bring benefit or harm or give or withhold.  This is why the <em>Ameer ul-Mumineen</em>, Umar bin al-Khattaab <em>-RadiAllaahu anhu- </em>said, as he kissed the Black stone:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Indeed I  know that you are a stone and you cannot cause benefit or harm.  If it were not that I saw the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>kiss you, I would not have kissed you.’</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhari and  Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jareer at-Tabaree <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Verily, Umar said this because the people had newly entered Islaam after having left the worship of idols.  So Umar feared that some of the ignorant people would take the act of touching of the stone to signify glorification of stones or rocks as had been the practice of previous Arabs in times of ignorance.  Umar intended to teach the people that he only touched this stone imitating the action of the Messenger of Allaah, not because the stone itself caused harm or benefit, which they had previously believed about their idols.’</strong>[4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for what has been narrated in the hadeeth of Abu Saeed that Alee, when Umar said this, responded by saying. ‘Indeed it does harm and benefit’ and went on to mention how Allaah took covenants from the sons of Aadam and they were written upon parchement which were devoured by the stone.  He continued, ‘I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘The black Stone will be brought on the Day of Judgment, it will have a tongue and it will testify for those upon <em>Tawheed</em> who touched it.’</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, this narration is not established from the Ameer ul-Mumineen, Alee bin Abu Taalib.  Hafidh Ibn Hajr said in Fath ul-Bari: ‘In its chain is Abu Haroon al-Abdee and he is very weak.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Haroon, the narrator of this narration is <em>Matrook</em> Hadeeth (his narrations are not accepted) according to the people of knowledge, some even call him a liar! an-Nisaee mentions that he is ‘<em>Matrook al-Hadeeth’</em>.  Hamaad Ibn Zayd said ‘Abu Haroon al-Abdee is a liar, in the morning he says one thing and  in the evening another!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al Jawzajani said of him ‘a slandering liar’ and Ibn Hibban said of him ‘I used to narrate from Abu Saeed that which was not narrated by him. It is not permissible to write his hadeeth except from the standpoint of amazement!!’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how can anyone support this narration if this, according to the people of knowledge, is the state of the narrator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus what is prescribed is kissing of the Black stone only and if you cannot do so then touching it.  If it is not possible to kiss or touch it then pointing to it is sufficient.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also legislated to touch the <em>Yemeni</em> corner, as found in the two authentic books.  On the authority of Abdullaah bin Umar bin al-Khattaab <em>–RadiAllaahu anhu-</em>  ‘I did not see the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> touch any part of the House except the two <em>Yemeni</em> corners.’[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This clarifies that it is not legislated to touch any part of the House other than the two<em>Yemeni</em> corners, namely the Black stone and the <em>Yemeni</em> corner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah said: ‘No corners other than the two <em>Yemeni</em> corners are to be touched and not the <em>Shami</em> corners.  The Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> specifically touched them because they are from the foundations laid by Ibraheem whilst the other corners are from inside the House.  Thus the Black stone is touched and kissed and the <em>Yemeni</em> corner is touched but not kissed.  The remaining two corners are not touched or kissed. <em>Al-Istislaam</em> is to touch with the hand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the remaining parts of the House and the Station of Ibraheem, the entire<em>masjid</em> and its walls, graves of Prophets and righteous people, such as the house of our Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, the cave of Ibraheem, the place in which our Prophet used to pray in and other places such as the graves of the Prophets and the righteous people and the stone in Bait al-Maqdis, then none of these are to be touched or kissed and the Imaams are all in agreement on this.’[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are great lessons and benefits which the Muslim derives from the fact that touching and kissing is only legislated at the above-mentioned specific place.  The evidence does not allow these acts to be performed at other than these two places.  Thus the Muslim does this in obedience to Allaah and imitating His Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.  The Muslim does not believe that in doing this (i.e. touching/kissing) he will receive any benefit or ward off any harm, as in the preceding explanation of the <em>Ameer ul-Mumineen</em>, Umar bin Khattab, where he kissed the Black stone and said as much in front of the people in order to teach and guide them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As previous texts have illustrated, touching or kissing the walls of the <em>Ka’ba</em> at other than the <em>Yemeni</em> corners or the Black stone is not from the Sunnah.  The texts show that touching or kissing the station of Ibraheem is, likewise, not from the Sunnah as nothing regarding this has been narrated from the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it (i.e. touching/kissing) is not permissible with the <em>Ka’bah</em> itself -whose sacredness over all other <em>Masajid</em> and places is well-known- then it is not permissible at the Station of Ibraeem, about which Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَٱتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبۡرَٰهِ‍ۧمَ مُصَلّٗىۖ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; And take the <em>Maqaam </em>(place) of Ibraheem [or the stone on which Ibraheem stood while he was building the Ka&#8217;bah] as a place of prayer&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">[al-Baqarah : 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though it is known that there is the Station of Ibraheem in Shaam, and other places, along with the other places of the Prophets lesser than this one, Allaah has only ordered us to take this particular, one station as a place of prayer.  Yet even so, we are not allowed to touch it or kiss it, as there is no evidence to sanction such an action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Know! That the rest of places cannot be made places of prayer nor can you touch or kiss any of them.  In fact there is no one thing on the face of this earth other than the Black stone that it has been made allowed to kiss.[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those ignorant people -who encourage one another to gather around shrines and tombs etc- they kiss, rub and touch them.  They seek blessings from them and request their help and aid.  All of this has nothing at all to do with the <em>Deen</em>.  On the contrary, it is clear misguidance and a great lie.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah said: ‘As for touching/rubbing a grave, regardless of whose it is, kissing it or placing one’s cheek upon it then this is prohibited by the consensus of the Muslims, even if they were the graves of the Prophets.  Neither anyone from the Salaf of this <em>Ummah</em> nor from the Imaams did it, rather this is from<em>Shirk</em>.’[10]</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>Lessons of Creed Acquired From the Hajj<br>
</strong>By ‘AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-Badr<br>
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Chapter Six</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tawwaf of the House of Allaah al-Haraam</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed from the great lessons that benefits the pilgrim is when he reaches the Ancient House and carries out that great act of worship which is: <em>Tawwaf</em> of the House of Allaah<em>al-Haraam</em>.  He sees all those pilgrims performing <em>Tawwaf</em> in obedience to Allaah and fulfilling His command.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What benefits him in this situation is that which is well-known; the important state and noble value of this worship and the great intensity with which it enters the hearts of the believers.  This is especially so when the large masses of believers are all dressed in one type of clothing and are of uniform appearance, circling the House of Allaah, saying: ‘SubhanAllaah, La illaah ill Allaah and Allaahu Akbar’ (Far is Allaah from imperfection, There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah and Allaah is the Greatest), supplicating to their Noble Lord, beseeching Him for success, asking of Him and turning to Him in prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every single one of them is making a <em>Tawwaf</em> of seven circuits, all of them beginning at the black stone and ending at it and this is what the <em>Tawwaf</em> is: going around the <em>Ka’ba</em>seven times with the intention of <em>Tawwaf</em>, in worship of Allaah, starting with the black stone and ending at it, with the <em>Ka’ba</em> on their left hand side.  The Muslims do this in obedience to Allaah and in imitation of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, and, for each person, the level of perfection for this act of worship is the equivalent to how much he followed the Noble Messenger<em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Tawwaf</em> is the first action a Muslim does when he reaches Makkah.  It is narrated by Bukhari and Muslim on the authority of ‘Ayesha <em>-radiAllaah anha &#8211;</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed the first action the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> performed when he reached Makkah was that he made <em>Wudhoo</em>, then he made the <em>Tawwaf</em>.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been narrated by Muslim in his authentic book on the authority of Jaabir ibn Abdullaah <em>&#8211; radiAllaah anhu – </em>who described the <em>Hajj</em> of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘…until we came to the House with the Prophet, where he touched the corner (black stone), then briskly walked the first three circuits and calmly walked four circuits.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has also been narrated by Bukhari and Muslim from the Hadeeth of Ibn Umar <em>&#8211; radiAllaah anhu-</em> ‘that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> if he made<em>Tawwaf</em> in the <em>Hajj</em> or <em>Umrah</em>, the first thing he would begin with was walking briskly for three circuits and walking the remaining four normally.  Then, he prostrated twice (i.e. he prayed two <em>rakahs</em>) and, next, walked between as-Safa and al-Marwah.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The evidences in the Book and the Sunnah showing the legislation of <em>Tawwaf </em>of the House of Allaah <em>al-Haraam</em> are numerous and there are multiple narrations from the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>. </em> This is proof that this action brings one closer to Allaah and it is obedience from Allaah’s slaves that He loves.  He has legislated it for them and commanded them with it, urged them to carry it out and made it a rite from the rites whereby His House <em>al-Haraam</em> is intended as He said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَأَذِّن فِي ٱلنَّاسِ بِٱلۡحَجِّ يَأۡتُوكَ رِجَالٗا وَعَلَىٰ كُلِّ ضَامِرٖ يَأۡتِينَ مِن كُلِّ فَجٍّ عَمِيقٖ ٢٧ لِّيَشۡهَدُواْ<br>
مَنَٰفِعَ لَهُمۡ وَيَذۡكُرُواْ ٱسۡمَ ٱللَّهِ فِيٓ أَيَّامٖ مَّعۡلُومَٰتٍ عَلَىٰ مَا رَزَقَهُم مِّنۢ بَهِيمَةِ ٱلۡأَنۡعَٰمِۖ فَكُلُواْ مِنۡهَا<br>
وَأَطۡعِمُواْ ٱلۡبَآئِسَ ٱلۡفَقِيرَ ٢٨ ثُمَّ لۡيَقۡضُواْ تَفَثَهُمۡ وَلۡيُوفُواْ نُذُورَهُمۡ وَلۡيَطَّوَّفُواْ بِٱلۡبَيۡتِ ٱلۡعَتِيقِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And proclaim to mankind the <em>Hajj</em>.  They will come to you on foot and on every lean camel, they will come from every deep and distant mountain highway (to perform<em>Hajj</em>).  That they may witness things that are of benefit to them and mention the Name of Allaah on the appointed days, over the livestock animals that He has provided for them.  Then eat thereof and feed therewith the poor having a hard time.  Then let them complete their prescribed duties and perform their vows, and circumambulate the Ancient House.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Hajj: 27-29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Allaah appointed His Prophet and friend, Ibraheem, along with his son Ismaeel, the Prophet of Allaah –<em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam</em>, to sanctify the House, build its foundations and prepare it for those who would perform <em>Tawwaf</em>, stand up for prayer, make <em>Rukoo</em> and make <em>Sujood</em>, Allaah says :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَعَهِدۡنَآ إِلَىٰٓ إِبۡرَٰهِ‍ۧمَ وَإِسۡمَٰعِيلَ أَن طَهِّرَا بَيۡتِيَ لِلطَّآئِفِينَ وَٱلۡعَٰكِفِينَ وَٱلرُّكَّعِ ٱلسُّجُودِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;and We commanded Ibraheem and Isma’eel that they should purify My House (the Ka’bahat Makkah) for those who are circumbulating it, staying (in it i.e. in <em>I’tikâf</em>), bowing or prostrating themselves (there, in prayer) &gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah : 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَإِذۡ بَوَّأۡنَا لِإِبۡرَٰهِيمَ مَكَانَ ٱلۡبَيۡتِ أَن لَّا تُشۡرِكۡ بِي شَيۡ‍ٔٗا وَطَهِّرۡ بَيۡتِيَ لِلطَّآئِفِينَ وَٱلۡقَآئِمِينَ وَٱلرُّكَّعِ ٱلسُّجُودِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;And (remember) when We showed Ibraheem the site of the (Sacred) House (the Ka’bah at Makkah) (saying): “Associate not anything (in worship) with Me, and sanctify My House for those who circumambulate it, those who stand up for prayer, and those who bow and prostrate (in prayer)”&gt;&gt;[Hajj: 26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It becomes clear from what has preceded that <em>Tawwaf</em> of the Ancient House is a noble act of worship and great act of obedience that Allaah loves from His slaves.  He has legislated it and ordained it for them.  He has prepared a great reward and many gains for those performing the <em>Tawwaf</em>.  <em>Tawwaf</em> of the House is a pillar from the pillars of<em>Hajj</em>, just as it is also a pillar from the pillars of <em>Umrah</em>.  This shows the great importance and high status of the <em>Tawwaf</em> with Allaah; since neither the <em>Hajj</em> nor the<em>Umrah</em> can be complete without it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, in this great act, the Muslim learns great lessons and attains significant benefits, which is that this significant act of worship – by which I mean the <em>Tawwaf</em> – was legislated for this place alone, around the House of Allaah <em>al-Haraam</em>, as preceding texts from the Book and Sunnah have shown and there are many other texts as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this, the Muslim comes to know that making <em>Tawwaf</em> in any place of the world other than this place is not legislated and there is nothing that proves its legislation.  Rather it is misguidance and false to make the houses of the creation equal with the House of the Creator; that place that He <em>-Subhanahu-</em> commanded to be established for His remembrance, obedience and to be faced in His <em>-Subhanahu-</em> worship.  There is no difference amongst the people of knowledge regarding the futility of making <em>Tawwaf</em>in any area or location other than the House of Allaah <em>al-Haraam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it  is not permissible to make <em>Tawwaf</em> around domed shrines or graves, nor around tombs, trees, stones or anything else, and there are many, many narrations from the people of knowledge regarding this.  Perhaps, if time allows, I will mention some of their statements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam an-Nawawee <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said in his book ‘al-Majmoo Sharh al-Muhadhib’: ‘and it is not permissible to make <em>Tawwaaf</em> of his grave <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continues after mentioning some points: ‘A person should not be deceived by many of the common people performing this <em>Tawwaf</em> because following the Sunnah and performing an action is only done by following the <em>Ahaadeeth</em> and the sayings of the scholars; no attention is paid to the innovations and ignorance of the common people or other then them.  It is affirmed in the two authentic books on the authority of ‘Ayesha <em>-RadiAllaah anha</em>: that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211;<em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>said<em>:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever innovates in this matter of ours that which is not from it then it is rejected.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in the narration of Muslim :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever does an action that we have not commanded then it will be rejected.’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And on the authority of Abu Huraira <em>&#8211; radiAllaah anhu &#8211;</em> who said that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Do not frequent my grave, and send prayers upon me, as your prayers reach me from wherever you are.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Aboo Dawood with an authentic chain,[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fudayl bin ‘Ayaad <em>-Rahimullaah-</em>  said the meaning of which is : ‘Follow the paths of guidance and you will not be harmed due to being a small number of followers.  Beware of the paths of misguidance and do not be deceived by the large number of ruined ones.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whosoever thinks that wiping his hands on graves and shrines, and other things similar to this, is more effective for receipt of blessings then this is from his ignorance and negligence; because receiving blessings can only be by way of that which is in accordance with the <em>Sharia’</em>, and how can good be achieved by opposing that which is correct.’[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said :  ‘And Indeed the Muslims are agreed that it is not legislated to make the <em>Tawaaf</em> except of <em>Bait-ul-Mamoor</em>.  It is not allowed to make <em>Tawaaf</em> of the rock of Bait ul-Maqdis, nor of the Prophet’s house <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, nor of the dome which is in the mountain of ‘Arafat, nor in any other place.’[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said : ‘There is no place on earth like the <em>Ka’ba</em> where you can make <em>Tawaaf</em>.  Whoever believes that making <em>Tawaaf</em> of other than the <em>Ka’ba</em> is legislated, then that is a worse evil than the one who believes that it is permissible to pray facing other than the <em>Ka’ba</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and the Muslims prayed facing Bait ul- Maqdis for eighteen months when he first migrated from Makkah to Madina.  That was the <em>Qiblah</em> of the Muslims for that period, then Allaah changed the<em>Qiblah</em> to the <em>Ka’ba</em> and revealed this in the Qur’aan as is mentioned in Sooratul Baqaraah.  The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and the Muslims prayed towards the <em>Ka’ba</em> and so it became a <em>Qiblah</em>.  It is the <em>Qiblah</em> of Ibraheem and other than him, from the Prophets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever today takes the rock as a <em>Qiblah</em> and prays facing it then he is a disbeliever, an apostate and he is made to repent- so he either repents or he is killed.  This is even though it used to be a <em>Qiblah</em> but has since been abrogated.  So what is the condition of one who takes it as a place for <em>Tawaaf</em>, just as one would make <em>Tawaaf</em>of the <em>Ka’ba</em>?  Making <em>Tawaaf</em> of other than the <em>Ka’ba</em> has not been legislated by Allaah in any way whatsoever……….’[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, with this research mentioned by Imaam an-Nawawee, Shaykh-ul- Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah and other then them from amongst the people of knowledge, the severe evil and danger of making <em>Tawaaf</em> of any place other than the House of Allaah<em>al-Haraam</em>&#8211; which Allaah gave permission to make <em>Tawaaf</em> around- becomes clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As far as what some of the ignorant people do where they make <em>Tawaaf</em> around graves, domes, shrines or anything else like this, then none of this is from the <em>Deen</em> of Allaah; rather it is from the whisperings of the Shaytaan and the legislation of Iblees; if it is not, then where is it to be found in the Book and the Sunnah: ‘make <em>Tawaaf</em> of the grave of so-and-so’ or of the tomb of so-and-so’, or things of this nature?  Allaah is The Most High above what they describe and He is far from the imperfection of what they associate with Him.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Lessons of Creed Acquired From the Hajj<br>
</strong>By ‘AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-Badr </span><br>
<span style="color:#993300;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Chapter Five</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>An Explanation of a Number of Benefits Gained From The <em>Talbiyaah</em></strong><strong><em><strong>[1]</strong></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the words in the proclamation relate to a very important matter and have a profound explanation.  We previously discussed the proof for the words of the<em>Talbiyaah</em> containing the implementation of <em>Tawheed</em> and the rejection of <em>Shirk</em>.  There is no doubt that these are great words which comprise important meanings with distinguished aims and many benefits.  The people of knowledge have pointed out the great significance of these words and the magnitude of what they comprise, of benefits and gains.  The Imaam and great scholar Ibn al-Qayyim mentioned a complete section, giving an extended explanation and discussion of this, in his book ‘Tahdeeb as-Sunnan’.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘And indeed the words in the <em>Talbiyaah</em> consist of great principles and magnificent benefits…’  and he mentioned twenty one benefits.  Here I will summarise a number of these magnificent benefits extracted from the <em>Talbiyaah</em> and from what Ibn al-Qayyim mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from these benefits is:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Your saying: ‘Labbayk’ (here I am).  This includes the response to your supplication by The One supplicated to and the response to your call by The One called upon.  It is not correct linguistically or intellectually that you call someone who does not speak or that you supplicate to someone who cannot answer you, so in this is the affirmation of the attribute of Allaah’s Speech.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>That the <em>Talbiyaah</em> includes love.  ‘Labbayk’ (here I am) is not said except to The One who is loved and glorified.  This is why it is said of its meaning: ‘I am directing myself towards You with what You love’, and it is said: a woman is beloved. i.e. beloved to her son.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>That the <em>Talbiyaah</em> comprises an adherence to a continuous (<em>al-Uboodiyah</em>) worship, so this is why it is said: the <em>Talbiyaah</em> is taken from the word <em>al-Iqamah</em> (establishment), i.e.: I am established on Your obedience.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>It includes humility and submissiveness, i.e. humility and more humility, in what they say: I am responding here in front of You, i.e. with humbleness and submissiveness.</li>
<li>It comprises <em>al-Ikhlaas</em> (sincerity), that is, it is said: the <em>Talbiyaah</em> is taken from the word <em>al-Lubb</em> (the core) and it is something pure.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the benefits of the <em>Talbiyaah</em> are that:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>It comprises an affirmation that Allaah, The Lord, hears; since it is impossible that a man will say ‘Labbayk’ (here I am) to someone who will not hear his supplication.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>It includes coming closer to Allaah, since it is said: that the <em>Talbiyaah</em> is taken from the word <em>al-ilbaab</em> (establishing) and that is seeking nearness.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>The <em>Talbiyaah</em> is used as a distinction between moving from one state to another and from one rite to another in <em>Ihraam</em>, just as the <em>Takbeer</em> (saying<em>Allaahu Ak</em><em>bar</em>) in the prayer is a cause for moving from one pillar of the prayer to another.  This is why it is the Sunnah to say the <em>Talbiyaah</em> up until the start of the <em>Tawaaf</em> at which point you break off from the <em>Talbiyaah</em>.  Then (after that), the pilgrim again begins to say the <em>Talbiyaah</em> until he stands at ‘Arafat, then he breaks off the <em>Talbiyaah</em>.  The pilgrim then resumes the <em>Talbiyaah</em> until he stands at Muzdalifah then he breaks off from it.  Then he makes the<em>Talbiyaah</em> until he stones the <em>Jamaraatul-‘Aqabah</em> (the Large Pillar) then he stops making <em>Talbiyaah</em>.  Therefore, the <em>Talbiyaah</em> is a sign of <em>Hajj</em> and a (sign of) change in the actions of its rites.  So, when the pilgrim moves from one action to another action he says: ‘Labbayk Allaahumma Labbayk’, just as the one praying says ‘<em>Allaahu Ak</em><em>bar</em>’ when he moves from one act to another.  So, when he completes his rites, he breaks off from the <em>Talbiyaah</em>, just as the one praying says the <em>Tasleem</em> (saying salaams at the end of the prayer) which cuts him off from his <em>Takbeer</em>.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>The <em>Talbiyaah</em> is a sign of <em>Tawheed</em> and the creed of Ibraheem – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam</em>, which is the spirit of <em>Hajj</em> and its purpose.  On the contrary, it is the spirit of all acts of worship and its purpose.  This is why the <em>Talbiyaah</em> is the key to this act of worship, wherewith a person enters into the <em>Hajj</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From its benefits is that it contains the key to Paradise and the door of Islaam whereby Paradise and Islaam are entered. It is also the statement of <em>al-Ikhlaas</em> and the testification for Allaah that He has no partners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the benefits of the <em>Talbiyaah</em> is that it includes the fact that all praise (<em>al-Hamd</em>) is for Allaah, which is the most beloved thing whereby a slave comes closer to Allaah.  It is the first thing that the people of Paradise will call with and ‘<em>al-Hamd</em>’ is the opening and completion of the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From its benefits is that it comprises the acknowledgement that all blessings belong to Allaah and this is why the word <em>an-Ni’ma</em> (الـنعـم) (the blessing) is in the definite form, meaning that it includes everything i.e. that all blessings are for You [O Allaah ] and You are The Lord of blessings and the One who gives blessings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From its (benefits); the <em>Talbiyaah</em> includes the acknowledgement that all the dominion belongs to Allaah Alone, thus there is, in actuality, no dominion for anyone other than Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from its benefits: The <em>Talbiyaah</em> includes a notification of the combination of <em>al-Mulk </em>(the dominion), <em>an-Ni’mah </em>(the blessings) and al-Hamd (the praise) and that all of these are for Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em>.  This is another type of praise for Allaah which is different to the praise which results from (only) one of any of these three, High attributes.  So combining the dominion, which constitutes capability, with the blessing- which constitutes the height of benefiting, doing good and mercy-, and the praise – which constitutes a general sublimity and honour which leads to loving Allaah- then this is a different type of praise and in it is a greatness and perfection and a glory which is better suited to Allaah and befitting for Him <em>–Subhanahu</em>.  So, when a slave  remembers Him and knows about his Lord then his heart is attracted to Allaah and turns towards Him, facing Him, professing all love for Him with that which is the reason for <em>al-Uboodiyaah</em> (worship) and its core.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From its benefits: the Prophet said, ‘The best thing which I and the Prophets before me have said is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَه،ُ لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْد،ُ وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaahu wahdahu la shareeka lahu, lahul mulku wa lahul hamdu wa huwa ala kulli shayin qadeer’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">(There is none worthy of worship except Allaah Alone, He has no partner, He has the Dominion and for Him is the praise and He has the capability over everything.)’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>Talbiyaah</em> consists of these words exactly and they include the same meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from the benefits: That the words in the <em>Talbiyaah</em> contain a refutation of everyone who negates Allaah’s Attributes and His <em>Tawheed</em>.  So the <em>Talbiyaah</em> nullifies the statements of the <em>Mushrikeen</em> however diverse their sects and statements. The<em>Talbiyaah</em> nullifies the statements of the philosophers and whoever is affected by them, from amongst those who nullify Allaah’s Attributes connected to <em>al-Hamd</em> (all praise).  The <em>Talbiyaah</em> ends the sayings of the <em>Qadireeyah</em>,  who are called the <em>Majoos</em> (fire-worshippers) of this <em>Ummah</em>, those who separate the actions of His slaves- from amongst the Angels, <em>Jinn</em> and mankind- from the dominion of The Lord and His capability.  They do not affirm that Allaah has power over them, nor do they make Him the Creator of this power over them.</p>
<blockquote><p>So, whoever comes to know the meaning of  the <em>Talbiyaah</em>, testifies to them and truly believes in them, then he will be unlike all the sects of the Muattilah (those who nullify the attributes of Allaah.)</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, from the benefits of the <em>Talbiyaah</em> is that repetition of the testification (<em>Shahaada</em>) in Allaah, ‘that He has no partner’, has a benefit which is that Allaah has informed him of the fact that He has no partner after the response to: ‘labbayk’ (Here I am), then he repeats it again after saying: ‘innal hamda wan-ni’mata laka wal mulka-la shareeka lak’ (Verily all praise is for You, and every bounty is from You, and all dominion is Yours – You have no partner.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This section of the <em>Talbiyaah</em> consists of the fact that Allaah has no partner in praise, blessing or dominion whereas the first part consists of the fact that Allaah has no partner in His response to this call (i.e. the <em>Talbiyaah</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is similar to the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">شَهِدَ ٱللَّهُ أَنَّهُۥ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ وَٱلۡمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ وَأُوْلُواْ ٱلۡعِلۡمِ قَآئِمَۢا بِٱلۡقِسۡطِۚ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ ٱلۡعَزِيزُ ٱلۡحَكِيمُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Allah bears witness that <em>Lâ ilâha illa Huwa</em> (none has the right to be worshipped but He), and the Angels, and those having knowledge (also give this witness); (He is always) maintaining His creation in Justice. <em>Lâ ilâh illa Huwa</em> (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the All-Mighty, the All-Wise. &gt;&gt; [al-Imraan: 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At the beginning of this Ayaah Allaah tells us that there is none worthy of worship in truth except Him, which is incorporated into His testimony (<em>la ilaha ill Allaah</em>) along with the testimony of the Angels and the people of knowledge, this is what has been attested to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah informs us that He maintains with justice and that He is just, then repeats the testification that there is none worthy of worship in truth except Him along with His maintainingeverything with justice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are just a number of great benefits and the precious harvest acquired from this distinguished statement, the <em>Talbiyaah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These benefits, without doubt, indicate the importance of concern for understanding the meaning of this statement and that if the slave of Allaah has correct concern for it then this will help him to perform this worship in the best and most correct way.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>Lessons of Creed Acquired From the Hajj<br>
</strong>By ‘AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-Badr<br>
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Chapter 3</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Proclamation of Tawheed is an Evidence of ‘Aqeedah</strong><strong>[1]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the most significant of the great lessons which benefits the Muslim in his <em>Hajj</em> to the House of Allaah the <em>al-Haram</em> is the obligation to have sincerity in all worship for Allaah Alone Who has no partners. So when the Muslim begins his <em>Hajj</em>, the first thing that he begins with is the proclamation of <em>Tawheed</em> and rejection of <em>Shirk</em> (associating partners with Allaah), when he says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">لَبَّيْكَ اللَّهُمَّ لَبَّيْكَ , لَبَّيْكَ لا شَرِيكَ لَكَ لَبَّيْكَ , إنَّ الْحَمْدَ وَالنِّعْمَةَ لَكَ وَالْمُلْكَ ، لا شَرِيكَ لَكَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">labbaykallaahumma labbaika, labbaika laa shareeka laka labbaika-innal hamda wan ni’mata laka wal mulka-la shareeka lak</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Here I am O Allaah, here I am, You have no partner, here I am, Verily all praise is for You, and every bounty is from You, and all dominion is Yours – You have no partner.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He repeats it and raises his voice with it whilst, at the same time, he is conscious of and feels what this proclamation indicates: the obligation to single out Allaah Alone with worship and keeping far away from <em>Shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since Allaah is Alone in His favours and His giving, having no partners, then likewise He is Alone in His <em>Tawheed</em> not having any equal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No one is supplicated to except Allaah, none is relied upon except Allaah, none is sought for aid except Allaah nor is any type of the different aspects of worship directed to anyone except Allaah. Just as the slave is required to make his intention for the <em>Hajj</em>completely for Allaah Alone, then in the same way he is required to make his intention in all the worship he performs and in all the acts of obedience by which he becomes closer to Allaah, for Allaah Alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whosoever directs anything from worship to other than Allaah then he has committed<em>Shirk</em> with Allaah, The Great, and he has suffered a clear loss, nullified his actions and Allaah will not accept his actions from him, neither his optional actions nor his obligatory actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Islaam came with this great proclamation, the proclamation of the <em>Tawheed</em> of Allaah, making the <em>Deen</em> sincerely for Allaah and distancing oneself from all types of<em>Shirk</em> large or small, minor or major.  Whereas the <em>Mushrikoon</em> (polytheists), the worshippers of idols and statues, used to make the declaration to enter into their<em>Ihraam</em> for <em>Hajj</em> with <em>Shirk</em> and abuse, they would say in their <em>Talbeeyaah</em>(proclamation):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Here I am O Allaah, here I am, You have no partner except for the partner who is Yours, whom you possess and what he possesses.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, in the proclamation, they included their false gods along with Allaah and they place – what they claim for their false gods – in the Hands of Allaah and this is the meaning of the saying of Allaah about them in the Qur’aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَمَا يُؤۡمِنُ أَكۡثَرُهُم بِٱللَّهِ إِلَّا وَهُم مُّشۡرِكُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; And most of them believe not in Allaah except that they attribute partners unto Him&gt;&gt; [Yusuf: 106]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: that most of them do not believe in Allaah, that He is The Creator, The Provider and The Disposer except that they associate partners with Him in worship – with idols who do not possess anything and statues that do not benefit or bring harm, nor do they give anything or prevent harm, rather they do not possess anything at all for themselves, let alone possess anything for anyone else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Ibn Jareer at-Tabaree on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas <em>-RadiAllaah anhu   – </em>who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It is from their <em>Eemaan</em>, that if it is said to them: ‘Who created the sky?’ ‘Who created the earth?’ and ‘Who created the mountains?’ They would say ‘Allaah’ yet they are still<em>Mushrikoon</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Ikrimaa that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Ask them who created the heavens and the earth, they will say: Allaah. That is their<em>Eemaan</em> in Allaah and yet they worship other than Him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, on the authority of Mujaahid who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Their <em>Eemaan</em> is their saying: Allaah is our Creator, He gives us provision and He takes our lives. So this is <em>Eemaan</em>, along with <em>Shirk</em> in their worship of other than Him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Ibn Zayd who said: ‘There is no-one that worships someone along with Allaah except that he believes in Allaah, knows that Allaah is His lord and that Allaah is his Creator and his Provider, but along with this he commits <em>Shirk</em> with Him. Do you not see how Ibraheem said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">قَالَ أَفَرَءَيۡتُم مَّا كُنتُمۡ تَعۡبُدُونَ ٧٥ أَنتُمۡ وَءَابَآؤُكُمُ ٱلۡأَقۡدَمُونَ ٧٦ فَإِنَّهُمۡ عَدُوّٞ لِّيٓ إِلَّا رَبَّ ٱلۡعَٰلَمِينَ ٧٧</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; He said: ‘Do you observe that which you have been worshipping – you and your ancient fathers? Verily they are enemies to me, except the Lord of the worlds. &gt;&gt; [ash-Shoora:75-77]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibraheem <em>– alayhi as-Sallam &#8211;</em> knew that they worshipped the Lord of the worlds along with those whom they used to worship.’ Then he said: there is none that commits <em>Shirk</em>except that he believes in Allaah, do you not see how the Arabs used to proclaim and say: ‘Here I am O Allaah, here I am, You have no partner except for the partner who is Yours, whom you possess and what he possesses.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what the <em>Mushrikoon</em> used to say.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the <em>Mushrikoon</em> at the time of the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> used to affirm that their Creator, Provider and The Disposer of their affairs was Allaah, but even with this affirmation they did not make the <em>Deen</em> sincerely for Allaah. Rather, they worshipped others along with Him in their worshipping of trees, stones and idols, besides other things. Allaah made this matter clear and explained it in many places in the Noble Qur’aan, such as His <em>-Subhanahu-</em> saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَلَئِن سَأَلۡتَهُم مَّنۡ خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضَ وَسَخَّرَ ٱلشَّمۡسَ وَٱلۡقَمَرَ لَيَقُولُنَّ ٱللَّهُۖ فَأَنَّىٰ يُؤۡفَكُونَ ٦١</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;And if you were to ask them: ‘Who has created the heavens and the earth and subjected the sun and the moon?’ They will surely reply ‘Allaah’. How then are they deviating (as disbelievers)? &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">[Ankabut: 61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Aayaat</em> with this meaning are many.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafidh Ibn Katheer <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said in his book of <em>Tafseer</em>: ‘Allaah Ta’ala speaks, affirming that there is none worthy of worship in truth except Him- because the<em>Mushrikeen</em> who worship Him, worship others along with Him- they acknowledge that He is Independent in His creation of the heavens and the earth, the sun and the moon and the change of the night and day and that He is The Creator and The Provider for His slaves, The One Who determines their different times of death, their different types of provision and the contrast between them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, from amongst them, are the rich and the poor and He knows best that which is befitting for everyone amongst them, he who deserves to be rich and he who deserves to be poor. It is mentioned that He is Independent in creating things and He is Alone in organising the creation.  So, if this is the case, then why is someone other than Him relied upon? Since He is Alone in possessing everything then He should be the only One worshipped. Many times Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> establishes His status as being worthy of being worshipped due to the recognition of the <em>Tawheed</em> of His Lordship. The<em>Mushrikoon</em> used to acknowledge this as they used to say in their proclamation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Here I am O Allaah, here I am, You have no partner, except for the partner who is Yours, whom You possess and what he possesses.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So why is someone else relied upon?[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many places in the noble Qur’aan which mention this meaning of establishing proof against the <em>Kuffar</em> of their obligation to have <em>Tawheed</em> of Him in His worship and making the <em>Deen</em> sincerely for Him due to their acknowledgement of the Lordship of Allaah <em>–Jala wa Oola</em>. Due to this, Allaah addresses them regarding the <em>Tawheed</em> of His Lordship with a rhetorical question. So, if they affirm His Lordship, He uses this as an evidence against them, that He is The One Who deserves to be worshipped Alone and He rebukes them, rejecting their association of others with Him, even though they acknowledge that He Alone is The Lord; because whoever acknowledges that He Alone is The Lord then it necessitates that all worship is performed sincerely for Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With this, it becomes clear that acknowledging that Allaah is The Creator, The Provider, The Benefactor, The One who controls and The Disposer of the affairs of the creation, (then this) is not sufficient for the (establishment of the) <em>Tawheed</em> of Allaah and it does not save anyone from the punishment of Allaah on the Day of Judgement, unless all worship is sincerely for Allaah Alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah does not accept the <em>Tawheed</em> of Lordship from His slaves unless they single Him out Alone in the <em>Tawheed</em> of <em>Ibaadah</em> (worship), such that they do not take an equal with Him, nor do they supplicate to anyone along with Him, nor do they rely upon anyone except Him, nor do they direct any form of worship to other than Him <em>-Subhanahu</em>, so just as He <em>-Subhanahu-</em> is The Only One to create then He is worshipped Alone with all types of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why Allaah Ta’ala said to those who turned their worship to other than Him, even though they knew that He is their Creator and Provider:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">فَلَا تَجۡعَلُواْ لِلَّهِ أَندَادٗا وَأَنتُمۡ تَعۡلَمُونَ ٢٢</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; Then do not set up rivals unto Allaah (in worship) while you know (that He Alone has the right to be worshipped)&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">[al-Baqarah: 22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Abbas <em>&#8211; RadiAllaah anhu –</em> said: ‘i.e. Do not associate others with Allaah assigning equals to Him, who do not bring any benefit, nor do they harm while you know that you have no Lord who provides for you other than Him. Indeed you have come to know that what the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>called you to, of Allaah’s <em>Tawheed</em>, then that is the truth wherein there is no doubt.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qatadah said: ‘You know that Allaah created you and He created the Heavens and the earth, then you ascribe equals unto Him.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the blessing upon the <em>Ummah</em> of Islaam is great; their being guided to the<em>Tawheed</em> of Allaah in His Lordship, worship and His Names and Attributes. The blessing of Allaah upon the Muslims is great in their being capable of proclaiming Allaah’s<em>Tawheed</em>, since others besides them proclaim <em>Shirk</em> and set up equals with Him.  So, for Allaah belongs the praise, <em>-Subhanahu-</em> for giving the ability, His blessings and guidance and to Him belong many good and blessed praises, such as our Noble Lord loves and is pleased with.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#993300;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="left"><strong>Chapter 2</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>An Explanation of  a Number of Benefits of Hajj</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As was mentioned in the previous discussion of the excellence of <em>Hajj</em> and its high stature, <em>Hajj</em> is from amongst the most distinguished acts of worship and the greatest means of seeking closeness to Allaah.  It is a pillar from the great pillars of Islaam and it is a principle from the strong foundations upon which Islaam stands and is built as was indicated previously when we mentioned the worldly and religious virtues and benefits of the <em>Hajj</em>, which a person can neither enumerate, nor limit nor is a person able to count them, and in this regard Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> says in the Noble Qur’aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَأَذِّن فِي ٱلنَّاسِ بِٱلۡحَجِّ يَأۡتُوكَ رِجَالٗا وَعَلَىٰ كُلِّ ضَامِرٖ يَأۡتِينَ مِن كُلِّ فَجٍّ عَمِيقٖ ٢٧ لِّيَشۡهَدُواْ<br>
مَنَٰفِعَ لَهُمۡ وَيَذۡكُرُواْ ٱسۡمَ ٱللَّهِ فِيٓ أَيَّامٖ مَّعۡلُومَٰتٍ عَلَىٰ مَا رَزَقَهُم مِّنۢ بَهِيمَةِ ٱلۡأَنۡعَٰمِۖ فَكُلُواْ مِنۡهَا<br>
وَأَطۡعِمُواْ ٱلۡبَآئِسَ ٱلۡفَقِيرَ ٢٨ ثُمَّ لۡيَقۡضُواْ تَفَثَهُمۡ وَلۡيُوفُواْ نُذُورَهُمۡ وَلۡيَطَّوَّفُواْ بِٱلۡبَيۡتِ ٱلۡعَتِيقِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And proclaim to mankind the <em>Hajj</em>.  They will come to you on foot and on every lean camel, they will come from every deep and distant mountain highway (to perform<em>Hajj</em>).  That they may witness things that are of benefit to them and mention the Name of Allaah on the appointed days, over the livestock animals that He has provided for them.  Then eat thereof and feed therewith the poor having a hard time.  Then let them complete their prescribed duties and perform their vows, and circumambulate the Ancient House.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Hajj: 27-29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore the <em>Hajj</em> is full of religious and worldly benefits, and the arabic letter Laam [ل ] in the saying of Allaah: &lt;&lt;…may witness things that are of benefit to them……&gt;&gt; is the arabic letter <em>Laam</em> which is used for purpose and reason which, here, is connected to the saying of Allaah: &lt;&lt;And proclaim to mankind the <em>Hajj</em>.  They will come to you on foot and on every lean camel………&gt;&gt;, which means; if the <em>Hajj</em> is proclaimed they will come to you walking and riding so that they can witness benefits; i.e. they can be present for their benefits, and the meaning of ‘be present’ is that they can achieve these benefits.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying &lt;&lt; منافع – benefits&gt;&gt; is the plural of &lt;&lt;منفعة – benefit &gt;&gt;, because Allaah intended benefits from this specific act of worship, religious and worldly benefits, which are not found in any other act of worship which is done together, communally.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abee Haatim narrated in his <em>Tafseer</em> on the authority of Ibn Abbas <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhumma-</em> who said regarding the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; may witness things that are of benefit to them&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Benefits in the world and benefits in the Hereafter.  As for benefits of the Hereafter then it is the pleasure of Allaah- <em>Azza wa Jal-</em> and as for benefits of the world then it is what they acquire of the meat of the goat and the slaughtered animals and business.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AbdurRazzaq narrated on the authority of Mujahid <em>–Rahimullaah- </em>regarding the statement of Allaah &lt;&lt;…may witness things that are of benefit to them&gt;&gt; he said: ‘Business and that which is pleasing to Allaah from the matters of the world and the Hereafter.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jareer at-Tabari narrated in his <em>Tafseer</em> on the authority of Mujahid <em>–Rahimullaah-</em> &lt;&lt;…may witness things that are of benefit to them.&gt;&gt;  He said: ‘The reward in the Hereafter and business in the worldly life.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the benefits which the pilgrims achieve and encounter in their <em>Hajj</em> to the House of Allaah the <em>al-Haram</em>, are many and varied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211;       Religious benefits of distinguished acts of worship and momentous acts of obedience which cannot take place except in the <em>Hajj</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211;       Worldly benefits of profits and achieving worldly gains, as Allaah mentions in the context of the <em>Ayaat</em> of <em>Hajj</em> in <em>Soorah</em> al-Baqarah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">لَيۡسَ عَلَيۡكُمۡ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَبۡتَغُواْ فَضۡلٗا مِّن رَّبِّكُمۡۚ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> &lt;&lt;There is no sin on you if you seek the bounty of your Lord &gt;&gt;[al-Baqarah : 198]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Abu Daawood and others on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas <em>&#8211; RadhiAllaah anhu  &#8211;</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘They used to be frightened to buy and sell and to conduct business during the prohibited season and during the <em>Hajj </em>because they would say ‘These are the days of<em>Dhikr</em> (remembrance).’ Then Allaah revealed :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">لَيۡسَ عَلَيۡكُمۡ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَبۡتَغُواْ فَضۡلٗا مِّن رَّبِّكُمۡۚ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> &lt;&lt;There is no sin on you if you seek the bounty of your Lord &gt;&gt;[al-Baqarah : 198]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas <em>-RadiAllaah anhu-</em> that he said, regarding the meaning of this Ayaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is no harm in you buying and selling before the <em>Ihraam</em> or after it.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad al-Ameen ash-Shanqitee <em>-Rahimullaahi-</em> said : ‘And the scholars of<em>Tafseer</em> are agreed on the meaning of the statement of Allaah : &lt;&lt;There is no sin on you if you seek the bounty of your Lord &gt;&gt; that there is no sin upon the person performing <em>Hajj</em> nor is there any harm if he desires to profit from business during the days of <em>Hajj</em> if this does not busy  him from performing the rituals of <em>Hajj</em>.’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from the worldly benefits for the people doing <em>Hajj</em> are what they gain from the sacrificial and slaughtered animals, as Allaah Ta’ala mentions :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; In them (cattle offered for sacrifice) are benefits for you for an appointed term and afterwards they are brought for sacrifice unto the Ancient House &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further to that is what the pilgrim gains of religious benefits, which cannot be compared to the worldly benefits since, in the <em>Hajj</em>, there are great rewards and plentiful expiations, forgiveness of sins, cancellation of bad deeds and many other great religious benefits which cannot be counted- all of which the pilgrim attains if he has Taqwa of Allaah during his <em>Hajj</em> by fulfilling His commands and keeping away from His prohibitions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What greater good can there be?  What can be more profitable than that the pilgrim departs from his <em>Hajj</em> and he is as he was on the day his mother gave birth to him, with no sin or mistake, as Allaah mentions :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">فَمَن تَعَجَّلَ فِي يَوۡمَيۡنِ فَلَآ إِثۡمَ عَلَيۡهِ وَمَن تَأَخَّرَ فَلَآ إِثۡمَ عَلَيۡهِۖ لِمَنِ ٱتَّقَىٰۗ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; But whosoever hastens to leave in two days, there is no sin on him and whosoever stays on, there is no sin on him, if his aim is to do good&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Baqarah :203]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jareer chose in his <em>Tafseer</em> of this <em>Ayaah</em>, after mentioning the sayings of the people of knowledge, the saying, that its meaning is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘So whosoever hastens the two days from the three days of Mina and he leaves on the second day, then there is no sin upon him since Allaah has purged him of his sins, if he had feared Allaah during his <em>Hajj</em>, avoided that which Allaah had ordered him to avoid, and done what Allaah had commanded him to do and had been obedient in performing the <em>Hajj</em> according to what Allaah had required from him, from His laws. Whosoever delays the <em>Hajj</em> until the third day ……..then there is no sin upon him, since Allaah has covered up what has preceded from his sins and crimes if he had <em>Taqwa</em> of Allaah whilst carrying out the <em>Hajj</em> within its limits.’[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Ibn Jareer mentions some clear narrations from the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> – with this meaning, and from them is his <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em> –</em> saying: ‘He who performs <em>Hajj</em> and does not commit intercourse nor is disobedient to Allaah then he returns cleansed from his sins just as the day his mother gave birth to him.’[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The  Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The reward of a complete <em>Hajj</em> is nothing but Paradise.’[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The  Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> – said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Perform the <em>Hajj</em> and the <em>‘Umrah</em> regularly since they do indeed negate poverty and sins just as the bellows get rid of the filth from iron.’[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these texts show that if the pilgrim performs <em>Hajj</em> within its limits according to what Allaah commanded then he has become free from all his sins, as Allaah &#8211;<em>Jala wa ‘Ala</em> – says :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">فَلَآ إِثۡمَ عَلَيۡهِۖ لِمَنِ ٱتَّقَىٰۗ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;there is no sin on him, if his aim is to do good &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Baqarah :203]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning; for the one who fears Allaah in his <em>Hajj</em> by carrying out the commands and keeping away from the prohibitions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that this is a great virtue and an amazing benefit which the believing hearts hasten to receive and the truthful souls desire to achieve.  By Allaah how great are His virtues and how great are the benefits.  When the pilgrim returns to his country after having carried out his <em>Hajj</em> and having his sins forgiven, he is left pure and clean from his sins and bad deeds, just as the day his mother gave birth to him, with no sin upon him nor any mistakes if he had <em>Taqwaa</em> of his Lord in his <em>Hajj</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In fact, from the great favours of the Lord – far is He from imperfection – and from His beautiful kindness to His pilgrim slaves, is that He boasts to His Angels about the pilgrims to His House <em>al-Haram</em> when they stand altogether on the plain of ‘Arafat and says: ‘Look at My slaves coming to Me from every deep valley with dishevelled hair, covered in dust and sacrificing , I take you as witnesses that I have indeed forgiven them.’[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By this, it becomes clear that the pilgrim returns from his <em>Hajj</em> with the greatest of profits and the biggest of gains and it is none other than forgiveness from his Lord for his sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, after his <em>Hajj</em> he begins a new, righteous life full of <em>Eemaan</em> and <em>Taqwaa</em>, filled with goodness, being upright and persistent in obedience, but achieving this reward is conditional on performing the <em>Hajj</em> correctly with sincerity and truthfulness and sincere repentance, coupled with avoiding anything of committing intercourse or disobedience to Allaah that cancels out the <em>Hajj</em>, as was mentioned earlier.  If he performs his <em>Hajj</em>like this, then it wipes out what was before it and the pilgrim departs from his <em>Hajj</em> in a wonderful state, like the day his mother gave birth to him without any sin or mistakes.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#993300;">Lessons of Creed Acquired From the Hajj &#8211; ‘AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-Badr</span><br>
<span style="color:#993300;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 1</h3>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">An Explanation Concerning the <em>Hajj</em> being a Great Centre of Learning</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that the <em>Hajj</em> is from the best acts of obedience and from the most magnificent ways by which the Muslim seeks closeness to his Lord. Rather, it is an act from the acts of worship, which Allaah has made obligatory and has made one of the five pillars upon which the upright religion of Islaam rests.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> explained this with his saying in the authentic hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Islaam is built upon five: The testification that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah and that Muhammad is His Messenger, establishing the prayer, payment of the<em>Zakaat</em>, the fasting of <em>Ramadan</em> and <em>Hajj</em> of the House.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The obligation of <em>Hajj</em> is established from him <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> in many ahaadeeth encouraging his <em>Ummah</em> to perform the <em>Hajj</em> and urging them to fulfil this great act of obedience. He explained the great rewards, the abundance of recompense and the forgiveness of sins they would profit from in the <em>Hajj</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim narrated in his authentic collection that the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam–</em> said to ‘Amr bin al-Aaas <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> when he became a Muslim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Did you not know that accepting Islaam wipes out what was before it, migration (<em>Hijra</em>) wipes out that what was before it, and that the <em>Hajj</em> wipes out what was before it.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been narrated by Bukhari and Muslim from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu- </em>who said: the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘He who performs <em>Hajj</em> and neither commits intercourse nor is disobedient to Allaah then he returns free from his sins just as the day his mother gave birth to him.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Muslim from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu- </em><em>that</em>the Messenger of Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The performance of <em>‘Umrah</em> is an expiation for the sins committed between it and the previous one and the reward of a complete <em>Hajj</em> is nothing but Paradise.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger performed <em>Hajj</em> with the people in the tenth year of his prophetic <em>Hijra</em>(migration) where he practically demonstrated for his <em>Ummah</em> how to perform this great obligation and urged them to learn everything that came from him <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> of actions and sayings. He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Take your <em>Hajj</em> rituals from me, perhaps I will not meet up with you after this year.’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was called the <em>Hajjatul Widdah</em> (the farewell <em>Hajj</em>) and during it the following statement of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> was revealed to the Messenger of Allaah<em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">ٱلۡيَوۡمَ أَكۡمَلۡتُ لَكُمۡ دِينَكُمۡ وَأَتۡمَمۡتُ عَلَيۡكُمۡ نِعۡمَتِي وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ ٱلۡإِسۡلَٰمَ دِينٗاۚ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;Today I have perfected your religion for you, completed my favour upon you and have chosen for you Islaam as your religion &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> [Soorah al-Ma’idah: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed it is obligatory upon every Muslim who comes to perform this great act of obedience, to exert himself and endeavour completely to learn about the Prophet’s <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> guidance regarding the <em>Hajj</em> and how to perform its rituals, thereby following the Prophet’s methodology.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also obligatory to tread along his path and imitate his way so that he can learn the rites from the Prophet and, therefore, accomplish the <em>Hajj</em> completely and with perfection since there is no way to perfect this act of obedience, nor any other act of obedience, except by following the traditions of the noble Messenger<em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> and by proceeding according to his methodology.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that every single Muslim on the face of the earth has his soul awakened in these blessed days where he desires to carry out this great act of worship, craving to fulfil this momentous ritual and loving to see the ancient House of Allaah, because indeed all the Muslims have a pledge to go to the House of Allaah, the <em>Haram</em>, and this began when the Muslim ascribed himself to the <em>Deen</em> of Islaam. So, this pledge remains as long as his soul is in his body.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For the child who is born into Islaam, one of the first things that is brought to his attention, from the obligations of Islaam, is that one of the five pillars is performing<em>Hajj</em> to the House of Allaah, the <em>Haram</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the disbeliever then, when he accepts Islaam and testifies that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger, then one of the first obligations of Islaam that faces him, after the two testifications, are the rest of the remaining pillars of Islaam, and they are: establishing the prayer, the giving of the <em>Zakaat</em>, the fasting of <em>Ramadan</em> and <em>Hajj</em> to the House of Allaah the <em>Haram</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first pillar after the two testifications is establishing the five prayers. Allaah has obligated this upon His slaves in every day and night and has made facing the House of Allaah, the <em>Haram</em>, a condition for the correctness of the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">قَدۡ نَرَىٰ تَقَلُّبَ وَجۡهِكَ فِي ٱلسَّمَآءِۖ فَلَنُوَلِّيَنَّكَ قِبۡلَةٗ تَرۡضَىٰهَاۚ فَوَلِّ وَجۡهَكَ شَطۡرَ ٱلۡمَسۡجِدِ<br>
ٱلۡحَرَامِۚ وَحَيۡثُ مَا كُنتُمۡ فَوَلُّواْ وُجُوهَكُمۡ شَطۡرَهُۥۗ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;Verily We have seen the turning of your face towards the heaven. Surely, We shall turn you to a <em>Qiblah</em> that shall please you, so turn in the direction of <em>Masjid al-Haram;</em>, and wherever you people are, turn your faces in prayer in that direction&gt;&gt; [Soorah al-Baqarah: 144]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Muslim’s connection to the House of Allaah, the <em>Haram,</em> remains continuous in every day and night; he faces it, if he has the capability, in every prayer that he performs whether it is an obligatory or optional prayer and he also faces it to supplicate.[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, this fortified link, which is acquired by this connection between the heart of the Muslim and the House of His Lord, and this continuous persistence inevitably drive the Muslim to a pressing desire to direct oneself towards the Ancient House, to gratify the eyes by gazing at it and to perform the <em>Hajj</em> that Allaah has made binding upon the Muslim if he has the means to perform it. So, when the Muslim has the means to perform the <em>Hajj</em>, he hastens to it in order to carry out this obligation with a desire to behold the House which he faces in all his prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">٩٦ فِيهِ ءَايَٰتُۢ بَيِّنَٰتٞ مَّقَامُ إِبۡرَٰهِيمَۖ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; In it are manifest signs (for example), the place of Ibraheem&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Soorah al-Imraan: 97]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So due to this, it is an obligation upon you my brother pilgrim that you increase in your praise of Allaah for His great blessing upon you of giving you the capability to perform this act of obedience, of your arrival to accomplish this worship and of being honoured to be permitted to see the Ancient House of Allaah which is the <em>Qiblah</em> of the Muslims from the east to the west of the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should exert yourself in completing the actions of the <em>Hajj</em> in the best way, with all its conditions, without any transgression or shortcoming, without any negligence or excessiveness, but rather, it should be upon guidance, upright, on a straight path following your noble Messenger &#8211;<em> sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should be seeking, by this action of yours, the pleasure of your Lord, seeking to earn reward from Him, forgiveness for sins and then returning to your country after this blessed journey with your sins forgiven and having had your sacrifices accepted. Also, returning having had your good actions accepted and blessed and returning with a new, good life full of <em>Eemaan</em> and <em>Taqwa</em>, full of goodness and steadfastness and beautified with eagerness and exerting oneself in obedience to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the <em>Hajj </em>is a great opportunity to increase the provisions for the Hereafter with repentance to Allaah, turning repentantly to Him, drawing closer to Him in obedience and seeking His pleasure during the <em>Hajj</em> by carrying out its rituals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The pilgrim has many opportunities to receive beneficial lessons, moving admonitions, important benefits and precious, ripe fruits in <em>‘Aqeedah</em>, worship and manners beginning with the very first action of <em>Hajj</em> which the worshippers carry out at the meeqaat and ending with the last rite of <em>Hajj</em>, which is the <em>Tawaaf</em> of seven circuits, where the pilgrim bids farewell to the House of Allaah,the <em>Haram</em>. Truly, it is a great school of education and <em>Eemaan</em> from which the God-fearing believers graduate. So, they witness great benefits in their <em>Hajj</em>, various lessons and touching sermons by which the hearts are given life and <em>Eemaan</em> is strengthened.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَأَذِّن فِي ٱلنَّاسِ بِٱلۡحَجِّ يَأۡتُوكَ رِجَالٗا وَعَلَىٰ كُلِّ ضَامِرٖ يَأۡتِينَ مِن كُلِّ فَجٍّ عَمِيقٖ ٢٧ لِّيَشۡهَدُواْ مَنَٰفِعَ لَهُمۡ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; And proclaim to mankind the Hajj. They will come to you on foot and on every lean camel, they will come from every deep and distant mountain highway (to perform Hajj). That they may witness things that are of benefit&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Soorah Al-Hajj: 27 – 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The benefits of Hajj cannot be counted, its virtues cannot be thoroughly investigated, nor can its beneficial events and lessons be completely defined. We will stop regularly during this booklet to examine a good number of valuable lessons and tremendous benefits of performing Hajj to the House of Allaah <em>al-Haram</em> and all capability lies with Allaah Alone.</p>

		<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;">Taken from <em>‘Saheeh al-Targheeb wa Tarheeb’<br>
</em>By the Shaykh, <em>‘Allaama</em>, the <em>Muhadith</em> Muhammad Nasr ud-Deen al-Albaani</span><br>
<span style="color:#993300;"> Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya<strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated on the authority of Ibn Umar <em>&#8211; radiAllaahu anhuma &#8211;</em> who said:  I was sitting with the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> in the <em>masjid</em>in Mina when a man from the Ansaar came and a man from the Thaqeef, they gave <em>Salaam</em> and said, “O Messenger of Allaah, we came to ask you questions.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Messenger said:  “If you want I can inform you why you came and what you want to ask, and I will do so, and if you want I will hold back and you can ask me and I will answer you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said:  “Tell us O Messenger of Allaah!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man from Thaqeef said to the Ansaari:  “Ask.”  So the Ansaari man said:  “Inform me O Messenger of Allaah!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah said:  “You came to me, to ask about leaving your house and aiming for the <em>Bait-ul-Haraam</em> and the reward for it; about praying two <em>Rakah</em> after <em>Tawaaf</em> and the reward for it; going between as-Safa and Marwa and the reward for it; your staying the evening in Mina, and the reward for it; stoning the <em>Jamarah</em> and the reward for it; slaughtering an animal and the reward for it; and the <em>Tawaaf</em> of <em>al-Ifaadh</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man said:  “I swear by the One who sent you with the truth! This is what I came to ask you about.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“As for you leaving your homes aiming for the <em>Bait-ul-Haraam</em>:  then your she-camel does not place its foot nor does it raise it except that Allaah writes for you a reward due to it, and wipes off one of your sins.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As for the two <em>Rakah</em> after the <em>Tawaaf</em>, then it is equivalent to freeing a slave from the Children of Ismaeel.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As for your circuiting of as-Safa and al-Marwa, then it is the same as freeing 70 slaves.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As for you staying till the evening in Arafah, then Allaah descends to the sky of the <em>Duniya</em> and He boasts about you to the Angels, and says:  ‘My slaves have come to Me, looking rough, from every deep valley hoping for My mercy, so if your sins were equivalent to the amount of sand or the drops of rain or like the foam on the sea I will forgive them.  So go forth My slaves!  Having forgiveness and for what or who you have interceded for.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As for stoning the <em>Jamaar</em> (the pillars), then for every stone that you throw, it removes a big sin from the deadly sins.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As for your slaughtering, then it is saved for you with your Lord.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As for shaving your head, then there is a reward for every strand of hair that you shaved, and a sin is wiped off by it.</strong></span></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Hajj is an act of worship that must be devoted only to Allaah. It is a declaration and a manifestation of the belief in the Oneness (tawheed) of Allaah. It is a time to call upon Allaah to purify the self from any worship to other than Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslim who declares the talbiyah: (Labbaika allaahumma labbaik. labbaika laa shareeka laka labbaik; innal-hamda wan-ni&#8217;mata laka wal mulk, laa shareeka lak) understands that it is a du’aa that means: “Here I am O Allaah, here I am. Here I am, You have no partner, here I am. Surely all praise is due to You, and every bounty is from You, and all dominion is Yours, and You have no partner.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslim, therefore, should submit himself completely (mentally, spiritually, and physically) to Allaah Alone. No worship should be devoted to statues, tombs, religious leaders, righteous men (dead or alive) or any part of the creation!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tawheed of Allaah requires the Muslim to follow the perfect way of worship. This is the way (sunnah) of Muhammad sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam as understood by the sahaabah (the companions of the Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam), who were the best of mankind.</p>

Chapter 233<br>
The Obligation of Hajj (Pilgrimage) and its Excellence</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka`bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allah, those who can afford the expenses (for one&#8217;s conveyance, provision and residence); and whoever disbelieves [i.e., denies Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah), then he is a disbeliever of Allah], then Allah stands not in need of any of the `Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists).&#8221;</b></span><b> (3:97)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1271.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">(The superstructure of) Islam is based on five (pillars), testifying the fact that La ilaha illallah wa anna Muhammad-ar-Rasul-ullah [there is no true god except Allah, and Muhammad ((sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) is the Messenger of Allah], establishing As-Salat (the prayers), paying Zakat (poor due), the pilgrimage to the House [of Allah (Ka`bah)], and the Saum (fasting) during the month of Ramadan</span>.&#8221;<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1272.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) delivered a Khutbah and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">O people! Hajj (pilgrimage to the House of Allah) has been made incumbent upon you, so perform Hajj.</span>&#8221; A man inquired: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, is it prescribed every year?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) remained silent till the man repeated it thrice. Then he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Had I replied in the affirmative, it would have surely become obligatory, and you would not have been able to fulfill it.</span>&#8221; Afterwards he said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do not ask me so long as I do not impose anything upon you, because those who were before you were destroyed on account of their frequent questioning and their disagreement with their Prophets. So when I order you to do something, do it as far as you can; and when I forbid you from doing anything, eschew it</span>.&#8221;<br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1273.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was asked: &#8220;Which deed is the best?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Faith in Allah and His Messenger</span>.&#8221; Then he was asked: &#8220;What is next?&#8221; He replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Jihad (holy fighting) in the Cause of Allah</span>.&#8221; Then he was asked, &#8220;What is after that?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Hajj Mabrur (an accepted pilgrimage</span>).&#8221;<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1274.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Whoever performs Hajj (pilgrimage) and does not have sexual relations (with his wife), nor commits sin, nor disputes unjustly (during Hajj), then he returns from Hajj as pure and free from sins as on the day on which his mother gave birth to him</span>.&#8221;<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1275.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;(<span style="color:#0000ff;">The performance of) `Umrah is an expiation for the sins committed between it and the previous `Umrah; and the reward of Hajj Mabrur (i.e., one accepted) is nothing but Jannah</span>.&#8221;<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1276.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: I said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! We consider Jihad as the best deed, should we not then go for Jihad?&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The best Jihad for you women is Hajj Mabrur (i.e., one accepted by Allah</span>).&#8221;<br>
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1277.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">There is no day on which Allah sets free more slaves from Hell than He does on the Day of `Arafah</span>.&#8221;<br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1278.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">(The performance of) `Umrah during Ramadan is equal to Hajj (pilgrimage).&#8221; Or said, &#8220;Equal to the performance of Hajj with me</span>.&#8221;<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1279.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: A woman came to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s obligation upon His slaves has become obligatory on my father in his old age. My father is very old and incapable of riding. May I perform Hajj on his behalf?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Yes</span>.&#8221;<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1280.</b> Laqit bin `Amir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I came to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and said: &#8220;My father is a very old man and does not have strength to perform Hajj (pilgrimage) or `Umrah or to undertake the journey.&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Perform Hajj and `Umrah on behalf of your father</span>.&#8221;<br>
[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1281.</b>  As-Sai&#8217;b bin Yazid (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: <span style="color:#008000;">I was seven years old when I was taken to perform Hajj (pilgrimage). This was during the time the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) performed the Hajjat-ul-Wada` (Farewell Pilgrimage)</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1282.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) came across a caravan at Ar-Rauha&#8217; and asked who the people in the caravan were. They replied that they were Muslims. They asked: &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">I am the Messenger of Allah</span>.&#8221; Then a woman lifted up a boy to him and asked: &#8220;Would this child be credited with having performed the Hajj (pilgrimage)?&#8221; Whereupon he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Yes, and you will have a reward</span>.&#8221;<br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1283.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: <span style="color:#008000;">The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) performed the pilgrimage on an unsaddled camel which also carried his provisions (i.e., his Zamilah)</span>.<br>
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1284.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Ukaz, Mijannah and Dhul-Majaz were markets during the pre-Islamic period. The Companions disliked trading there till the following Ayat of the Noble Qur&#8217;an were revealed: &#8220;<span style="color:#ff0000;">There is no sin on you if you seek the Bounty of your Rubb (during pilgrimage by trading)</span>&#8230;&#8221; (2:198)<br>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 7:</p>
<h3 align="center"><em>The Book of Pilgrimage (Kitab Al-Hajj) </em></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word Hajj means, literally, repairing to a place for the sake of visit (al-qasd li-ziyarah), and in the terminology of the Islamic Shari&#8217;ah, it implies the repairing to Bait-Allah (the house of Allah) to observe the necessary devotion (iqamat-an-li-nusuk) Bait-Allah is one of the names by which the Ka&#8217;ba is called.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hajj is not a new institution which Islam has introduced in its Shari&#8217;ah. This institution is as old as the Ka&#8217;ba itself which is called in the Holy Qur&#8217;an to be&#8221; the first House of Divine Worship appointed for men&#8221; (iii. 95). This verse of the Holy Qur&#8217;an corroborates the hadith which tells us that the Ka&#8217;ba was first built by Adam, the first man upon the earth. It was later on rebuilt by Hadrat Ibrahim and his illustrious son Hadrat Isma&#8217;il (peace be upon both of them). And when Ibrahim and Isma&#8217;al raised the foundations of the house, they said:&#8221; Our Lord! accept from us&#8221; (ii. 127). An earlier revelation makes it clear that the Ka&#8217;ba was already there when Hadrat Ibrahim left Hadrat Isma&#8217;il in the wilderness of Arabia:&#8221; Our Lord! I have settled a part of my offspring in a valley unproductive of fruit near Thy sacred House&#8221; (xiv. 37).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The whole ceremony of Hajj is commemorative of Hadrat Ibrahim and his family&#8217;s acts of devotion to God Almighty. This shows that the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) did not innovate this institution but purged it of all evil practices and made it an obligatory act of piety by which one can develop God-consciousness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is rightly said that it is the perfection of faith since it combines in itself all the distinctive qualities of other obligatory acts. It represents the quality of salat since a pilgrim offers prayers in the Ka&#8217;ba, the House of the Lord. It encourages the spending of material wealth for the sake of the Lord, the chief characteristic of Zakat. When a pilgrim sets out for Hajj, he dissociates himself from his hearth and home, from his dear and near ones to please the Lord. He suffers privation and undertakes the hardship of journey-the lessons we learn from fasting and i&#8217;tikaf. In Hajj one is trained to be completely forgetful of the material comforts and show of worldly thing. One has to sleep on stony ground, circumambulate the Ka&#8217;ba, run between Safa and Marwa and spend his night and day wearing, only two pieces of unsewn cloth. He is required to avoid the use of oil or scent or any other perfume. He is not even allowed to get his hair cut or trim his beard. In short, he is commanded to abandon everything for the sake of Allah and submit himself before his Lord, the ultimate aim of the life of a Muslim. In fact, physical pilgrimage is a prelude to spiritual pilgrimage to God, when man would bid goodbye to everything of the world and present himself before Him as His humble servant saying:&#8221; Here I am before Thee, my Lord, as a slave of Thine.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Down through the ages.&#8221; says Professor Hitti, &#8220;this institution has continued to serve as the major unifying influence in Islam and the most effective common bond among the diverse believers. It rendered almost every capable Moslem perforce a traveller for once in his lifetime. The socializing influence of such a gathering of the brotherhood of believers from the far quarters of the earth is hard to overestimate. It afforded opportunity for negroes, Berbers, Chinese, Persians, Syrians, Turks-rich and poor, high and low-to fraternize and meet together on the common ground of faith&#8221; (History of the Arabs, p. 136).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported that a person asked the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) what a Muhrim should put on as dress. Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Do not put on a shirt or a turban, or trousers or a cap, or leather stockings except one who does not find shoes; he may put on stockings but he should trim them below the ankles. And do not wear clothes to which saffron or wars is applied.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Salim reported on the authority of his father (&#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Umar) that the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) was asked what a Muhrim should wear, whereupon he said: A Muhrim should not wear a shirt, or a turban, or a cap, or trousers, or a cloth touched with wars or with saffron, nor (should he wear) stock- ings, but in case he does not find shoes, but (before wearing stockings) be should trim them (in such a way) that these should become lower than the ankles.</p>

He said (to the Holy Prophet): What do you command me to do during my Umra? (It was at this juncture) that the revelation came to the Apostle of Allah (way peace be upon him) and he was covered with a cloth, and Ya&#8217;la said: Would that I see revelation coming to the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him). He (Hadrat &#8216;Umar) said: Would it please you to see the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) receiving the revelations &#8216;Umar lifted a corner of the cloth and I looked at him and he was emitting a sound of snorting. He (the narrator) said: I thought it was the sound of a camel. When he was relieved of this he said: Where is he who asked about Umra? When the person came, the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: Wash out the trace of yellowness, or he said: the trace of perfume and put off the cloak and do in your &#8216;Umra what you do in your Hajj.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Safwan b. Ya&#8217;la b. Umayya reported that Ya&#8217;la used to say to &#8216;Umar b. Khattab (Allah be pleased with him): Would that I see revelation descending upon the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him). (Once) when the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) was in Ji&#8217;rana and there was a cloth which provided shade over him, and there were his Companions with him. &#8216;Umar being one of them, there came a person with a cloak of wool on him daubed with perfume and he said: Messenger of Allah, what about the person who, entered upon the state of Ihram with a cloak after daub- ing it with perfume? The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) looked at him for a short while, and then became quiet, and revelation began descending upon him, and &#8216;Umar gestured (with his hand) to Ya&#8217;la b Umayya to come. Ya&#8217;la came and he enter- ed his head (beneath the cloth and saw) the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) with his face red, and breathing with a snore. Then he felt relieved (of that burden) and he said: Where is the man who was just asking me about Umra? The man was searched for and he was brought, and the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: So far as the perfume is concerned, wash it three times, and remove the cloak too (as it was sewn) and do in &#8216;Umra as you do in Hajj.</p>

And &#8216;Umar screened him and it was (usual) with &#8216;Umar that when the revelation descended upon him, he provided him shade (with the help of a piece of cloth). I (the person who came to the Holy Prophet) said: I said to &#8216;Umar I wish to project my head into the cloth (to see how the Holy Prophet receives revelation). So when the revelation began to descend upon him &#8216;Umar wrapped him (the Holy Prophet) with cloth I came to him and projected my head with him into the cloth, and saw him (the Holy Prophet) (receiving the revelation). When he (the Holy Prophet) was relieved (of its burden), he said: Where is the inquirer who was just inquiring about &#8216;Umra? That man came to him. Thereupon he (the Apostle of Allah) said: Take off the cloak from (your body) and wash the traces of perfume which were upon you, and do in &#8216;Umra what you did in Hajj.</p>

I attacked It with a spear and held it, and begged for their (i. e. of his companions) assistance, but they refused to help me and we ate its meat.

I met him and said: Messenger of Allah. your Companions convey salutations and benedictions of Allah to you and they fear that they may not be separated from you (and the enemy may do harm to you), so wait for them, and he (the Holy Prophet) waited for them. I said: Messenger of Allah, I killed a game and there is left with me (some of the meat). The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) said to his people: Eat it. And they were in the state of Ihram.</p>

I (Ka&#8217;b) said: Then this verse was revealed:&#8221; Com- pensation (in the form of) fasting or alms or a sacrifice.&#8221; He (the Holy Prophet) said: (It Implies) fasting for three days, or feeding six needy perscins, half sa&#8217; of food for every needy person.

They then put off Ihram and then made the last circuit after they had returned from Mina after performing their Hajj, but those who had combined the Hajj and the Umra made only one circuit (as they had combined Hajj and &#8216;Umra).</p>

So some of thtm performed Hajj whereas others who had no sacrificial animals with them did not do (Hajj, but per- formed only &#8216;Umra).

He said: What has happened to you? I said: I do not observe prayer (due to the monthly period), whereupon besaid: It would not harm you; you should perform (during this time) the rituals of Hajj (which you can do outside the House). Maybe Allah will compensate you for this. You are one among the daughters of Adam and Allah has ordained for you as He has ordained for them. So I proceeded on (with the rituals of Hajj) till we came to Mina. I washed myself and then circumambuleted the House, and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) encamped at Muhassab and called, Abd al-Rahman b.

I said: Messenger of Allah, who has annoyed you? May Allah cast him in fire I He said: Don&#8217;t you know that I commanded the people to do an act, but they are hesitant. (Hakam said: I think that he said: They seem to be hesitant.) And if I were to know my affair before what I had to do subsequently, I would not have brought with me the sacrificial animals, and would have bought them (at Mecca) and would have put off lhram as others have done.</p>

And if there were not sacrificial animals with me, I would also have put off Ihram as you have put off. And if I were to know this matter of mine what I have come to know later on. I would not have brought sacrificial animals with me. SO they (the Companions) put. olf Ihrim and we also put off and listened to (the Holy Prophet) and obeyed (his command). Jabir said: &#8216;All came with the revenue of the taxes (from Yemen). He (the Holy Prophet) said: For what (purpose) have you entered into the state of Ihram (whether you entered into the state purely for Hajj and, Umra jointly or Hajj and Umra separately)? He said: For the purpose for which the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) had entered. (The Holy Prophet had entered as a Qiran, i. e. Ihram covering both Umra and Hajj simultaneously.) Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Offer a sacrifice of animal, and retain Ihram. And &#8216;All brought a sacrificial animal for him (for the Holy Prophet). Suraqa b.

When it was the day of Tarwiya, then put on Ihram for Hajj and make lhram for Mut&#8217;a (you had put on Ihram i f or Hajj, but take it off af ter perf orming Umra and then again put on Ihram for Hajj). They said: How should we make it Mut&#8217;a although we entered upon lhram in the name of Hajj? He said: Do whatever I command you to do. Had I not brought sacrificial animals with me, I would have done as I have commanded you to do. But it is not permissible for me to put off Ihram till tLe sacrifice is offered.

<p style="text-align:justify;">FAREWELL PILGRIMAGE OF THE APOSTLE OF ALLAH (MAY PEACE BE UPON HIM)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as the first revelation in the cave of Hira&#8217; marks the advent of the apostolic mission of Muhammad (May peace be upon him), similarly his Farewell Pilgrimage marks its crowning glory. Opinions differ as to when Hajj became obligatory but the commonly accepted opinion is that it was in the eighth year of Hijra that Allah declared it as one of the five fundamentals of Islam. In the ninth year of Hijra the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) sent Abu Bakr as the leader of the Hajj delegation but he himself did not go. Hadrat Abu Bakr was later on joined by Hadrat Ali in order to make a sure declaration on behalf of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) which concerned the freedom from obligation in regard to those idolatrous tribes who had shown no respect for the treaties which they had entered into with the Holy Prophet (May peace be upon him). This declaration is contains in the opening verses of Sura Tauba.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Holy Prophet (May peace be upon him) spent this year in making preparations for the Hajj in the tenth year of Hijra which coincided with the sixty-third year (the last year) of his life. Every attempt was, therefore, made to take full advantage of this great assembly. Messengers were sent to all parts of Arabia inviting people to join him in this great Pilgrimage. It was necessary for them since they should learn by first-hand knowledge the several injunctions and practices of the Pilgrimage-free from all taints of ignorance-an ideal pattern which was to be kept intact in its pristine glory for all times to come. Not only the rites and rituals of the Pilgrimage were to be finally explained by the Holy Prophet (May peace be upon him) but all those things which had any concern with Islam had been finalized.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Holy Prophet (May peace be upon him) delivered a khutba on the 24th of Dhi-Qa&#8217;da on the occasion of the Friday prayer and gave the Muslims necessary instructions relating to Hajj. Next day, I. e. on the 25th of Dhi-Qa&#8217;da, he set out after Zuhr prayer on a journey for Hajj along with thousands of his devoted Companions. The &#8216;Asr prayer was offered at Dhu&#8217;l-Hulaifa. The caravan spent the night there and it was there after the Zuhr prayer that the Holy Prophet (May peace be upon him) and his Companions put on Ihram and proceeded towards Mecca. They reached their destination on the 4th of Dhu&#8217;l-Hijja pronouncing Talbiya (Labbaik, Labbaik, Allahumma Labbaik).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As the caravan moved on the number of participants swelled till, according to some of the narrators, it reached more than one lakh and thirty thousands. The Farewell Pilgrimage is one of the most important occasions in the sacred life of Muhammad (May peace be upon him). Apart from the rites and rituals, the addresses and speeches of the Holy Prophet (May peace be upon him) succinctly sum up the teachings of Islam.</p>

Ask whatever you want to ask. And I asked him but as he was blind (he could not respond to me immediately), and the time for prayer came. He stood up covering himself in his mantle. And whenever he placed its ends upon his shoulders they slipped down on account of being short (in size). Another mantle was, however, lying on the clothes rack near by. And he led us in the prayer.

And he pointed with his hand nine, and then stated: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) stayed in (Medina) for nine years but did not perform Hajj, then he made a public announcement in the tenth year to the effect that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was about to perform the Hajj. A large number of persons came to Medina and all of them were anxious to follow the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) and do according to his doing. We set out with him till we reached Dhu&#8217;l-Hulaifa. Asma&#8217; daughter of Umais gave birth to Muhammad b. Abu Bakr. She sent message to the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) asking him: What should 1 do? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Take a bath, bandage your private parts and put on Ihram. The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) then prayed in the mosque and then mounted al-Qaswa (his she-camel) and it stood erect with him on its back at al-Baida&#8217;. And I saw as far as I could see in front of me but riders and pedestrians, and also on my right and on my left and behind me like this. And the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was prominent among us and the (revelation) of the Holy Qur&#8217;an was descending upon him. And it is he who knows (its true) significance. And whatever he did, we also did that. He pronounced the Oneness of Allah (saying):&#8221; Labbaik,0 Allah, Labbaik, Labbaik. Thou hast no partner, praise and grace is Thine and the Sovereignty too; Thou hast no partner.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the people also pronounced this Talbiya which they pronounce (today). The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) did not reject anything out of it. But the Messenger of Allah (May peace. be upon him) adhered to his own Talbiya. Jabir (Allah be pleased with him) said: We did not have any other intention but that of Hajj only, being unaware of the Umra (at that season), but when we came with him to the House, he touched the pillar and (made seven circuits) running three of them and walking four. And then going to the Station of Ibrahim, he recited:&#8221; And adopt the Station of Ibrahim as a place of prayer.&#8221; And this Station was between him and the House. My father said (and I do not know whether he had made a mention of it but that was from Allah&#8217;s Apostle [May peace be upon him] that he recited in two rak&#8217;ahs:&#8221; say: He is Allah One,&#8221; and say:&#8221; Say: 0 unbelievers.&#8221; He then returned to the pillar (Hajar Aswad) and kissed it. He then went out of the gate to al-Safa&#8217; and as he reached near it he recited:&#8221; Al-Safa&#8217; and al-Marwa are among the signs appointed by Allah,&#8221; (adding: ) I begin with what Allah (has commanded me) to begin. He first mounted al-Safa&#8217; till he saw the House, and facing Qibla he declared the Oneness of Allah and glorified Him, and said:&#8221; There is no god but Allah, One, there is no partner with Him. His is the Sovereignty. to Him praise is due. and He is Powerful over everything. There is no god but Allah alone, Who fulfilled His promise, helped His servant and routed the confederates alone.&#8221; He then made supplication in the course of that saying such words three times. He then descended and walked towards al-Marwa, and when his feet came down in the bottom of the valley, he ran, and when he began to ascend he walked till he reached al-Marwa. There he did as he had done at al-Safa&#8217;. And when it was his last running at al-Marwa he said: If I had known beforehand what I have come to know afterwards, I would not have brought sacrificial animals and would have performed an &#8216;Umra. So, he who among you has not the sacrificial animals with him should put off Ihram and treat it as an Umra. Suraqa b. Malik b. Ju&#8217;sham got up and said: Messenger of Allah, does it apply to the present year, or does it apply forever? Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) intertwined the fingers (of one hand) into another and said twice: The &#8216;Umra has become incorporated in the Hajj (adding):&#8221; No, but for ever and ever.&#8221; &#8216;All came from the Yemen with the sacrificial animals for the Prophet (May peace be upon him) and found Fatimah (Allah be pleased with her) to be one among those who had put off Ihram and had put on dyed clothes and had applied antimony. He (Hadrat&#8217;Ali) showed disapproval to it, whereupon she said: My father has commanded me to do this. He (the narrator) said that &#8216;Ali used to say in Iraq: I went to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) showing annoyance at Fatimah for what she had done, and asked the (verdict) of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) regarding what she had narrated from him, and told him that I was angry with her, whereupon he said: She has told the truth, she has told the truth. (The Holy Prophet then asked &#8216;Ali): What did you say when you undertook to go for Hajj? I (&#8216;Ali) said: 0 Allah, I am putting on Ihram for the same purpose as Thy Messenger has put it on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: I have with me sacrificial animals, so do not put off the Ihram. He (Jabir) said: The total number of those sacrificial animals brought by &#8216;Ali from the Yemen and of those brought by the Apostle (may peace be upon him) was one hundred. Then all the people except the Apostle (may peace be upon him) and those who had with them sacrificial animals, put off Ihram, and got their hair clipped; when it was the day of Tarwiya (8th of Dhu&#8217;l-Hijja) they went to Mina and put on the Ihram for Hajj and the Messenger of Ailah (may peace be upon him) rode and led the noon, afternoon, sunset &#8216;Isha&#8217; and dawn prayers. He then waited a little till the sun rose, and commanded that a tent of hair should be pitched at Namira. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) then set out and the Quraish did not doubt that he would halt at al-Mash&#8217;ar al-Haram (the sacred site) as the Quraish used to do in the pre-Islamic period. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), however, passed on till he came to &#8216;Arafa and he found that the tent had been pitched for him at Namira. There he got down till the sun had passed the meridian; he commanded that al-Qaswa should be brought and saddled for him. Then he came to the bottom of the valley, and addressed the people saying: Verily your blood, your property are as sacred and inviolable as the sacredness of this day of yours, in this month of yours, in this town of yours. Behold! Everything pertaining to the Days of Ignorance is under my feet completely abolished. Abolished are also the blood-revenges of the Days of Ignorance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first claim of ours on blood-revenge which I abolish is that of the son of Rabi&#8217;a b. al-Harith, who was nursed among the tribe of Sa&#8217;d and killed by Hudhail. And the usury of she pre-Islamic period is abolished, and the first of our usury I abolish is that of &#8216;Abbas b. &#8216;Abd al-Muttalib, for it is all abolished. Fear Allah concerning women! Verily you have taken them on the security of Allah, and intercourse with them has been made lawful unto you by words of Allah. You too have right over them, and that they should not allow anyone to sit on your bed whom you do not like. But if they do that, you can chastise them but not severely. Their rights upon you are that you should provide them with food and clothing in a fitting manner. I have left among you the Book of Allah, and if you hold fast to it, you would never go astray. And you would be asked about me (on the Day of Resurrection), (now tell me) what would you say? They (the audience) said: We will bear witness that you have conveyed (the message), discharged (the ministry of Prophethood) and given wise (sincere) counsel. He (the narrator) said: He (the Holy Prophet) then raised his forefinger towards the sky and pointing it at the people (said):&#8221; O Allah, be witness. 0 Allah, be witness,&#8221; saying it thrice. (Bilal then) pronounced Adhan and later on Iqama and he (the Holy Prophet) led the noon prayer. He (Bilal) then uttered Iqama and he (the Holy Prophet) led the afternoon prayer and he observed no other prayer in between the two.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) then mounted his camel and came to the place of stay, making his she-camel al-Qaswa, turn towards the side where there we are rocks, having the path taken by those who went on foot in front of him, and faced the Qibla. He kept standing there till the sun set, and the yellow light had somewhat gone, and the disc of the sun had disappeared. He made Usama sit behind him, and he pulled the nosestring of Qaswa so forcefully that its head touched the saddle (in order to keep her under perfect control), and he pointed out to the people with his right hand to be moderate (in speed), and whenever he happened to pass over an elevated tract of sand, he slightly loosened it (the nose-string of his camel) till she climbed up and this is how he reached al-Muzdalifa. There he led the evening and &#8216;Isha prayers with one Adhan and two Iqamas and did not glorify (Allah) in between them (i. e. he did not observe supererogatory rak&#8217;ahs between Maghrib and &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayers). The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) then lay down till dawn and offered the dawn prayer with an Adhan and Iqama when the morning light was clear. He again mounted al-Qaswa, and when he came to al-Mash&#8217;ar al-Haram, he faced towards Qibla, supplicated Him, Glorified Him, and pronounced His Uniqueness (La ilaha illa Allah) and Oneness, and kept standing till the daylight was very clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then went quickly before the sun rose, and seated behind him was al-Fadl b. &#8216;Abbas and he was a man having beautiful hair and fair complexion and handsome face. As the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) was moving on, there was also going a group of women (side by side with them). Al-Fadl began to look at them. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) placed his hand on the face of Fadl who then turned his face to the other side, and began to see, and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) turned his hand to the other side and placed it on the face of al-Fadl. He again turned his face to the other side till he came to the bottom of Muhassir. 1680 He urged her (al-Qaswa) a little, and, following the middle road, which comes out at the greatest jamra, he came to the jamra which is near the tree. At this be threw seven small pebbles, saying Allah-o-Akbar while throwing every one of them in a manner in which the small pebbles are thrown (with the help of fingers) and this he did in the bottom of the valley. He then went to the place of sacrifice, and sacrificed sixty-three (camels) with his own hand. Then he gave the remaining number to &#8216;All who sacrificed them, and he shared him in his sacrifice. He then commanded that a piece of flesh from each animal sacrificed should be put in a pot, and when it was cooked, both of them (the Holy Prophet and Hadrat &#8216;All) took some meat out of it and drank its soup. The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) again rode and came to the House, and offered the Zuhr prayer at Mecca. He came to the tribe of Abd al-Muttalib, who were supplying water at Zamzam, and said: Draw water. O Bani &#8216;Abd al-Muttalib; were it not that people would usurp this right of supplying water from you, I would have drawn it along with you. So they handed him a basket and he drank from it.</p>

He first put on Ihram for &#8216;Umra and then for Hajj. and then offered animal sacrifice. So he drove the sacrificial animals with him from Dhu&#8217;l-Hulaifa. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) commenced Ihram of Umra and thus pronounced Talbiya for &#8216;Umra. and then (put on Ihram for Hajj) and pronounced Talbiya for Hajj. And the people performed Tamattu&#8217; in the company of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). They put on Ihram for Umra (first) and then for Hajj. Some of them had sacrificial animals which they had brought with them, whereas some of them had none to sacrifice. So when Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to Mecca, he said to the people: He who amongst you has brought sacrificial animals along with him must not treat as lawful anything which has become unlawful for him till he has completed the Hajj; and he, who amongst you has not brought the sacrificial animals should circumambulate the House, and run between al-Safa&#8217; and al-Marwa and clip (his hair) and put off the Ihram, and then again put on the Ihram for Hajj and offer sacrifice of animals. But he who does not find the sacrificial animal, he should observe fast for three days during the Hajj and for seven days when he returns to his family. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) circumambulated (the House) when he came to Mecca: he first kissed the corner (of the Ka&#8217;ba containing the Black Stone), then ran in three circuits out of seven and walked in four circuits. And then when he had finished the circumambulation of the House he observed two rak&#8217;ahs of prayer at the Station (of Ibrahim), and then pronounced Salaam (for concluding the rak&#8217;ahs), and departed and came to al-Safa&#8217; and ran seven times between al-Safa&#8217; and al-Marwa. After that he did not treat anything as lawful which had become unlawful till he had completed his Hajj and sacrificed his animal on the day of sacrifice (10th of Dhu&#8217;l-Hijja). and then went back quickly (to Mecca) and performed circumambulation of the House (known as tawaf ifada) after which all that was unlawful for him became lawful; and those who had brought the sacrificial animals along with them did as Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had done.

He then proceeded pronouncing Talbiya for both of them together until he reached Mecca, He circumambulated the House. and (ran) between al-Safa&#8217; and al-Marwa and made no addition to it. He neither sacrificed the animal, nor got his head shaved, nor got his hair clipped, nor did he make anything lawful which was unlawful (due to Ihram) until it was the Day of Sacrifice (10th of Dhu&#8217;l-Hijja). He then offered sacrifice, and got his hair cut, and saw that circumambulation of Hajj and &#8216;Umra was complete with the first circumambulation. Ibn &#8216;Umar said: This is how Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had done.</p>

And if he says:&#8221; No, it can&#8217;t be put off,&#8221; then tell him that there is a person who makes such an assertion. He (Muhammad b. &#8216;Abd al-Rahman) then said: I asked him ( Urwa b.

Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) performed Hajj, and &#8216;A&#8217;isha (Allah be pleased with her) has told me that the first thing with which he commenced (the rituals) when he arrived at Mecca was that he performed ablution and then circumambulated the Ka&#8217;ba. Then Abu Bakr performed Hajj and the first thing with which he commenced (the Hajj) as the circumambulation of the Ka&#8217;ba and nothing besides it. So did &#8216;Umar.

Then Mu&#8217;awiya and Abdullah b. &#8216;Umar did that. Then I performed Hajj with my father Zubair b. al-&#8216;Awwam, and the first thing with which he commenced (Hajj) was the circumambulation of the House. He then did nothing besides it. I then saw the emigrants (Muhajirin) and the helpers (Ansar) doing like this and nothing besides it. And the last one whom I saw doing like this was Ibn &#8216;Umar. And he did not break it (the Hajj) after performing &#8216;Umra. And Ibn &#8216;Umar is with them. Why don&#8217;t they ask him (to testify it)? And none amongst those who had passed away commenced (the rituals of Hajj) but by circumambulating the Ka&#8217;ba on their (first arrival) and they did not put off Ihram (without completing the Hajj), and I saw my mother and my aunt commencing (their Hajj) with the circumambulation of the House, and they did not put off Ihram. My mother informed me that she came and her sister, and Zubair and so and so for &#8216;Umra, and when they had kissed the corner (the Black Stone, after Sa&#8217;i and circumambulation), they put off Ihram.

So they intercalated the month of Muharram for Safar and said: When the backs of their camels would become all right and traces (if the pilgrims) would be effaced (from the paths) and the month of Safar would be over, then Umra would be permissible for one who wants to perform it. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and his Companions came in the state of Ihram for performing Hajj on the fourth (of Dhu&#8217;l-Hijja) he (Allah&#8217;s Apostle) commanded them to change their state of Ihram (from Hajj) to that of &#8216;Umra.

One of the inquirers said: Messenger of Allah, I did not know that pebbles should be thrown before sacrificing the animal, and by mistake I sacrificed the animal before throwing pebbles, whereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: (Now) throw pebbles and there is no harm in it. Then another (person) came saying: I did not know that the animal was to be sacrificed before shaving, but I got myself shaved before sacrificing the animal, whereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Sacrifice the animal (now) and there is no harm in it. He (the narrator) said: I did not hear that anything was asked on that day (shout a matter) which a person forgot and could not observe the sequence or anything like it either due to forgetfulness or ignorance, but Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said (about that): Do it; there is no harm in it.</p>

(The idea behind was) that he wanted to exhort them or incite them (to war) against the people of Syria. When the people had arrived he said to them: O people, advise me about the Ka&#8217;ba. Should I demolish it and then build it from its very foundation, or should I repair whatever has been damaged of it? Ibn &#8216;Abbas said: An idea has occurred to me according to which I think that you should only repair (the portion which has been) damaged, and leave the House (in that very state in which) people embraced Islam (and leave those very stones in the same state) when people embraced Islam, and over which Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) had raised it. Thereupon Ibn Zubair said: It the house of any one of you is burnt, he would not be contented until he had reconstructed it, then what about the House of your Lord (which is far more Important than your house)? I would seek good advice from my Lord thrice and then I would make up (my mind) about this affair. After seeking good advice thrice, he made up his mind to demolish it. The people apprehended that calamity might fall from heaven on those persons who would be first to climb (over the building for the purpose of demolishing it), till one (took up courage, and ascended the roof), and threw down one of its stones. When the people saw no calamity befalling him, they followed him, demolished it until it was razed to the ground. Then Ibn Zubair erected pillars and hung cartains on them (in order to provide facilities to the people for observing the time of its construction). And the walls were raised; and Ibn Zubair said: I heard &#8216;A&#8217;isha (Allah be pleased with her) say that Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) had observed: If the people had Rot recently (abandoned) unbelief, find I had means enough to reconstruct it, which I had not, I would have definitely excompassed in it five cubits of area from Hijr. And I would also have constructed a door for the people to enter, and a door for their exit. I today have (the means to spend) and I entertain no fearfrom the side of people (that they would protest against this change). So he added five cubits of area from the side of Hatim to it that there appeared (the old) foundation (upon which Hadrat Ibrahim had built the Ka&#8217;ba). and the people saw that and it was upon this foundation that the wall was raised. The length of the Ka&#8217;ba was eighteen cubits. when addition was made to it (which was in its breadth), then naturally the length appears to be) small (as compared with its breadth). Then addition of ten cubits (of area) was made in its length (also). Two doors were also constructed, one of which (was meant) for entrance and the other one for exit. When Ibn Zubair (Allah be pleased with him) was killed, Hajjaj wrote to &#8216;Abd al-Malik (b. Marwan) informing him about it, and telling him that Ibn Zubair (Allah be pleased with him) had built (the Ka&#8217;ba) on those very foundations (which were laid by Ibrahim) and which reliable persons among the Meccans had seen. &#8216;Abd al-Malik wrote to him: We are not concerned with the censuring of Ibn Zubair in anything. Keep intact the addition made by him in the side of length, and whatever he has added frem the side of Hijr revert to (its previous) foundation, and wall up the door which he had opened. Thus Hajjaj at the command of Abd al-Malik) demolished it (that portion) and rebuilt it on (its previous) foundations.</p>

He showed her about fifteen cubits of area from the side of Hatim (that they had separated). This is the narration transmitted by &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubaid. Walid b. &#8216;Ata&#8217; has, however, made this addition to it:&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: I would have made two doors on the level of the ground (facing) the east and the west. Do you know why your people raised the level of its door (i. e. the door of the Ka&#8217;ba)? She said: No. He said: (They did it) out of vanity so that (they might be in a position) to grant admittance to him only whom they wished. When a person intended to get into it, they let him climb (the stairs), and as he was about to enter, they pushed him and he fell down.&#8221; &#8216;Abd al-Malik said to Harith; Did you yourself hear her saying this? He said: Yes. He (Harith) said that he (&#8216;Abd al-Malik) scratched the ground with his staff for some time and then said: I wish I had left his (Ibn Zubair&#8217;s) work there.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbas (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying on the Day of Victory over Mecca: There is no Hijra (emigration) but only Jihad and good intention; and when you are called to battle, then go forth. He also said on the Day of Victory over Mecca: Allah made this town sacred on the day He created the earth and the heavens; so it is -sacred by the sacred- ness conferred on it by Allah until the Day of Resurrection and fighting in it was not lawful to anyone before me, and it was made lawful for me only during an hour on one day, for it is sacred by the sacredness conferred on it by Allah until the Day of Resurrection. Its thorns are not to be cut, its game is not to be molested, and the things dropped are to be picked up only by one who makes a public announcement of it, and its fresh herbage is not to be cut. Abbas (Allah be pleased with him) said: Messenger of Allah, exception may be made in case of rush, for it is useful for their blacksmiths and for their houses. He (the Holy Prophet) conceding the suggestion of &#8216;Abbas) said: Except rush.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Shuraih al-&#8216;Adawi reported that he said to Amr b. Sa&#8217;id when he was sending troops to Mecca: Let me tell you something. O Commander, which Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said on the day following, the Conquest which my ears heard and my heart has retained, and my eyes saw as he spoke it. He praised Allah and extolled Him and then said: Allah, not men, has made Mecca sacred; so it is not permissible for any person believing in Allah and the Last Day to shed blood in it, or lop a tree in it. If anyone seeks a concession on the basis of fighting of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), tell him that Allah permitted His Messenger, but not you, and He gave him permission only for an hour on one day, and its sacredness was restored on the very day like that of yesterday. Let him who is present convey the information to him who is absent. It was said to Abu Shuraih: What did Amr say to you? He said: I am better informed of that than you, Abu Shuraih, but the sacred territory does not grant protection to one who is disobedient, or one who runs away after shedding blood, or one who runs away after committing</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Huraira, (Allah be pleased with him) reported. When Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, granted Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) victory over Mecca, he stood before people and praised and extolled Allah and then said: Verily Allah held back the elephants from Mecca and gave the domination of it to His Messenger and believers, and it (this territory) was not violable to anyone before me and it was made violable to me for an hour of a day, and it shall not be violable to anyone after me. So neither molest the game, nor weed out thorns from it. And it is not lawful for anyone to pick up a thing dropped but one who makes public announcement of it. And it a relative of anyone is killed he is entitled to opt for one of two things. Either he should be paid blood-money or he can take life as (a just retribution). &#8216;Abbas (Allah be pleased with him) said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, but Idhkhir (a kind of herbage), for we use it for our graves and for our houses, whereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: With the exception of Idhkhir. A person known as Abu Shah, one of the people of Yemen, stood up and said: Messenger of Allah, (kindly) write it for me. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said I Write it for Abu Shah. Walid said: I asked al-Auzai&#8217;: What did his saying mean:&#8221; Write it for me, Messenger of Allah&#8221;? He said: This very address that he had heard from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported: The people of the Khuza&#8217;ah tribe killed a man of the tribe of Laith in the Year of Victory as a retaliation for one whom they had killed (whom the people of the tribe of Laith had killed). It was reported to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). He mounted his camel and delivered this address: Verily Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, held back the Ele- phants from Mecca, and gave its domination to His Messenger and believers. Behold, it was not violable for anyone before me and it will not be violable for anyone after me. Behold, it was made violable for me for an hour of a day; and at this very hour it has again been made inviolable (for me as well as for others). So its thorns are not to be cut, its trees are not to be lopped, and (no one is allowed to) pick up a thing dropped, but the one who makes an announcement of it. And one whose fellow is killed is allowed to opt between two alternatives: either he should receive blood-money or get the life of the (murderer) in return. He (the narrator said): A person from the Yemen, who was called Abu Shah, came to him and said: Messenger of Allah, write it down for me, whereupon he (Allah&#8217;s Messenger) said: Write it down for Abu Shah. One of the persons from among the Quraish also said: Except Idhkhir, for we use it in our houses ant our graves. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Except Idhkhir.</p>

<h3 align="center">Al-Adha Festival Sacrifice (Adaahi)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.068.453"></a>Volume 7, Book 68, Number 453:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said (on the day of Idal-Adha), &#8220;The first thing we will do on this day of ours, is to offer the (&#8216;Id) prayer and then return to slaughter the sacrifice. Whoever does so, he acted according to our Sunna (tradition), and whoever slaughtered (the sacrifice) before the prayer, what he offered was just meat he presented to his family, and that will not be considered as Nusak (sacrifice).&#8221; (On hearing that) Abu Burda bin Niyar got up, for he had slaughtered the sacrifice before the prayer, and said, &#8220;I have got a six month old ram.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8216;Slaughter it (as a sacrifice) but it will not be sufficient for any-one else (as a sacrifice after you). Al-Bara&#8217; added: The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever slaughtered (the sacrifice) after the prayer, he slaughtered it at the right time and followed the tradition of the Muslims.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 454:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever slaughtered the sacrifice before the prayer, he just slaughtered it for himself, and whoever slaughtered it after the prayer, he slaughtered it at the right time and followed the tradition of the Muslims.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 455:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Uqba bin &#8216;Amir Al-Juhani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that the Prophet distributed among his companions some animals for sacrifice (to be slaughtered on &#8216;Id-al-Adha). &#8216;Uqba&#8217;s share was a Jadha&#8217;a (a six month old goat). &#8216;Uqba said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I get in my share of Jadha&#8217;a (a six month old ram).&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Slaughter it as a sacrifice.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 456:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that the Prophet entered upon her when she had her menses at Sarif before entering Mecca, and she was weeping (because she was afraid that she would not be able to perform the Hajj). The Prophet said, &#8220;What is wrong with you? Have you got your period?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;This is a matter Allah has decreed for all the daughters of Adam, so perform all the ceremonies of Hajj like the others, but do not perform the Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added: When we were at Mina, beef was brought to me and I asked, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; They (the people) said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle has slaughtered some cows as sacrifices on behalf of his wives.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 457:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said on the day of Nahr, &#8220;Whoever has slaughtered his sacrifice before the prayer, should repeat it (slaughter another sacrifice).&#8221; A man got up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! This is a day on which meat is desired.&#8221; He then mentioned his neighbors saying, &#8220;I have a six month old ram which is to me better than the meat of two sheep.&#8221; The Prophet allowed him to slaughter it as a sacrifice, but I do not know whether this permission was valid for other than that man or not. The Prophet then went towards two rams and slaughtered them, and then the people went towards some sheep and distributed them among themselves.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 458:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Time has come back to its original state which it had on the day Allah created the Heavens and the Earth. The year is twelve months, four of which are sacred, three of them are in succession, namely Dhul-Qa&#8217;da, Dhul Hijja and Muharram, (the fourth being) Rajab Mudar which is between Juma&#8217;da (ath-thamj and Sha&#8217;ban. The Prophet then asked, &#8220;Which month is this?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Allah and his Apostle know better.&#8221; He kept silent so long that we thought that he would call it by a name other than its real name. He said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the month of Dhul-Hijja?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Which town is this?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; He kept silent so long that we thought that he would call it t,y a name other than its real name. He said, &#8220;isn&#8217;t it the town (of Mecca)?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;What day is today?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; He kept silent so long that we thought that he would call it by a name other than its real name. He said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the day of Nahr?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He then said, &#8220;Your blood, properties and honor are as sacred to one another as this day of yours in this town of yours in this month of yours. You will meet your Lord, and He will ask you about your deeds. Beware! Do not go astray after me by cutting the necks of each other. It is incumbent upon those who are present to convey this message to those who are absent, for some of those to whom it is conveyed may comprehend it better than some of those who have heard it directly.&#8221; (Muhammad, the sub-narrator, on mentioning this used to say: The Prophet then said, &#8220;No doubt! Haven&#8217;t I delivered (Allah&#8217;s) Message (to you)? Haven&#8217;t I delivered Allah&#8217;s message (to you)?&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 462:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Uqba bin &#8216;Amir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that the Prophet gave him some sheep to distribute among his companions to slaughter as sacrifices (&#8216;Id&#8211;al&#8211;Adha). A kid was left and he told the Prophet of that whereupon he said to him, &#8220;Slaughter it as a sacrifice (on your behalf).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 463:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara&#8217; bin &#8216;Azib:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An uncle of mine called Abu Burda, slaughtered his sacrifice before the &#8216;Id prayer. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to him, &#8220;Your (slaughtered) sheep was just mutton (not a sacrifice).&#8221; Abu Burda said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have got a domestic kid.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Slaughter it (as a sacrifice) but it will not be permissible for anybody other than you&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;Whoever slaughtered his sacrifice before the (&#8216;Id) prayer, he only slaughtered for himself, and whoever slaughtered it after the prayer, he offered his sacrifice properly and followed the tradition of the Muslims.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 464:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Burda slaughtered (the sacrifice) before the (&#8216;Id) prayer whereupon the Prophet said to him, &#8220;Slaughter another sacrifice instead of that.&#8221; Abu Burda said, &#8220;I have nothing except a Jadha&#8217;a.&#8221; (Shu&#8217;ba said: Perhaps Abu Burda also said that Jadha&#8217;a was better than an old sheep in his opinion.) The Prophet said, &#8220;(Never mind), slaughter it to make up for the other one, but it will not be sufficient for anyone else after you.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 465:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet slaughtered two rams, black and white in color (as sacrifices), and I saw him putting his foot on their sides and mentioning Allah&#8217;s Name and Takbir (Allahu Akbar). Then he slaughtered them with his own hands.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle entered upon me at Sarif while I was weeping (because I was afraid that I would not be able to perform the ,Hajj). He said, &#8220;What is wrong with you? Have you got your period?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;This is a matter Allah has decreed for all the daughters of Adam, so perform the ceremonies of the Hajj as the pilgrims do, but do not perform the Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle slaughtered some cows as sacrifices on behalf of his wives.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 467:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard the Prophet delivering a sermon, and he said (on the Day of &#8216;Id-Allah. a), &#8220;The first thing we will do on this day of ours is that we will offer the &#8216;Id prayer, then we will return and slaughter our sacrifices; and whoever does so, then indeed he has followed our tradition, and whoever slaughtered his sacrifice (before the prayer), what he offered was just meat that he presented to his family, and that was not a sacrifice.&#8221; Abu Burda got up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I slaughtered the sacrifice before the prayer and I have got a Jadha&#8217;a which is better than an old sheep.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Slaughter it to make up for that, but it will not be sufficient for anybody else after you.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 468:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever slaughtered the sacrifice before the &#8216;Id prayer, should repeat it (slaughter another one).&#8221; A man said &#8220;This is the day on which meat is desired.&#8221; Then he mentioned the need of his neighbors (for meat) and the Prophet seemed to accept his excuse. The man said, &#8220;I have a Jadha&#8217;a which is to me better than two sheep.&#8221; The Prophet allowed him (to slaughter it as a sacrifice). But I do not know whether this permission was general for all Muslims or not. The Prophet then went towards two rams and slaughtered them, and the people went towards their sheep and slaughtered them.</p>

I have already done it. The Prophet said, &#8220;That is something you have done before its due time.&#8221; Abu Burda said, &#8220;I have a Jadha&#8217;a which is better than two old sheep; shall I slaughter it?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes, but it will not be sufficient for anyone after you.&#8221;</p>

Masruq added, I heard the clapping of her hands behind the curtain. She said, &#8220;I used to twist the garlands for the Hadi of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and he used to send his Hadi to Ka&#8217;ba but he never used to regard as unlawful what was lawful for men to do with their wives till the people returned (from the Hajj).&#8221;</p>

<h3 align="center">Pilgrims Prevented from Completing thePilgrimage</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.028.033"></a>Volume 3, Book 28, Number 33:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Abdullah bin Umar set out for Mecca intending to perform Umra, at the time of afflictions, he said, &#8220;If I should be prevented from reaching the Kaba, then I would do the same as Allah&#8217;s Apostle did, so I assume the lhram for Umra as Allah&#8217;s Apostle assumed the Ihram for Umra in the year of Hudaibiya.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 34:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That Ubaidullah bin &#8216;Abdullah and Salim bin &#8216;Abdullah informed him that they told Ibn &#8216;Umar when Ibn Az-Zubair was attacked by the army, saying &#8220;There is no harm for you if you did not perform Hajj this year. We are afraid that you may be prevented from reaching the Kaba.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said &#8220;We set out with Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the non-believers of Quraish prevented us from reaching the Ka&#8217;ba, and so the Prophet slaughtered his Hadi and got his head shaved.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;I make you witnesses that I have made &#8216;Umra obligatory for me. And, Allah willing, I will go and then if the way to Ka&#8217;ba is clear, I will perform the Tawaf, but if I am prevented from going to the Ka&#8217;ba then I will do the same as the Prophet did while I was in his company.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar then assumed Ihram for Umra from Dhul-Hulaifa and proceeded for a while and said, &#8220;The conditions of &#8216;Umra and Hajj are similar and I make you witnesses that I have made &#8216;Umra and Hajj obligatory for myself.&#8221; So, he did not finish the Ihram till the day of Nahr (slaughtering) came, and he slaughtered his Hadi. He used to say, &#8220;I will not finish the Ihram till I perform the Tawaf, one Tawaf on the day of entering Mecca (i.e. of Safa and Marwa for both &#8216;Umra and Hajj).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 35:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi: Some of the sons of &#8216;Abdullah told him (i.e. &#8216;Abdullah) if he had sta</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 36:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle was prevented from performing (&#8216;Umra) Therefore, he shaved his head and had sexual relations with his wives and slaughtered his Hadi and performed Umra in the following year.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 37:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Abdullah) bin &#8216;Umar used to say, &#8220;Is not (the following of) the tradition of Allah&#8217;s Apostle sufficient for you? If anyone of you is prevented from performing Hajj, he should perform the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and between As-Safa and Al-Marwa and then finish the Ihram and everything will become legal for him which was illegal for him (during the state of Ihram) and he can perform Hajj in a following year and he should slaughter a Hadi or fast in case he cannot afford the Hadi.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 38:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Miswar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle slaughtered (the Hadi) before he had his head shaved and then he ordered his Companions to do the same.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 39:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That Abdullah and Salim said to &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar, &#8220;(You should not go for Hajj this year).&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar replied, &#8220;We set out with the Prophet (to Mecca for performing &#8216;Umra) and e infidels of Quraish prevented us from reaching the Ka&#8217;ba. Allah&#8217;s Apostle slaughtered his Budn (camels for sacrifice) and got his head shaved.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 40:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar set out for Mecca with the intentions performing &#8216;Umra in the period of afflictions, he said, &#8220;If I should be prevented from reaching the Ka&#8217;ba, then I would do the same as we did while in the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221; So, he assumed the Ihram for &#8216;Umra since the Prophet had assumed the Ihram for &#8216;Umra in the year of Al-Hudaibiya. Then &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar thought about it and said, &#8220;The conditions for both Hajj and &#8216;Umra are similar.&#8221; He then turned towards his companions and said, &#8220;The conditions of both Hajj and &#8216;Umra are similar and I make you witnesses that I have made the performance of Hajj obligatory for myself along with &#8216;Umra.&#8221; He then performed one Tawaf (between As-Safa and Al-Marwa) for both of them (i.e. Hajj and (&#8216;Umra) and considered that to be sufficient for him and offered a Hadi.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 41:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Layla:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ka&#8217;b bin &#8216;Ujra said that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to him (Ka&#8217;b), &#8220;Perhaps your lice have troubled you?&#8221; Ka&#8217;b replied, &#8220;Yes! O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Have your head shaved and then either fast three days or feed six poor persons or slaughter one sheep as a sacrifice.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 42:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ka&#8217;b bin &#8216;Umra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood beside me at Al-Hudaibiya and the lice were falling from my head in great number. He asked me, &#8220;Have your lice troubled you?&#8221; I replied in the affirmative. He ordered me to get my head shaved. Ka&#8217;b added, &#8220;This Holy Verse:&#8211;&#8216;And if any of you is ill, or has ailment in his scalp (2.196), etc. was revealed regarding me. &#8220;The Prophet then ordered me either to fast three days, or to feed six poor persons with one Faraq (three Sas) (of dates), or to slaughter a sheep, etc (sacrifice) whatever was available.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 43:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Ma&#8217;qal:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I sat with Ka&#8217;b bin &#8216;Ujra and asked him about the Fidya. He replied, &#8220;This revelation was revealed concerning my case especially, but it is also for you in general. I was carried to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the lice were falling in great number on my face. The Prophet said, &#8220;I have never thought that your ailment (or struggle) has reached to such an extent as I see. Can you afford a sheep?&#8221; I replied in the negative. He then said, &#8220;Fast for three days, or feed six poor persons each with half a Sa of food.&#8221; (1 Sa = 3 Kilograms approx.)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 44:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Layla:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Reporting the speech of Ka&#8217;b bin Umra) Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw him (i.e. Ka&#8217;b) while the lice were falling on his face. He asked (him), &#8220;Have your lice troubled you?&#8221; He replied in the affirmative. So, he ordered him to get his head shaved while he was at Al-Hudaibiya. At that time they were not permitted to finish their Ihram, and were still hoping to enter Mecca. So, Allah revealed the verses of Al-Fidya. Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered him to feed six poor persons with one Faraq of food or to slaughter one sheep (as a sacrifice) or to fast for three days.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 45:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whoever performs Hajj to this House (Ka&#8217;ba) and does not approach his wife for sexual relations nor commits sins (while performing Hajj), he will come out as sinless as a newly-born child. (Just delivered by his mother).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 46:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever performs Hajj to this Ka&#8217;ba and does not approach his wife for sexual relations nor commit sins (while performing Hajj), he will come out as sinless as a new-born child, (just delivered by his mother).&#8221;</p>

<h3 align="center">Penalty of Hunting while on Pilgrimage</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.029.047"></a>Volume 3, Book 29, Number 47:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Abu Qatada:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My father set out (for Mecca) in the year of Al-Hudaibiya, and his companions assumed Ihram, but he did not. At that time the Prophet was informed that an enemy wanted to attack him, so the Prophet proceeded onwards. While my father was among his companions, some of them laughed among themselves. (My father said), &#8220;I looked up and saw an onager. I attacked, stabbed and caught it. I then sought my companions&#8217; help but they refused to help me. (Later) we all ate its meat. We were afraid that we might be left behind (separated) from the Prophet so I went in search of the Prophet and made my horse to run at a galloping speed at times and let it go slow at an ordinary speed at other times till I met a man from the tribe of Bani Ghifar at midnight. I asked him, &#8220;Where did you leave the Prophet ?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I left him at Ta&#8217;hun and he had the intention of having the midday rest at As-Suqya. I followed the trace and joined the Prophet and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Your people (companions) send you their compliments, and (ask for) Allah&#8217;s Blessings upon you. They are afraid lest they may be left behind; so please wait for them.&#8217; I added, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I hunted an onager and some of its meat is with me. The Prophet told the people to eat it though all of them were in the state of Ihram.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 29, Number 48:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Abu Qatada:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That his father said &#8220;We proceeded with the Prophet in the year of Al-Hudaibiya and his companions assumed Ihram but I did not. We were informed that some enemies were at Ghaiqa and so we went on towards them. My companions saw an onager and some of them started laughing among themselves. I looked and saw it. I chased it with my horse and stabbed and caught it. I wanted some help from my companions but they refused. (I slaughtered it all alone). We all ate from it (i.e. its meat). Then I followed Allah&#8217;s Apostle lest we should be left behind. At times I urged my horse to run at a galloping speed and at other times at an ordinary slow speed. On the way I met a man from the tribe of Bani Ghifar at midnight. I asked him where he had left Allah&#8217;s Apostle . The man replied that he had left the Prophet at a place called Ta&#8217;hun and he had the intention of having the midday rest at As-Suqya. So, I followed Allah&#8217;s Apostle till I reached him and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have been sent by my companions who send you their greetings and compliments and ask for Allah&#8217;s Mercy and Blessings upon you. They were afraid lest the enemy might intervene between you and them; so please wait for them.&#8221; So he did. Then I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We have hunted an onager and have some of it (i.e. its meat) left over.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle told his companions to eat the meat although all of them were in a state of Ihram.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 29, Number 49:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Qatada:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were in the company of the Prophet at a place called Al-Qaha (which is at a distance of three stages of journey from Medina). Abu Qatada narrated through another group of narrators: We were in the company of the Prophet at a place called Al-Qaha and some of us had assumed Ihram while the others had not. I noticed that some of my companions were watching something, so I looked up and saw an onager. (I rode my horse and took the spear and whip) but my whip fell down (and I asked them to pick it up for me) but they said, &#8220;We will not help you by any means as we are in a state of Ihram.&#8221; So, I picked up the whip myself and attacked the onager from behind a hillock and slaughtered it and brought it to my companions. Some of them said, &#8220;Eat it.&#8221; While some others said, &#8220;Do not eat it.&#8221; So, I went to the Prophet who was ahead of us and asked him about it, He replied, &#8220;Eat it as it is Halal (i.e. it is legal to eat it).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 29, Number 50:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Abu Qatada:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That his father had told him that Allah&#8217;s Apostle set out for Hajj and so did his companions. He sent a batch of his companions by another route and Abu Qatada was one of them. The Prophet said to them, &#8220;Proceed along the sea-shore till we meet all together.&#8221; So, they took the route of the sea-shore, and when they started all of them assumed Ihram except Abu Qatada. While they were proceeding on, his companions saw a group of onagers. Abu Qatada chased the onagers and attacked and wounded a she-onager. They got down and ate some of its meat and said to each other: &#8220;How do we eat the meat of the game while we are in a state of Ihram?&#8221; So, we (they) carried the rest of the she-onager&#8217;s meat, and when they met Allah&#8217;s Apostle they asked, saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We assumed Ihram with the exception of Abu Qatada and we saw (a group) of onagers. Abu Qatada attacked them and wounded a she-onager from them. Then we got down and ate from its meat. Later, we said, (to each other), &#8216;How do we eat the meat of the game and we are in a state of Ihram?&#8217; So, we carried the rest of its meat. The Prophet asked, &#8220;Did anyone of you order Abu Qatada to attack it or point at it?&#8221; They replied in the negative. He said, &#8220;Then eat what is left of its meat.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Shuraih, Al-&#8216;Adawi said that he had said to &#8216;Amr bin Sa&#8217;id when he was sending the troops to Mecca (to fight &#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair), &#8220;O Chief! Allow me to tell you what Allah&#8217;s Apostle said on the day following the Conquest of Mecca. My ears heard that and my heart understood it thoroughly and I saw with my own eyes the Prophet when he, after Glorifying and Praising Allah, started saying, &#8216;Allah, not the people, made Mecca a sanctuary, so anybody who has belief in Allah and the Last Day should neither shed blood in it, nor should he cut down its trees. If anybody tells (argues) that fighting in it is permissible on the basis that Allah&#8217;s Apostle did fight in Mecca, say to him, &#8216;Allah allowed His Apostle and did not allow you.&#8217; &#8220;Allah allowed me only for a few hours on that day (of the conquest) and today its sanctity is valid as it was before. So, those who are present should inform those who are absent (concerning this fact.&#8221; Abu Shuraih was asked, &#8220;What did &#8216;Amr reply?&#8221; He said, (&#8216;Amr said) &#8216;O Abu Shuraih! I know better than you in this respect Mecca does not give protection to a sinner, a murderer or a thief.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Prophet said, &#8216;Allah has made Mecca, a sanctuary, so it was a sanctuary before me and will continue to be a sanctuary after me. It was made legal for me (i.e. I was allowed to fight in it) for a few hours of a day. It is not allowed to uproot its shrubs or to cut its trees, or to chase (or disturb) its game, or to pick up its luqata (fallen things) except by a person who would announce that (what he has found) publicly.&#8217; Al-&#8216;Abbas said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Except Al-ldhkhir (a kind of grass) (for it is used) by our goldsmiths and for our graves.&#8217; The Prophet then said, &#8216;Except Al-idhkhir.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Ikrima said, &#8216;Do you know what &#8220;chasing or disturbing&#8221; the game means?

I greeted him and he asked who I was.

So, these (above mentioned) are the Mawaqit for all those living at those places, and besides them for those who come through those places with the intention of performing Hajj and &#8216;Umra and whoever lives within these places should assume Ihram from his dwelling place, and similarly the people of Mecca can assume lhram from Mecca.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet with his companions started from Medina after combing and oiling his hair and putting on two sheets of lhram (upper body cover and waist cover). He did not forbid anyone to wear any kind of sheets except the ones colored with saffron because they may leave the scent on the skin. And so in the early morning, the Prophet mounted his Mount while in Dhul-Hulaifa and set out till they reached Baida&#8217;, where he and his companions recited Talbiya, and then they did the ceremony of Taqlid (which means to put the colored garlands around the necks of the Budn (camels for sacrifice). And all that happened on the 25th of Dhul-Qa&#8217;da. And when he reached Mecca on the 4th of Dhul-Hijja he performed the Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba and performed the Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. And as he had a Badana and had garlanded it, he did not finish his Ihram. He proceeded towards the highest places of Mecca near Al-Hujun and he was assuming the Ihram for Hajj and did not go near the Ka&#8217;ba after he performed Tawaf (round it) till he returned from &#8216;Arafat. Then he ordered his companions to perform the Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba and then the Tawaf of Safa and Marwa, and to cut short the hair of their heads and to finish their Ihram. And that was only for those people who had not garlanded Budn. Those who had their wives with them were permitted to contact them (have sexual intercourse), and similarly perfume and (ordinary) clothes were permissible for them.</p>

The Prophet then said, &#8220;Whoever has the Hadi with him should assume Ihram for Hajj along with &#8216;Umra and should not finish the Ihram till he finishes both.&#8221; I was menstruating when I reached Mecca, and so I neither did Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba nor Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. I complained about that to the Prophet on which he replied, &#8220;Undo and comb your head hair, and assume Ihram for Hajj (only) and leave the Umra.&#8221; So, I did so. When we had performed the Hajj, the Prophet sent me with my brother &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr to Tan&#8217;im. So I performed the &#8216;Umra. The Prophet said to me, &#8220;This &#8216;Umra is instead of your missed one.&#8221; Those who had assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra (Hajj-atTamattu) performed Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba and between Safa and Marwa and then finished their Ihram. After returning from Mina, they performed another Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa).

He ordered me to perform Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba and between Safa and Marwa and then to finish my Ihram. I did so and went to a woman from my tribe who combed my hair or washed my head. Then, when Umar came (i.e. became Caliph) he said, &#8220;If we follow Allah&#8217;s Book, it orders us to complete Hajj and Umra; as Allah says: &#8220;Perform the Hajj and Umra for Allah.&#8221; (2.196).

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216; Aisha said, &#8220;We set out with Allah&#8217;s Apostles in the months of Hajj, and (in) the nights of Hajj, and at the time and places of Hajj and in a state of Hajj. We dismounted at Sarif (a village six miles from Mecca). The Prophet then addressed his companions and said, &#8220;Anyone who has not got the Hadi and likes to do Umra instead of Hajj may do so (i.e. Hajj-al-Tamattu) and anyone who has got the Hadi should not finish the Ihram after performing &#8216; Umra). (i.e. Hajj-al-Qiran). Aisha added, &#8220;The companions of the Prophet obeyed the above (order) and some of them (i.e. who did not have Hadi) finished their Ihram after Umra.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle and some of his companions were resourceful and had the Hadi with them, they could not perform Umra (alone) (but had to perform both Hajj and Umra with one Ihram). Aisha added, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me and saw me weeping and said, &#8220;What makes you weep, O Hantah?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I have heard your conversation with your companions and I cannot perform the Umra.&#8221; He asked, &#8220;What is wrong with you?&#8217; I replied, &#8216; I do not offer the prayers (i.e. I have my menses).&#8217; He said, &#8216; It will not harm you for you are one of the daughters of Adam, and Allah has written for you (this state) as He has written it for them. Keep on with your intentions for Hajj and Allah may reward you that.&#8221; Aisha further added, &#8220;Then we proceeded for Hajj till we reached Mina and I became clean from my menses. Then I went out from Mina and performed Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; Aisha added, &#8220;I went along with the Prophet in his final departure (from Hajj) till he dismounted at Al-Muhassab (a valley outside Mecca), and we too, dismounted with him.&#8221; He called &#8216; Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr and said to him, &#8216; Take your sister outside the sanctuary of Mecca and let her assume Ihram for &#8216; Umra, and when you had finished &#8216; Umra, return to this place and I will wait for you both till you both return to me.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216; Aisha added, &#8216; &#8216; So we went out of the sanctuary of Mecca and after finishing from the &#8216; Umra and the Tawaf we returned to the Prophet at dawn. He said, &#8216;Have you performed the &#8216; Umra?&#8217; We replied in the affirmative. So he announced the departure amongst his companions and the people set out for the journey, and the Prophet: too left for Medina.&#8221;</p>

So the people who had not driven the Hadi along with them finished their Ihram. The Prophet&#8217;s wives, too, had not driven the Hadi with them, so they too, finished their Ihram.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;I got my menses and could not perform Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; So when it was the night of Hasba (i.e. when we stopped at Al-Muhassab), I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Everyone is returning after performing Hajj and &#8216;Umra but I am returning after performing Hajj only.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Didn&#8217;t you perform Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba the night we reached Mecca?&#8217; I replied in the negative. He said, &#8216;Go with your brother to Tan&#8217;im and assume the Ihram for&#8217;Umra, (and after performing it) come back to such and such a place.&#8217; On that Safiya said, &#8216;I feel that I will detain you all.&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;O &#8216;Aqra Halqa! Didn&#8217;t you perform Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba on the day of sacrifice? (i.e. Tawaf-al-ifada) Safiya replied in the affirmative. He said, (to Safiya). &#8216;There is no harm for you to proceed on with us.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;(after returning from &#8216;Umra), the Prophet met me while he was ascending (from Mecca) and I was descending to it, or I was ascending and he was descending.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">We set out with Allah&#8217;s Apostles (to Mecca) in the year of the Prophet&#8217;s Last Hajj. Some of us had assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra only, some for both Hajj and &#8216;Umra, and others for Hajj only. Allah&#8217;s Apostle assumed Ihram for Hajj. So whoever had assumed Ihram for Hajj or for both Hajj and &#8216;Umra did not finish the Ihram till the day of sacrifice. (See Hadith No. 631, 636, and 639).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The people (of the Pre-lslamic Period) used to think that to perform &#8216;Umra during the months of Hajj was one of the major sins on earth. And also used to consider the month of Safar as a forbidden (i.e. sacred) month and they used to say, &#8220;When the wounds of the camel&#8217;s back heal up (after they return from Hajj) and the signs of those wounds vanish and the month of Safar passes away then (at that time) &#8216;Umra is permissible for the one who wishes to perform it.&#8221; In the morning of the 4th of Dhul-Hijja, the Prophet and his companions reached Mecca, assuming Ihram for Hajj and he ordered his companions to make their intentions of the Ihram for&#8217;Umra only (instead of Hajj) so they considered his order as something great and were puzzled, and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What kind (of finishing) of Ihram is allowed?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Finish the Ihram completely like a non-Muhrim (you are allowed everything).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Hafsa the wife of the Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

I asked Ibn Abbas regarding it and he ordered me to perform Hajj-at-Tammatu&#8217;. Later I saw in a dream someone saying to me, &#8216;Hajj-Mabrur (Hajj performed in accordance with the Prophet&#8217;s tradition without committing sins and accepted by Allah) and an accepted &#8216;Umra.&#8217; So I told that dream to Ibn Abbas. He said, &#8216;This is the tradition of Abu-l-Qasim.&#8217; Then he said to me, &#8216;Stay with me and I shall give you a portion of my property.&#8217; &#8221; I (Shu&#8217;ba) asked, &#8220;Why (did he invite you)?&#8221; He (Abu Jamra) said, &#8220;Because of the dream which I had seen.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I left for Mecca for Hajj-at-Tamattu&#8217; assuming Ihram for &#8216;Umra. I reached Mecca three days before the day of Tarwiya (8th Dhul-Hijja). Some people of Mecca said to me, &#8220;Your Hajj will be like the Hajj performed by the people of Mecca (i.e. you will lose the superiority of assuming Ihram from the Miqat). So I went to &#8216;Ata&#8217; asking him his view about it. He said, &#8220;Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah narrated to me, &#8216;I performed Hajj with Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the day when he drove camels with him. The people had assumed Ihram for Hajj-al-Ifrad. The Prophet ordered them to finish their Ihram after Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba, and between Safa and Marwa and to cut short their hair and then to stay there (in Mecca) as non-Muhrims till the day of Tarwiya (i.e. 8th of Dhul-Hijja) when they would assume Ihram for Hajj and they were ordered to make the Ihram with which they had come as for &#8216;Umra only. They asked, &#8216;How can we make it &#8216;Umra (Tamattu&#8217;) as we have intended to perform Hajj?&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;Do what I have ordered you. Had I not brought the Hadi with me, I would have done the same, but I cannot finish my Ihram till the Hadi reaches its destination (i.e. is slaughtered).&#8217; So, they did (what he ordered them to do).&#8221;</p>

Why don&#8217;t you rebuild it on its original foundation laid by Abraham?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Were it not for the fact that your people are close to the pre-lslamic Period of ignorance (i.e. they have recently become Muslims) I would have done so.&#8221; The sub-narrator, &#8216;Abdullah (bin &#8216;Umar ) stated: &#8216;Aisha &#8216;must have heard this from Allah&#8217;s Apostle for in my opinion Allah&#8217;s Apostle had not placed his hand over the two corners of the Ka&#8217;ba opposite Al-Hijr only because the Ka&#8217;ba was not rebuilt on its original foundations laid by Abraham.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked the Prophet whether the round wall (near Ka&#8217;ba) was part of the Ka&#8217;ba. The Prophet replied in the affirmative. I further said, &#8220;What is wrong with them, why have they not included it in the building of the Ka&#8217;ba?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see that your people (Quraish) ran short of money (so they could not include it inside the building of Ka&#8217;ba)?&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What about its gate? Why is it so high?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Your people did this so as to admit into it whomever they liked and prevent whomever they liked. Were your people not close to the Pre-lslamic Period of ignorance (i.e. they have recently embraced Islam) and were I not afraid that they would dislike it, surely I would have included the (area of the) wall inside the building of the Ka&#8217;ba and I would have lowered its gate to the level of the ground.&#8221;</p>

Were your nation not close to the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance, I would have had the Ka&#8217;ba demolished and would have included in it the portion which had been left, and would have made it at a level with the ground and would have made two doors for it, one towards the east and the other towards the west, and then by doing this it would have been built on the foundations laid by Abraham.&#8221; That was what urged Ibn-Az-Zubair to demolish the Ka&#8217;ba. Jazz said, &#8220;I saw Ibn-Az-Zubair when he demolished and rebuilt the Ka&#8217;ba and included in it a portion of Al-Hijr (the unroofed portion of Ka&#8217;ba which is at present in the form of a compound towards the north-west of the Ka&#8217;ba). I saw the original foundations of Abraham which were of stones resembling the humps of camels.&#8221; So Jarir asked Yazid, &#8220;Where was the place of those stones?&#8221; Jazz said, &#8220;I will just now show it to you.&#8221; So Jarir accompanied Yazid and entered Al-Hijr, and Jazz pointed to a place and said, &#8220;Here it is.&#8221; Jarir said, &#8220;It appeared to me about six cubits from Al-Hijr or so.&#8221;</p>

Jafar and Ali did not inherit anything as they were Muslims and the other two were non-believers. &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab used to say, &#8220;A believer cannot inherit (anything from an) infidel.&#8221; Ibn Shihab, (a sub-narrator) said, &#8220;They (Umar and others) derived the above verdict from Allah&#8217;s Statement: &#8220;Verily! those who believed and Emigrated and strove with their life And property in Allah&#8217;s Cause, And those who helped (the emigrants) And gave them their places to live in, These are (all) allies to one another.&#8221; (8.72)</p>

When we had performed our Hajj, the Prophet sent me with &#8216;Abdur-Rahman to Tan&#8217;im and I performed the &#8216;Umra. The Prophet said, &#8220;This is in lieu of your missed &#8216;Umra.&#8221; Those who had assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra performed Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa) and then finished their Ihram. And then they performed another Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa) after returning from Mina.

He (the son of Ibn &#8216;Umar) said, &#8220;I fear that this year a battle might take place between the people and you might be prevented from going to the Ka&#8217;ba. I suggest that you should stay here.&#8221; Ibn Umar said, &#8220;Once Allah&#8217;s Apostle set out for the pilgrimage, and the pagans of Quraish intervened between him and the Ka&#8217;ba. So, if the people intervened between me and the Ka&#8217;ba, I would do the same as Allah&#8217;s Apostle had done . . . &#8220;Verily, in Allah&#8217;s Apostle you have a good example.&#8221; Then he added, &#8220;I make you a witness that I have intended to perform Hajj along with &#8216;Umra.&#8221; After arriving at Mecca, Ibn &#8216;Umar performed one Tawaf only (between Safa and Marwa).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Umar intended to perform Hajj in the year when Al-Hajjaj attacked Ibn Az-Zubair. Somebody said to Ibn &#8216;Umar, &#8220;There is a danger of an impending war between them.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Verily, in Allah&#8217;s Apostle you have a good example. (And if it happened as you say) then I would do the same as Allah&#8217;s Apostle had done. I make you witness that I have decided to perform &#8216;Umra.&#8221; Then he set out and when he reached Al-Baida&#8217;, he said, &#8220;The ceremonies of both Hajj and &#8216;Umra are similar. I make you witness that I have made Hajj compulsory for me along with &#8216;Umra.&#8221; He drove (to Mecca) a Hadi which he had bought from (a place called) Qudaid and did not do more than that. He did not slaughter the Hadi or finish his Ihram, or shave or cut short his hair till the day of slaughtering the sacrifices (10th Dhul-Hijja). Then he slaughtered his Hadi and shaved his head and considered the first Tawaf (of Safa and Marwa) as sufficient for Hajj and &#8216;Umra. Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle did the same.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 705:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Muhammad bin &#8216;AbdurRahman bin Nawfal Al-Qurashi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked &#8216;Urwa bin Az-Zubair (regarding the Hajj of the Prophet ). &#8216;Urwa replied, &#8220;Aisha narrated, &#8216;When the Prophet reached Mecca, the first thing he started with was the ablution, then he performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and his intention was not &#8216;Umra alone (but Hajj and &#8216;Umra together).&#8217; &#8221; Later Abu Bakr I performed the Hajj and the first thing he started with was Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and it was not &#8216;Umra alone (but Hajj and &#8216;Umra together). And then &#8216;Umar did the same. Then &#8216;Uthman performed the Hajj and the first thing he started with was Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and it was not &#8216;Umra alone. And then Muawiya and &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar did the same. I performed Hajj with Ibn Az-Zubair and the first thing he started with was Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and it was not &#8216;Umra alone, (but Hajj and &#8216;Umra together). Then I saw the Muhajirin (Emigrants) and Ansar doing the same and it was not &#8216;Umra alone. And the last person I saw doing the same was Ibn &#8216;Umar, and he did not do another &#8216;Umra after finishing the first. Now here is Ibn &#8216;Umar present amongst the people! They neither ask him nor anyone of the previous ones. And all these people, on entering Mecca, would not start with anything unless they had performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, and would not finish their Ihram. And no doubt, I saw my mother and my aunt, on entering Mecca doing nothing before performing Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, and they would not finish their lhram. And my mother informed me that she, her sister, Az-Zubair and such and such persons had assumed lhram for &#8216;Umra and after passing their hands over the Corner (the Black Stone) (i.e. finishing their Umra) they finished their Ihram.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 706:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Urwa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked &#8216;Aisha : &#8220;How do you interpret the statement of Allah,. : Verily! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah, and whoever performs the Hajj to the Ka&#8217;ba or performs &#8216;Umra, it is not harmful for him to perform Tawaf between them (Safa and Marwa.) (2.158). By Allah! (it is evident from this revelation) there is no harm if one does not perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;O, my nephew! Your interpretation is not true. Had this interpretation of yours been correct, the statement of Allah should have been, &#8216;It is not harmful for him if he does not perform Tawaf between them.&#8217; But in fact, this divine inspiration was revealed concerning the Ansar who used to assume lhram for worship ping an idol called &#8220;Manat&#8221; which they used to worship at a place called Al-Mushallal before they embraced Islam, and whoever assumed Ihram (for the idol), would consider it not right to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When they embraced Islam, they asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) regarding it, saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We used to refrain from Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.&#8221; So Allah revealed: &#8216;Verily; (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah.&#8217; &#8221; Aisha added, &#8220;Surely, Allah&#8217;s Apostle set the tradition of Tawaf between Safa and Marwa, so nobody is allowed to omit the Tawaf between them.&#8221; Later on I (&#8216;Urwa) told Abu Bakr bin &#8216;Abdur-Rahman (of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s narration) and he said, &#8216;i have not heard of such information, but I heard learned men saying that all the people, except those whom &#8216;Aisha mentioned and who used to assume lhram for the sake of Manat, used to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah referred to the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and did not mention Safa and Marwa in the Quran, the people asked, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We used to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa and Allah has revealed (the verses concerning) Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and has not mentioned Safa and Marwa. Is there any harm if we perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa?&#8217; So Allah revealed: &#8220;Verily As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;It seems that this verse was revealed concerning the two groups, those who used to refrain from Tawaf between Safa and Marwa in the Pre-lslamic Period of ignorance and those who used to perform the Tawaf then, and after embracing Islam they refrained from the Tawaf between them as Allah had enjoined Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and did not mention Tawaf (of Safa and Marwa) till later after mentioning the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8217;</p>

In Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) you have a good example.&#8221; We asked Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah (the same question) and he said, &#8220;He (that man) should not come near (his wife) till he has completed Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.&#8221;</p>

(The two mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah.

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet and his companions assumed Ihram for Hajj and none except the Prophet (p.b.u.h) and Talha had the Hadi (sacrifice) with them. &#8216;Ali arrived from Yemen and had a Hadi with him. &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;I have assumed Ihram for what the Prophet has done.&#8221; The Prophet ordered his companions to perform the &#8216;Umra with the lhram which they had assumed, and after finishing Tawaf (of Ka&#8217;ba, Safa and Marwa) to cut short their hair, and to finish their lhram except those who had Hadi with them. They (the people) said, &#8220;How can we proceed to Mina (for Hajj) after having sexual relations with our wives?&#8221; When that news reached the Prophet he said, &#8220;If I had formerly known what I came to know lately, I would not have brought the Hadi with me. Had there been no Hadi with me, I would have finished the state of lhram.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha got her menses, so she performed all the ceremonies of Hajj except Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, and when she got clean (from her menses), she performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba. She said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! (All of you) are returning with the Hajj and &#8216;Umra, but I am returning after performing Hajj only.&#8221; So the Prophet ordered &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr to accompany her to Tan&#8217;im and thus she performed the &#8216;Umra after the Hajj.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(On &#8216;Id) We used to forbid our virgins to go out (for &#8216;Id prayer). A lady came and stayed at the Palace of Bani Khalaf. She mentioned that her sister was married to one of the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle who participated in twelve Ghazawats along with Allah&#8217;s Apostle and her sister was with him in six of them. She said, &#8220;We used to dress the wounded and look after the patients.&#8221; She (her sister) asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle , &#8220;Is there any harm for a woman to stay at home if she doesn&#8217;t have a veil?&#8221; He said, &#8220;She should cover herself with the veil of her companion and she should take part in the good deeds and in the religious gatherings of the believers.&#8221; When Um &#8216;Atiyya came, I asked her. &#8220;Did you hear anything about that?&#8221; Um &#8216;Atiyya said, &#8220;Bi Abi&#8221; and she never mentioned the name of Allah&#8217;s Apostle without saying &#8220;Bi Abi&#8221; (i.e. &#8216;Let my father be sacrificed for you&#8217;). We asked her, &#8220;Have you heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying so and so (about women)?&#8221; She replied in the affirmative and said, &#8220;Let my father be sacrificed for him. He told us that unmarried mature virgins who stay often screened or unmarried young virgins and mature girls who stay often screened should come out and take part in the good deeds and in the religious gatherings of the believers. But the menstruating women should keep away from the Musalla (praying place).&#8221; I asked her, &#8220;The menstruating women?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;Don&#8217;t they present themselves at &#8216;Arafat and at such and such places?&#8221;</p>

Al-Hajjaj came Out, wrapping himself with a waist-sheet dyed with safflower, and said, &#8220;O Abu Abdur-Rahman! What is the matter?&#8221; He said, If you want to follow the Sunna (the tradition of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ) then proceed (to &#8216;Arafat).&#8221; Al-Hajjaj asked, &#8220;At this very hour?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Please wait for me till I pour some water over my head (i.e. take a bath) and come out.&#8221; Then Ibn &#8216;Umar dismounted and waited till Al-Hajjaj came out. So, he (Al-Hajjaj) walked in between me and my father (Ibn &#8216;Umar).

<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Ibn Abbas about Hajj-at-Tamattu&#8217;. He ordered me to perform it. I asked him about the Hadi (sacrifice). He said, &#8220;You have to slaughter a camel, a cow or a sheep, or you may share the Hadi with the others.&#8221; It seemed that some people disliked it (Hajj-at-Tamattu). I slept and dreamt as if a person was announcing: &#8220;Hajj Mabrur and accepted Mut&#8217;ah (Hajj-At-Tamattu&#8217;)&#8221; I went to Ibn Abbas and narrated it to him.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the last Hajj (Hajj-al-Wada&#8217;) of Allah&#8217;s Apostle he performed &#8216;Umra and Hajj. He drove a Hadi along with him from Dhul-Hulaifa. Allah&#8217;s Apostle started by assuming Ihram for&#8217;Umra and Hajj. And the people, too, performed the &#8216;Umra and Hajj along with the Prophet. Some of them brought the Hadi and drove it along with them, while the others did not. So, when the Prophet arrived at Mecca. he said to the people, &#8220;Whoever among you has driven the Hadi, should not finish his Ihram till he completes his Hajj. And whoever among you has not (driven) the Hadi with him, should perform Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and the Tawaf between Safa and Marwa, then cut short his hair and finish his Ihram, and should later assume Ihram for Hajj; but he must offer a Hadi (sacrifice); and if anyone cannot afford a Hadi, he should fast for three days during the Hajj and seven days when he returns home. The Prophet performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba on his arrival (at Mecca); he touched the (Black Stone) corner first of all and then did Ramal (fast walking with moving of the shoulders) during the first three rounds round the Ka&#8217;ba, and during the last four rounds he walked. After finishing Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, he offered a two Rakat prayer at Maqam Ibrahim, and after finishing the prayer he went to Safa and Marwa and performed seven rounds of Tawaf between them and did not do any deed forbidden because of Ihram, till he finished all the ceremonies of his Hajj and sacrificed his Hadi on the day of Nahr (10th day of Dhul-Hijja). He then hastened onwards (to Mecca) and performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and then everything that was forbidden because of Ihram became permissible. Those who took and drove the Hadi with them did the same as Allah&#8217;s Apostle did.</p>

Then he went out and when he reached Al-Baida&#8217;, he assumed Ihram for Hajj and &#8216;Umra (together) and said, &#8220;The conditions (requisites) of Hajj and &#8216;Umra are the same.&#8221; He, then brought a Hadi from Qudaid.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216; Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Safiya got her menses on the night of Nafr (departure from Hajj), and she said, &#8220;I see that I will detain you.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Aqra Halqa! Did she perform the Tawaf on the Day of Nahr (slaughtering)?&#8221; Somebody replied in the affirmative. He said, &#8220;Then depart.&#8221; (Different narrators mentioned that) &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;We set out with Allah&#8217;s Apostle (from Medina) with the intention of performing Hajj only. When we reached Mecca, he ordered us to finish the Ihram. When it was the night of Nafr (departure), Safiya bint Huyay got her menses. The Prophet said, &#8220;Halqa Aqra! I think that she will detain you,&#8221; and added, &#8220;Did you perform the Tawaf (Al-Ifada) on the Day of Nahr (slaughtering)?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Then depart.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have not (done the Umra).&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Perform &#8216;Umra from Tan&#8217;im.&#8221; My brother went with me and we came across the Prophet in the last part of the night. He said, &#8220;Wait at such and such a place.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaani was born in the Ashkodera, capital of Albania in 1914 C.E. While he was young his parents migrated with him to Damascus, Syria. From an early age he became fascinated by the sciences of Hadith and thereafter spent his time devoted to seeking the knowledge. In later life he was given professorship of Hadith at the Islamic University of Madinah. He is well known to students and scholars for his knowledge and writings. He has many well-known students and has visited places throughout the MiddleeEast and Europe. He was forced to migrate to Syria to Jordan, then to Syria, then to Lebanon, then to the Emirates, then finally back to Jordan. He has been of enormous service to the Prophetic Hadith, taking great pains to check and sort out the authentic from the weak and fabricated narrations. He has produced many pamphlets and books, some of them running into many volumes &#8211; on topics of great importance to Muslims &#8211; and has fully checked many of the famous books of Hadith &#8211; the Sunan of Tirmidhee, Aboo Daawood, An-Nasaa&#8217;ee and Ibn Maajah, along with Suyootis huge &#8216;Jaami su-Sugheer&#8217; and Mishkat ul-Masaabeeh&#8217;. He is the foremost scholar of Hadith and related science of this age.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Text of Translation</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Verily all praise is for Allaah, we praise Him and seek His aid, and we ask for His forgiveness, and we seek refuge in Allaah from the evils of our own selves and from our evil deeds. Whomsoever Allaah has guided, none can misguide him, and whomsoever Allaah has mis- guided, none can guide him, and I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, without any partner, and I testify that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Verily the desire to make Knowledge easily accessible to the public has called me to explain the rites of Hajj and to do that by extracting these from my original book: <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>&#8220;the Hajj of the Prophet as narrated by Jaabir radhi Allaahu anhu &#8220;</strong></span> &#8211; in the same way that I produced an abridgement of my book on the Prophet&#8217;s manner of Prayer &#8211; except that I have here in included many important additions not found in the original &#8211; and I have been careful to record their source and authenticity &#8211; along with other additions with I have added in accordance with the method used in my other books as regards quoting the standard Hadith along with its source &#8211; in abridged form &#8211; while usually referring the reader to my other books &#8211; some of which have been published and some of which have not. As for what is to be found in my original book on Hajj, then I have not quoted the sources in full herein &#8211; regarding it as sufficient that reader should refer back to the original as it is widely available to the honorable readers &#8211; so anyone who wishes to check on such a point will find it easy to refer back to and I will refer to it as <strong>&#8216;The Original&#8217;</strong>. And to add to the usefulness of the book I have ended it with a brief mention of the innovations connected with Hajj and visiting Madinah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I have called it <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>&#8220;The Rites of Hajj and &#8216;Umrah&#8221; from the Book and the Sunnah and Narrations from the Pious Predecessors</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah the Blessed and Most High to make all my work good and sincerely for His Face and that should be no sharer in that with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaani</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Damascus, 21st Sha&#8217;baan 1395</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Advice for those about to perform Hajj</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are some pieces of advice and useful points which I offer to our brothers about to make Hajj.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Firstly.</b> The pilgrim must <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>fear his lord</strong></span> by obedience to Him, and must be very careful not to fall into that which Allaah has forbidden as Allaah ta&#8217;la says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">For Hajj are the months well-known. If anyone undertaken that duty therein, let there be no obscenity nor wrangling in the Hajj</span></strong>.&gt;&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Surat-al-Baqarah ayah 197]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He who performs Hajj and does not speak obscenely or commit evil then he returns from his sins just as the day his mother gave birth to him</strong></span>&#8220;,</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and if he did so then his Hajj would be accepted and Rasoolullaah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;<strong>The accepted Hajj &#8211; there is no less a reward for it than Paradise&#8221; </strong></span>(1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he must be aware of what many are affected by because of their ignorance or misguidance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(A) Directing any form of worship to other than Allaah (<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>shirk</strong></span>). And we have seen many of the people falling into shirk &#8211; like praying fro the removal of distress or aid from the Prophets and the pious instead of from Allaah alone, and their taking oath by them in veneration of them &#8211; so by their actions they completely nullify their Hajj. As Allaah ta&#8217;ala says:(Soorat-ul-Zumar ayah 65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>If you were to join gods with Allaah, truly fruitless will be you work (in life)</strong></span>.&gt;&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(B) Some men <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>shaving off their beards</strong></span> &#8211; as it is a sinful deed &#8211; and doing it involves four separate sins &#8211; as I have explained in &#8216;The Original&#8217;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(C) The wearing of <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>gold rings by men</strong></span> &#8211; and this is Haraam &#8211; even more so those which are known as <strong><span style="color:#000000;">wedding-rings</span></strong> as that includes the further sin of imitating the Christians.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Secondly.</b> Everyone who intends to make Hajj and has not brought the sacrificial animal (Hadee) with him (2) then he should intend to perform Hajj of Tamattu&#8217; [see the Glossary] &#8211; as the Prophet ordered his companions to do in the end, and as he became angry when some did not immediately carry out this order to change the intention from Hajj to an &#8216;Umrah and he صلى الله عليه و آله وسلم said: &#8220;I have entered the `Umarah into the Hajj until the Day of Resurrection&#8221;, and when some of the Companions asked whether he had done that only for that year or forever, the Prophet joined his fingers together and said: &#8220;I have entered the &#8216;Umrah into the Hajj until the Day of Resurrection, not just for a time, rather forever.(3) And because of this he ordered Fatimah and also all his wives &#8211; may Allah be pleased with them all &#8211; to leave the state of iHraam after finishing the &#8216;Umrah, and therefore Ibn &#8216;Abaas رضي الله عنه used to say: Whomsoever makes tawaaf of the House &#8211; then he has left iHraam &#8211; the Sunnah of your Prophet &#8211; even if you are averse to it.(4) So everyone who has not brought the sacrificial animal with him, should call out that he is going to make &#8216;Umrah &#8211; in the three months of Hajj, and he who has declared his intention to do Hajj Mufrad (Hajj on its own) or Hajj Qaarin then hears of the Prophet to change it &#8216;Umrah &#8211; then he should quickly obey even after reaching Makkah and Sa&#8217;ee between Safaa and Marwah &#8211; then he should leave the state of iHraam &#8211; then declare the intention for Hajj on the Day of Tarwiyyah &#8211; the 8th of Dhul Hijjah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you who believe! Give you response to Allaah and His Messenger, when He calls you to that which will give you life&#8230;</strong></span>&gt;&gt;[Soorat-ul-Anfal ayah 24].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Thirdly.</b> You must not leave off <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>staying the night at Mina</strong></span> on the night before &#8216;Arafah as it is obligatory (waajib) &#8211; the Prophet did it and ordered it with his saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Take from me your rites of pilgrimage</span></strong>.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And you must also <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>stay the night at Muzdalifah until you pray Fajr prayer</strong></span>, and if you miss this staying then you must at least pray Fajr there &#8211; as that is even more obligatory &#8211; rather it is one of the rukn (pillar) of Hajj according to the most correct saying according to the scholars &#8211; except upon the woman and the weak &#8211; for it has been allowed for them to leave after half of the night has passed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Fourthly.</b> And be very careful not <strong><span style="color:#000000;">to walk directly in front of anyone praying in the Haraam</span> </strong>mosque, not to speak of other mosques and prying places as the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;If the one walking between the hands of one praying knew what were upon him then it would be better for him to stand still for forty (&#8230;) than that he should walk between his hands. </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Maalik, al-Bukhaaree, Muslim, the 4 Sunan of Abu Juhaim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is a general text covering everyone walking in front, and everyone praying &#8211; and there is no authentic Hadith to make any exception for the one doing so in the Haraam Masjid &#8211; and you should pray therein like any other place towards a sutrah &#8211; according to the general nature of the Hadith regarding that &#8211; and there are also some narrations from the Companions particularly about the Masjid-ul-Haraam &#8211; which I have mentioned in &#8216;The Original&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Fifthly.</b> The people of knowledge should <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>teach the pilgrims the rites of Hajj and its commands according to the Book and the Sunnah</strong></span> whenever meeting with them, and that should not stop them from calling to Tawheed which is the essence of Islaam and was the reason for sending of the Prophets, and the sending down of revealed books, as most of the people whom we have met &#8211; even some of those who are supposed to be seeking knowledge &#8211; we have found to be in complete ignorance of the real meaning of oblivious to the necessity of the return of the Muslims &#8211; upon their differing madhabs (schools of thoughts) and various parties &#8211; to unification and joining ranks upon the basis of the Book and the Sunnah, &#8211; in belief (Aqeedah) and Regulations (Ahkaam) and transactions, and behaviour, and politics and economic affairs and all other aspects of life. And they must remember that any voice raised or any movement made to reform which is based upon any foundation other than this firm splitting and weakening of the Muslims &#8211; and will increase their shamefulness and humiliation &#8211; and the present state of affairs is the greatest proof of that &#8211; and Allaah is the One Whose help is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is nothing wrong with debating in the best way &#8211; when required, as the kind of argumentation that is forbidden in Hajj is useless argument which is also forbidden outside Hajj, just like the eveil-doing that is forbidden in Hajj &#8211; for that is not the debating which is commanded in Allaah ta&#8217;ala&#8217;s saying [Soorat-un-Nahi aya 125].</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Invite (all) to the way of your Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching, and argue with them in ways that are best and most gracious..</span></strong>.&gt;&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, it should be noticed that if it appears that there is no benefit in the discussion because of the other persons blindly sticking to his madhab or own opinion &#8211; and if he were to continue then there is fear of going into that which is not permissible &#8211; then it is better to leave that argument with him as the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;I am a claimant for a house in the outskirts of Paradise for one who leaves off arguing even if he is in the right&#8230;&#8221;</strong> </span>(6)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>No Difficulty</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the one who is inviting to the truth should always make things easy for the people in general and the pilgrims in particular as this making things easy is one of the principles of the kind of Sharee&#8217;ah &#8211; as is known &#8211; as long as there is no text against the point, for when there is a specific text then it is not permissible to make things easy by opinion. And this is the just and middle way which it is binding for every caller to the truth to adopt. And there is no need to take any notice to the people&#8217;s objecting after that and saying: He is too strict, he is too lenient.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there are various actions which are <b>permissible</b> for the pilgrims which they have become used to avoiding due to some people&#8217;s fatawa going against the aforementioned principle. So I decided to make note of those:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Bathing</strong></span>, without need to because of (e.g.) wet dreams (iHtilaam), even if it involves rubbing the head &#8211; as it is authentically reported from the Prophet in Bukhaaree and Muslim and others from the narration of Aboo Ayyoob rahimahullaah (7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Scratching the head</strong></span>, even if some hair falls out as shown by the preceding hadith of Aboo Ayyoob &#8211; and it is the saying of Shaikhul-Islaam Taimiyya (rahimahullaah ).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Cupping/Blood-letting (iHtijaam)</strong></span> even if some of the hair is shaved off in the place required, as the Prophet had it done on the center of his head while in iHraam &#8211; and that is not possible without shaving some of the hair. And this is also the saying of Ibn Taymiyyah &#8211; and the Hanbali scholars also &#8211; however, they say that he must make a sacrifice to make up for it, and they have no proof of this. Rather that is rejected by the Prophet&#8217;s cupping &#8211; and had he made a sacrifice because of having done that then the narrator would have reported that &#8211; and his not having done so shows that it did not happen &#8211; so the correct position is the saying of Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah ).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Smelling sweet smelling plants</strong></span> and <strong><span style="color:#000000;">pulling off broken nails</span></strong> &#8211; and there is narrations about that mentioned in &#8216;The Original&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Taking the shade of a tent, or upheld garment</strong></span> &#8211; as this is proven from the Prophet, and in the same way using the camel-litter in the old days or an umbrella or car &#8211; even sitting inside &#8211; these days. And making it obligatory to make up for that with a sacrifice is a harshness for which there is no proof, rather there is no difference between seeking the shade of a tent which is proven from the Sunnah and seeking shade from the camel-litter &#8211; and its like, and this is a narration from Imaam AHmad as occurs in &#8216;Manaar us-Sabeel&#8217; (1/2460). And what some people do regarding removing the roofs of their cars is entering into religion something that the Lord of the worlds has not allowed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Wearing a belt around the izaar</strong></span> and tying it when necessary, and <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>wearing rings</strong></span> &#8211; as occurs in some narrations. And like it is wearing a <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>watch</strong> </span>or <strong><span style="color:#000000;">spectacles</span> </strong>and <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>money-pouch</strong></span> around the neck.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of those things fall under the aforementioned principle &#8211; furthermore some of them also being supported by hadith from the Prophet, or by narrations from the Companions &#8211; and Allaah ta&#8217;ala says: [Soorat-ul-Baqarah ayah 185].</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He (Allah) intends every facility for you, He does not want to put you into difficulties</strong></span>.&gt;&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And all praise is for Allaah Lord of the worlds.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Assuming Iharaam</b> (Ihraam is the state entered into at the Meeqat in which certain acts and types of clothing are forbidden).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. It is mustaHabb for anyone going for Hajj or &#8216;Umrah to take a <strong>ghusl</strong> (bath) for iHraam &#8211; even if a woman is in her period or in after-birth confinement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Then the men may wear whatever clothes he wishes that are not made in the shape of the body &#8211; and these clothes are called by the fuqahaa (religious scholars) &#8220;<strong>ghair al mukheet (unstitched)</strong>&#8220;. So he wears a ridaa (upper garment) and izaar (lower garment) or whatever, and sandals or any footwear that <span style="text-decoration:underline;">does not cover the ankle-bone</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. He does not wear a <strong>hat or an &#8216;imaamah (turban)</strong> or anything like that which fits onto and covers the head &#8211; this referring only to men. As for the women &#8211; she does not remove anything of the clothes that are prescribed for her in the Shari&#8217;ah, except that she should not tie on the <strong>niqaab</strong> (8) (face-veil) or the burqa&#8217; or the lithaam (lower face cover, up to the eyes) or handkerchief and she should not wear <strong>gloves </strong>(9). And the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و آله وسلم) said :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The muHrim should not wear the shirt, or the &#8216;imaamah, or the hooded cloak, or trousers, or garment touched by wars (dyes with saffron) or saffron; or leather socks &#8211; unless he cannot find sandals) then in that case he may wear leather socks),(10)&#8221; </span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The woman muHrim should not affix a face veil and should not wear gloves(11). </span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is permissible to for the women to cover her face &#8211; even if it touches her face according to the correct opinion &#8211; however, she should not tie it on, as Ibn Taymiyyah says.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. He may put on the <strong>clothing of iHraam before the meeqat</strong> even in his own house as the Prophet and his Companions did. And this makes it easier for those making Hajj by aeroplane for whom it is not possible to put on iHramm at the meeqat &#8211; so it is permissible for them to embark on the plane in iHraam, but they do not make the <strong>intention of iHramm</strong> until very shortly before the meeqat &#8211; in order that they do not go past the meeqat without iHraam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. He may use <strong>body oil and perfume himself</strong> with any perfume he please which was has <strong>odor but not color</strong>, however, women use that which has color not but no odor &#8211; and all this to be before he makes intention of iHraam at the meeqat &#8211; after that is Haraam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Ihraam and Niyya (intention)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. So when he comes t the meeqat it becomes waajib (obligatory) for him to assume iHraam &#8211; and the mere wish and intention to perform Hajj is not sufficient as that has been with him since leaving his own land &#8211; rather he must perform by word and action what will cause him to be muhrim. So when he recites `talbiyyah&#8217; intending to enter into iHraam then his iHraam is concluded &#8211; as agreed upon by the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. And he does not say anything more than the <strong>talbiyyah</strong> such as their saying: &#8220;O Allah, I intend to make Hajj or `Umrah so make it easy for me and accept it from me&#8230;&#8221; as none of this is reported from the Prophet &#8211; just like speaking with the intention for wudoo and salaat and Fasting &#8211; all of this being from the newly invented matters and is well-known the Prophet said: &#8220;&#8230;for every newly invented matter is an innovation, and every innovation is a going astray and every going astray is in HellFire.&#8221; [Tirmidhee &#8211; saHeeh]</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Meeqaats</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. The meeqaats (places for assuming iHraam) are five: Dhul Hulaifah, Al-Juhfah, Qarn-ul manaazil, Yalamlam and Dhaatu `Irq. They are for those who live there and those who pass by them intending Hajj or &#8216;Umrah. And he whose house is nearer than them to Makkah then he makes iHraam from his house, the people of Makkah making iHraam from Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">DHUL HULAIFAH is the place for the people of Madinah and is a village six or seven miles away &#8211; and it is the furthest meeqaat from Makkah &#8211; being ten riding stations away &#8211; or less depending on the route, there being many routes from there to Makkah as Ibn Taimiyyah points out. And it is called ((<strong>waadi ul `Aqeeq</strong>,)) and its masjid is called ((<strong>Masjid-ush-shajarah</strong>)) (mosque of the Tree), and there is spring there called `<strong>the spring of `Ali</strong>&#8216; by the ignorant masses &#8211; believing that `Ali : killed a jinn there &#8211; and that is a lie.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And AL-JUHFAH is a village between Madinah and Makkah &#8211; about three travel stages away. It is the meeqat for the people of Madinah if they come by this route. Ibn Taimiyyah said: &#8220;It is the meeqaat for those who make Hajj from the direction of the west, like the people of Shaam (Greater Syria) and Egypt and the rest of the West. And it is today ruined and deserted, therefore the people now go into iHraam before it in the place called &#8220;<strong>Raabigh</strong>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Qarn UL MANAAZIL &#8211; which is also called &#8220;Qarn-uth-Tha&#8217;aalib&#8221; is near Makkah &#8211; being a day and night&#8217;s journey away &#8211; and is the meeqaat for the people of Najd.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And YALAMLAM is a place two nights distant from Makkah, thirty miles away and is the meeqaat for the people of Yemen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And DHAATU TRQ is a place out in the desert, marking the border between Najd and Tihaamah, being forty-two miles from Makkah. It is the meeqaat for the people of Iraq.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Prophet&#8217;s order to perform Hajj UT-TAMATTU</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. So when he wishes to make iHraam and is making Hajj-ul-Qirran, having brought the sacrificial animal with him, he should say: <b>labbaikallaahumma bi-hajjah wa umrah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Here I am O Allah making Hajj and `Umraah). So if he hasn&#8217;t brought the sacrificial animal &#8211; and that is better &#8211; then he says talbiyyah for `Umrah only and that he must do, saying <b>labbaikallaahumma bi-`umrah</b>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if he has already made talbiyyah for Hajj only, he cancels that and makes it into an `Umrah &#8211; as the Prophet ordered that and also said: &#8220;I have entered the Hajj until the Day of Judgment&#8221; and he joined his fingers together (as in the Hadith that has preceded).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said: &#8220;O family of Muhammad &#8211; whoever from you makes Hajj, then let him say talbiyyah of an &#8216;Umrah in Hajj(12)&#8221; and this is At-Tamattu&#8217; of `Umrah with Hajj.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Making condition</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. And if he wishes when making talbiyyah he may state a condition to Allah fearing that which may prevent him (from completion of the Hajj) whether illness or fear &#8211; saying as the Prophet taught: <b>allaahumma mahillee haithu habastanee</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Allah my place is wherever you prevent me).(13) So if he does that and is then prevented or becomes ill &#8211; then he may leave iHraam of the Hajj or `Umrah &#8211; and there is no recompensatory sacrifice due upon him and he does not have to do the Hajj again, except and unless it was his first Hajj &#8211; then he has to repeat it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. There is no special prayer for iHraam, however if it is time for prayer before iHraam, then he should pray and then put on iHraam following the example of the Rasoolullah who put on iHraam after prying zuhr.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Prayer in waadee ul&#8217;aqeeq</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. However he whose meeqaat is Dhul Hulaifah &#8211; then it is mustahabb for him to pray there, not for iHraam, but because of the place and its being blessed. As al-Bukhaari has narrated from Umar &#8211; may Allah be pleased with him &#8211; who said : &#8220;I heard the Rasoolullah say in waadi ul &#8216;Aqeeq:&#8221; &#8220;Someone came to me this night from my Lord and said: Pray in this blessed valley, and say `Umrah with Hajj(14)&#8221; And Ibn &#8216;Umar narrates from the Prophet: &#8220;&#8230;that he saw, when alighting for sleep at the end of the night in Dhul Hulaifah in the center of the valley, one saying to him: you are in the blessed stony ground.&#8221;(15)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Talbiyyah and raising the voice</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. then he said he should stand(16) facing the Qiblah, and say talbiyyah for `Umrah or Hajj as has preceded, and say:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>allaahumma haadhihi hajjah, laariyaa&#8217;a feehaa wa laa sum&#8217;ah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(O Allah this is a Hajj, there being no ostentation in it or hypocrisy).(17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. And he should say the talbiyyah of the Prophet:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) <b>labbaikallaahumma labbaika labbaika laa shareeka laka labbaika-innal hamda wan na&#8217;mata laka wal mulka-la shareeka laka</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Here I am O Allah, here I am, there is no partner for You, here I am, Verily all praise for You, and every bounty is from You, and all dominion is Yours &#8211; You have no partner.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) And he also said: <b>labbaika ilaahal haqq</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Here I am O God of Truth.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15. And it is better to stick to the talbiyyah of the Prophet, even though it is permissible to increase upon it &#8211; as the Prophet approved of those who did so, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;labbaika dhal ma&#8217;aarij, labbaika dhal fawaadil&#8221;.<br>
(of the Ways of Ascent, Here I am Owner of Excellence.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Ibn `Umar used to also say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;labbaika wa sa&#8217;daika wal khairu biyadaika war-raghabaa&#8217;u ilaika wal `amalu&#8221;<br>
(Here I am and blessed by You, and all good is in Your Hands, and desire and action are directed towards You.)(18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16. And the one saying the talbiyyah is ORDERED to <strong>raise his voice</strong> with it, as the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Jibreel came to me and ordered me to ordered my companions and those with me to raise their voices with talbiyyah.&#8221;</strong></span>(19)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;the best Hajj is shouting out and spilling blood&#8221;</strong></span> (20)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore the companions of the Prophet when they entered into iHraam, by the time they reached `arRauhaa&#8217; their voices had tired out.(21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;It is as if I am looking at Musa, upon whom be peace, descending from the mountain pass raising his voice with talbiyyah&#8230;&#8221;</strong></span>(22)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">17. And women, as regards the talbiyyah, are like men &#8211; as the two preceding hadith are general &#8211; so they should raise their voices as long as their is no fear of fitnah. And `Aa&#8217;ishah used to raise her voice until the men could hear her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu `Atiyyah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I heard `Aa&#8217;ishah saying: Verily I know how was the talbiyyah of Rasoolullah, then I heard her after that saying: Labbaikallaahumma labbaika&#8230;&#8221;(23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Qaasim ibn Muhammad said: Mu&#8217;aawiyyah went out at night and heard the voice of someone making talbiyyah, so he said: `Who is that?&#8221; It was said: &#8220;`Aa&#8217;ishah, Mother of the Believers, making `Umrah from at-Tan&#8217;eem.&#8221; So that was mentioned to `Aa&#8217;ishah so she said: &#8220;If he had asked me I would have told him.&#8221;(24)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">18. And he <strong>continually repeats the talbiyyah</strong> as it is &#8220;from the signs of Hajj&#8221;(25) and because of the Prophet&#8217;s saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;There is no one who makes talbiyyah except that whatever is on his right and left &#8211; trees and stones also make talbiyyah until the earth resounds from here and here &#8211; meaning &#8211; on his right and left.&#8221;</strong></span>(26)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Especially whenever he ascends a high place or descends a valley &#8211; according to the hadith which has preceded: &#8220;It is as if I am looking at Musa &#8211; upon whom be peace &#8211; coming down from the mountain pass&#8230;.loudly reciting talbiyyah&#8221; and in the other hadith: &#8220;It is if I am looking towards him when he descends in the valley reciting talbiyyah&#8221;.(27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19. And he may also <strong>recite along with it &#8220;La ilaaha illallaah&#8221;</strong> and talbiyyah according to the saying of Ibn Mas&#8217;ood may Allaah be pleased with him &#8211; &#8220;I went out Rasoolullah and he did not leave off the talbiyyah until he stoned Jamrat-ul&#8217; Aqabah &#8211; except when he mixed it with reciting talbiyyah or &#8220;La ilaaha illallaah&#8221;.(28)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">20. So when he reaches the haram of Makkah and sees the houses of Makkah he leaves off the talbiyyah to concentrate on the following actions:(29)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Taking Ghusl for entring Makkah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">21. And whoever can talk a ghusl (bath) before entering Makkah then he should do so. And he should enter Makkah in the day following the example of Rasoolullah.(30)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">22. And he should enter from the upper part of Makkah which today has Bab ul Mi&#8217;laah as the Prophet entered from the upper pass (Kadaa&#8217;)(31) above the graveyard, and he entered the masjid from Bab Bani Shaibah as that was the nearest way to the Black Stone (Al-Hajrul-Aswad).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">23. And he is allowed to enter by any path as the Prophet said: All of the mountain passes of Makkah are a pathway and place for slaughter and in another hadith, All of Makkah is a pathway. He enters from here and leaves from here.(32)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">24. So if you enter the masjid do not forget to enter by the right foot,(33) and say:(34)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>allallhumma salli `alaa muhammadin wa sallim &#8211; allaahumma aftah lee abwaaba rahmatika</b> or <b>a&#8217;oodhu billaahil `azeemi wa biwajhihil kareem wa sultaanihil qadeemi minash shaitaanir rajeem.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">25. And when he sees the Ka&#8217;bah he raises his hands if he wants to &#8211; as it is established from Ibn `Abbaas.(935))</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">26. And there is no du&#8217;aa established from the Prophet at this point. So he may make du&#8217;aa with Whatever he can if he wishes with the du&#8217;aa which is established from `Umar:(36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>allaahumma anta salaamu wa minkas salaamu fahayyinaa rabbanaa bissalaam</b></p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Tawaaf of Quadoom (arrival)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">27. Then he should go straight to the Black Stone and facing it make takbeer. And he may say `Bismillah&#8217; before it &#8211; as it is authentically reported from Ibn `Umar, although not from the Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">28. Then he touches the Black Stone with his hand and kisses it also, and makes sajda upon it also &#8211; as Rasoolullah did that, and `Umar, and Ibn `Abbaas.(37)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">29. If he is not able to kiss it then he touches it with his hand then kisses his hand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">30. Then if he cannot touch it he should make a sign towards it with his hand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">31. And he does that in every circuit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">32. And he should not push and crowd to get to it according to the Prophet&#8217;s saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>O`Umar, you are a strong man, so do not harm the weak, and when you wish to touch it, then when it become free then touch it, and if not then face it and say takbeer</strong>.(38)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">33. And there is in touching the Black Stone a great excellence as the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;Allaah will raise up the Stone on the Day of Judgement, and will have two eyes with which it will see, and a tongue which it talks with, and it will give witness in favor of everyone who touched it in truth.&#8221;</strong>(39)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Touching the Black Stone and the Yemeni corner removes sins.&#8221;</strong>(40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;The Black Stone is from Paradise, and it used to be whiter that snow, but the sins of the idolaters turned it black.&#8221;</strong>(41)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">34. Then he should begin making tawaaf around the Ka&#8217;bah &#8211; it being to his left &#8211; and he goes around past the Stone seven times &#8211; from the Stone to the Stone being one, wearing the iHraam under his right armpit and over the left (called al-idtibaa&#8217;)(42) throughout the tawaaf. And walking quickly and with boldness (ramal &#8211; a strong walk in which the shoulders are thrust forwards) in the first three, from the Stone to the Stone &#8211; then he walks normally in the rest.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">35. And he touches the Yemeni corner with his hand each time he passes and does not kiss it, and if he is not able to touch it then he should not make any sign towards it with his hand at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">36. And he should say between the two corners:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O Allaah gives us good in this life, and good in the Hereafter and save us from the Punishment of the Fire.&#8221;</strong>(43)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Rabbanaa aatinaa fid-dunyaa hasanatan wa feel aakhirati hasanatan wa qinaa &#8216;adhaaban naar</strong><br>
[Soorat-ul-Baqarah ayah 201]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Our Lord! Give us good in this world and good in the Hereafter, and defend us from the torment of the Fire.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">37. And he does not touch the two shaami corners at all following the sunnah of the Prophet.(44)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Iltizaam Between The Corner And The Door</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">38. And he may cling to the place between the corner and the Door &#8211; placing his chest and face and forearms upon this place.(45)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">39. And there is no particular dhikr for tawaaf &#8211; so he may read Qur&#8217;an or say any dhikr he pleases, according to the Prophet&#8217;s saying :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tawaaf around the House is prayer, except that Allah has allowed speech in it, so he who speaks then let him not say except, good things and in a narration : so let him limit his talk in it.&#8221;</strong>(46)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">40. And it is forbidden for a naked person or a mentruating woman to make tawaaf of the House, as he said :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A naked person may not make tawaaf of the House.&#8221;</strong>(47)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying to &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah when she came to make &#8216;Umrah in the final Hajj :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Do as anyone making Hajj does, except do not make tawaaf of the House (and do not pray) until you become clean.</strong>(48)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">41. So when he finished the seventh round he covers his right shoulder and moves to the Place of Ibrahim and recites:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Wattakhidhoo min-maqaami ibraaheema musalla</strong> [Soorat-ul-Baqarah ayah 125]<br>
<strong>(And take you the Station of Abraham as a place of prayer.)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">42. And he places the Maqaami Ibraheem (Place of Abraham) between himself and the Ka&#8217;bah and then prays two rak&#8217;ahs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">43. And he recites therein Surat-ul-Kaafiroon and Surat-Qul Huwallaahu Ahad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">44. And he should not walk between the hands of any praying person there, nor allow anyone to walk in front of him while he is praying &#8211; as the ahadith forbidding that are general &#8211; and there is no established exception for the Haram Masjid, let alone the rest of Mukkah.(49)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">45. Then after praying he goes to Zamzam and drinks thereof,and pours some of the water onto his head, as he said :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Zamzam water is for what it drunk for&#8221;</strong>(50)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and he said</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;It is blessed and it is a food and a cure for illness&#8221;</strong>(51)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and he said :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The best water upon the face of the earth is Zamzam water, in it is nourishment and a cure from illness.</strong>(52)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">46. Then he returned to the Black Stone, says takbeer and touches it &#8211; as before.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Sa&#8217;ee Between Safaa And Marwah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">47. The he goes off for sa&#8217;ee between Safaa and Marwah (two small hills). And when he reaches the foot of Safaa he reads Allaah ta&#8217;ala&#8217;s saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Innas-safaa wal marwata min sha&#8217;aa&#8217;irillaahi faman hajjal baita &#8216;awi`tamara falaa janaaha &#8216;alaihi an yattawwafa bihimaa wa man tatawwa&#8217;a khiran fa&#8217;innallaaha shaakirun &#8216;aleemun</strong> [Soorat-ul-Baqarah ayah 158]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Behold! Safa and Marwa are among the Symbols of Allah. So if those who visit the House in the Season or at other times should compass them round, it is no sin in them, and if any one obeys his own impulse to good, be sure that Allaah is He Who recognizes and knows.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Nabda&#8217;u bimaa bada&#8217;allaahu bihi<br>
</strong><strong>(We begin with what Allaah began with.)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">48. Then he begins with as-Safaa &#8211; climbing upon it until he can see the Ka&#8217;bah.(53)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">49. Then he faces the Ka&#8217;bah &#8211; and makes tauheed of Allaah and takbeer, saying :(54)</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allaahu akbar allaahu akbar allaahu akbar &#8211; laa illaaha illallahu wahdau laa shareekalahu &#8211; lahul mul ku wa lahul hamdu &#8211; yuheeu wa yumeetu wa huwa &#8216;alaa kulli shai&#8217;in qadeer &#8211; laa ilaaha illallahu wahdahu laa shareekalahu &#8211; anjaza wa&#8217;dahu wa nasara &#8216; abdahu wa hazamal ahzaaba wahdahu</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saying that three times and making du&#8217;aa after each time.(55)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">50. Then he descends for sa&#8217;ee between Safaa and Marwah, as Rasoolullah said : Make sa&#8217;ee as Allah has prescribed sa&#8217;ee for you.(56)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">51. So he walks till he reaches the green sign-post &#8211; on the right and left &#8211; then runs quickly till he reaches the next sign-post. And this place was in the time of the Prophet a dried river bed covered with small stones, and the Prophet said:(57)</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> (The river bed is not crossed except with vigour.) </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he walks up to Marwah and ascends it and does upon it as he did upon as-Safaa &#8211; facing the Qiblah, saying takbeer and tahleel and making du&#8217;aa(58) and that forms one complete circuit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">52. Then he returns till he ascends as-Safaa &#8211; walking in the place for walking, and running in the place for running &#8211; and that is a second circuit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">53. Then he returns to Marwah &#8211; and so on till he completes seven circuits finishing upon Marwah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">54. And it is permissible for him to go between Safaa and Marwah While riding. However the Prophet preferred to walk.(59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">55. And if he makes du&#8217;aa in sa&#8217;ee, saying :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Rabbighfir warham innaka antal a&#8217;azzul akram<br>
</strong>(O lord forgive and have mercy,verily You are the Most Mighty, Most Noble)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">then there is no harm as it is authentically reported from a group of the Salaf.(60)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">56. Then when he finishes from the seventh circuit upon al-Marwah he shortens the hair of his head(61) thus ending the &#8216;Umrah &#8211; and everything that became forbidden to him upon entering iHraam now becomes permissible again &#8211; and he remains in the state of hill (being out of iHraam) until Yaum ut-Tarwiyyah (8th Dhul-Hijjah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">57. And he who made iHraam not intending to make &#8216;Umrah before the Hajj &#8211; and not having brought the hadi (sacrificial animal) from outside sacred precincts then should also leave the state of iHraam in obedience to the Prophet&#8217;s order and in avoidance of his anger. Those, however, who have bought the sacrificial animal with them remain in iHraam and do not leave that state until after the stoning on the Day of Sacrifice (Yaum-un-Nahr) (10th Dhul-Hijjah).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Ihlaal (Calling Aloud With Tal-Biyyah) For Hajj On Yaum Ut-Tarwiyyah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">58. So when it is Yaum ut-Tarwiyyah and that is the 8th of Dhul Hijjah &#8211; he puts on iHraam and calls out with the talbiyyah of Hajj, and does as he did when assuming iHraam for &#8216;Umrah which he did from the meeqaat &#8211; as regards bathing and putting on perfume, and wearing the ridaa and izaar (upper and lower garments) and reciting talbiyyah &#8211; which he does not cease to do until he has stoned Jamrat ul-Aqaha (on 10th Dhul-Hijjah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">59. And he assumes iHraam form the place he is resident in &#8211; the people resident in Makkah doing so from Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">60. Then he goes off to Minaa and prays there the Zuhr prayer and remains there, spending the night there and praying the rest of the five daily prayers &#8211; shortening them (to two ra&#8217;kahs) but without combining them.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Proceeding To &#8216;Arafah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">61. So after the sun rises on the Day of &#8216;Arafah (10th Dhul-Hijjah) &#8211; he moves off towards &#8216;Arafah (a large plain to the south-east of Makkah), while reciting talbiyyah of takbeer &#8211; as both of these were practised by the Companions of the Prophet while making Hajj with him &#8211; and he did not critize either (those reciting tal-biyyah of those reciting takbeer.) (62)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">62. Then he stops at Namirah (63) &#8211; and it is a place near to &#8216;Arafah but not forming part of it &#8211; and he remains there until noon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">63. So When the sun passes its zenith he moves to &#8216;Uranah and settles there,(64) and it is next to &#8216;Arafah &#8211; and here the Imaam should give an appropriate Khutbah to the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">64. Then he prays with the people Zuhr and &#8216;Asr shortening and combining them in the time of the Zuhr prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">65. And one adhaan is given and two iqaamahs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">66. And he does not pray anything between the two prayers.(65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">67. And he who is not able to pray along with the Imaam &#8211; then he prays them in the same way on his own &#8211; or with those in similar situation around him.(66)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Standing In &#8216;Arafah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">68. Then he goes off to &#8216;Arafah and if able stands upon the rocks beneath the Mount of Mercy (Jabal ur-Rahmah) and if not then all of &#8216;Arafah is place of standing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">69. And he stands facing the Qiblah, raising his hands making du&#8217;aa and reciting talbiyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">70. And he recites much &#8216;La ilaha illallaah&#8217; as it is the best du&#8217;aa on the Day of &#8216;Arafah as the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The best thing that I and the Prophets have said on the evening of &#8216;Arafah is :<br>
<strong>Laa ilaha illallaahu wahdahu laa shareeka lahu lahul mulk wa lahul hamdu wa huwa &#8216;alaa kulli shay&#8217;in qadeer</strong>.(67)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">71. And if he adds in the talbiyyah occasionally (all good is the good of the Hereafter) then that is permissible.(68)</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Innamaal Khairu Khairul Aakhirati</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">72. And it is sunnah for the one standing in &#8216;Arafah not to fast that day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">73. And he remains in that state, remembering Allaah reciting talbiyyah, making du&#8217;aa as he wishes &#8211; hoping from Allaah that He will make him one of those whom He boasts of (those whom He frees from Fire) to the Angels as occurs in the hadith :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;There is no day on which Allaah frees more of His slaves from Fire than the Day of &#8216;Arafah, and He verily draws near then boasts of them before the angles, saying :&#8217;What do they seek?&#8217; &#8220;</strong>(69)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and in another hadith :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Verily Allaah boasts of the people of &#8216;Arafah before the people of heaven (the angels), saying : &#8216;Look to my servants who have come to Me dishevelled and dusty.'&#8221;</strong>(70)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and he remains in that state until the sun sets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Leaving &#8216;Arafah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">74. So when the sun has set he leaves &#8216;Arafah for Muzdalifah &#8211; going with calmness and tranquility, not jostling or pushing the people with himself or his riding beast or his vehicle, rather whenever he finds room then he goes faster.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">75. And when reaching Muzdalifah he gives adhaan and iqaamah then prays the three ra&#8217;kahs of Maghrib, then gives iqaamah and prays &#8216;Ishaa &#8211; shortening it &#8211; and joining the two prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">76. And if he separates the two prayers for some necessity then there is no harm in that.(71)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">77. And he does not pray anything between them or after &#8216;Ishaa.(72)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">78. Then he sleeps until Fajr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">79. Then when the dawn first appears he prays Fajr in the first part of its time with adhaan and iqaamah.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Fajr Prayer In Muzdalifah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">80. And all of the pilgrims pray Fajr prayer in Muzdalifah (a place between &#8216;Arafah and Minaa) except the weak and the women &#8211; it being permissible for them to leave after half of the night has passed for fear of the crush of people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">81. Then he comes to the <strong>Mash&#8217;ar al-Haraam</strong> (a small mountain in Muzdalifah) and climbs upon it and faces the Qiblah &#8211; then recites tahweed,takbeer, tahleel &#8211; and declares Allaah&#8217;s Unity and makes du&#8217;aa until the sky becomes very bright.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">82. And all Muzdalifah is a place of standing &#8211; so wherever he stands then it is permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">83. Then he leaves for Minaa before the sun rises, calmly while reciting talbiyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">84. So when he comes to the river <strong>valley of Mu-Hassir</strong> he hurries if possible &#8211; and it is a part of Minaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">85. Then he takes the middle road which takes him to the Jamrat ul Aqabah.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Stoning (Ar-Ramee)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">86. And he picks up in Minaa stones with which he intends to do the stoning of Jamrat-ul-&#8216;Aqabah &#8211; and it is the last of the Jamraat and the nearest one to Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">87. And he faces the Pillar (Jamrah), having Makkah to his left and Minaa to his right.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">88. Then he stones it with seven small stones, like the Stones of Khadhf &#8211; which are slightly longer than the chick-pea.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">89. And he recites takbeer while throwing each stone.(73)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">90. And he ceases reciting talbiyyah when throwing the last stone.(74)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">91. And he he does not perform this stoning until after sunrise, even the women or weak who were allowed to leave Muzdalifah after half the night, as this is one thing and the stoning is something else.(75)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">92. And he may perform this stoning after noon even up to the night if he finds difficulty in performing this stoning before noon as is established in the hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">93. So when he has stoned the Jamrah everything becomes lawful for him again except women, even if he has not sacrificed or shaved his head &#8211; so he may wear his clothes and use perfume.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">94. However he should perform Tawaaf-ul-Ifaada on the same day (before Maghrib) if he wishes to continue in his state of having left iHraam &#8211; otherwise, if he has not made Tawaaf before the evening (before Maghrib) then he returns to the state of iHraam as he was before the stoning &#8211; so he should remove his clothes and put on iHraam according to the Prophet&#8217;s saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Verily on this day has been allowed for you, when you have stoned the Jamrah, that was prohibited for you except women (sexual intercourse). Verily on this day everything that you were prohibited from (by iHraam) has been allowed for you, when you have stoned the Jamrah, except the women (sexual intercourse) &#8211; so if evening comes upon you before you have made Tawaaf of this House then you revert to the state of iHraam as you were before stoning the Jamrah &#8211; until you make the Tawaaf.</strong> (76)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Sacrifice</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">95. Then he comes to the place of sacrifice in Minaa and sacrifices his animal &#8211; and that is the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">96. However, it is permissible for him to slaughter in any other part of Minaa or Makkah as the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>I have slaughtered here and all of Minaa is a place for slaughtering, and all of the mountain pass approaches, so slaughter on your place of stopping.</strong>(77)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">97. And the Sunnah is to do the dhabh (slaughter by a horizontal cut through the throat) or Nahr (slaughter by a vertical movement of the spear to the lower part of the throat) with own hand if possible, and if not, then to depute someone else to do it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">98. And he should make the animal face the Qiblah when slaughtering(78), making it lie down on its left side and putting his right foot upon its right side.(79)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">99. As for the camel then he should slaughter it by means of Nahr..while it is standing having its left leg tied, standing on its others(80) with its face towards the Qiblah.(81)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">100. And he says when slaughtering:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Bismillaahi Wallaahu Akbar Al-Laahumma Inna Hadha Minka Wa Laka(82) Al Lahumma Taqabbal Minnee(83)<br>
</b>(In the name of Allah and Allah is greater. O Allah this is from You and for You. O Allah accept it from me.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">101. And the time for slaughter is the four days of &#8216;Eid &#8211; Yaum-un-Nahr, and that is called &#8216;Yaum ul-Jajj-ul-Akbar&#8217; (Day of the greatest Hajj)(84) and the three days of Tashreeq, as the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Allthe days of Tashreeq are for sacrifice.&#8221;</strong> (85)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">102. And he may eat from the meat of his sacrificial animal and take some back with him to his land as the Prophet did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">103. And he should give some it to feed the poor and the needy as Allah ta&#8217;ala says:(86)</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(The sacrificial camels We have made for you as among the Symbols from Allah: in them is (much) good for you: then pronounce the name of Allah over them as they line up (for sacrifice): when they are down on their side (after slaughter), eat ye thereof, and feed such as (beg not you) live in contentment and such as beg with due humility.)</strong>[Soorat-ul-Hajj ayah 36]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">104. And seven people may share in one camel or cow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">105. And he who cannot afford a sacrificial animal should fast three days in Hajj and seven when he returns to his family.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">106. And he may fast the three days of Tashreeq according to the hadith of &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah and Ibn &#8216;Umar &#8211; may Allah be pleased with them &#8211; who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;No permission was given for us to fast the days of Tashreeq except for those who could not afford a sacrificial animal.</strong>(87)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">107. Then he shaves all of his hair off or shortens it. &#8211; and the first is better as the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O Allah have mercy on those who save their heads. They (the people) said &#8216;And those who shorten their O Rasoolullah.&#8217; He said: O Allah have mercy on those who save their heads. They said: &#8216;And those who shorten their hair O Rasoolullah&#8217; He added on the fourth time: And those who shorten their hair&#8221;</strong>(88)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">108. And the Sunnah is for the barber to begin with the right side of the head as occurs in the hadith of Anas.(89)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">109. And shaving the hair is just the for men and not for the women &#8211; they have to shorten only as the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;There is no shaving of the hair for women, verily upon women is shortening of the hair.&#8221;</strong>(90)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So she should together her hair and shorten it by the length of a finger-joint.(91)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">110. And it is Sunnah for the Imaam to give a khutbah on the Day of Sacrifice in Minaa(92) between the Jamaraat(93) in the forenoon(94) to teach the people to rites of Hajj.(95)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Tawaaf ul Ifaadah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">111. The he goes off that day to the House and makes Tawaaf &#8211; seven times around &#8211; as has preceeded in the Tawaaf of arrival &#8211; <span style="color:#ff0000;">except that he does not wear iHraam under his right shoulder &#8211; nor does he perform raml</span> in this Tawaaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">112. And it is from the Sunnah to pray two ra&#8217;kahs behind the Station of Ibrahim &#8211; as Az-Zuhree(96) said, and Ibn &#8216;Umar did so(97), and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;For every seven times around there are two ra&#8217;kahs.&#8221;</strong>(98)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">113. Then he walks and runs between Safaa and Marwah as before &#8211; except for one doing Hajj of Qiraan or Ifraad &#8211; the first sa&#8217;ee being enough for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">114. And after this tawaaf everything again becomes lawful for him that became unlawful due to iHraam &#8211; even the woman (sexual intercourse).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">115. And he prays Zuhr at Makkah, and Ibn &#8216;Umar says: At Minaa.(99)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">116. And he comes to Zamzam and drinks from it.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Staying Overnight At Minaa</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">117. Then he returns to Minaa and remians there for the days of Tashreeq and their nights.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">118. And he stones the three Jamaraat with seven small stones in each of those days, after noon, as has preceeded concerning the stoning on the Day of Sacrifice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">119. He begins with the first Jamrah, which is the nearest to <strong>Masjid &#8211; al-Khaif</strong>, and after stoning it he moves onward and stands facing the Qiblah for a long while making du&#8217;aa while raising his hands.(100)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">120. Then he comes to the second Jamarah and stones it in the same way, then he moves to the left and stands for a long while facing the Qiblah making du&#8217;aa while raising his hands.(101)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">121. The he comes to the third Jamarah and it is Jamrat al-Aqabah &#8211; and he stones it in the same way &#8211; standing so that Ka&#8217;bah is to his left and Minaa to his right and does not stand there (making du&#8217;aa) afterwards.(102)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">122. Then on the second day he repeats this stoning and on the third day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">123. An if he leaves after stoning on the second day not remaining for the third day&#8217;s stoning, then that is permissible as Allaah ta&#8217;ala says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Celebrate the praises of Allah during the Appointed Days, but if anyone hastens to leave in two days, there is no blame on him, and if anyone stays on, these is no blame on him if his aim is to do right,) </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However remaining for the third day&#8217;s stoning is better as it is the Sunnah.(103)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">124. And the Sunnah is to do the previous actions of Hajj in order: the stoning, then slaughter, then shaving the head, then Tawaaf of Ifaadah, the Sa&#8217;ee for the one doing Hajj at-Tamattu&#8217;; however if he brings something forward in the order or delays something in the order (doing things out of order) then that is permissible as the Prophet said: &#8220;There is no harm, there is no harm.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">125. And regarding stoning, the following is allowed to those who have a valid excuse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) The permission not to have to spend the night in Minaa according to the hadith of Ibn &#8216;Umar: &#8220;Al &#8216;Abbaas sought permission of Rasoolullah to spend the night of Minaa in Makkah as he was responsible for supplying Zamzam water there, so he gave him the permission.&#8221;(104)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) To combine two days&#8217; stoning in one day, according to the hadith of &#8216;Aasim ibn &#8216;Adiyy who said: &#8220;Rasoolullah made concession for the camel drivers in Bairootah that they could stone on the Day of Sacrifice, the combine two days&#8217; stoning after that &#8211; performing it in one of the two days.&#8221;(105)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(c) To perform the stoning at night as the Prophet said: The shephered may stone at night, then look after his flock in the daytime.(106)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">126. And it is lawful for him to visit the Ka&#8217;bah and make Tawaaf during each of the nights of Minaa as the Prophet did so.(107)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">127. And the pilgrim during the Days of Minaa must take care to pray the five daily prayers with the congregation &#8211; and it is best to pray the Masjid of Khaif if he is able to, as the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Seventy Prophets have prayed in the Masjid of Khaif</strong>.</span>(108)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">128. So after completing the stoning on the second day or third day of the days of Tashreeq &#8211; then he has completed the rites of Hajj and therefore returns to Makkah &#8211; and remains there for as long as Allaah has written for him to remain &#8211; and he should take care to perform the prayer with the congregation &#8211; especially in the Masjid-ul-Haraam, and <strong>a single prayer in the Masjid-ul-Haraam is better than a hundred thousand prayers in other mosques</strong>.(109)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">129. And he should perform much of prayer and Tawaaf at any time he pleases of the day or night as the Prophet said about the two corners &#8211; the Black Stone and Yemeni corner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Touching them takes away sins, and he who performs Tawaaf does not raise or lower his foot (while walking) except that Allaah writes it for him as a good deed, and wipes off bad deed for him, and writes for him an extra rank and whoever does it even times round [check Sharh of at-Tirmidhee] it is as if he had freed a slave.&#8221;</strong>(110)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;&#8221;O tribe of &#8216;Abd Manaaf! Do not prevent anyone from making Tawaaf of this house or from prayer at any hour of the day or night he pleases.&#8221;&#8221;</strong>(111)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Farewell Tawaaf (Tawaaf ul Wadaa)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">130. So when he has finished all that he has to do and has decided to travel then he has to make a farewell Tawaaf of the house, as Ibn &#8216;Abbas narrated: &#8216;The people used to head off in every direction so the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;None of you should depart until he makes as his last act Tawaaf of the House.&#8221;</strong>(112)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">131. And the menstruating woman was at first ordered to wait until she became clean of it in order to make Tawaaf ul Wadaa'(113) then it was permitted for her to leave without waiting according to the hadith of Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;That the Prophet gave concession for the menstruating women that she should depart before (Farewell) Tawaaf as long as she had made Tawaaf of Ifaadah.&#8221;</strong> (114)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">132. And he may carry away with him whatever he can of Zamzam water because of the blessing therein, as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Rasoolullah used to carry it with him in water skins and containers &#8211; and he used to pour (it) upon the sick and give it to them to drink.&#8221;</strong></span>(115)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Before Makkah was conquered he used to send the message to Suhail ibn &#8216;Amr: that he should bring Zamzam water for us and not leave it &#8211; so he would send to him two large bag fulls.&#8221;</strong>(116)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">133. So when he finishes the Tawaaf he leaves the mosque like the rest of the people &#8211; not walking backwards &#8211; and he leaves putting out his left foot first(117), saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Allaahuma salli &#8216;alla muhammadin wa sallim &#8211; allaahumma innee &#8216;as&#8217;aluka min fadhlika<br>
</b>(O Allaah send blessings and peace upon Muhammad. O Allaah I ask You for Your bounty.)</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><b>PREFACE</b></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dear pilgrim brothers and sisters,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Assalamu alaikumwa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu. </i>Congratulations and welcome on your arrival at these sacred precincts, on this blessed journey as guests of Allah, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This brief but comprehensive Guide is presented to you to outline the obligatory rites of <i>Hajj </i>and <i>&#8216;umrah </i>with which you ought to be familiar. It begins with some important advice. This advice is, first of all, for ourselves, and then it is offered to you in accordance with what Allah, the Most High, says concerning those of His servants who receive salvation and success in this world and the Hereafter: &#8220;They counsel each other of the truth and counsel each other of patience.&#8221; It is further to put into practice His saying: &#8220;Cooperate with each other in goodness and fear of Allah, and do not cooperate in sin and transgression.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask you to read this booklet before you begin the rites of <i>Hajj </i>in order that you may acquaint yourself with what is to be done. You will f Ind in It answers to many of your questions. We hope that you will keep this booklet with you as a reference for this year, and possibly for later years as well if It Is Allah&#8217;s will that you return again for <i>Hajj.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask you to share this booklet with other Muslims in order that they may also benefit from reading its contents. We ask Allah to accept from all of us our <i>Hajj, </i>our striving, and our good deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Wassalamu &#8216;alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu.</i></p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;">IMPORTANT ADVICE</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dear pilgrims, we praise Allah for having guided you to the <em>hajj</em> of His House and to the visit of the Sacred Precincts. May He accept from all of us our good deeds and increase His reward for us and for you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following advice is being offered to you in the hope that Allah will accept from all of us our hajj and our striving.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Remember that you are on a blessed journey. This journey, which is a migration toward Allah, is based on belief in His Unity <i>(tawheed), on </i>sincerity toward Him, on responding to His call, and on obedience to His commands. There is no greater reward than that of a <em>hajj</em> which<i> is </i>acceptable to Allah Ta&#8217;alah-the reward of the Garden of Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Be on your guard against the mischief of Satan, who intends to cause dissension among you. Love each other as brothers and avoid disputes and disobedience to Allah. Know that the Messenger of Allah (may peace and blessings of Allah be on him) said, &#8220;<strong>None of you has truly believed unless he likes for his brother what the likes for himself</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Whenever you have a question concerning religious matters or concerning the <i>hajj, </i>ask knowledgeable Muslims until you receive a satisfactory answer. This is in accordance with what Allah has said: &#8221; <strong>If you realize this not, ask of those who possess The Message</strong>.&#8221; it is also in accordance with what the Prophet (peace be on him) has said. &#8220;<strong>When Allah intends good for someone, He gives him understanding of the religion</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Know that Allah has made certain acts <i>fard </i>(obligatory) and other acts <i>sunnah </i>(according to the practice of the Prophet, peace be on him). Allah does not accept a <i>sunnah </i>which violates some fard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some pilgrims ignore this fact when they harm believing men and women in their zeal to kiss the <i>Black Stone, </i>to hasten in their circuits around the K&#8217;abah, to make <i>salah </i>behind the Station of lbraheem, to drink from Zamzam,.and similar practices. These practices are <i>sunnah. </i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>To </i>harm any believer in doing them is <i>haram </i>(prohibited). How is it possible to carry out a <i>sunnah </i>observance while doing a <i>haram </i>deed? Therefore, avoid hurting each other, and Allah will grant you His mercy and will increase your reward.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>We would also like to emphasize the following:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) It is not fitting that a Muslim man performs his Salat next to, or behind a woman in the holy Mosque or at any other place if it is at all possible to avoid doing so. Women should pray behind men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) The doors and entrances to the holy Mosque are for traffic and should not be blocked by people praying there, even though if it is to join the congregational prayer that may be in progress.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(c) It is not permissible to block the free flow of people around the K&#8217;abah by sitting near the K&#8217;abah, by praying near it, or by standing near the Black Stone, or al-Hijr or at the Station of lbraheem, especially when the place is crowded, as this is a source of harm to other people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(d) While safeguarding the dignity of Muslims is a <i>fard, </i>kissing the Black Stone is a <i>sunnah. A fard </i>cannot be sacrificed for a <i>sunnah. </i>When the area is crowded, it is sufficient to point to the Black Stone, saying <i>&#8220;Allahu akbar.&#8221; </i>and to continue to move with the flow of people without causing a break in the lines. indeed, keeping an easy flow during circuits is the most commendable thing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(e) It is not a sunnah to kiss the Yamani corner, but to touch it with the right hand, if it is not overcrowded, and say: <i>&#8220;Bismillahi w</i>al-lahu <i>akbar. &#8221; But </i>if it is difficult to touch it, then move on, do not point to it with your hand, or say <i>takbir. </i>For it is not reported of the Prophet. It is mustahabb (good) to recite the following supplication in between the Yamani corner and the Black Stone:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">رَبَّنَا آتِنَا فِي الدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةً وَفِي الآخِرَةِ حَسَنَةً وَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>&#8220;Rabbana atina fid-donya hasanatan wa fil- akhirati hasanatan wa qina adhaban-nar&#8221;.</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally, the best advice we can give you is that you follow the Book of Allah and the <i>sunnah</i><b><i> </i></b>of His Messenger (peace be on him) in all what you do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Obey Allah and the Messenger in order that you may receive mercy.&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><b>VIOLATIONS OF ISLAM</b></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Brother and sister Muslim, you must be aware that there are matters which nullify your Islam. We will mention here the ten most common violations. Please be mindful of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The First</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Associating partners with Allah (shirk). Allah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>Truly, if anyone associates partners with Allah, Allah will forbid him the garden and his abode will be the Fire; the wrongdoers will have no helpers</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Calling upon the dead, asking their help, or offering them gifts or sacrifices are all forms of <i>shirk.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Second</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Setting up intermediaries between oneself and Allah, making supplication to them, asking their intercession with Allah, and placing one&#8217;s trust in them is unbelief (kufr).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Third</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who does not consider polytheists <i>(mushrikeen)</i> to be unbelievers, or who has doubts concerning their unbelief, or considers their way to be correct, is himself an unbeliever (kafir).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Fourth</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who believes any guidance other than the Prophet&#8217;s guidance to be more perfect, or a decision other than the Prophet&#8217;s decision to be better, is an unbeliever. This applies to those who prefer the rule of <i>Evil (Taghout) </i>to the Prophet&#8217;s rule. Some examples of this are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) To believe that systems and laws made by human beings are better than the <i>Shari&#8217;ah </i>of Islam; for example,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that the Islamic system is not suitable for the twentieth century.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that Islam is the cause of the backwardness of Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or that Islam is a relationship between Allah and the Muslim. It should not interfere in other aspects of life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) To say that enforcing the punishments prescribed by Allah, such as cutting off the hand of a thief or stoning an adulterer, is not suitable in this day and age.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(c) To believe that it is permissible to give a rule from that which Allah did not reveal in Islamic transactions or matters of law, punishments or other affairs. Although one may not believe such rulings to be superior to the <i>Shari&#8217;ah </i>he in effect affirms such a stand by declaring a thing which Allah has totally prohibited, such as adultery, drinking alcohol or usury, to be permissible. According to the consensus of Muslims, one who declares such things to be permissible is an unbeliever (kafir).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Fifth</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who hates any part of what the Messenger of Allah (may peace and blessings of Allah be on him) has declared to be lawful has nullified his lslam, even though he may act in accordance with it. Allah the Most High, says: &#8220;<strong>Because they disliked what Allah has revealed. their deeds are brought to nothing</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Sixth</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who ridicules any aspect of the religion of the Messenger of Allah (peace be on him), or any of its rewards or punishments, becomes an unbeliever. Allah. the Most High, says: &#8220;<strong>Say: Do you ridicule Allah, His revelations and His Messenger? Make no excuse; you have disbelieved after your (profession of) faith&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>The Seventh</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The practice of magic included in this is causing a rift between a husband and wife by turning his love for her into hatred, or tempting a person to do things he dislikes by using black arts. One who engages in such a thing or is pleased with it is outside the pale of Islam. Allah the Most High, says, &#8220;<strong>The two (angels, Harut and Marut) did not teach anyone (magic) without warning them, &#8216;Indeed. we are a trial; then do not disbelieve.</strong>&#8220;&#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The <i>Eighth</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Supporting and aiding polytheists against the Muslims. Allah the Most High, says: &#8220;<strong>The one from among you who supports them belongs to them. Truly. Allah does not guide the people who do wrong</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>The Ninth</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who believes that some people are permitted to deviate from the <i>Shari&#8217;ah of </i>Muhammad (peace be on him) is an unbeliever by the word of Allah, the Most High: &#8220;<strong>If anyone seeks a religion other than al-Islam it will not be accepted from him, and in the Hereafter he will by among the losers&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>The Tenth</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To turn completely away from the religion of Allah, neither learning its precepts nor acting upon it. Allah the Most High, says: &#8220;<strong>Who does greater wrong than the one who is reminded of the revelations of his Lord and turns away from them. Truly, We shall recompense the guilty</strong>,&#8221; and He also says: &#8220;<strong>But those who disbelieve turn away from that about which they are warned</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It makes no difference whether such violations are committed as a joke, in seriousness or out of fear, except when they are done under compulsion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We seek refuge in Allah from such deeds as entail His wrath and severe punishment.<b> </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>How to perform HaJJ and &#8216;Umrah, and to visit the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Brother and sister Muslims:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are three ways of performing the hajj:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Hajj </i>al-tamatt&#8217;u (interrupted)<br>
<i>Haii </i>al-qiran (combined)<br>
<i>Haii al- ifrad </i>(single)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><i>Hajj al-Tamatt&#8217;u</i></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means entering into ihram for the &#8216;umrah during the months of <i>Haji, </i>i.e., the months of Shawwal, Dhul-Q&#8217;idah and the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah; to take off ihram after performing the &#8216;umrah; and then to take ihram again for the hajj from Makkah on the 8th day of Dhul-Hijjah during the same year in which the &#8216;umrah was performed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><i>Hajj al-Qiran</i></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This denotes entering into ihram for both the &#8216;umrah and the hajj at the same time, not taking off the ihram until the Day of Sacrifice (the 10th of Dhul-Hijjah). Alternatively, one may first enter into <i>ihram </i>for the <i>&#8216;umrah, </i>and before beginning one&#8217;s tawaf may make the intention of <i>ihram </i>for the <i>hajj </i>as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><i>Hajj al-lfrad</i></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This signifies donning <i>ihram</i> for the <i>hajj </i>either from the prescribed Station of <i>lhram (al-miqat), </i>from Makka if one resides there, or from a place in between al-migat and Makkah in the event that one has brought a sacrificial animal with him, and to remain in <i>ihram </i>until the Day of Sacrifice. If one has not brought an animal for sacrifice, he is required to come out of <i>ihram </i>after performing <i>&#8216;umrah; </i>that is, he makes the (Sa&#8217;ye)&#8221;around the K&#8217;abah (tawaf), performs the (Sa&#8217;ye) the running between Safa and Marwah. cuts some of his hair and then comes out of <i>ihram, </i>resuming his usual clothing and state. This is what the, Prophet (peace be on him) prescribed for those people who had entered into <i>ihram</i> for the hajj without bringing a sacrificial animal; they then re-entered into ihram on the 8th of Dhul-Hijjah. The same applies to a person who is performing hajj al-qiran in the event that he has not brought with him an animal to sacrifice; it is required that he comes out of ihram after the &#8216;umrah, as described above.<b> </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE PERFORMANCE OF &#8216;UMRAH</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. When you reach the prescribed Station (<b>al-miqat</b>), make ghusl (a shower or full washing of the whole body), use perfume if available, and then put on the two-piece garment of <b>ihram </b>( izar and rida ), which preferably should be of white cloth. This applies to men only. A woman also makes ghusl but she does not use make up, and she may wear any clothes she has available as long as they do not display her adornments; she should be completely covered except for her face and hands. Then make your <b>intention</b> to perform &#8216;Umrah by saying; Labbayka &#8216;Umrah, or: Labbayk Allahumma Umrah, as follows:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><i>Labbayk, Allahumma. Labbayk</i></td>
<td>Here I am at Your service. O Lord, here I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>Labbayk. La shareeka laka. Labbayk.</i></td>
<td>Here I am. No partner do You have. Here I am,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>lnnal-hamda wan-n &#8216;imata laka wal- mulk.</i></td>
<td>Truly, the praise and the favor is Yours, and the dominion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>La shareeka lak&#8217;</i></td>
<td>No partner do You have</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Men should utter this aloud while women should say it silently. Repeat this <b>talbiyyah</b> frequently, and engage in the praise of Allah, in supplications for forgiveness, and in the enjoining of what is good and forbidding of what is evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. When you reach Makkah, make seven circuits <i>(<b>Tawaf</b>) </i>around the K&#8217;abah, beginning at the <b>Black Stone</b> with <b><i>t</i></b><b><i>akbir</i></b> (utterances of <i>&#8220;<b>Allahu akbar&#8217;</b>) </i>and ending each at the same place. While making your <i>(Tawaf) you </i>may praise Allah and make supplications to Him in any words you please. it is preferable to end each with the words.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b><i>&#8220;Rabbana, atina fid-dunya hasanatan wa fil-akhirati hasanstan wa qina adhaban-nar.&#8221;<br>
</i></b>(Our Lord, give us good in this world and good in the Hereafter. and save us from the punishment of the Fire.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After completing the seventh cirucit, pray <b>two <i>rak&#8217;ats</i></b> behind the <b>Station of Ibraheem <i>(Maqam lbraheem)</i></b><i> if </i>It is possible, even though you may be a little far from it. Otherwise at any other place within the Sacred Mosque.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. You then go to <b>as-safa</b> and climb on it. Facing the K&#8217;abah, praise Allah, raising your hands, say <i>takbir (&#8221;Allahu akbar&#8221;) </i>three times. Then make supplication to Allah, repeating your supplication three times as this is the <i>sunnah. </i>Then say</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b><i>&#8220;La ilaha illal- Lah, wahdahu La sharika La. &#8221;<br>
</i></b><em><strong>Lahul-mulk wa Iahul-hamd, wa huwa &#8216;ala kulli Shayin qadeer&#8221;.</strong></em><br>
<b><i>&#8220;La illahe illal-lah, wahdahu. Anjaza wadahu Wanasara abdahu wa hazama alahzab wahdahu. &#8220;</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(There is no deity except Allah, the One without a partner.<br>
His is the dominion and His is the praise. and He is powerful over everything.<br>
There is no deity except Allah, completed His promise, supported His Slave and defeated the parties Alone.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is preferable to utter this supplication three times but there is no harm in saying it less than three times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You then descend from as-Safa and do the sa&#8217;ye of the umrah seven times. Increase your pace between the green posts, but walk at a normal pace before and after them. When you climb on the Marwah, praise Allah and do as you did at as-Safa, repeating your supplications, if you can conveniently do so, three times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are no required formulas or supplications for tawaf and sa&#8217;ye. It is up to the worshipper to praise Allah or supplicate Him in his own words, or he may recite portions of the Our&#8217;an, with due regard to the supplications which the Prophet (peace be on him) recited during the performance of these rites.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. After sa&#8217;ye end your &#8216;umrah by shaving or shortening your hair. After this, the prohibitions pertaining to the state of ihram are lifted and you may now resume your normal life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you are doing hajj al-tamatt&#8217;u the sacrifice of a sheep or the seventh part of a camel or a cow becomes obligatory for you on the Day of Sacrifice (the 10th of Dhul-Hijjah) .If you cannot afford this sacrifice, it is obligatory for you to fast ten days, three of them during the hajj and seven after returning home.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you are performing hajj al-tamatt&#8217;u or hajj al-qiran, it is preferable to fast these three days before the Day of &#8216;Arafat (the 9th of Dhul-Hijjah).<b> </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE PERFORMANCE OF HAJJ</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. If you are performing hajj al-ifrad or hajj al-qiran (i.e., hajj combined with &#8216;umrah), you enter into ihram at the &#8216;station of ihram (al-miqat) through which you pass on your way to Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you do not pass through any Station of ihram on your way to Makkah, you enter into ihram from your residence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you are performing <i>hajj </i>al-tamatt&#8217;u (the interrupted <i>haii), you </i>enter into ihram for hajj from your residence in Makkah on the 8th of Dhul-Hijjah. Perform ghusl (shower or washing of the entire body), perfume yourself if possible, and put on the two garments of ihram. This applies to men. Women likewise perform ghusl but are not to use perfume. They may wear any suitable clothes they have as long as they do not show their adornments and cover every part of their bodies excepting the hands and face. For woman, if she is in the presence of other men who are not her immediate relatives like her husband, father, brother or son then she should cover her face. After putting on ihram make your niyyah (intention) by Saying: <i>Labbayk Hajjan </i>then recite <i>talbiyyah</i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>&#8220;Labbayk, Allahumma. Labbayk.<br>
Labbayk. La shareeka laka. Labbayk.<br>
lnnal-hamda wan-n&#8217;imata laka wal-mulk. La shareeka lak&#8217;.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(Here I am at Your service, O Lord, here I am. No partner do You have. Here Iam. Truly, the praise and the favor is Yours, and the dominion. No partner do You have.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. You then go to Mina, where you pray the Dhuhr, &#8216;Asr, Maghrib, &#8216;Isha and Fajr prayers at their proper times, shortening prayers of four rak&#8217;as to two rak&#8217;as. Do not combine these prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. When the sun has risen on the 9th of Dhul-Hijjah, proceed toward &#8216;Arafat in a dignified manner and without harming your fellow pilgrims. At&#8217;Arafat, pray the Dhuhr and &#8216;Asr prayers, shortened and combined during the time of Dhuhr with one adhan and two iqamahs</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Make sure that you are within the boundaries of &#8216;Arafat. Stay within the boundaries of &#8216;Arafat, except the valley of Oranah, reciting the praise of Allah the Most High, and offering supplications facing qiblah with upraised hands, as was the practice of Prophet Muhammad (may peace and blessings of Allah be on him). Remain at &#8216;Arafat until after sunset.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. When the sun has set, proceed toward Muzdalifah in a peaceful and dignified manner, reciting <i>talbiyyah. </i>Do not harm or cause any discomfort to your fellow Muslims. When you arrive at Muzdalifah, pray the <i>Maghrib </i>and <i>&#8216;lsha </i>prayers combined, shortening <i>&#8216;Isha </i>to two <i>rak&#8217;ats. </i>Stay at Muzdalifah until you have prayed the <i>Fair </i>prayer. Then wait until the brightness of the morning is wide spread, supplicate facing <i>qiblah </i>with upraised hands, following the practice of the Prophet (peace be on him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For women or weak individuals, it is permissible to proceed to Mina at any time after midnight.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Muzdalifah, pick up only seven pebbles to throw at the Stone Pillar of &#8216;Aqabah. Other pebbles can be picked up at Mina. There is no harm even if the seven pebbles to be thrown at the Stone Pillar of &#8216;Aqabah are also picked up at Mina.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. When you arrive at Mina, do the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) At the Stone Pillar of &#8216;Aqabah (this is the pillar nearest to Makkah) throw the seven pebbles one after the other, saying <i>&#8220;Allahu akbar&#8221; </i>at each throw.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) If you are required to sacrifice, slaughter your sacrificial animal. You are to eat some of its meat and distribute the major part of it to the needy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(c) Shave your head or cut some hair from it. Shaving is preferable for men, while for women the length of hair to be cut is that of a fingertip.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above-mentioned order of doing things is preferred, however, if they are done in some other order, there is no harm in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After you have thrown the pebbles and shaved or cut some of your hair, the prohibitions of <i>ihram </i>are lifted, excepting the prohibition of sexual intercourse with your spouse. This is the first <strong>tahallul</strong>, i.e., returning to one&#8217;s normal state. You are now to wear your usual clothes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. Then you go to Makkah and perform the tawaf al-ifadah (the tawaf which is an essential part of the Hajj). If you are doing hajj al-tamatt&#8217;u, you also perform sa&#8217;ye. If you are performing hajj al- ifrad or hajj al-qiran and you did not perform sa&#8217;ye with tawaf al- qudum (the Tawaf of Arrival), you must do sa&#8217;ye now. After this, the prohibition of marital relations is also lifted and you return to a completely normal life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible to delay the tawaf al-ifadah until the days spent at Mina are over, going to Makkah for this tawaf after all three Pillars have been stoned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. After performing your tawaf al-ifadah on the Day of Sacrifice, return to Mina and spend there the nights preceding the 11th, 12th and 13th days of Dhul-Hijjah (the three days following the Day of Sacrifice which are known as ayyamu-tashreeq. It is however, permissible to spend only two nights in Mina instead of three.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. At any time in the afternoon of each of the two or three days of your stay in Mina, stone each of the three Pillars, starting with the first Pillar( i.e., the one which is farthest from Makkah), followed by the middle Pillar and lastly the Pillar of &#8216;Aqabah. Throw seven pebbles, one by one, at each of these Pillars, saying <i>&#8220;Allahu </i>akbar&#8221; at each throw.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you stay in Mina for only two days, you must leave Mina before the sun sets on the second day. if the sun should set before you are able to depart, remain in Mina for the third night and throw pebbles again the next day. In any case, it is preferable to remain in Mina for three nights.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible for the sick and the weak to appoint a proxy to throw their pebbles. The proxy first throws his own pebbles, followed by the pebbles of the person he represents while at the same pillar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. If you decide to return to your Country after completing the rites of <i>hajj, you </i>perform the Farewell Tawaf (tawaf al-wida &#8216; ) before leaving Makkah. No one is excused from this except women who are menstruating or in the period of discharge following childbirth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>OBLIGATIONS DURING IHRAM</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the state of <i>ihram </i>for <i>hajj </i>or &#8216;Umrah, the following are obligatory;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. To faithfully observe all that Allah has made obligatory, such as the daily prayers at their proper times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. To avoid what Allah has prohibited, such as wrongdoing, quarreling and committing sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. To guard against injuring the Muslims by deed or by word.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. To abstain from what is prohibited during <i>ihram, </i>namely:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) Do not cut your nails or pull out hair. There is no blame on you if these break or come off by themselves without your intending it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) Do not use scent, whether on the clothes or on the body, or in food or drink. There is no harm if the effect of scent applied before putting on ihram remains.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(c) Do not kill, frighten or assist in hunting any land game as long as you are in ihram.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(d) Within the precincts of al-Haram no one, in the state of ihram or not, is allowed to cut trees, pluck vegetables or collect a lost property except for the sake of identifying it for its owner. For the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(e) Do not propose to a woman or contract marriage either for yourself or on behalf of others. Sexual intercourse is prohibited too, so is touching the apposite sex with desire. All these actions are-prohibited during the period of ihram.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All these prohibitions apply equally to men and women alike.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In particular</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man may not put any covering on his head. However, the shade of an umbrella or the roof of a car is permissible. There is no harm in carrying something on the head.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man may not wear a shirt or anything else which is sewn, such as a burnoose, turban, trousers, <i>khuff </i>(short, thin boot), on the whole or a part of his body. However, if an <i>izar </i>(one of the two garments of <i>ihram, </i>worn on the lower part of the body) is not available, trousers may be worn, and if sandals are not available <i>khuff </i>may be worn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is forbidden for a woman to wear gloves on her hands or to cover her face with a face-veil <i>(niqab) </i>or <i>burqa </i>(drape) during the state of <i>ihram. </i>However, if male strangers are around her, she should conceal her face with her head-covering or something similar. These rules apply until she comes out of <i>ihram</i><i>..</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a person wears a sewn garment or covers his head (for men), uses perfume, pulls out some hairs, or cuts his nails through forgetfulness or due to ignorance, there is no <i>fidyah </i>(expiation) for him. He should stop doing such things as soon as he remembers or is reminded of then.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible to wear sandals, a ring, a pair of glasses, a hearing aid, a wrist watch, and a belt or a girdle which protects one&#8217;s money or documents.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible to change one&#8217;s clothes and to wash them, as well as to wash one&#8217;s hair and body, and it does not matter if some hair inadvertently falls out during washing.<b> </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>VISITATION OF THE PROPHET&#8217;S MOSQUE</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Going to Madinah at any time with the intention of visiting the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque is a sunnah, as is performing <i>salah </i>in it, According to a <i>hadith of the Prophet </i>(may peace and blessing of Allah be on him). A salah performed in the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque is better than a thousand salats in any other place excepting the Sacred Mosque (Masjid al-Haram) in Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. There is no <i>ihram</i> nor <i>talbiyah </i>for the visit to the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque, and it should be emphasized that there is no connection whatsoever between this visit and the <i>hajj.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. When you enter the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque, enter with your right foot first, saying the name of Allah the Most High, and invoking blessings on His Prophet (may His peace and blessings be on him), and ask Allah to open the gates of His mercy for you. The recommended words for entering any mosque, including the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque, are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;A&#8217;udhu billahil-adheem wa wajhi hil-kareem wa sultanihil- qadeem mina &#8211; shaytani-rajeem. Allahhumma, iftah li abwaba rahmattk.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(I seek refuge in Allah the Al-mighty, and in His noble countenance and in His eternal power, from Satan the Rejected. 0 Allah, open to me the doors of Your mercy.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Perform two <i>rak&#8217;ats </i>of <i>tahiyyat al-masjid </i>(the <i>salat </i>of &#8220;greeting of the mosque&#8221;) after entering the Mosque, preferably in the <i>Rawdah </i>or otherwise anywhere else in the Mosque.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Then go to the grave of the Prophet (may the peace and blessing of Allah be on him), and standing in front of it and facing it, say in a respectful and hushed voice:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>&#8220;Assalamu &#8216;alaika, ayyuhan-nabiyya wa rahmat al lahi wa barakatuhu. &#8221;<br>
</i><em>(Peace be on you, O Prophet, and the mercy and blessings of Allah), </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and call for the blessings of Allah on him. There is no harm if you add:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8220;Allahumma, atihil-waseelata wal-fadeelata wab-&#8216;athul-maqamal-mahmoudal-ladhee wa-adtahu. Allahumma, ajzih &#8216;an ummatihi afdalal- jaza&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(O Lord, give him the right (of intercession) and the favor, and raise him to the praiseworthy station which you promised to him.O Allah, reward him on behalf of his ummah (people) with the best of rewards.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then move a little to the right to stand before the grave of Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him). Greet him and supplicate Allah to bestow His mercy and forgiveness on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Again move a little to the right to stand before the grave of &#8216;Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), and greet him and make supplication for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. It is sunnah to have (Taharah), and visit the Mosque of Quba and offer salat in it, as the Prophet (peace be on him) prayed there and encouraged others to do the same.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. It is sunnah to visit the graves of al-Baqe&#8217;e cemetery, and the grave of Uthman (May Allah be pleased with him) and the martyrs of &#8216;Uhud, and the grave of Hamzah (May Allah be pleased with them.); to greet them and to pray for the mercy of Allah upon them. The Prophet (peace be upon him) used to visit all these graves and pray for the souls of those who were buried there. He taught his companions when visiting graves to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>&#8220;Assalamu &#8216;alaikum, ahlal-diyar minal-mu&#8217;mineen wal-muslimeen,<br>
wa inna insha-Allah bikum lahiqoon.<br>
Nasalal-laha lans wa lakumul-&#8216;afiyah.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(Peace be on you, O dwellers of this place from among the Believers and the Muslims,<br>
and we <i>will insha-&#8216;Allah </i>join you.<br>
We ask Allah for security (from the Fire of Hell) for ourselves and for you.)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(Reported by Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to the <i>Shari&#8217;ah </i>besides the mosques and other places mentioned above, there are no other mosques or places in Madinah which are to be visited. Therefore, do not burden yourself by visiting places for which there is no reward or for which, in fact, there might be some blame for doing so. And Allah is the source of guidance.<b> </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>ERRORS OFTEN COMMITTED BY PILGRIMS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>First: Errors Related to lhram</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some pilgrims bypass the designated Station of <i>lhram </i>on their route without either being in <i>ihram </i>or entering into <i>ihram </i>there, proceeding until they reach Jeddah or some other place within the precincts of the Stations, at which they enter into <i>ihram. </i>This is against the command of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be on him), which stipulates that every pilgrim should enter into <i>ihram</i> at the Station of <i>ihram </i>which lies on his route.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this happens to someone, he must either go back to the Station of ihram lying on his route and there enter into ihram, or he must make expiation by sacrificing a sheep in Makkah and feeding all its meat to the poor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This applies to all pilgrims regardless of whether one passes the Station of ihram by air, by sea or by land.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one did not pass through one of the five designated Stations of lhram, he should enter into ihram at a point which is nearest to the Station of ihram on his route.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Second: Errors Related to Tawaf</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Starting the tawaf at some point other than the site of the Black Stone, while it is obligatory to begin tawaf from the Black Stone</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Doing one&#8217;s tawaf inside the Hijr of lsma&#8217;il, which means going around a portion of the K&#8217;abah rather than the whole of it since the Hijr of Isma&#8217;il is a part of the K&#8217;abah which would then be left out of tawaf<b>. </b>Such a tawaf is invalid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Doing ramal (i.e., taking quick short steps) during alI seven circuits while ramal is to be done only during the first three of the Tawaf of Arrival (tawaf <i>al-qudum).</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Struggling vehemently to kiss the Black Stone in this process and hitting or pushing people. Such acts, which are injurious to Muslims, are not permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It should be noted that the tawaf remains perfectly valid without kissing the Black Stone. If one does not or cannot kiss the Black Stone. it is sufficient simply to point to it, saying &#8220;Allahu <i>akbar&#8221; when </i>one comes parallel to it, although one may be at a distance from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Wiping one&#8217;s hand over the Black Stone, seeking &#8220;blessings&#8221; <i>(barakah) thereby </i>is an innovation <i>(bid&#8217;a) </i>with no basis in the <i>Shari&#8217;ah </i>of Islam. The <i>sunnah is </i>to touch it or kiss it only when it can be done easily.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. Touching the four corners of K&#8217;abah or its walls, and wiping one&#8217;s hands against them. The Prophet (peace be on him) did not touch any part of K&#8217;abah except the Black Stone and the Yemeni Corner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. Saying specific formulas of supplications reserved for each circuit. The Prophet (peace be on him) did not specify any supplications except to say &#8220;Allahu <i>akbar&#8221; </i><i>when when </i>he reached the Black Stone and, at the end of each circuit between the Yamani Corner and the Black Stone, he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b><i>&#8220;Rabbana, </i>atina&#8217; <i>fid-dunya hasanatan wa fil-akhirati hasana wa qina adhaban-nar. &#8221;<br>
</i></b>(Our Lord, give us good in this world and good in the Hereafter and save us from the punishment of the Fire.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. Raising one&#8217;s voice above the voices of others; whether in following or leading the tawaf as it causes confusion among the worshippers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. Struggling to pray at the Station of lbraheem. This is contrary to the <i>sunnah, </i>besides being injurious to other worshippers. it is sufficient to pray the two <i>rak&#8217;ats of tawaf </i>after completing one&#8217;s tawaf anywhere within the Sacred Mosque.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Third: Errors Related to Sa&#8217;ye</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. When climbing upon Safa and Marwah, some pilgrims face the K&#8217;abah and gesticulate toward it with their hand while saying <i>&#8220;Allahu akbar&#8221; </i>as if they were saying <i>takbir for </i>salat salat. This gesticulating is an error because the Prophet (peace be on him) raised his palms only for supplication. Here you may glorify and magnify Allah the Most High, supplicating Him in any words you wish while facing the direction of the K&#8217;abah. It is preferable to recite the <i>dhikr</i> which the Prophet (peace be on him) recited at Safa and Marwah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Accelerating one&#8217;s pace throughout the entire distance between the two hills. The <i>sunnah </i>is to accelerate one&#8217;s pace only between the two green posts, while walking at normal pace the remainder of the way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Fourth: Errors Related to &#8216;Arafat</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Some pilgrims camp outside the boundaries of &#8216;Arafat and remain there until the sun has set; then they depart for Muzdalifah without standing at &#8216;Arafat properly. This is a serious error which invalidates their hajj since standing in Arafat is the essence of <i>haji, </i>and it is obligatory to be within its boundaries and not outside them, if it is not easy to do that, they may enter before sunset and remain there until sunset. It is quite acceptable to stand in Arafat during the night of sacrifice in particular.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Departing from &#8216;Arafat before the sun has set is not permissible, because the messenger of Allah (peace be on him) stayed at &#8216;Arafat until the sun had set completely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Struggling through crowds in order to climb Mount &#8216;Arafat is not permissible, because it causes much harm and injury to others. The entire Plain of &#8216;Arafat is a place of standing, and neither climbing Mount &#8216;Arafat nor making <i>salah </i>there has been recommended.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Making supplications facing Mount &#8216;Arafat is incorrect because the <i>sunnah </i>is to face <i>qiblah while </i>making supplication.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Making heaps of earth or pebbles: during the day of &#8216;Arafat, at particular places, by some people, has no bases in the <i>Shariah of </i>Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Fifth: Errors Related to Muzdalifah</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some pilgrims start collecting <i>pebbles to </i>throw at the Stone Pillars in Mina as soon as they arrive in Muzdalifah prior to praying the <i>Maghrib and </i>&#8216;lsha prayers. This is not correct. Nor is the practice that ail the pebbles must be collected at Muzdalifah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The correct position is that the pebbles can be collected anywhere within the boundaries of al-Haram (the territory or precincts of Makkah ). It is known that the Prophet (peace be on him) did not ask that the pebbles for Jamratul Aqabah be picked up for him from Muzdalifa. They were picked up for him, in the Morning, after leaving Muzdalifa and on entering Mina. The rest of the pebbles were picked up for him, from Mina too. Some pilgrims wash the pebbles, but this is not recommended.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#993300;">Error Related to Throwing the Pebbles</span><i><br>
</i></b><br>
1. Some pilgrims are under the impression that when they are throwing pebbles at the Stone Pillars, they are actually throwing them at <i>shayateen (devils): </i>hence they hurl them with rage and force. However, the throwing of the pebbles has been merely prescribed as a means of remembering Allah the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Some people throw big stones, shoes or pieces of wood. This is an excess in matters of religion which the Prophet (peace be upon him) prohibited, what is allowed is to throw pebbles the size of good beans.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Crowding and fighting with others at the Pillars while throwing the pebbles is not permissible. What is prescribed is to be gentle and to throw the pebbles without hurting anyone as much as possible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Throwing all the pebbles at one time is an error. Scholars have said that this would be counted as only one throw. The <i>Shari&#8217;ah prescribes </i>throwing the pebbles one by one, saying <b><i>&#8220;Allahu akbar&#8221; </i></b>at each separate throw.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Appointing a proxy to throw the pebbles, simply due to fear of the crowds or of hardship, while one is capable of doing it himself. Only sick or weak individuals are permitted to have a proxy for this act.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Seventh: Errors Related to the Farewell Tawaf (Tawaf -al- Wida)</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. On the day of their departure, some pilgrims go.to Makkah to perform their Farewell Tawaf before throwing the pebbles at the Pillars. Then they return to Mina to throw the pebbles, and depart from Mina for their respective countries. Thus their final rite becomes that of throwing the pebbles at the Pillars and not of the tawaf of K&#8217;abah. This is an error as the Prophet (peace be on him) said, No one should depart without his last visit being to the House (K&#8217;abah) &#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, the Farewell Tawaf must take place after one has completed all the rites of hajj (and before starling his journey for home). After this tawaf one should not stay in Makkah except during the time it takes to prepare to depart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. After finishing the Farewell <i>Tawaf, </i>some people walk backwards, facing the K&#8217;abah, as they exit from the Sacred Mosque, under the impression that this is a veneration of the K&#8217;abah. This act is an innovation <i>(bid&#8217;a) </i>in the religion and is without any basis.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. After finishing the Farewell <i>Tawaf, </i>some pilgrims halt at the door of the Sacred Mosque to make supplications. This is also an innovation with no basis in the <i>Shari&#8217;ah of </i>Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Eighth: Errors Related to the visit of the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Touching and wiping one&#8217;s hands on the walls and iron grilles, tying threads to the gratings, and other acts of this sort while visiting the grave of the Prophet (may peace and blessings of Allah be on him) in order to receive blessings <i>(barakah) </i>are an innovation (bid&#8217;a). Blessings come from following what Allah and His Messenger (peace be on him) have prescribed, and not from following innovations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Going to the caves of Mount Uhud or to the caves of Hira or Thaur near Makkah and hanging pieces of cloth or making supplications there have not been prescribed by Allah. All these are unnecessary hardships, innovations in the religion, and are without any basis in the <i>Shari&#8217;ah.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Likewise, visiting certain sites under the impression that these constitute &#8220;relics&#8221; of the Prophet (peace be on him), as for example the place where his camel sat, the Well of &#8216;Uthman or the Well of the Ring, and gathering soil from these places to obtain &#8220;blessings&#8221;, are all innovations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Calling upon the dead while visiting the graves at the Baqi&#8217; Cemetery or the graves of the martyrs of Uhud, and throwing coins in order to seek the blessings of the place or of the people buried there, is a grievous error indeed. it is <i>shirk </i>(ascribing partners to Allah the Most High), as has been pointed out by scholars. It is clear from the Book of Allah and the <i>sunnah </i>of His Messenger (peace be on him) that all forms of worship are for Allah alone. It is not permissible to call upon, or to offer sacrifice, give vow or any other form of <i>ibadah </i>(worship) except for Allah alone. Allah the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b><i>&#8220;and they were commanded nothing except to worship Allah (only), purifying the religion for Him alone,&#8221;</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and He also says,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>&#8220;<strong>Verily, the places of worship are for Allah (alone), so do not call on anyone else apart from Allah</strong>.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah, the Most High, to improve the condition of the Muslims and to give them understanding of the religion. and to turn all of us away from errors and deviations Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Responding.<b> </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>WHAT IS REQUIRED OF THE PILGRIMS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. To repent sincerely of all sins, and to spend on the hajj or &#8216;umrah out of his lawful earnings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. To guard one&#8217;s tongue from lying, backbiting and slandering.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3, To purify the intention to perform <i>hajj </i>or &#8216;<em>umrah</em> solely to seek the pleasure of Allah the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. To learn what actions are prescribed&#8217;by the Shari&#8217;ah or hajj and &#8216;umrah, and in the event of any difficulty or problem to ask those who know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. When the pilgrim arrives at al-miqat (station of ihram) he is free to choose one of the three types of hajj (ifrad, tamatt&#8217;u or qiran). Tamatt&#8217;u is preferable for a person who has not brought his sacrificial animal with him, while qiran is preferable for one who has his animal with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. If the person entering ihram is afraid he may not be able to complete all the rites because of sickness or fear, he should make the condition: &#8220;I will return to the normal state in case I am obliged to.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. The hajj of children is valid, but it does not fulfill their lslamic obligation of <i>hajj.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. During the state of ihram, one may take bath or wash his head or scratch it if need be.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. A woman may veil her face with her headcovering if she fears that men are looking at her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. Many women wear a headband under the veil to keep it away from the face. This action has no basis.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. It is permissible to wash the ihram garments and to wear them again, or to change into other ihram garments.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. If, during the state of ihram, one should wear a sewn garment, cover his head, or use scent due to forgetfulness or ignorance, no expiation (penalty or redemptive offering) is required of him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. If one is performing hajj al-tamatt&#8217;u or &#8216;umrah, he should stop reciting <i>talbiyyah upon </i>arriving at the K&#8217;abah before beginning his tawaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. Walking with quick, short steps and baring the right shoulder is not permissible during tawaf except during the first three circuits of the Tawaf of Arrival (tawaf <i>al-qudum</i><i>). </i>This<i> </i>applies to men only.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15. If the pilgrim forgets how many circuits he has performed, i.e., whether three or four, he should count them as three (that is, the lesser of the two numbers). The same procedure is to be followed for sa&#8217;ye.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16. In case of large crowds, there is no harm in performing the circuits beyond the Station of lbraheem or even further beyond, as the whole of the Sacred Mosque is a place of tawaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">17. It is prohibited for a woman to make tawaf showing her adornments, using perfume, or not covering properly what the <i>Shari&#8217;ah </i>requires her to be covered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">18. If a woman&#8217;s menses begins or she gives birth after entering into ihram, it is not permissible for her to make tawaf until the flow of blood ceases and she is cleansed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19. A woman may wear any dress for ihram as long as it does not resemble men&#8217;s clothing, show her adornments, or cause temptation to men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">20. To verbalize the intentions for acts of worship other than the hajj or &#8216;umrah is an innovation <i>(bid&#8217;a), and </i>to say it aloud is even more incorrect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">21. If a Muslim has the intention of making <i>hajj or </i>&#8216;<em>umrah</em>, it is forbidden for him to pass by the appointed Station of lhrem (al- miqat) without entering into ihram.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">22. If the pilgrim for <i>hajj or </i>&#8216;<em>umrah</em> is arriving by air, he enters into ihram on the plane when he passes parallel to the Station of ihram on his route. He is to prepare himself, for entering into ihram during the flight before boarding the plane.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">23. If one resides in Makkah, or between Makkah and the Stations of <i>Ihram </i>he need not go anywhere to take <i>ihram. </i>In this case, he is to take his <i>ihram </i>for either <i>hajj </i>or <i>&#8216;umrah </i>at his place of residence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">24. In order to increase the number of their <i>&#8216;umrahs, </i>some people go to al-Tan&#8217;im or al-J&#8217;iranah after the <i>hajj </i>and subsequently return for <i>&#8216;umrah. No </i>support for this practice exists in the <i>Shari&#8217;ah.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">.25. The pilgrim who is performing <i>hajj al-tamatt&#8217;u </i>re-enters <i>ihram</i> on the 8th of Dhul-Hijjah at the place in which he is staying in Makkah. It is not necessary for him to take <i>ihram </i>from any specified place within Makkah (such as al-Mizab), as many people do, nor is there any Farewell <i>Tawaf </i>for going out of Makkah at this time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">26. It is preferable to go to &#8216;Arafat from Mina on the 9th of Dhul- Hijjah after the sun has risen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">27. It is not permissible to depart from &#8216;Arafat on the 9th of Dhul- Hijjah before the sun has set. When the pilgrim departs after sunset, he should do so with ease and dignity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">28, The <i>Maghrib </i>and <i>&#8216;Isha </i>prayers are to be performed after arriving at Muzdalifah, whether at the time of <i>Maghrib </i>or during the period of <i>&#8216;lsha.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">29. It is permissible to gather the pebbles for stoning the Pillars from any place within the boundaries of Makkah <i>(al-Haram), </i>not necessarily from Muzdalifah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">30. It is not recommended to wash the pebbles. No report exists to the effect that the Prophet (peace be on him) or his Companions ever did this. Nor are the used pebbles to be used again.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">31. It is permissible for women, children and weak individuals to proceed to Mina at the end of the night.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">32, When the pilgrim arrives in Mina on the Day of &#8216;Eid (the 10th of Dhul-Hijjah), he should stop reciting <i>talbiyyah. </i>The pebbles are to be thrown successively, one by one, at the Stone Pillar of &#8216;Aqabah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">33. It is not required that the pebbles remain where they are thrown; it is only necessary that they be thrown at the Pillar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">34. According to the opinion of scholars, the period of sacrifice extends to the sunset of the third day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">35. Tawaf <i>al-ifadah or al-ziyarah </i>on the day of &#8216;Eid (the 10th of Dhul-Hijjah) is an essential part of the <i>hajj </i>and <i>hajj </i>is not complete without it. However, it is permissible to delay it until the end of the stay in Mina.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">36. The person making qiran between <i>hajj </i>and <i>&#8216;umrah </i>offers one <i>Sa,ye </i>only. The same is true in the case of ifrad, if the person keeps his <i>ihram </i>until the day of <i>an-Nahr.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">37. On the Day of Sacrifice, it is preferable that the pilgrims do things in the following order: begins by throwing pebbles at the Pillar of &#8216;Aqabah; then Offers his sacrifice; then shaves or clips his hair, he then makes tawaf of the K&#8217;abah followed by sa&#8217;ye Changing this order is, however, permissible<b>.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">38. Returning to full normal state is attained after one has done the following: (a) thrown the pebbles at the Pillar of &#8216;Aqabah; (b) shaved his head or clipped some of his hair; (c) done tawaf al-ifada with sa&#8217;ye.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">39. If the pilgrim decides to shorten his stay in Mina, it is necessary that he departs from Mina before the sunset.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">40. For a child who cannot do the throwing of pebbles, his guardian throws on his behalf after throwing his own pebbles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">41. A person who is not capable of going to the throwing due to old age, illness or pregnancy it is permitted to appoint someone else (his proxy) to do the throwing on his or her behalf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">42. The proxy first throws his own pebbles and thereafter, without leaving the place, throws the pebbles on behalf of the person whom he represents at each of the three Pillars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">43. Except for the residents of the Sacred Mosque, it is obligatory on anyone who is doing <i>hajj a</i> l-tamatt&#8217;u or hajj al-qiran to sacrifice a sheep or to share in the seventh part of a camel or a cow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">44. If the pilgrim is unable to make this sacrifice, he must fast three days during the <i>hajj </i>and seven days after returning home.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">45. It is preferable that these three days of fasting be completed before the Day of &#8216;Arafat so that he is not fasting on that day, or otherwise that he fast on the 11 th, 12th and 13th of Dhul-Hijjah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">46. It is permissible to fast these three days either consecutively or separately, and the same applies to the seven days of fasting at home.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">47. The Farewell <i>Tawaf (tawaf al-wida&#8217;) is </i>obligatory for every pilgrim excepting menstruating or post-partum women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">48. To visit the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque in Madinah is a <i>sunnah, </i>whether it is done before the <i>haii </i>or after it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">49. When you enter the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque, it is <i>sunnah </i>to pray two <i>rak&#8217;ats </i>of tahiyyat <i>al-masjid </i><i>(the (the </i>salah of greeting the mosque). Although you can perform this salah anywhere in the Mosque, it is preferable to perform it in the Rawdah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">50. Visiting the graves of the Prophet (peace be on him) and others is allowed for Males only, and not for females, so that they would not have to travel for such a visit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">51. Rubbing and wiping one&#8217;s hands against the walls of the chamber containing the Prophet&#8217;s tomb, kissing it, or doing circuits around it are all innovations which are prohibited. Such things were not done by our upright ancestors. in particular, making <i>tawaf </i>around the chamber <i>is shirk </i>(ascribing partners to Allah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">52. it is also shirk to call upon the Prophet (peace be upon him) for the fulfilment of a need or to remove a grief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">53. The Prophet&#8217;s life in his grave is in the state at <i>barzakh </i>(the state of existence between death and resurrection on the Day of Judgement) and is in no way similar to his life on earth before his death. The nature and reality of the life of <i>barzakh is </i>known only to Allah the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">54. People who stand in front of the Prophet&#8217;s grave, raising their hands and making supplications, are doing something alien to Islam. This is an innovation in the religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">55. Visiting the grave of the Prophet (peace be on him) is neither obligatory nor a condition for the completion of the <i>hajj, </i>as some people believe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">56. The <i>hadiths </i>cited by some people prescribing visitation of the Prophet&#8217;s grave either have weak authority or are fabricated.</p>
