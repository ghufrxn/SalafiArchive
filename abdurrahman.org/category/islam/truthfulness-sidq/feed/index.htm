										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">source:<em> silsilat ul-ahaadeeth is-saheeha</em> – the series of authentic narrations –<em>hadeeth </em>no. 545</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Umm Kulthum bint ‘Uqbah</em> (<em>radi Allaahu ‘anhaa</em>) said: “the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) allowed lying in three (situations): during war, in reconciling between people, and the speech of a man to his wife. {In another narration:} the speech of a man to his wife and the speech of a woman to her husband.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~*~*~*~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh al-Albaani</em> (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) comments:[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I say, it is<strong> not</strong> part of the permissible lying that (the man) promises (his wife) something that he does not intend to fulfill for her, or he tells her that he bought such and such thing for her with such and such price – i.e., more than the real (price) – for the purpose of pleasing her, because that may be revealed to her; then it will be a reason for her to think badly of her husband, and that is part of corruption, not rectification.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Collected by Abdul Wahhab bin Muhammad as-Salafi</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">Taken from sahab.net</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- The slave of Allaah cannot actualize ‘You are the One that we worship’ except with two principles: one of them is following the Messenger and the second is having sincerity (<em>Ikhlaas</em>) for the one worshipped.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim – ‘Tahdeeb al-Madrij’ 68</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- Sincerity for Allaah is that a person’s intent is for Allaah and intends everything for Him, causing fountains of wisdom to spring up from his heart on to his tongue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymeeyah – ‘an-Naboowaat’ 147</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- Whenever the sincerity of the slave of Allaah strengthens, his worship becomes more complete.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymeeyah – ‘al-Fatawa’ 10/198</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- In relation to the amount of <em>Tawheed</em> a slave has for his Lord, and his sincerity for the religion for Allaah is the amount he is deserving of the generosity of Allaah upon him, from intercession and other things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymeeyah – ‘As-Sarim al-Monkey’ 390</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5- A person does not show his actions to the creation, except due to his ignorance of the Greatness of the Creator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Rajab – ‘Kalimat ul-Ikhlaas’ 31</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6- <em>Ikhlaas</em> cannot be achieved except after having <em>Zuhud</em>, and there is no <em>Zuhud</em> except after having<em>Taqwa</em>, and <em>Taqwa</em> is following the commands (of Allaah and His Messenger) and keeping away from prohibitions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymeeyah – ‘al-Fatawa’ 1/94</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7- Strive today in implementing <em>Tawheed</em>, since there is nothing that will deliver you to Allaah except <em>Tawheed</em>. Also, be eager in fulfilling its rights, since there is nothing that can save you from the fire except <em>Tawheed</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Rajab – ‘Kalimat ul-Ikhlaas’ 54</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8- Whoever is sincere in regards to the actions of the <em>Deen</em>, which he does for Allaah, then he is from the pious <em>Awliyah</em> of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymeeyah – ‘al-Fatawa’ 1/8</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9- If you correct your hidden deeds subsequently Allaah will correct your outward deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymeeyah – ‘al-Fatawa’ 3/277</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10- Having the correct understanding of the <em>Deen</em> is light which Allaah throws into the heart of the slave of Allaah, which is increased by having the <em>Taqwa</em> of Allaah and having good intent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim – ‘Ilaam al-Muaq’een’ 1/69</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11- <em>Ikhlaas</em> is the way to salvation, Islaam is the ship to safety and <em>Emaan</em> is the seal of security.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim – ‘Dar miftah as-Sa’ada’ 1/74</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12- Certainly the strength of Yusuf’s sincerity <em>&#8211; alayhi sallam &#8211;</em> was stronger than the beauty of Azeez’s wife, stronger than her allure, and his want for her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymeeyah – ‘al-Fatawa’ 10/602</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13 – The heart of the truthful person is filled with the light of truth and he has the light of <em>Emaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim – ‘Madarij as-Salikeen’ 2/282</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14- The sincere person is fortified by Allaah due to his worship of Him Alone, intending his Face Alone.  He has humility for Him Alone, and hope in Him Alone, requesting from Him Alone, submissiveness for Him Alone and has a dire need of Him Alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim – ‘Madarij as-Salikeen’ 2/202</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15- There is nothing that drives away the afflictions of this world except <em>Tawheed</em>. That is why the supplication of the distressed person is with <em>Tawheed</em>.   Such as, the supplication of Yunus.  The distressed person does not supplicate by what Yunus supplicated with except that Allaah releases him from his hardship with <em>Tawheed</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing more gruesome for the distressed person except shirk, and there is nothing that can rescue you from it except <em>Tawheed</em>, it is the refuge for the creation, its shelter, its fortress and its aid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim – ‘al-Fawaid’ 96</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16-The reward is doubled in accordance with one perfecting his Islaam and with his perfecting the strength of <em>Ikhlaas</em>, in that action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Rajab – ‘Jama’ al-Aloom’ 2/316</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">17- If a benefit could be achieved from an action performed without <em>Ikhlaas</em>, then Allaah would not have criticised the hypocrites.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim – ‘al-Fawaid’ 65</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">18- Without doubt <em>al-Ikhlaas</em> negates the reason for entering into the Fire, therefore, who ever enters the fire, from those who said: ‘‘<em>la illah ila Allaah’ </em>(there is none worthy of worship except Allaah)’ then this is proof that he never implemented the sincerity of ‘‘<em>la illah ila Allaah’</em><em>’ </em>which would have prohibited him from the fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymeeyah – ‘al-Fatawa’ 10/261</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19 – If the slave of Allaah perfects his <em>Tawheed</em> and his sincerity for Allaah and he establishes / fulfills all its conditions with his heart, and his tongue and his limbs then forgiveness for his past sins becomes obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Rajab – ‘Jama’ al-Aloom’ 2/417</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">20 – <em>Fitnah</em> continues upon the heart, except if the <em>Deen</em> of the slave is completely for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymeeyah – ‘al-Fatawa’ 10/545</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">21- Without doubt, the sincere person has tasted the sweetness of his worship for Allaah, this is what stops him from performing worship for other than Allaah, since there is nothing more sweet or more blessed for the heart than the sweetness of <em>Emaan</em> in Allaah the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymeeyah – ‘al-Fatawa’ 10/215</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">22- The different grades of doing actions for Allaah are in relation to what is in the heart from<em>Emaan</em>, sincerity, love and that what follows them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim – ‘al-Waabil as-Sayib’ 22</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">23- Sincerity is not combined in the heart along with the love of being praised by the people, and being commended by them, and also having greed for what the people have, except like water being combined with fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim – ‘al-Fawaid’ 267</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">24- <em>Ikhlaas</em> and <em>Tawheed</em> are a tree in the heart.  Its branches are good actions.  Its fruits are a good life in this world, and eternal comfort in the Hereafter, and just like in Paradise the fruits whose supply is not cut off, nor are they out of reach, likewise are the fruits of <em>Tawheed</em> and<em>Ikhlaas</em> in this world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim – ‘al-Fawaid’ 292</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">25- An action done without <em>Ikhlaas</em> and without following the Messenger is like a traveler whose sock becomes filled with sand, which weighs him down, and has no benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim – ‘al-Fawaid’ 89</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">26- Allaah loves from His slave that he beautifies his tongue with the truth, and his heart with<em>Ikhlaas</em> and love, turning repentantly and reliance upon Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim – ‘al-Fawaid’ 327</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">27- Having sincerity for the <em>Deen</em> of Allaah is the foundation of justice, likewise committing <em>Shirk</em>with Allaah is a great injustice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymeeyah – ‘al-Fatawa’ 1/87</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 align="Center"><a href="#">Imam Al-Nawawi&#8217;s Riyad-us-Saliheen</a><br />
Chapter 4<br />
Truthfulness</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;O you who believe! Be afraid of Allah, and be with those who are true (in words and deeds)&#8221;.</b></span><b> (9:119)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;the men and women who are truthful (in their speech and deeds)..&#8221;.</b></span><b> (33:35)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;then if they had been true to Allah, it would have been better for them&#8221;.</b></span><b> (47:21)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>54.</b> Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Truth leads to piety and piety leads to Jannah. A man persists in speaking the truth till he is enrolled with Allah as a truthful. Falsehood leads to vice and vice leads to the Fire (Hell), and a person persists on telling lies until he is enrolled as a liar&#8221;.&#8217;</span><br />
[Agreed upon].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>55.</b> Hasan bin `Ali (May Allah be pleased with them) said: I remember (these words) from Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam):<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Give up what is doubtful to you for that which is not doubtful; for truth is peace of mind and falsehood is doubt&#8221;.</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>56.</b> Abu Sufyan (May Allah be pleased with him) reported, in course of his detailed narration about Heraclius when the latter questioned him about the teachings of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) He said that: He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) told (us):<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Worship Allah Alone and do not associate a thing with Him; and give up all that your ancestors said. &#8220;</span>He also commands us to perform Salat (prayers), to speak the truth, to observe modesty and to strengthen the ties of kinship<span style="color:#0000ff;">.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>57.</b>  Abu Thabit from Sahl bin Hunaif (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He who asks Allah for martyrdom, Allah will raise him to the high status of the martyrs, even if he dies on his bed&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>58.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;One of the earlier Prophets who was out on an expedition proclaimed among his people that no man should follow him who had married a woman with whom he wished to cohabit but had not yet done so, or who had built houses on which he had not yet put the roofs, or who had bought sheep or pregnant she-camels and was expecting them to produce young. He, then, went on the expedition and approached the town at the time of the &#8216;Asr prayer or little before it. He then told the sun that both it and he were under command and prayed Allah to hold it back for them, so it was held back till Allah gave him victory. He collected the spoils and it (meaning fire) came to devour these, but did not. He said that among the people there was a man who stole from the booty. He told them that a man from every tribe must swear allegiance to him, and when a man&#8217;s hand stuck to his, he said: &#8220;There is thief among you and every individual of your tribe must swear allegiance to me&#8221;. (In course of swearing of allegiance,) hands of two or three persons stuck to his hand. He said: &#8220;The thief is among you&#8221;. They brought him a head of gold like a cow&#8217;s head and when he laid it down, the fire came and devoured the spoils. Spoils were not allowed to anyone before us, then Allah allowed spoils to us as He saw our weakness and incapacity and allowed them to us&#8221;</span>.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>59.</b> Hakim bin Hizam (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Both parties in a business transaction have a right to annul it so long as they have not separated; and if they tell the truth and make everything clear to each other (i.e., the seller and the buyer speak the truth, the seller with regard to what is purchased, and the buyer with regard to the money) they will be blessed in their transaction, but if they conceal anything and lie, the blessing on their transaction will be eliminated.&#8221;</span><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We came to the Prophet and we were young men nearly of  equal ages and we stayed with him for twenty nights. Allah&#8217;s Apostle was a very kind man  and when he realized our longing for our families, he asked us about those whom we had  left behind. When we informed him, he said, &#8220;Go back to your families and stay with  them and teach them (religion) and order them (to do good deeds). The Prophet mentioned  things some of which I remembered and some I did not. Then he said, &#8220;Pray as you have  seen me praying, and when it is the time of prayer, one of you should pronounce the call  (Adhan) for the prayer and the eldest of you should lead the prayer. &#8221; </font></p>
<hr />
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.091.353"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 91, Number 353: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Mas&#8217;ud: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The (call for prayer) Adhan of  Bilal should not stop anyone of you from taking his Suhur for he pronounces the Adhan in  order that whoever among you is praying the night prayer, may return (to eat his Suhur)  and whoever among you is sleeping, may get up, for it is not yet dawn (when it is like  this).&#8221; (Yahya, the sub-narrator stretched his two index fingers side ways). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Bilal pronounces the Adhan at night  so that you may eat and drink till Ibn Um Maktum pronounces the Adhan (for the Fajr  prayer).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 91, Number 355: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet led us in Zuhr prayer and prayer five Rakat.  Somebody asked him whether the prayer had been increased.&#8221; He (the Prophet ) said,  &#8220;And what is that?&#8221; They (the people) replied, &#8220;You have prayed five  Rakat.&#8221; Then the Prophet offered two prostrations (of Sahu) after he had finished his  prayer with the Taslim. </font></p>
<hr />
<p></a><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.091.356"></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle finished his prayer after offerings two  Rakat only. Dhul-Yaddain asked him whether the prayer had been reduced, or you had  forgotten?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Is Dhul-Yaddain speaking the truth?&#8221; The  people said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up and performed another two  Rakat and then finished prayer with Taslim, and then said the Takbir and performed a  prostration similar to or longer than his ordinary prostrations; then he raised his head,  said Takbir and prostrated and then raised his head (Sahu prostrations). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While the people were at Quba offering the morning prayer,  suddenly a person came to them saying, &#8220;Tonight Divine Inspiration has been revealed  to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and he has been ordered to face the Ka&#8217;ba (in prayers): therefore you  people should face it.&#8221; There faces were towards Sham, so they turned their faces  towards the Ka&#8217;ba (at Mecca). </font></p>
<hr />
<p></a><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.091.358"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 91, Number 358: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara&#8217;: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah&#8217;s Apostle arrived at Medina, he prayed facing  Jerusalem for sixteen or seventeen months but he wished that he would be ordered to face  the Ka&#8217;ba. So Allah revealed: &#8212; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Verily! We have seen the turning of your face towards the  heaven; surely we shall turn you to a prayer direction (Qibla) that shall please you.&#8217;  (2.144) Thus he was directed towards the Ka&#8217;ba. A man prayed the &#8216;Asr prayer with the  Prophet and then went out, and passing by some people from the Ansar, he said, &#8220;I  testify. that I have prayed with the Prophet and he (the Prophet) has prayed facing the  Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; Thereupon they, who were bowing in the &#8216;Asr prayer, turned towards the Ka&#8217;ba.  </font></p>

Then a person came to them  and said, &#8220;All alcoholic drinks have been prohibited.&#8221; Abii Talha then said,  &#8220;O Anas! Get up and break all these jars.&#8221; So I got up and took a mortar  belonging to us, and hit the jars with its lower part till they broke. </font></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah Issue No.2 &#8211; Safar 1417H / July 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THE MASTER OF SUPPLICATIONS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The master of supplications for seeking Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness is when a servant says: <b> O Allaah! You are my Lord and none has the right to be worshipped except You. Indeed You created me and I am Your slave. I abide by my promise and covenant to You as best as I can. I seek refuge in You from the evils that I have done. I acknowledge Your favours upon me and I acknowledge my sin. So forgive me. Indeed none can forgive sin except You.</b> [<i>Allaahumma anta Rabbee, laa ilaaha illaa anta, khalaqtanee, wa anaa &#8216;abduka, wa anaa &#8216;alaa abdika wa wa&#8217;dika mastata&#8217;tu, a&#8217;oodhu bika min sharri maa sana&#8217;tu, aboo&#8217;u laka bi ni&#8217;matika &#8216;alayaa, wa aboo&#8217;u bi dhanbee, faghfirlee, fa innahu laa yaghfirudh-dhanooba illaa anta</i>] Whosoever enters upon the evening saying this, then dies that night, would enter Paradise. And whosoever enters upon the morning saying this, then dies that day, will enter Paradise.&#8221; [Related by al-Bukhaaree (11/97-98) and Ahmad (5/356), from the narration of Shaddaad ibn Aws and Buraydah ibn al-Haseeb <i> radiallaahu &#8216;anhumaa</i>.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>A POINT OF BENEFIT</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim (d.751H) &#8211; <i> rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said in al-Waabilus-Sayyib (pp.16-17):<br />
&#8220;Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) said: &#8220;Knowing the path to Allaah lies in recognising Allaah&#8217;s favours and considering the sins and shortcomings of one&#8217;s self.&#8221; This is the meaning of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s</i> saying &#8211; as occurs in the authentic narration from Shaddaad and Buraydah <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhumaa</i> &#8211; that he said: <i>&#8220;The master of supplications in seeking the forgiveness of Allaah is when a savant says: O Allaah! You are my Lord&#8230; &#8220;</i> So recognition of Allaah&#8217;s favours and consideration of one&#8217;s own sins and shortcomings have both been collectively mentioned in the (above) supplication, since he <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;I acknowledge Your favours upon me and I acknowledge my sins.&#8221; </i> So recognition of Allaah&#8217;s Favours necessitates praising and thanking Him for His favours and bounties, which in turn necessitates love for Him. Whilst consideration of one&#8217;s own sins and shortcomings necessitates humility to Allaah and a feeling of lowliness and humbleness to Him. This in turn necessitates repenting to Allaah continuously, and that one considers himself as being poor and in need of Allaah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Spreading Mischief Through THE ART OF LYING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;Indeed truthfulness leads to piety and obedience and piety and obedience lead to Paradise. And a person continues to be truthful until he is recorded with Allaah as a truthful person. And indeed lying leads to wickedness and wickedness lead to the Fire. And a person continues to lie until he is recorded with Allaah as a liar.&#8221; </i>[Related by al-Bukhaaree (3/30) and Muslim (no.2607), from Ibn Mas&#8217;ood <i>radiallaabu &#8216;anhu</i>.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>DESTROYING COMPREHENSIVE BROTHERHOOD</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaanee &#8211; <i> hafidhahullaah</i> &#8211; said in <i>Fiqhul-Waaqi&#8217;</i> (pp.13-14), whilst speaking about certain trials that have afflicted the Muslims, destroying their unity, weakening their resolve and splitting their ranks: &#8220;Part of this trial has struck at the root of the hearts of a great number of <i>daa&#8217;ees</i> (callers to Islaam) and students of knowledge, so that they have &#8211; regretfully &#8211; become divided between themselves. Some of them speaking ill of others, and the others criticising the remainder and refuting them. These rebuttals on their own, or these criticisms alone will neither harm the one refuting, nor the one refuted, since &#8211; with the people of justice &#8211; the truth is recognised by its light and its proofs, which is not the case with the people of blind-sectarianism and deviation. <b>However, what will harm them is speech without knowledge, talking without restraint and speaking falsely about the servants of Allaah!</b>&#8220;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Scholar</strong>: Imâm Muhammad bin Sâlih bin ´Uthaymîn<br />
<strong>Source</strong>: islamcast.wordpress.com/2009/03/29<br />
<strong>Reference</strong>: Darulhadith.com<br />
<strong>Translation &amp; video:</strong> aFatwa.com</p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymîn:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I warn my Muslim brothers against what some stupid people do when they narrate april jokes. This lie have they taken from the jews, the christians, fire-worshipers (Majûs) and other disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Not only is this act a lie, which is in itself forbidden according to the Sharî’ah, it also involves imitating the disbelievers, which is forbidden. The prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Whoever imitates a people belongs to them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh-ul-Islâm Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullâh) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“Its chain of narration is good.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The least one could say is that it is forbidden, even if it seemingly entails disbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Together with these two sins, the Muslim becomes humiliated before his enemy. It is generally known that the one who is imitated boasts before the imitator and sees himself as being in front of him. The imitator thus becomes weak so that he imitates him. The believer thusly becomes degraded since he subjugates himself and follows the disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth sin is that this filthy lie is often about taking someone else’s money unjustly and scaring the Muslims. They maybe lie and tell the family that they will be having guests. As a result thereof they prepare a great meal and meat and the like. They might also lie and tell them horrifying news of a relative being run over by a car or the like. This is not allowed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bismi Allaahi RaHman ir RaHeem</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sheikh &#8216;Alee arRamlee hafidahu Allaah explains:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Somebody says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;I will only take from him [i.e. somebody that somehow differs with the salaf] his words that are truth and leave the falsehood&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sheikh answers: &#8220;<b>It is not permissible for you to do that</b>&#8220;</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>Q: &#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Because your situation will not fail to be one of two possible cases: either you are a student of the religion and you can distinguish truth from falsehood or you are not able to distinguish truth from falsehood and the latter is the situation of most people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">If you are unable to distinguish then there is not point in asking your question, but if you are able to distinguish then still you are not able to assure that your heart will not be overcome with doubts, and this is a matter of religion, no playing games is allowed, besides the truth you would take from him [i.e. the one that somehow opposed the salaf] you can take from others that are trustworthy&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>And then Sheikh ar Ramlee goes on to remind the stories of some of the greatest scholars in the first generations that would not allow themselves, or their families, to listen to even a verse of the qur&#8217;an recited by a caller to innovation. Like the example of Ibn Tawus, Abu Kulabah as well as the example of Muhammad ibn Sirin. Then the Shaikh refutes many other common excuses like &#8220;but he has sincerity and piety&#8221; or &#8220;isnt this ghiba?&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For the original in Arabic please visit: <a href="http://www.albaidha.net/vb/archive/index.php/t-13335.html" target="_blank">http://www.albaidha.net/vb/archive/index.php/t-13335.html</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Related to this is &#8220;Repenting to mistakes in Manhaj&#8221; by sheikh Rabee&#8217; (hafidahu Allaah) which highlights the seriousness of opposing the way of the salaf (includes link to arabic original) with examples of the prophet sala Allaahu &#8216;aleihi wa salaam and the sahaba:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Imaam Sufyaan</strong> (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Be truthful at all times and in all places. Stay away from lying and from deception, and do not sit alongside liars and deceivers, for all such deeds are sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My brother, be careful not to show off, either in speech or in deed, for showing off is <em>Shirk</em> itself (<em>Shirk</em> being to associate partners with Allaah in worship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not be conceited, for even a good deed is not raised (to the heavens) if any conceitedness is involved in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Take your religion only from one who is sincerely and compassionately concerned about his own religious guidance. The example of a scholar who is not concerned about his own religious well-being is that of a sick doctor: If he cannot treat his own disease…then how can he treat the diseases of others…? Likewise, if one is not concerned about his own religious well-being, then how can he be concerned about the religious well-being of others?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My brother, your religion is nothing more than your flesh and blood (i.e., You should be concerned about your religious well-being, because if you aren’t, it is your flesh and blood that will pay the penalty through the punishment of Allaah). Cry out of concern for your soul and have mercy on it; if you do not have mercy on it, then mercy will not be shown to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sit only in the company of one who advises you to desire little from this world and who encourages you to put your hopes in the Hereafter. Take care not to sit with worldly people who speak constantly about worldly affairs; such people will ruin your religious well-being and will corrupt your heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Remember death frequently, and just as frequently ask Allaah to forgive you for your past sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ask Allaah to keep you safe (safe from evil, from dangerous diseases, from trials and tribulations, etc) for the remainder of your life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My brother, develop a good character and noble manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not act contrary to the <em>Jamaa’ah</em> (the general body of <em>Sunni</em> Muslims), for goodness and safety are the consequences of being in harmony with the <em>Jamaa’ah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Someone who strives constantly for this world is like a person who builds one home and destroys another (because he builds prosperity for himself in this world, while he destroys all chances of becoming prosperous in the Hereafter).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Give sincere advice to every believer who asks you a question regarding his religion. And never hide good advice to someone who asks you about a matter that leads to the Good Pleasure of Allaah (<em>subhaanahu wa ta’aala</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you love your (Muslim) brother for the sake of Allaah, then give him generously from your self and your wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Stay far away from arguments, quarrels, and disputes; otherwise, you will become a wrongdoer, a transgressor, and a deceiver.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Be patient at all times and in all places, for patience leads to righteousness, and righteousness leads to Paradise. Do not become angry and furious, for those two emotions lead to wickedness, and wickedness leads to the Hellfire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not argue with a scholar, for that will lead to him loathing you. Being able to visit scholars (and learn from them) is a mercy, and cutting oneself off from them means that one is bringing down upon himself the wrath of Allaah (<em>subhaanahu wa ta’aala</em>). Verily, the scholars are the treasurers of the Prophets (<em>‘alayhumus salaam</em>) and are also their inheritors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Turn away from worldly pleasures and things (to a certain degree), and, as a result, Allaah will enable you to see the faults and defects of this world. Be a man of <em>Wara’</em> (one who forsakes all dubious and some lawful things because he fears that those things will lead to what is prohibited in Islaam), and (on the Day of Resurrection) Allaah will make your session of accountability easier for you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Leave many of the things regarding which you are doubtful, and replace them with things regarding which you are not doubtful, and you will, as a result, remain safe: So by warding off doubt with certainty, you will remain safe in your religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Enjoin good and forbid evil — thus will you become loved by Allaah. Despise wicked-doers, and drive away devils (regardless of whether they are humans or jinn).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you want to become strong (in faith)…then be exultant only a little and laugh only a little when you get something you want from this world. Concentrate on working for the Hereafter; if you do that, Allaah will be sufficient for you regarding your worldly concerns….</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ask Allaah for safety (in both your religious and worldly affairs). If you intend to something for your Hereafter – such as giving charity – then apply yourself to doing it quickly before the <em>Shaytaan</em> (the Devil) weakens your resolve and thus prevents you from doing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not be a heavy eater, whereby you work less than you eat, for that is disliked (in Islaam). Do not eat without an intention, and do not eat when you are not hungry. And do not fill your stomach constantly until you become a corpse, not having remembered Allaah while you were alive (but instead having been concerned with eating to your full and fulfilling your desires).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Decrease the frequency with which you fall into error, accept apologizes (from those who wronged you), and forgive the person who wronged you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Be the type of person from whom people generally expect good things and from whose evil people feel safe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not hate anyone who obeys Allaah, and be merciful both towards people in general and towards those with whom you are well-acquainted (or both to the general masses of Muslim and to people of high standing in society).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not sever the ties of the womb (i.e., do not cut off relations with family members and relatives), and join ties with those who have severed them from you. Pardon those who wronged you, and you will, as a result, become a companion of the Prophets and martyrs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not be a frequent visitor of the marketplace, for the people there (mostly sellers, but some buyers also) are wolves in men’s clothing. Marketplaces are often frequented by devils – devils both of the human kind and of the jinn kind. When you enter the marketplace, it becomes obligatory upon you to enjoin good and forbid evil – but know that you will only see evil there. Stand to one side of the marketplace and call out: ‘<span style="color:#993300;">I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped but Allaah alone; He has no partner; the dominion of all that exists belongs to Him. He is deserving of all praise. It is He Who gives life, and it is He Who causes death. All goodness is in His hands, and He is upon all things capable. There is neither might nor power except with Allaah, the All-High, the All-Mighty</span>.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not enter into disputes with worldly people over their worldly things, and, as a result, Allaah will love you, and the people of earth will love you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And be humble….When you are healthy, do good deeds, and you will be granted safety and health (physically and spiritually) from above.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Be a forgiving person, and you will get the things you want. Be a merciful person, and all things will be merciful towards you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My brother, do not allow your days, nights, and hours to be wasted on falsehood. Spend from your self for yourself – for the Day of Thirst (the Day of Resurrection). My brother, your thirst will not be quenched on the Day of Resurrection unless the Most Merciful is pleased with you, and you will not achieve His Good pleasure unless you are obedient to Him. Perform many voluntary good deeds, for they have the effect of bringing you closer to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Be generous, and your faults will be covered, and Allaah will make easier for you your session of accountability (on the Day of Resurrection) as well as the horrors (that will take place on that day).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perform many good deeds, and Allaah will make you feel happy and at ease in your grave.&nbsp; Stay away from all prohibited deeds, and thus will you taste the sweetness of faith (<em>Eemaan</em>). Sit in the company of righteous and pious people, and Allaah will make well for you the affairs of your religion. And in the affairs of your religion, consult those who fear Allaah. Hasten to perform good deeds, and Allaah will protect you from disobeying Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Remember Allaah frequently, and, as a result, Allaah will make you less desirous of this world (and its pleasures and possessions). Remember death, and, as a result, Allaah will make your worldly affairs easier for you. Yearn for Paradise, and, as a result, Allaah will help you obey Him. Be frightened by the Hellfire, and,&nbsp; as a result, Allaah will make it easier for you to endure the hardships of this life.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allaah, The Most Gracious, The Most Merciful<br />
All Praise is due to Allaah, Lord of everything that exists</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:large;"><strong><span style="color:green;">The Importance of Being Truthful</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Falaah Isma&#8217;eel recently relayed a heart-melting story that may interest you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Shaikh visited Holland, he was of course met by Muslims from Holland and they told him, &#8220;If you had come two weeks earlier you would have seen it yourself. We prayed over this man.&#8221; Then they told him the following story.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[What follows is not verbatim, but a summary, with some explanations so as to clarify some terms that may be new to non-Muslims.]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was a 26-year-old Christian from Holland. One day, he changed his dress to thobes, a burnoose, grew a beard, and the people started calling him &#8220;the one who looks like Jesus.&#8221;One day, he met some Muslims, and he said to them, &#8220;I love Jesus.&#8221; And the Muslims told him, &#8220;We also love Jesus, and it is even a condition of Islam. We love Jesus and Moses.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this man tried imitating Jesus, helping others when he could, cutting their lawns and the like. After two years, he entered the mosque [the Muslims&#8217; place of worship] for the first time, and he was greeted with &#8220;ahlan&#8221; [which means welcome, and thus was not greeted with the greeting reserved for Muslims &#8220;as-salaamu &#8216;alaykum&#8221; (which means: may peace and safety be upon you on the Day of Judgement)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8220;no; I want to be a Muslim.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, the Muslims witnessed his testimony (pronounced &#8220;shahada&#8221;) &#8211; there is none deserving of worship except Allaah, and Muhammad is His servant and Messenger, and Jesus is His servant and Messenger &#8211; taught him the basics, and taught him how to pray. He began praying in congregation with them, not missing a single congregation. Then one day, he noticed that the other Muslims were arriving at the mosque after him, so he asked for a key to the mosque. And he was given one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslims then observed that not only was he opening the mosque, but additionally he was routinely found in optional prayer whenever they entered the mosque for the dawn prayer. [They would enter and find him already engaged in the worship of Allaah.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then one day, he told the Muslims how he decided to become Muslim. He said he had a dream about Jesus (the son of Mary), and Jesus said to him, &#8220;Be Muslim. Be Muslim. Be Muslim.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I woke up, and a few days later, I had the same dream. This happened three times.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[The shaikh interjected and said, this is success from Allaah.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So after having prayed for 20 days with the other Muslims, he died.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the mercy of Allaah, and Allaah saved him [from dying upon other than Islam].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is Sidq (truthfulness); he truthfully loved Jesus, so he became Muslim. Allaah guided him to become Muslim, because he was truthful in his love for Jesus.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif;">If one is truthful in his love for Jesus and his following Jesus, then this should lead him to the true religion of Jesus (Islam) and should lead him to following whom Jesus commanded to be followed after him &#8211; Muhammad, the seal of all Prophets.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif;">After all, the religion of all the Prophets was Islam, and their creed was the same, and their message was the same, and they confirmed each other.</span><span style="font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif;"> It is only the deviant who have distorted the message of the previous Prophets, and thus Allaah promised to preserve His last revelation (the Qur`an) from corruption.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">In Al-Fawaaid Ad-daraaree, Al-Ajloonee related that Imam Bukhaaree (may Allah have mercy on him) once travelled by boat on a journey to seek out knowledge and that  he had taken with him one-thousand dinars. One of his fellow travelers ingratiated himself with Imam Bukharee, outwadly showing him love and admiration. During the sea-voyage, the man often made it a point to sit in his company. On long journeys, friendships develop faster than normal, and during the course of the time they spent together, Imam Bukhaaree informed the man that he had one-thousand dinars with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The morning after Imam Bukharee spoke about the money, the man woke up and began to cry, scream, rip his clothing apart, and slap his own face, as if he had just been afflicted with a great loss. His fellow shipmates asked him what was wrong, and he refused to answer at first, as if he was still in a state of  shock and could not bring himself to speak about his situation. After they continually insisted that he tell them what the matter was with him, he finally said, &#8220;I had a bag that contained one-thousand dinars, and I lost it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The crewmen who were incharge of the ship began to search the passengers. One by one everyone was being searched, and upon realizing what was happening, Imam Bukharee, making sure that no one was looking, threw his bag of money over the side of the ship. When it was his turn to be searched, nothing was found. When the entire ship and all of its passengers were searched, and when no bag of money was found, those in authority on the ship went back to the man who had made up the story and chastised him for making a false claim and for putting them through so much trouble. As soon as the ship finally reached shore, the passengers began to disembark;meanwhile, Imam Bukhaaree&#8217;s old friend went to him and asked him what he had done with the bag of money.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I threw it into the sea,&#8221; Imam Bukhaaree matter-of-factly replied.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And you are patiently accepting the fact that you have just lost such a huge sum of money?&#8221; the man asked in bewilderment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O ignorant one,&#8221; Imam Bukhaaree said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;Do you not know that I have spent my entire life gathering the Ahadeeth of the Messenger (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) and that  the world now acknowledges my trustworthiness. Would it then have been befitting for me to subject  myself to the accusation of theft? And shall I lose the precious pearl (i.e my knowledge and achievements as a scholar) that I have earned over a lifetime over a limited number of dinars?&#8221;</span>[1]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#808080;">From last hadith in The Book of Revelation of the 1st Volume of Sahih Bukhari:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sufyan bin Harb informed me that Heraclius had sent a messenger to him while he had been accompanying a caravan from Quraish. They were merchants doing business in Sham (Syria, Palestine, Lebanon and Jordan), at the time when Allaah&#8217;s Messenger had truce with Abu Sufyan and Quraish infidels. So Abu Sufyan and his companions went to Heraclius at Ilya (Jerusalem). Heraclius called them in the court and he had all the senior Roman dignitaries around him. He called for his translator who, translating Heraclius&#8217;s question said to them, &#8220;Who amongst you is closely related to that man who claims to be a Prophet?&#8221; Abu Sufyan replied, &#8220;I am the nearest relative to him (amongst the group).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Heraclius said, &#8220;Bring him (Abu Sufyan) close to me and make his companions stand behind him.&#8221; Abu Sufyan added, Heraclius told his translator to tell my companions that he wanted to put some questions to me regarding that man (The Prophet) and that if I told a lie they (my companions) should contradict me.&#8221; Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;By Allaah! Had I not been afraid of my companions labeling me a liar, I would not have spoken the truth about the Prophet. The first question he asked me about him was:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;What is his family status amongst you?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;He belongs to a good (noble) family amongst us.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Heraclius further asked, &#8216;Has anybody amongst you ever claimed the same (i.e. to be a Prophet) before him?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;No.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8216;Was anybody amongst his ancestors a king?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;No.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Heraclius asked, &#8216;Do the nobles or the poor follow him?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;It is the poor who follow him.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8216;Are his followers increasing decreasing (day by day)?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;They are increasing.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then asked, &#8216;Does anybody amongst those who embrace his religion become displeased and renounce the religion afterwards?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;No.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Heraclius said, &#8216;Have you ever accused him of telling lies before his claim (to be a Prophet)?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;No. &#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Heraclius said, &#8216;Does he break his promises?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;No. We are at truce with him but we do not know what he will do in it.&#8217; I could not find opportunity to say anything against him except that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Heraclius asked, &#8216;Have you ever had a war with him?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;Yes.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said, &#8216;What was the outcome of the battles?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;Sometimes he was victorious and sometimes we.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Heraclius said, &#8216;What does he order you to do?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, <strong>&#8216;He tells us to worship Allaah and Allaah alone and not to worship anything along with Him, and to renounce all that our ancestors had said. He orders us to pray, to speak the truth, to be chaste and to keep good relations with our Kith and kin.&#8217;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Heraclius asked the translator to convey to me the following, I asked you about his family and your reply was that he belonged to a very noble family. In fact all the Messengers come from noble families amongst their respective peoples. I questioned you whether anybody else amongst you claimed such a thing, your reply was in the negative. If the answer had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that this man was following the previous man&#8217;s statement. Then I asked you whether anyone of his ancestors was a king. Your reply was in the negative, and if it had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that this man wanted to take back his ancestral kingdom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I further asked whether he was ever accused of telling lies before he said what he said, and your reply was in the negative. <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>So I wondered how a person who does not tell a lie about others could ever tell a lie about Allaah.</strong></span> I, then asked you whether the rich people followed him or the poor. You replied that it was the poor who followed him. And in fact all the Messengers have been followed by this very class of people. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing. You replied that they were increasing, and in fact this is the way of true faith, till it is complete in all respects. I further asked you whether there was anybody, who, after embracing his religion, became displeased and discarded his religion. Your reply was in the negative, and in fact this is (the sign of) true faith, when its delight enters the hearts and mixes with them completely. I asked you whether he had ever betrayed. You replied in the negative and likewise the Messengers never betray. Then I asked you what he ordered you to do. You replied that he ordered you to worship Allaah and Allaah alone and not to worship any thing along with Him and forbade you to worship idols and ordered you to pray, to speak the truth and to be chaste. If what you have said is true, he will very soon occupy this place underneath my feet and I knew it (from the scriptures) that he was going to appear but I did not know that he would be from you, and if I could reach him definitely, I would go immediately to meet him and if I were with him, I would certainly wash his feet.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Heraclius then asked for the letter addressed by Allaah&#8217;s Messenger which was delivered by Dihya to the Governor of Busra, who forwarded it to Heraclius to read. The contents of the letter were as follows: &#8220;In the name of Allaah the Beneficent, the Merciful (This letter is) from Muhammad the slave of Allaah and His Messenger to Heraclius the ruler of Byzantine. Peace be upon him, who follows the right path. Furthermore I invite you to Islam, and if you become a Muslim you will be safe, and Allaah will double your reward, and if you reject this invitation of Islam you will be committing a sin by misguiding your Arisiyin (peasants). (And I recite to you Allaah&#8217;s Statement:)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>O people of the scripture! Come to a word common to you and us that we worship none but Allaah and that we associate nothing in worship with Him, and that none of us shall take others as Lords beside Allaah. Then, if they turn away, say: Bear witness that we are Muslims (those who have surrendered to Allaah).</strong> (3:64)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sufyan then added, &#8220;When Heraclius had finished his speech and had read the letter, there was a great hue and cry in the Royal Court. So we were turned out of the court. I told my companions that the question of Ibn-Abi-Kabsha) (the Prophet Muhammad) has become so prominent that even the King of Bani Al-Asfar (Byzantine) is afraid of him. Then I started to become sure that he (the Prophet) would be the conqueror in the near future till I embraced Islam (i.e. Allaah guided me to it).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sub narrator adds, &#8220;Ibn An-Natur was the Governor of llya&#8217; (Jerusalem) and Heraclius was the head of the Christians of Sham. Ibn An-Natur narrates that once while Heraclius was visiting ilya&#8217; (Jerusalem), he got up in the morning with a sad mood. Some of his priests asked him why he was in that mood? Heraclius was a foreteller and an astrologer. He replied, &#8216;At night when I looked at the stars, I saw that the leader of those who practice circumcision had appeared (become the conqueror). Who are they who practice circumcision?&#8217; The people replied, &#8216;Except the Jews nobody practices circumcision, so you should not be afraid of them (Jews).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Just Issue orders to kill every Jew present in the country.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While they were discussing it, a messenger sent by the king of Ghassan to convey the news of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger to Heraclius was brought in. Having heard the news, he (Heraclius) ordered the people to go and see whether the messenger of Ghassan was circumcised. The people, after seeing him, told Heraclius that he was circumcised. Heraclius then asked him about the Arabs. The messenger replied, &#8216;Arabs also practice circumcision.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(After hearing that) Heraclius remarked that sovereignty of the &#8216;Arabs had appeared. Heraclius then wrote a letter to his friend in Rome who was as good as Heraclius in knowledge. Heraclius then left for Homs. (a town in Syrian and stayed there till he received the reply of his letter from his friend who agreed with him in his opinion about the emergence of the Prophet and the fact that he was a Prophet. On that Heraclius invited all the heads of the Byzantines to assemble in his palace at Homs. When they assembled, he ordered that all the doors of his palace be closed. Then he came out and said, &#8216;O Byzantines! If success is your desire and if you seek right guidance and want your empire to remain then give a pledge of allegiance to this Prophet (i.e. embrace Islam).&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(On hearing the views of Heraclius) the people ran towards the gates of the palace like onagers but found the doors closed. Heraclius realized their hatred towards Islam and when he lost the hope of their embracing Islam, he ordered that they should be brought back in audience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When they returned) he said, &#8216;What already said was just to test the strength of your conviction and I have seen it.&#8217; The people prostrated before him and became pleased with him, and this was the end of Heraclius&#8217;s story (in connection with his faith).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah radhiallahu `anhu has said that the Messenger of Allah sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam mentioned a man of the Bani Israel saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He asked another to lend him a thousand dinars. The lender asked him to bring witnesses but the borrower said, &#8220;Allah is sufficient as a witness.&#8221; The lender asked him to furnish a surety but the borrower again asserted, &#8220;Allah is sufficient as a surety.&#8221; The lender agreed, &#8220;You are correct,&#8221; and lent him money for a specified period.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The debtor went across the sea. When he had finished his work, he looked for a conveyance to take him back for the punctual repayment of his debt, but he did not find any conveyance. So he took a piece of wood and made a hole in it. He inserted in it the one thousand dinars and a letter to the lender and closed the hole tightly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He took the piece of wood to the sea and said, &#8220;O Allah! You know well that I took a loan of one thousand dinars from so-and-so. He demanded a surety from me but I told him that Allah&#8217;s surety was enough and he accepted Your Guarantee. He then demanded a witness and I told him that Allah was sufficient as a witness. No doubt I have tried much to find a conveyance so that I might pay back his money but could not find one, so I hand this money over to you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saying that, he threw the piece of wood into the sea till it went far out into it, and then he went away. Meanwhile he kept looking for a conveyance to take him to the lender&#8217;s place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One day, the lender came out of his house to see whether a ship had arrived bringing his money, and all of a sudden, he saw a piece of wood in which was the money. He took it home to use as firewood. When he sawed it, he found his money and the letter inside it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shortly after that, the debtor came with a thousand dinars and said, &#8220;By Allah! I had been trying to get a boat so I could bring you your money but failed to get one before the one I have come by.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The lender said, &#8220;Allah has delivered on your behalf the money you sent in the piece of wood. So you may keep your thousand dinars and go, guided on the right path.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~ <strong>Sahih Bukhari</strong></p>
