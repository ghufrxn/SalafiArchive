<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">7- The most authentic books on “Aqidah</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Q: Please guide me to the most authentic book on true Islamic Aqidah (creed)! May Allah grant you success!</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">A: The most authentic, noblest and greatest book dealing with the subject of Aqidah and other subjects is <strong>the Glorious Qur&#8217;an</strong>. It contains the most truthful speech. </span><span style="color:#000000;">No falsehood can approach it from before or behind it. It is a revelation from Allah, the All-Wise, the Praiseworthy. I advise the inquirer and all Muslims to hold fast to the Qur&#8217;an and to give it due attention by reciting it often, reflecting on its meanings and trying hard to memorize as many chapters of it as possible. It is the Greatest Book which Allah has sent down to His servants so that they may memorize it, follow its teachings and act upon it. It contains plain truths and clear guidance. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states, «<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Verily, this Qur’an guides to that which is most just and right</strong></span>» </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">He (Glorified be He) also says,« <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>it is an honourable well-fortified respected Book (because it is Allah’s Speech, and He has protected it from corruption)</strong></span>» «<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it: (it is) sent down by the All-Wise, Worthy of all praise (Allah azza wa jal)</strong></span></span>».<span style="color:#000000;"> and: «<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We have sent down to you the Book (the Qur’an) as an exposition of everything, a guidance, a mercy, and glad tidings for those who have submitted themselves (to Allah as Muslims)</span></strong>.»</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">I thus advise the inquirer to care for this Great Book, recite it frequently, ponder over its meanings, study it together with colleaques and fellows, and refer to reliable books of Tafsir (exegesis of the meanings of the Qur&#8217;an), such as the book entitled <strong>&#8220;Adwa&#8217; Al-Bayan&#8221;</strong> for Al-Baghawy, <strong>Tafsir Ibn Kathir </strong>(may Allah be merciful to them all), and the like. They may also refer to commentaries of other Mufassirs (exegetes of the Qur&#8217;an) who clarified the meanings of the Ayahs of the Qur&#8217;an, citing related Hadiths of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">I advise you my fellow brother to study the Book of Allah and to pay due concern to the <strong>Sunnah</strong> (whatever reported from the Prophet) of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), which contains guidance and light. You may refer to such books as <strong>Sahih Al-Bukhari</strong>, <strong>Sahih Muslim</strong> and the remaining four collections of Hadith (<strong>Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhi, Al-Nasa&#8217;i, and Ibn Majah</strong>). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">There are also many other books which </span><span style="color:#000000;">explain the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him), including the <strong>Muwatta&#8217; of Imam Malik</strong> (may Allah be merciful to him), the <strong>Sunan of Al-Darimi</strong> (may Allah be merciful to him), the <strong>Sahih of Ibn Khuzaymah</strong>, the <strong>Sahih of Ibn Hibban</strong>, <strong>Al-Hakim</strong> and other books which are very beneficial. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">If you have some knowledge of Hadith, you will be able to differentiate between authentic and false Hadiths cited in the books referred to above. The Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) are an exception to this. The Muslim Ummah (community) has unanimously agreed on the authenticity of all the Hadiths compiled in them. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">You are also advised to follow in the footsteps of the righteous scholars of Hadith. The Two Sahih Books of Hadith have gained the credibility of AhI-ul- Sunnah wal-Jama ‘ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream). The Muslim Ummah has also acknowledged them as authentic. Therefore, you must adhere to them tenaciously. You must also hold fast to the Book of Allah, the remaining four books of Sunan and the books we just mentioned. Scholars of Hadith have pointed out weak Hadiths and have given reasons for their weakness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">As for books on the topic of “Aqidah, they are many. One of the best books in this regard is the <strong>&#8220;Kitab Al-Tawhid&#8221; by Ibn Khuzaymah</strong>, <strong>&#8220;Kitab Al-Sunnah&#8221; by *Abdullah Ibn Ahmad Ibn Hanbal</strong>, <strong>&#8220;Minhaj Al-Sunnah&#8221;, by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah</strong>, which refutes the claims of the Mutazilites, and <strong>&#8220;Zad Al-Ma‘ad&#8221; by Ibn Al-Qayyim</strong>, knowing that the latter is very good reference in the field of “Aqidah and rulings of Shariah (Islamic Law). Other books include <strong>&#8220;Ijtima Al-Juyush Al-Islamiyyah&#8221; by Ibn Al-Qayyim</strong> which refutes the claims of innovators in religious matters, &#8220;<strong>Al-Sawa ‘iq Al-Mursalah&#8221; by Ibn Al-Qayyim</strong>, which also involves refutation of the claims of innovators in religious matters, and <strong>&#8220;Al- Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah&#8221; by Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah</strong>. This is a concise book which involves great benefit to Muslims. It is in line with the guidance of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama ‘ah, and Shaykh- ul-Islam advised all Muslims, particularly seekers of knowledge, to memorize it, as it contains clear illustration of the doctrine of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama ‘ah. Shaykh-ul-Islam also authored a book entitled <strong>&#8220;Al-Risalah Al-Hamawiyyah&#8221;</strong> which answers questions posed by the people of Hamah </span><span style="color:#000000;">concerning proper understanding of Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes, and other questions related to Aqidah. Upon visiting the people of Tadmur, he also wrote an epistle which he entiteled <strong>&#8220;Al-Risalah Al-Tadmuriyyah&#8221;.</strong> It is a great piece which clarifies sound Aqidah. There is also a book entitled &#8220;<strong>Al- Aqidah Al-Tahawiyyah&#8221; by Imam Al- Izz</strong>. It is wonderfully written. There is also another book called <strong>&#8220;Kitab Al-Tawhid&#8221; written by Shaykh-ul-Islam Muhammad Ibn Abdul-Wahhab</strong> (may Allah be merciful to him), which is a valuable book. He also wrote <strong>“At-Thatlathat Al-Usul&#8221;</strong>. He also wrote a short treatise on Aqidah. Another book called <strong>&#8220;Fat-h Al-Majid Sharh Kitab Al-Tawhid&#8221;</strong> was written by his grandson Shaykh ‘Abdul-Rahman Ibn Hasan Ibn Al-Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Abdul-Wahhab. It is a great and useful book. The book was annotated by Shaykh Sulayman Ibn ‘Abdullah Ibn Muhammad Ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhab. He titled it &#8220;<strong>Taysir Al- Aziz Al-Hamid li-Sharh Kitab Al-Tawhid</strong>&#8220;. It is also a great and useful book.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">I advise all Muslims to refer to and benefit from these and other beneficial books on the subject of Aqidah. I again stress the fact that the Qur&#8217;an is the greatest, noblest and most truthful of all books. It is the greatest remedy for those who seek healing for their souls. The Salaf (righteous predecessors) did not have any other book except the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). The Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) and the Tabi‘un (Followers, the generation after the Companions of the Prophet) had only the Glorious Qur&#8217;an and the Hadiths of the Prophet (peace be upon him), and they were sufficient for them. They contain every type of guidance. However, there is nothing wrong in referring to the books of well known and reliable scholars as has been mentioned.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">There is no harm in making use of their writings, benefiting from them or calling other people to benefit from them. Some people may not trust their own understanding of the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah, and when they refer to books written by reliable scholars and such references happen to be in conformity with their understanding, their knowledge is further enhanced and their hearts are set at ease. Allah alone grants success.</span></p>

<h2></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قُل لَّوْ كَانَ الْبَحْرُ مِدَاداً لِّكَلِمَـتِ رَبِّى لَنَفِدَ الْبَحْرُ قَبْلَ أَن تَنفَدَ كَلِمَـتُ رَبِّى وَلَوْ جِئْنَا بِمِثْلِهِ مَدَداً </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: &#8220;If the sea were ink for the Words of my Lord, surely, the sea would be exhausted before the Words of my Lord would be finished, even if We brought like it for its aid.</strong></span>&#8221; [Surah Kahf 18:109]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#003300;"><strong>[Tafseer Ibn Kathir]</strong></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Words of the Lord can never be finished</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says: `<strong>Say, O Muhammad, if the water of the sea were ink for a pen to write down the words, wisdom and signs of Allah, the sea would run dry before it all could be written down.</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَوْ جِئْنَا بِمِثْلِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(even if We brought like it)</strong> means, another sea, then another, and so on, additional seas to be used for writing. The Words of Allah would still never run out. As Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَوْ أَنَّمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ مِن شَجَرَةٍ أَقْلَامٌ وَالْبَحْرُ يَمُدُّهُ مِن بَعْدِهِ سَبْعَةُ أَبْحُرٍ مَّا نَفِدَتْ كَلِمَاتُ اللَّهِ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if all the trees on the earth were pens and the sea </strong>(were ink)<strong>, with seven seas behind it to increase it, yet the Words of Allah would not be exhausted. Verily, Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.</strong></span>) (31:27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said, &#8220;<strong>The parable of the knowledge of all of mankind, in comparison to the knowledge of Allah, is that of a drop of water in comparison to all of the oceans</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah revealed that:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قُل لَّوْ كَانَ الْبَحْرُ مِدَاداً لِّكَلِمَـتِ رَبِّى لَنَفِدَ الْبَحْرُ قَبْلَ أَن تَنفَدَ كَلِمَـتُ رَبِّى</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: &#8220;If the sea were ink for the Words of my Lord, surely, the sea would be exhausted before the Words of my Lord would be finished,</strong></span>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says that even if those oceans were ink for the Words of Allah, and all the trees were pens, the pens would be broken and the water of the sea would run dry, and the Words of Allah would remain, for nothing can outlast them. For no one can comprehend the greatness of Allah or praise Him as He deserves to be praised, except the One Who praises Himself. Our Lord is as He says He is and He is beyond what we can say. The blessings of this world, the beginning and end of it, in comparison to the blessings of the Hereafter, are like a mustard seed compared to the entire world.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning:<strong><span style="color:#008000;"> And remember when Allaah took a covenant from those who were given the Scripture to make it clear to the people, and not hide it; but they cast it behind their backs, and they purchased thereby some paltry gain. So evil is that which they purchased</span></strong>.]] [Soorah Aali `Imraan (3): 187]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Shaikh `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Naasir as-Sa&#8217;dee- <em>rahimahullaah</em>-said in his Tafseer of the Aayah:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Covenant (<em>al-Meethaaq</em>) is the weighty, emphatic covenant; and Allaah-the Most High-took this Covenant from everyone to whom He gave the Book, and whom He taught knowledge to; that they should clarify to the people whatever they are in need of from that which Allaah taught him, and that they should not hide that, nor be miserly with them regarding it &#8211; particularly if they ask him about it, or when something occurs which necessitates that. So in such a situation it is obligatory upon everyone who possesses knowledge that he clearly explains it to the people, and clarifies the truth from falsehood. So as for those guided to correctness by Allaah, then they carry this out in the most complete manner, and they teach the people that which Allaah has taught them, seeking the Pleasure of their Lord, and out of compassion for the creation, and from fear of the sin of hiding the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who were given the Scripture, from the Jews and the Christians and their like, then they cast this agreement and this covenant behind their backs. They took no notice of it. So they hid the truth and they put forth falsehood. They boldly violated the prohibitions laid down by Allaah; and they neglected the rights of Allaah and the rights of the creation. Through concealing the truth they purchased a paltry gain- which is what they acquire, if they acquire anything, from positions of authority and trivial wealth; from their lowly ones- from those who follow their desires, and who give precedence to their desires over the truth.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> فَبِئْسَ مَا يَشْتَرُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So evil is that which they bought</strong></span>]]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">since it is the most wretched exchange. They turned away from clarifying the truth, which is something which brings about eternal bliss, and religious and worldly benefits – the most tremendous and exalted goals. So they only chose that which is lowly and despicable over that which is lofty and precious because of their wretchedness and degradation, and because they are not fitting for anything other than that which they were created for.”</p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Fourth Treatise: The Three Fundamental Principles Which it is Obligatory to Have Knowledge of.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First Fundamental Principle: Knowledge and Awareness of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَإِذَا قِيلَ لَكَ مَا هي الأُصُولُ الثلاثةُ التي تجبُ معرفتُها؟ فقُلْ معرِفةُ العبدِ رَبَّهُ، ودينَهُ، ونبيَّهُ محمدًا صلى الله عليه وسلم</span><strong> </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>So if it is said to you, “What are the three fundamental principles which must be known?”, then say, “The servant’s knowledge of his Lord, and his Religion, and his Prophet Muhammad</strong> <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>.</span> <strong><sup>1</sup> </strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong>[1]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong><em>al-U<u>s</u>ool </em>(fundamental principles)</strong>”, this is the plural of <em>a<u>s</u>l </em>which is that which something else is built upon. And the word <em>far’ </em>(branch or detail) is that which is built upon something else. Therefore these (matters) are called <em>u<u>s</u>ool </em>because other matters from the religion are built upon them. Therefore they are called <em>u<u>s</u>ool </em>because the matter of the religion is built upon them. And the whole of the religion pivots upon these three fundamentals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#000000;">معرِفةُ العبدِ رَبَّهُ </span>“The servant’s knowledge of his Lord”</strong>: <em>Rabbahu </em>(his Lord) is in the accusative case because it is the object of <em>ma’rifah </em>(knowledge) because the verbal noun <em>ma’rifah </em>(knowledge) is attached to the active particle <em>‘abd </em>(servant). And the verbal noun, if attached to something, acts in the manner of its verb according to the scholars of the Arabic grammar. So the verbal noun here is attached and acts in the manner of the verb.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And his Religion and his Prophet”</strong>: This is joined – meaning: to the <em>man<u>s</u>oob </em>(accusative). These are the fundamentals of the religion in general, and their details will follow in the speech of the Shaykh <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah </em>if Allaah wishes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why are these three fundamental principles specifically mentioned? Because they are the foundations of the religion of Islaam and because they are the matters about which the servant will be asked when he is placed in his grave. (This is) because the servant when he is placed in his grave and earth has been laid over him and the people have departed from him returning to their families, then two angels will come to him in the grave and his soul will be returned to his body and he will be given the life of the <em>barzakh</em> (transitional period between this life and the Hereafter); it is not a life like the life of this world. It is a life which Allaah knows best about. So they will make him sit up in his grave and they will say to him, “Who is your Lord and what is your religion and who is your prophet?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the believer will say, “My Lord is Allaah and my religion is Islaam and Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> is my prophet.” So it will be said to him, “How did you know that?” So he will say, “I read the Book of Allaah so I understood it and I knew.” So then a caller will call out, “My servant has spoken the Truth.” So they will lay out for him a bed from Paradise and there will open for him a door to Paradise and his grave will be extended for him as far as the eye can see and the fragrance of Paradise and its gentle breeze will come upon him. So he will look to his living place in Paradise and he will say, “O my Lord, establish the Hour so that I can return to my family and my wealth.”<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the doubter who lived upon misgivings and doubt and lack of certainty even if he claimed to be upon Islaam, if he had doubts and misgivings about the Religion of Allaah like the <em>munaafiq </em>(hypocrite) he will stutter. So when they say to him, “Who is your Lord?” He will say, “I don’t know.” And when they say, “What is your Religion?” He will say, “I don’t know.” And when it is said: “Who is your Prophet?” He will say, “I don’t know. Haah, haah, I don’t know, I heard the people saying something so I said it.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by al Bukhaaree in abridged from the <u>h</u>adeeth of Anas (1338) and Muslim (2870).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: that in the <em>dunyaa </em>(world) he would just say whatever the people said, without having <em>eemaan </em> &#8211; and Allaah’s refuge is sought. This hypocrite who outwardly displayed Islaam, whilst he did not believe it in his heart; rather he outwardly showed it to gain worldly benefits, so he said in the world, “My Lord is Allaah”, but he did not truly believe it; his heart denied it, and Allaah’s refuge is sought. He used to say, “My religion is Islaam”, but he did not have <em>eemaan </em>in Islaam; his heart denied it! He used to say, “My prophet is Mu<u>h</u>ammad<em> <u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>”, but he did not truly believe in the messengership of Mu<u>h</u>ammad in his heart! Rather he said it upon his tongue only  &#8211; this is the <em>munaafiq </em>(hypocrite). So it will be said to him: “You did not know and you did not read!” So he will be struck with an iron sledgehammer which will cause him to scream in such a manner that if men and jinn were to hear it, they would drop down dead. It will be heard by everything except for mankind; if he were to hear it he would drop down dead – meaning, he would die from terror. He will be crushed in his grave until his ribs cross over and a gate to the Fire will be opened for him and its fierce and poisonous wind will come upon him and its heat. And he will say, “O my Lord, do not establish the Hour!” This will be his life and his condition in the grave &#8211; and Allaah’s refuge is sought – because he did not give the correct answer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore a caller will call out, “My servant has lied”. So they will lay out for him a bed from the Fire and they will open for him a door to the Fire  &#8211; and Allaah’s refuge is sought. So since these matters are this important it is obligatory upon us to learn them and to hold them as our creed and belief. And it is not sufficient just to learn them alone; rather we learn them and we hold them as our creed, and we have <em>eemaan </em>in them and we act upon them for as long as we live, hoping that Allaah makes us firm at the questioning in the grave. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يُثَبِّتُ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا بِالْقَوْلِ الثَّابِتِ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا وَفِي الْآخِرَةِ ۖ وَيُضِلُّ اللَّهُ الظَّالِمِينَ ۚ وَيَفْعَلُ اللَّهُ مَا يَشَاءُ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah makes firm those who truly believe with the firm saying in the life of this world and in the Hereafter. And Allaah misguides the disbelieving wrongdoers. And Allaah does whatever He wishes. </strong></span>[14:27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these three fundamental principles have tremendous importance, and therefore the Shaykh focused upon them in this treatise and he clarified them so that we should study them and carefully examine them and so that we should hold them as our creed and belief and act upon them hoping that Allaah should make us and you firm with the firm saying in the life of this world and in the Hereafter.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/knowledge-comes-before-speech-and-action" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<h3>:وَقَالَ البُخَارِيُّ رَحِمَهُ اللهُ: بَابٌ: العِلْمُ قَبْلَ القَوْلِ وَالعَمَلِ. وَالدَّلِيلُ قَوْلُهُ تَعَالَى</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And al-Bukhaaree <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaahuta‘aalaa</em> said: “Chapter: Knowledge comes before speech and action; and the proof is:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَاعْلَمْ أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَاسْتَغْفِرْ لِذَنبِكَ وَلِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَاتِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Then know that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and seek forgiveness for your sin and for the believers.</span> </strong>[47:19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong>So He began with knowledge”, before speech and action.<sup>13</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13]: S<strong>haykh Salih Al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhaaree: he was the Imaam Mu<u>h</u>ammad ibn Ismaa‘eel ibn Ibraaheem al-Bukhaaree. Al-Bukhaaree is an ascription to Bukhaaraa, a town in the East. He was the Imaam of the people of <em><u>H</u>adeeth</em>, and a mountain of memorization, may Allaah have mercy upon him, he was the compiler of the <em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em>, which is the most authentic of books after the Book of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “Knowledge comes before speech and action”: because action will not benefit unless it is built upon knowledge. As for action which is built upon ignorance, then it will not benefit the person rather it will be an affliction and misguidance for him on the Day of Resurrection, so precedence must be given to learning knowledge before action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “And the proof”: meaning for this heading is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَاعْلَمْ أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَاسْتَغْفِرْ لِذَنبِكَ وَلِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَاتِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then know that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and seek forgiveness for your sin </strong></span>[47:19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since He began with knowledge, and His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَاسْتَغْفِرْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And seek forgiveness … </strong></span>[47:19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is action. So He the Perfect began with knowledge before action, because action if it is built upon ignorance then it will not benefit the person, so a person should begin with knowledge first and then act upon what he has learnt, this is the foundation.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Proof is He the Most High’s saying:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَالْعَصْرِ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الْإِنسَانَ لَفِي خُسْرٍ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">إِلَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالْحَقِّ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالصَّبْرِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">By Time. Mankind is certainly in loss. Except for those who have <em>eemaan</em> (those who truly believe) and perform righteous deeds, and enjoin one another with the truth and enjoin one another with patience.</span> [103:1-3]</strong><sup style="text-align:justify;">11</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory that you learn these four matters in detail – is there any proof for what the Shaikh has said? That it is obligatory upon us to learn these four matters, and he has promised us that he will not say anything except with a proof, so where is the proof? The proof upon that is His saying, He the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Bismillaahirra<u>h</u>maanirra<u>h</u>eem</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">By Time. Mankind is certainly in loss. Except for those who have <em>eemaan</em> </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(those who truly believe)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> and perform righteous deeds, and enjoin one another with the truth and enjoin one another with patience.</span> </strong>[103:1-3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Except for those who have <em>eemaan</em>”, <strong>this is the first matter</strong>: knowledge, because <em>eemaan</em> cannot be except through knowledge, which is awareness of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, awareness of His Prophet and awareness of the religion of Islaam with the proofs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second matter: </strong>“And they perform the righteous deeds”, this is action upon the knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third matter: </strong>“And they enjoin each other with the truth”, this is calling to the knowledge and action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The fourth matter:</strong> “And they enjoin each other with patience”, upon harm in the path of calling to knowledge and action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying, He the One free of all imperfections:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَالْعَصْرِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">By Time.</span> </strong>[103:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The, “<em>Waw</em>”, is the <em>waw-ul-qasm</em> (the <em>‘waw’</em> of an oath). And <em>Al-‘A<u>s</u>r </em>is a noun upon which an oath is sworn and it is <em>majroor</em>, and the sign that it is <em>majroor</em> is that it has a <em>kasrah</em> upon it. And what is meant is Time and a time period.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, swears by a time period and by Time, and it is something created. And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, swears by whatever He wishes from the creation, but the creation may not swear an oath except by Allaah. And Allaah does not swear an oath except by something which has importance, and which contains a Sign from His Signs, He the Perfect and Most High. So this Time, contains a lesson and has importance, and therefore Allaah swore an oath by Time, and He swore by the night when it covers, and He swore an oath by the daytime brightness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for the creation, then he may not swear an oath except by Allaah. And it is not permissible for us to swear an oath by other than Allaah. He <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu’ alaihi wa sallam </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Whoever swears an oath by other than Allaah, then he has committed unbelief or he has committed shirk.”</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said:<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Whoever is going to swear an oath, then let him swear by Allaah or let him keep silent.”</strong><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah swears by whatever he wishes and he does not swear except by something which has importance and which contains a lesson, so what is the lesson here in this Time? The lessons are tremendous, the succession of the night and the day, and how they interchange and take from each other, this one taking from that one, and that one taking from this one, and they succeed each other in this amazing ordered manner which does not vary or alter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a proof for the Ability of Allaah the Perfect and Most High. And then, whatever occurs within this Time from events and catastrophies and calamities and from favours and blessings and good things, and whatever occurs within this Time, this is from the lessons. And likewise because night and day are an arena for righteous action to be performed in. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> .. وَهُوَ الَّذِي جَعَلَ اللَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَارَ خِلْفَةً </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He </strong>(Allaah)<strong> is the One who made the night and the day to follow each other in succession …</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning they follow each other in succession, this one follows on from this one.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> لِّمَنْ أَرَادَ أَن يَذَّكَّرَ أَوْ أَرَادَ شُكُورًا ..</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">… for whoever wants to be reminded of Allaah or whoever wants to give thanks for Allaah’s favours.</span> </strong>[25:62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in some of the recitations of this <em>aayah, </em>it occurs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">… for the one who wants to remember Allaah …</span> </strong>[25:62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the night and the day are a tremendous bounty to be earned for a person who utilizes them in obedience to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and the arena for action is the night and the day, you have nothing else besides the night and the day, they are the arena for action and for good and pure earning for this world and the hereafter. So in the night and the day there are lessons and there are benefits, so therefore Allaah swore an oath by Time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is this oath sworn upon? It is His saying:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الْإِنسَانَ لَفِي خُسْرٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Mankind is certainly in loss.</span> </strong>[103:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It (Mankind) means all of the descendants of Aadam, He did not exclude anyone, neither the kings nor the leaders, nor the rich people nor the poor people, nor the free people nor the slaves, nor the males nor the females. So, “<em>Al-</em>”, in, “<em>Al-Insaan</em>”, is for <em>istighraaq</em> – to make the word all-inclusive. All of the descendants of Aadam are in loss, meaning they will be in loss and destruction if they waste this precious Time, and they utilize it in disobedience to Allaah and in doing that which will harm them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this Time which is very cheap with many people, time seems prolonged for them, they become weary and bored, and they say, “<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>We want to kill some time</strong></span>”. So they bring amusements, or they travel abroad to spend a holiday and just to spend some time somewhere, or they laugh and joke to use up time. So those people, they use it up and waste it – then it will be loss and regret upon them on the Day of Resurrection. And it could be the source of their true happiness, if only they took care of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So all of the descendants of Aadam are in loss and destruction, except for those who have the <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">four qualities</span></strong> which are: knowledge and action and calling to Allaah and having patience upon any harm which the person meets. So whoever has these four qualities will be saved from this loss.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And having <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah is not possible except through having knowledge, which is knowledge and awareness of Allaah.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"> وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they perform the righteous and correct deeds</span> </strong>[103:3]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning they perform the righteous deeds from the obligatory duties and the recommended duties. So they utilize their time in performing the righteous deeds in that which will benefit them in their religion and in their worldly life, for even worldly action contains good and can contain reward if it is done with the intention of using it as an aid upon obedience. So how about action for the hereafter. So what is important is that you do not waste the time, rather you use it in something which will be to your advantage and benefit you.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالْحَقِّ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they enjoin each other with the truth</span> </strong>[103:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They command the good and they forbid the evil and they call to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and they teach beneficial knowledge and they propagate knowledge and good amongst the people. They become callers to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"> وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالصَّبْرِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they enjoin each other with having patience.</span> </strong>[103:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They have patience upon whatever strikes them. <span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>abr</em></strong></span> in the language means <strong>restraining</strong>, and what is meant by it here is restraining oneself upon obedience to Allaah. And it is of three types:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first one is: </strong>Patience upon obedience to Allaah.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second one is: </strong>Patience in keeping away from those things which Allaah has forbidden.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third one is:</strong> Having patience with those things which Allaah has Pre-decreed to occur.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So the first:</strong> patience upon obedience to Allaah, because the person’s soul desires laziness and desires relaxation, so therefore a person must force it to have patience upon obedience and upon the prayer and upon fasting and upon <em>jihaad</em> in Allaah’s cause even though it may dislike these matters, he should cause it to have patience and he should restrain it on obedience to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And the second: </strong>patience in keeping away from those things Allaah has made forbidden. The soul desires forbidden things and desires. It inclines towards them and is attracted to them, so therefore the person must bind it and restrain it away from the forbidden things, and this requires patience, and it is not easy to prevent the soul from desires and forbidden things. Whoever does not have patience, then his soul will overcome him and incline towards forbidden things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third is: </strong>having patience with the painful things which Allaah has decreed, the calamities which strike a person, from the death of a close relative or loss of wealth or illness which befalls a person, he must have patience upon the pre-ordainment and pre-decree of Allaah and he should not become vexed and he should not become angry, rather he should restrain the tongue from wailing and forbidden lamenting and from displaying anger and he should withhold himself from vexation and he should withhold his limbs from striking the cheeks and from tearing the front-opening of the garments. This is patience upon calamities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for faults, then he should not have patience upon them, rather he should repent to Allaah and flee away from them. However, with regard to calamities which are not something which you yourself have done, rather they are from Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, He has decreed that they will occur to you as a test and a trial or as a punishment for you for sins which you have committed just as there occurs in His saying the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا أَصَابَكُم مِّن مُّصِيبَةٍ فَبِمَا كَسَبَتْ أَيْدِيكُمْ وَيَعْفُو عَن كَثِيرٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whatever calamity strikes you then it is on account of the sins which your hands have committed and Allaah pardons and does not punish, a great deal.</span> </strong>[42:30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a calamity strikes the Muslim in his self or in his wealth or in his children or his close relative or one of his brothers from the Muslims, then it is upon him to have patience and to await reward. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِينَ إِذَا أَصَابَتْهُم مُّصِيبَةٌ قَالُوا<span style="color:#008000;"> إِنَّا لِلَّهِ وَإِنَّا إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُونَ</span></span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أُولَٰئِكَ عَلَيْهِمْ صَلَوَاتٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ وَرَحْمَةٌ ۖ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُهْتَدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Those who, when a calamity strikes them they say, “Indeed we belong to Allaah and we will certainly be returning to Him”. Those people, upon them is praise from their Lord and mercy, and they are the ones who are guided.</span> [2:156-157]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is patience, and from that is having patience upon harm which comes in calling to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, for that is from the calamities. So it is upon you to have patience upon whatever you meet from harm upon the path of good. And do not turn away from doing good, because some people wish to do good, however, if something which he dislikes faces him he then says, “It is not obligatory upon me to enter myself into these matters”. Then he abandons teaching if he is a teacher, he abandons calling to Allaah, he abandons giving the <em>khu<u>t</u>bah</em> if he is a <em>kha<u>t</u>eeb</em> (one who gives the <em>khu<u>t</u>bah</em> in a mosque), he abandons leading the prayer in the mosque, he abandons commanding the good and forbidding the evil – this person has not had patience upon the harm which came to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if you are upon error, then it is upon you to turn back to the truth and to correctness, but if you are upon  something true and you have not erred, then it is upon you to have patience and to await and expect reward and to be aware and to feel that this is in the cause of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and that you will receive reward for it, and that you remember the harm which occurred to the Prophets <em>‘alaihimu<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam </em>and how they had patience and how they strove and fought in Allaah’s cause, until Allaah the Mighty and Majestic gave them victory.</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قَالَ الشَّافِعِيُّ رَحِمَهُ اللهُ:<span style="color:#808000;"> لَوْ مَا أَنْزَلَ اللهُ حُجَّةً عَلَى خَلْقِهِ إِلاَّ هَذِهِ السُّوْرَةَ لَكَفَتْهُمْ</span></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ash-Shaafi‘ee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said: “<strong>If Allaah had not sent down any proof upon his creation except this <em>soorah</em>, then that would have sufficed for them</strong>.”<sup>12</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “Ash-Shaafi‘ee”: He is the Imaam Mu<u>h</u>ammad ibn Idrees Ash-Shaafi‘ee and Ash-Shaafi‘ee is an ascription to his great great grandfather who was called Shaafi‘, and he was from Quraish from Banul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib. He died in the year 204 H, and he was one of the four Imaams. And he said this saying, because Allaah has made clear in this <em>soorah</em> the reasons for wretchedness and the means for true happiness and success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the means for true happiness and success is that the person has these four characteristics: knowledge, and action, and calling, and having patience upon harm in the cause of Allaah the Most High. So Allaah’s proof is established upon His creation through this <em>soorah</em>. Allaah the Perfect says to them &#8211; I have made clear to you the means for true happiness in this short and brief <em>soorah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Qur’aan, all of it, and the Sunnah are details for these four matters. However, this <em>soorah</em> has made clear the means to true happiness and success in general terms, through it the proof has been established upon the creation, and the texts of the Qur’aan and the Sunnah give the details and clarify these four matters. And the speech of Ash-Shaafi‘ee does not mean that this <em>soorah</em> is sufficient for mankind, even if Allaah had not sent down anything else. But rather it has established the proof upon them, because Allaah has made clear in it the means to true happiness and the reasons for total wretchedness, so on the Day of Resurrection no-one can say, “I did not know the means to true happiness and I did not know the reasons leading to total wretchedness”, when he has read this brief and short <em>soorah</em>.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<h3><strong>Calling to the Knowledge</strong></h3>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الثَّالِثَةُ: الدَّعْوَةُ إِلَيْهِ<sup> </sup><span style="font-size:10px;vertical-align:super;"> </span></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The third is calling to it.<sup>9</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>Calling to it</strong>”: meaning, it is not sufficient that a person learns knowledge and acts himself and does not call to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. Rather he must call and invite others so that he benefits himself and benefits others, and because this knowledge is something he is entrusted with, it is not your personal property which you can hoard away and withhold from the people, when the people are in need of it. So what is obligatory upon you is to convey it and to explain it and to call the people to good. This knowledge, which Allaah has given you the task of carrying, is not an endowment for your benefit alone, rather it is for you and for others besides you, so do not keep it to yourself and prevent the people from benefiting from it. Rather it is essential that you convey it and you must clarify it to the people. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِذْ أَخَذَ اللَّهُ مِيثَاقَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ لَتُبَيِّنُنَّهُ لِلنَّاسِ وَلَا تَكْتُمُونَهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And when Allaah took the solemn agreement from those who were given the scripture, you must make it clear to the people and not conceal it</span> </strong>[3:187]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a solemn agreement which Allaah took from the <em>‘ulemaa</em> (people of knowledge) that they would make clear to the people that which Allaah has taught them, in order that the good should spread, and to bring the people out from the depths of darkness into light, and this was the work of the Messengers and of those who followed them. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ هَٰذِهِ سَبِيلِي أَدْعُو إِلَى اللَّهِ ۚ عَلَىٰ بَصِيرَةٍ أَنَا وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَنِي ۖ وَسُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَمَا أَنَا مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say: “This is my way, I call to Allaah upon clear knowledge, I and those who follow me, and Perfect is Allaah and I am not from the people of <em>shirk</em> (those who associate others with Allaah).”</span> </strong>[12:108]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the way of Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu’alaihiwasallam </em>and the way of his followers: knowledge, and action and calling to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. So whoever does not call, and he has the ability to call, and he has knowledge and he conceals it, then he will be given a bridle of fire on the Day of Resurrection as occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Aboo Daawood and At-Tirmidhee and Ibn Maajah from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah who said: Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu’alaihiwasallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong> “Whoever is asked about knowledge and he conceals it, then Allaah will give him a bridle of fire on the Day of Resurrection”. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Albaanee declared this <u>h</u>adeeth <u>h</u>asan <u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Ibn Maajah reports a longer wording from Aboo Sa‘eed Al-Khudree … [declared very weak by Al-Albaanee].</p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Having patience upon harm which is encountered whilst carrying this out.</strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong><span style="color:#993300;">الرَّابِعَةُ: الصَّبْرُ عَلَى الأَذَى فِيهِ<sup>  </sup></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><sup> </sup>The fourth is having patience upon any harm encountered whilst carrying it out.<sup>10</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>Having patience upon any harm encountered whilst carrying it out</strong>”: it is known that whoever calls the people, and commands the good and forbids the evil, then he will be exposed to harm from the evil-doers, because many of the people do not want good, rather they want desires and forbidden things and false whims, so when someone comes who calls them to Allaah and who deters them away from their desires, then there will certainly be a reaction from them either in speech or in action. So what is obligatory upon whoever calls to Allaah and desires the Face of Allaah is that he should have patience upon the harm, and he should persist in calling to Allaah, and his example in that regard will be the Messengers <em>‘alaihimu<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em>, and the best of them and their seal is Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ’alaihi wasallam.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What did he encounter from the people, how much harm did he suffer in sayings and actions? They said he was a sorcerer and a liar, and they said he was a madman. They said those sayings about him which Allaah the Mighty and Majestic has mentioned in the Qur’aan. And they harmed him with physical harm, they threw stones at him until his heels ran with blood <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ’alaihi wasallam</em> when he called them to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. And they threw the after-birth of camels on his back whilst he was making prostration by the Ka‘bah, and they threatened to kill him and they tried to intimidate him, and in the battle of U<u>h</u>ud, there occurred to him and to his Companions that which occurred <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> – they broke his lateral incisor tooth and they wounded his head <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ’alaihi wasallam</em> and he fell into a ditch, and he was the Prophet of Allaah – all of this was harm in calling to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. However he had patience and he bore it and he was the most excellent one of the creation <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em>. So therefore whoever carries out this call will certainly face harm in accordance with the level of his <em>eemaan</em> and his call, however it is upon him to have patience as long as he is upon the truth, then he should have patience and bear it, for he is in Allaah’s cause, and whatever harm befalls him then it will be reward from Allaah the Perfect and Most High, upon the scale of his good deeds.</p>

<p><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F422807028&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> </strong>الثَّانِيَةُ: العَمَلُ بِهِ  <sup> </sup></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The second: Action upon it.<sup>8</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “Action upon it”: meaning upon the knowledge, since it is not sufficient that a person teaches and learns, rather he must act upon his knowledge. So knowledge without action is just a proof against the person, so knowledge will not be beneficial except with action. As for the person who has knowledge, and he does not act upon it, then he is one upon whom is Anger, because he knows the truth, but he abandons it upon knowledge and insight.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the poet says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>The scholar who does not act upon his knowledge,<br />
</em><em>                        Will be punished before the worshippers of idols</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is mentioned in the noble hadeeth:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إن من أول من تسعر ﺑﻬم النار يوم القيامة ، عالم لم يعمل بعلمه<em> </em></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“That from the first of those for whom the Fire will be made to blaze on the Day of Resurrection will be a scholar who does not act upon his knowledge”.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowledge is joined to action, and action is the fruit of knowledge, so knowledge without action is like a tree without fruit, there is no benefit in it, and knowledge was sent down to bring about action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as action without knowledge will be an affliction and misguidance for its person. If a person acts without knowledge, then his action will be affliction and a burden upon the person. He <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ’alaihi wasallam </em>said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">من عمل عملا ليس عليه أمرنا فهو رد</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Whoever does an action which our affair is not in accordance with, then it will be rejected”.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore we read in <em>Al-Faati<u>h</u>ah</em> in every <em>rak’ah:</em></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">اهْدِنَا الصِّرَاطَ الْمُسْتَقِيمَ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">صِرَاطَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا الضَّالِّينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Guide us upon the straight path, the path of those whom You have favoured, not those upon whom is Your Anger, nor those who are astray.</span> [1:6-7]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah called those people who act without knowledge those who are astray; and those people who have knowledge, but do not act upon it as being those upon whom is Anger. So let us be attentive to that, because it is very important.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a>  A similar <u>h</u>adeeth is reported by At-Tirmidhee, and it is part of a long <u>h</u>adeeth, and it contains the wording, “<strong>Those three people will be  the first of the creation for whom Allaah will make the Fire blaze on the Day of Resurrection</strong>”, from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu ‘anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[However the wording of the <u>h</u>adeeth mentions three men, who will be the first for whom the Fire will blaze – “<strong>So the first of these men will be a person who gathered the Qur’aan…</strong>”. Al-Albaanee declares this <u>h</u>adeeth <u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a>  Reported by al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree in disconnected form as <u>h</u>adeeth 7350, and reported by Muslim as <u>h</u>adeeth 1718/18 from a <u>h</u>adeeth of ‘Aa’ishah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu ‘anhaa. </em>And also reported by al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree in connected form as <u>h</u>adeeth 2697 and Muslim as <u>h</u>adeeth 1718/17 from ‘Aa’ishah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu ‘anhaa, </em>that she said, Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ’alaihi wasallam </em>said, “<strong>Whoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it will have it rejected</strong>”.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَهُوَ مَعْرِفَةُ اللهِ ، <sup> </sup>وَمَعْرِفَةُ نَبِيِّهِ <sup>  </sup></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><sup> </sup>And it is knowledge and awareness of Allaah and knowledge of His Prophet<sup>5</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And it is knowledge and awareness of Allaah</strong>”: How does the servant come to have knowledge and awareness of his Lord? He knows of Him through His Signs and His created things, so from His Signs are the night and the day, and from those things which He has created are the sun and the moon, as will be explained later on <em>inshaa’ Allaah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He knows of Allaah by means of His <strong><em>Aayaat-ul-Kawneeyah</em></strong> (Signs within the creation) and His <strong><em>Aayaat-ul-Qur’aaneeyah</em></strong> (The aayahs of His Qur’aan). If he recites the Qur’aan, then He knows that Allaah the Perfect and Most High – He is the One who created the heavens and the earth and that He is the One who made subservient whatever is within the heavens and the earth, and that He is the One who gives life and gives death, and that He has full Ability over everything, and that He is <em>Ar-Ra<u>h</u>maan </em>the Extremely Merciful One, and <em>Ar-Ra<u>h</u>eem</em> the One Who bestows mercy. So the Qur’aan provides knowledge and awareness of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and that He is the One Who bestowed all favours upon us, and that He is the One who created us and gives us provision, so if you recite the Qur’aan, then you will know your Lord, the Perfect and Most High, by way of His Names and His Attributes and His Actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if you look into the creation, then you will know and be aware of your Lord, the Perfect and Most High – that He is the One Who created this creation, and who made this creation subservient, and Who caused it to proceed by His Wisdom and His Knowledge – He the Perfect and Most High; this is knowledge of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And knowledge of His Prophet</strong>”: he is Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ’alaihi wa sallam</em>, because he was the one who conveyed the message from Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, he is the intermediary between us and Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, with regard to conveying the message, so therefore it is essential that you know him, you know who he is, and you know his lineage, and you know his city, and you know that which he <em>sallallaahu ’alaihi wa sallam</em> came with. That you know how the revelation first came to him, and how he established the call to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, in Makkah and in Al-Madeenah. That you know the life history of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ’alaihi wa sallam </em> even if it is in abridged form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ’alaihi wa sallam</em>, he is Mu<u>h</u>ammad the son of ‘Abdullaah, the son of ‘Abdul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib, the son of Haashim, the son of ‘Abd-Manaaf, all the way to the end of the noble Prophetic lineage, which goes all the way back to Ibraaheem <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em>. And you know how he lived before he was raised as a Prophet, and how the revelation came to him from Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and what did he <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> do after his being raised as a Prophet – you know that through study of his <em>seerah </em>(of his life), and it is not befitting for the Muslim that he should be ignorant of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ’alaihi wasallam</em>. For how can you follow a person when you do not have knowledge of him? This cannot be comprehended.</p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَعْرِفَةُ دِينِ الإِسْلامِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And knowledge of the religion of Islaam<sup>6</sup></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>Knowledge of the religion of Islaam</strong>”: which is the religion of this Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ’alaihi wasallam</em>. Indeed, it is the religion of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, which He commanded His servants with, and which He commanded you to follow, and you are required to follow it, so you must have knowledge and awareness of this religion. And Islaam is the religion of all of the Messengers. All of the Messengers, their religion was Islaam, with the general meaning. So everyone who followed a Messenger from the Messengers, then he is a Muslim, one who submits in Islaam to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, one who submitted to Him and one who singled Him out with all worship – this is Islaam with the general meaning, that it is the religion of all the Messengers. So Islaam is:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الاستسلام لله بالتوحيد والانقياد له بالطاعة والخلوص من الشرك وأهله</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“To submit to Allaah with <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, and to comply to Him with obedience, and remaining free of <em>shirk</em> and its people”</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Islaam with the specific meaning, then it is that which Allaah sent His Prophet Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu’alaihiwasallam</em> with, since after the sending of the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu’alaihiwasallam</em> then there is no religion except for his religion <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatuwassalaam. </em>And Islaam is confined to following him <em><u>s</u>allallaahu’alaihiwasallam, </em>so it is not possible for a Jew to now say, “I am a Muslim”, or a Christian to say, “I am a Muslim”, after the sending of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu’alaihiwasallam, </em>if he does not follow him. So Islaam, after the sending of the Prophet, is following him <em><u>s</u>allallaahu’alaihiwasallam. </em>He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Say: If you people truly love Allaah, then follow Me, then Allaah will love you [3:31]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is Islaam with its general meaning and with its specific meaning.</p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">بِالأَدِلَّةِ<sup>    </sup></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">With the proofs.<sup>7</sup></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “With the proofs”: not due to <em>taqleed</em> (blind following), but rather with the proofs from the Qur’aan and from the Sunnah – this is knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ul-Qayyim said in <em>Al-Kaafiyat-ush-Shaafiyah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Knowledge is Allaah said, His Prophet said,</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>          The Companions said – they are the possessors of knowledge and awareness</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Knowledge is not that you foolishly raise up a disagreement</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>          Between the Messenger and the opinion of so-and-so.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what is knowledge, knowledge is the knowledge contained in the Book and the Sunnah. As for the sayings of the <em>’ulemaa</em> (the scholars), then they only explain and clarify the speech of Allaah and the speech of the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu’alaihiwasallam, </em>and some of them may contain a mistake, and the proofs are not the speech of the <em>’ulemaa</em>, rather the proofs are the <em>aayahs</em> of the Qur’aan and the Prophetic <em>a<u>h</u>adeeth</em>. As for the speech of scholars, then it explains and clarifies that, except it is not a proof in itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the first matter, and it is the foundation, the Shaikh <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> began with it because it is the foundation, and one should begin with <em>‘aqeedah</em> (creed and belief), and with the foundation in learning, and in teaching, and in calling to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. <em>‘Aqeedah</em> should be begun with, because it is the fundamental basis, and it is the foundation.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>That it is obligatory upon us to learn four matters</strong></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">الأُوْلَى: العِلْمُ</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The first is knowledge<sup>4</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzan Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “knowledge”: what is meant by knowledge here, is <strong><em>al-‘ilm ash-shar‘ee</em></strong> the legislated (islaamic) knowledge, because that is what it is obligatory to learn, and these matters are obligatory to learn upon every Muslim, male or female, free or slave, rich or poor, a king or a pauper, every Muslim, it is obligatory upon him that he should learn these four matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is what the scholars call <strong><em>al-waajib al-‘aynee</em></strong>, and it is what is obligatory upon every individual from the Muslims. So the five obligatory prayers which are upon the men and the  women, and the congregational prayer in the mosques, which is upon the men, this is obligatory upon every individual from the Muslims, that he learns about them. Therefore he said, “it is obligatory upon us”, and he did not say, “it is obligatory upon some of us”, rather he said, “it is obligatory upon us”, meaning upon us the Muslims. So it is from the knowledge which it is obligatory to learn upon all individuals, because knowledge is of two categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first of them: that which it is obligatory upon all individuals to learn</strong>, such that there is no excuse for anyone to be ignorant of it, and it is that which is such that the religion cannot be correctly established except with it, such as the five pillars of Islaam which are the Two Testifications, and the establishment of the Prayer, and the giving of the <em>Zakaat, </em>and the fast of <em>Rama<u>d</u>aan, </em>and <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> to the sacred House of Allaah. It is not permissible for the Muslim to be ignorant of that, rather he must learn it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since learning the meaning of the Two Testifications, is to learn the <em>‘aqeedah </em>(creed and belief), so the Muslim learns the creed and belief in order to act upon it, and he learns whatever opposes it in order to keep away from it – this is what is contained in the Two Testifications.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise he learns the pillars of the Prayer, and the conditions of the Prayer, and the obligations of the Prayer, and the sunnahs of the Prayer; he must learn these matters in detail. It is not just the case that he can pray when he does not know the rulings of the prayer. How can a person do an action when he does not have knowledge of the action which he is performing? How can he perform the Prayer when is ignorant of its rulings? So it is essential that he learns the rulings of the Prayer, and those things which nullify the Prayer, he must learn this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise he should learn the rulings of the <em>Zakaat</em>, and he should learn the rulings of the Fasting, and he should learn the rulings of the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em>, so when he wants to perform <em><u>H</u>ajj</em>, it becomes obligatory upon him to learn the rulings of the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> and the rulings of the <em>‘Umrah</em> in order to perform these acts of worship in the prescribed and legislated manner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this category, no-one is excused for being ignorant of it, and it is what is called <em>al-waajib al-‘aynee </em>that which is obligatory upon every individual Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second category from the categories of knowledge</strong>, is that which is additional to that, from the legislated rulings which the <em>Ummah</em> (Islaamic Nation) together has need of, and it may be the case that not every individual has a need of it, such as the rulings of trading, and the rulings of dealing and transactions, and the rulings of religious endowments, and laws of inheritance and bequests and the rulings of marriages, and the rulings relating to crimes. These are essential for the <em>Ummah</em>. However it is not obligatory upon every individual from the <em>Ummah</em> that he has to learn it. Rather, if these things are learnt by sufficient number of scholars, such that what is required is attained, then that will suffice so that they can fulfill the need of the Muslims for legal judgments and for religious verdicts and for teaching and other than this. This is called <strong><em>waajib al-kifaayah</em></strong> (the communal obligation), such that if a sufficient number of people carry it out, then sin falls away from the rest, and if all of them leave it, then they will all be sinful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the <em>Ummah</em> must have people who learn this category since they are in need of it. However, it is not said to every individual, “it is obligatory upon you to acquire knowledge of these matters”, because this may not  be possible for every individual. Rather this is specific to the people of ability and the people of capability from the <em>Ummah. </em>And if this is learnt by some of the <em>Ummah</em>, then the obligation has been established, contrary to the first category, for there, every individual is accountable for it himself, because it is not possible for him to perform these actions except with knowledge. And therefore the Shaikh said, “it is obligatory upon us”, and he did not say, “it is obligatory upon the Muslims”, or, “it is obligatory upon some of the Muslims”. Rather he said, “it is obligatory upon us”, meaning upon everyone from us as an individual obligation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we should know, before entering into the matters, that what is meant by knowledge, which it is obligatory upon the <em>Ummah</em> – whether it be that which is obligatory upon every individual, or whether it be that which is obligatory upon some, then it is <strong><em>al-‘ilm ash-shar‘ee</em></strong> the legislated (islaamic) knowledge, that which the Messenger <em>sallallaahu‘alaihiwasallam</em> came with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <strong>worldly knowledge</strong>, such as the knowledge of industries, and professions, and arithmetic, and mathematics, and engineering, then this knowledge is permissible – it is permissible to learn it and it can be obligatory if the <em>Ummah</em> has need of it, then it will be obligatory on those who are capable. However, it is not the knowledge which is intended in the Qur’aan and the Sunnah, that which Allaah the Most High has praised and commended its people, and that which the Prophet <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>said about it:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">العلماء ورثة الأنبياء</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The <em>‘ulemaa</em>, (the scholars, or the people of knowledge) are the inheritors of the Prophets.”</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is meant is <em>al-‘ilm ash-shar‘ee</em> the legislated (islaamic) knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for worldly knowledge, then whoever is ignorant of it, then there is no sin upon him, and whoever learns it, then it is permissible for him, and if he utilises it to benefit the <em>Ummah</em>, then he is rewarded for it. And if a person died, and he was ignorant of this knowledge, then he would not be taken to account for it on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, whoever died and he was ignorant of <em>al-‘ilm ash-shar‘ee</em> the legislated (islaamic) knowledge, particularly essential knowledge, then he will be asked about it on the Day of Resurrection, “Why didn’t you learn? Why didn’t you ask?”. The one who says when he is placed in his grave, “My Lord is Allaah, and Islaam is my religion, and my Prophet is Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wasallam</em>”, this person will be saved.  It will be said to him, “Where did you acquire this from?”. So he will say, “I read the Book of Allaah and I learnt it”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the person who turns away from that, then when he is questioned in his grave, then he will say, “Haa, haa, I don’t know, I heard the people saying something so I said it”. Then this person, his grave will be made to blaze with fire upon him – and Allaah’s refuge is sought – and it will be crushed upon him, to such an extent that his ribs will cross over, and he will come to be in a pit from the pits of the hell-fire, because he did not have knowledge and he did not read. So it will be said to him:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">لا دريت ولا تليت )  أو لا تلوت )</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“You did not know and you did not read (or you did not follow)”.</strong><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong>So he did not learn and he did not follow the example of the people of knowledge, rather he was wasted and lost in his life, so this is the person who ends up in wretchedness, and Allaah’s refuge is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So his saying, “Knowledge”, this is the legislated knowledge that is required from us as a body and as individuals, and it is knowledge and awareness of Allaah through His Names and His Attributes, and knowledge of His right upon us, which is to worship Him alone ascribing no partner to Him, so the first thing that is obligatory upon the servant is knowledge and awareness of his Lord the Mighty and Majestic, and how to worship Him.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> This is reported by al-Bukhaaree in disconnected form in the Book of Knowledge, Chapter, “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Knowledge comes before speech and action</strong></span>”, it follows on from <u>h</u>adeeth 67; and is reported by Aboo Daawood, and ibn Maajah and at-Tirmidhee from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Ad-Dardaa <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu‘anhu.</em> [Al-Albaanee declared the <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Daawood <u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>].</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">اِعْلَمْ <sup> </sup>رَحِمَكَ اللهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Know! May Allaah have Mercy upon you</strong></span><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzan Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “Know!”, it is a word which indicates giving importance to the topic, so when he said, “Know!”, then its meaning is that the matter which he is going to put before you is a matter which is important. So this word, “Know!”, indicates the importance of the topic which he is beginning it with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the meaning of, “<strong>Know</strong>!”, Is that it is a command from, ‘<strong>knowledge</strong>’, meaning, ‘<strong>learn</strong>!’. And knowledge means: to comprehend something as it actually is, or, to perceive something in accordance with how it actually is.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To comprehend something in a manner which is contrary to how it actually is in reality, or to perceive something contrary to the reality of it, this is ignorance, and it is the opposite of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<em>May Allaah have Mercy upon you</em>”, this is a supplication for the seeker of knowledge, so the shaikh makes supplication for the student of knowledge, that Allaah has Mercy upon him, and that He the Perfect and Most High should place Mercy upon them. So this shows the kindness of the teacher towards the student, and that he should begin with good and fine speech, and with righteous supplication, so that this has an effect upon him and so that he turns attentively to his teacher.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for if the teacher begins with stern words, and with speech which is not appropriate, then this will alienate (i.e. will cause the student to flee). So what is obligatory upon the teacher and upon whoever calls to Allaah and whoever commands the good and forbids the evil is to be kind and gentle with those he addresses with making supplication for him and complimenting him and speaking with mild speech, because this is more likely to bring about acceptance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the obstinate opponent and the person who proudly refuses to accept, then there is a different way of addressing this person. Allaah the Perfect said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَا تُجَادِلُوا أَهْلَ الْكِتَابِ إِلَّا بِالَّتِي هِيَ أَحْسَنُ إِلَّا الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا مِنْهُمْ ۖ وَقُولُوا آمَنَّا بِالَّذِي أُنزِلَ إِلَيْنَا وَأُنزِلَ إِلَيْكُمْ وَإِلَٰهُنَا وَإِلَٰهُكُمْ وَاحِدٌ وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُسْلِمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And do not debate with the People of the Book except in a manner which is best, except those of them who transgress. And say we truly believe in what was sent down to us, and what was sent down to you, and our Lord whom we worship and your Lord is One, and we are Muslims in submission to Him. </strong></span>[29:46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So those who transgressed from the People of the Book and knowingly and obstinately refused the truth, and rejected the truth with pride, those people are not addressed in the manner which is finest, rather they are addressed with that which will deter them. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ جَاهِدِ الْكُفَّارَ وَالْمُنَافِقِينَ وَاغْلُظْ عَلَيْهِمْ ۚ وَمَأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ ۖ وَبِئْسَ الْمَصِيرُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O Prophet, strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be stern with them. And their final abode is the Hell-fire, and what an evil destination</span>. </strong>[9:73]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hypocrites, they are not fought against with weapons, rather <em>jihaad</em> is waged against them with proof and speech and by refuting them with sternness as a deterrent for them, and in order to deter the rest of the people away from them. And He the Most High said with regard to them:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ يَعْلَمُ اللَّهُ مَا فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ فَأَعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ وَعِظْهُمْ وَقُل لَّهُمْ فِي أَنفُسِهِمْ قَوْلًا بَلِيغًا </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And admonish them with a saying which will have an effect upon them.</span> </strong>[4:63]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a specific manner of addressing those people, because they are people who deliberately and obstinately reject, and reject from pride, and they do not want the truth, rather they want to misguide the people, so those people are addressed with that which befits them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the student who seeks guidance, then he should be spoken to with gentleness and mercy, and kindness, because he desires the truth, and he desires knowledge and he desires benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<em>Know! May Allaah have Mercy upon you</em>”, is a supplication for you for mercy, for if Allaah truly has Mercy upon you, then through that you will be blissful in this life and in the hereafter, if you enter within the Mercy of Allaah – and this is a supplication from a great scholar and a righteous man, so it is to be hoped that it will be accepted, if Allaah wishes.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Introduction to the Explanation </strong>(Sharh-ul-Usool-ith-Thalaathah)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allaah the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is for Allaah the Lord of the whole of creation and may Allaah extol and grant peace and security to our prophet Mu<u>h</u>ammad and to his true followers and to his companions, all of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to Proceed:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So before us is this treatise – the treatise “<strong>The Three Fundamental Principles</strong>” &#8211; and it is a tremendous treatise which is brief, supported by evidences from the Book of Allaah and the sunnah of his Messenger <em><u>s</u>allaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this small treatise is about a tremendous fundamental matter from the fundamentals of Islaam and it is <em>al-‘aqeedah</em> – creed and belief. And the scholars give importance to these brief works, authoring them and exerting themselves to shorten them and refine them, then they would encourage their students to memorize them so that they should remain fundamental assets for them and a store of provision for them which they can derive benefit from, and bring benefit to others by means of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And beginning with these shorter works is the foundation for the students of knowledge, so the student of knowledge should begin by learning little by little, taking from the initial points of knowledge and its fundamentals and then proceed in stages through it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these brief works are the path leading on to the longer works. So it is not possible for the longer works to be understood except after the brief works have been understood and then the person has proceeded on from them in stages. And therefore they said about the meaning of His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#333333;">وَلَٰكِن كُونُوا رَبَّانِيِّينَ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تُعَلِّمُونَ الْكِتَابَ وَبِمَا كُنتُمْ تَدْرُسُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">But rather be <em>rabbaaniyyoon</em> (wise scholars who cultivate the people) by your teaching them the Book and your studying it</span> </strong>[3:79]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word <em>rabbaaniyoon</em> &#8211; they are those who begin with the small matters of knowledge before the greater ones. They cultivate themselves and their students beginning with the smaller matters and moving on to the larger matters, and this is something natural, because all things begin from their roots and their foundations and then they grow bigger and larger after that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the person who pounces upon knowledge from its top, then this person will just tire himself out and will not attain anything. Whereas the one who begins with the fundamentals and proceeds in stages, this is the person, who by the permission of Allaah will be proceeding in the correct way and with sound direction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#333333;">يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْأَهِلَّةِ ۖ قُلْ هِيَ مَوَاقِيتُ لِلنَّاسِ وَالْحَجِّ ۗ وَلَيْسَ الْبِرُّ بِأَن تَأْتُوا الْبُيُوتَ مِن ظُهُورِهَا وَلَٰكِنَّ الْبِرَّ مَنِ اتَّقَىٰ ۗ وَأْتُوا الْبُيُوتَ مِنْ أَبْوَابِهَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They ask you about the crescent moons. Say: they are signs to mark periods of time for mankind and for the <em>hajj</em>. And righteousness in not that you enter the houses from their backs, but rather righteousness is the quality of the person who has <em>taqwaa </em>(who fears and is dutiful to Allaah). And enter houses through their proper doors. </span></strong>[2:189]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those people asked a question about the crescent moons: why does the crescent moon begin as something small and then grow larger until it becomes full, then it grows smaller until it is again a crescent? So Allaah rebukes them, and directed them towards asking about that which will benefit them, and that they should come to the houses of knowledge from their correct doors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for asking about the crescent moon and it conditions and its smallness and its largeness, then this has no benefit in it for them, rather benefit is that they ask about what they are in need of and that is awareness of the benefits of the crescent moon, and therefore He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#333333;">قُلْ هِيَ مَوَاقِيتُ لِلنَّاسِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: they are signs to mark periods of time for mankind</strong> </span>[2:189]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He explained their benefits and that is that Allaah makes them signs marking periods of time for mankind by means of which they can become aware of acts of worship and dealings and time spans and other than that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He directed them to the benefits of the crescent moons and He did not respond to their question about the reality of the crescent moons, because there was no benefit for them in that, and so that He should direct them towards what is befitting for them to ask about and it is the doors to knowledge, not the back-doors of knowledge and the superfluous unnecessary matters which they have no need of. And if they do have some need of them, then it is only a slight need.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 77 : Points 132</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Every Knowledge which worshippers claim to be from hidden inner knowledge (<em>‘Ilmul-Baatin</em>) which is not found in the Book and the Sunnah, then it  is innovation and misguidance. It is not to be acted upon by anyone nor called to </strong></span>[1].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] This is what the extreme innovators, amongst them the <em>Baatinees</em> and extreme <em>Soofees</em>, call to. They explain things away by claiming that they have an outer aspect and an inner aspect. They twist the Book of Allah and His <em>Sharee’ah</em> to suit their own desires. Their claim of receiving hidden religious knowledge, outside of the Book and the Sunnah, is disbelief.</p>

And upon you is to affirm, to submit, to surrender to and to be pleased with what is contained in this book. Do not hide this book from any one from the people of the <em>Qiblah</em>. Perhaps, by means of it, Allah may bring a confused person back from his state of confusion, or  a person of innovation back from his  innovation, or one astray back from his misguidance so that he is saved through it. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>So fear and be dutiful to Allah and adhere to the original old affair. And it is what I have described to you in this book. May Allah have mercy upon a servant, and may be mercy on his parents who reads this book, distributes it, acts upon it, calls to it and uses it as a proof for it is the religion of Allah </strong></span>[1] <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>and  the religion of Allah’s Messenger (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] The Religion of Allah, as is well known, is the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (<em>sallallaahu alihi wa sallam</em>) as understood by the Pious Predecessors. As for the speech of people, everyone is correct in some things and incorrect in others, except for the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alihi wa sallam</em>).</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 61: Point 105</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><span style="text-align:justify;">Know may Allah have mercy upon you! that whoever speaks about the religion of Allah from his opinion, analogy and interpretation, without proof from the Sunnah and the <em>Jamaa’ah</em> , then he has spoken about Allah that which he does not know </span></strong></span>[1].<span style="color:#993300;"><strong><span style="text-align:justify;"> Whoever says about Allah what he does not know is one who has overstepped the bounds (</span><em style="text-align:justify;">Mutakallifeen</em><span style="text-align:justify;">) </span></strong></span>[2].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] In the Book of Allah, speaking about Allah without knowledge is shown to be a form of Shirk. He, the One free from all defects, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: The things that my Lord has forbidden are: shameful deeds, whether open or secret, sins (of all kinds), assigning of partners to Allah for which He has given no authority and saying things about Allah of which you have no knowledge.</strong> </span>[Soorah al-A’raaf (7): 33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Masrooq (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said: We entered upon Abdullah ibn Mas’ood and he said, “O people! Whoever knows something then let him speak according to it. Whoever does not know, let him say, ‘Allah knows best,’ since this, too, is from knowledge, that you say concerning that which you do not know: ‘Allah knows best.’ Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, said to His Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: No reward do I ask of you for this </strong>(Qur’an)<strong>, nor am I a pretender</strong></span>. [Soorah Saad (38): 86]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Know that there has never been any heresy except from the ignorant rabble who follow anyone who calls out wildly. They bend with every wind that blows, so anyone who is like that has no religion. Allah, the Blessed and Most High, says:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>فَمَا اخْتَلَفُوا إِلَّا مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَهُمُ الْعِلْمُ بَغْيًا بَيْنَهُمْ</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>They did not differ until after the knowledge came to them, through envy amongst themselves.</strong></span>[Soorah al-Jaathiyah (45): 17]</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">مَا اخْتَلَفَ فِيهِ إِلَّا الَّذِينَ أُوتُوهُ مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَتْهُمُ الْبَيِّنَاتُ بَغْيًا بَيْنَهُمْ ۖ فَهَدَى اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لِمَا اخْتَلَفُوا فِيهِ مِنَ الْحَقِّ بِإِذْنِهِ</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Those to whom (the Scripture) was given only differed concerning it after clear proofs had come to them through hatred to one another </strong></span>[Soorah al-Baqarah (2): 213]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>They are the evil scholars, those greedy (for this world) and who are the innovators.</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 10 : Point 06B</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">So examine, may Allaah have mercy upon you, the speech of everyone you hear from, in your time in particular; so do not act in haste. And do not enter into anything from it, until you ask and see: Did any of the Companions of the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam speak about it or anyone from the scholars? So if you find a narration about it from them, then cling onto it and do not go beyond it for anything and do not give preference to anything over it, and thus fall into the Fire.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F362090078&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/examine-the-speech-of-everyone-you-hear-from-in-your-time-in-particular" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not be hasty regarding that which you hear from the people, particularly in later times, and the large number of people who speak and give rulings and who stand to give knowledge and speak. And particularly, with the new development in information media, that it is now the case that everyone talks foolishly and speaks in the name of knowledge and in the name of the Religion, even the people of misguidance and the deviated and the misguided sects. They now speak in the name of the Religion on satellite channels. So the danger is very great.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is upon you O Muslim, and O Student of Knowledge in particular, to verify and that you are not hasty in taking everything that you hear. It is upon you to verify and to be aware, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>who is the one who said this thing? And where did this idea come from? And then what is its basis, and its proofs from the Book and the Sunnah? Then where did this person study and who did he take knowledge from?</strong> </span>So these matters require verification, particularly in this time. So we do not accept every saying that anyone is saying, even if he speaks well, and speaks eloquently, and speaks abundantly and attracts people&#8217;s hearing, do not be taken in by it until you look and see the extent of their knowledge and understanding of the Religion that he has.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or it may be the case that a person&#8217;s speech may be little, but he is a person of understanding of the Religion. And it might also be the case that a person&#8217;s speech may be plentiful, but he is an ignorant one who has nothing from knowledge and understanding of the Religion. Rather he just has magical/enchanting speech so that he fools the people, and gives the false impression that he is a scholar and that he is a person of understanding and that he is a thinker and the likes of that, so that the people are taken in and he takes them away from the Truth. So what is counted is not the amount of speech and being able to ramble on, rather what is counted is what it contains with regard to knowledge and what it contains with regard to being based upon correct principles. And it may be the case with speech that is little but it is correctly based upon correct principles. This will be far more beneficial than abundant speech which is just lengthy, and from which no benefit can be taken except a little. And this is the situation in our time, where speech is abundant and knowledge is scarce; the recitors are many, and the people of knowledge and understanding (fuqahaa·) are few in number. And fiqh (knowledge and understanding of the Religion) does not come about by being able to speak a great deal, or to recite a great deal, or being able to speak well or being able to word things well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Poet said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Embellished (falsely adorned) speech may make its falsehood seem attractive,</em><br />
<em> Whereas the Truth, may suffer as a result of being badly expressed.</em><br />
<em> So you may say, “This is the spittle of the bees” if you want to praise it;</em><br />
<em> but if you wanted you could say, “It is the vomit of flying insects which sting.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you wish to praise honey, you can say, “This is something put out from the mouth of the bee,” but if you want to speak against it, then you can say, “This is vomit,” instead of saying it is ‘spittle’ (something put out from the mouth); and instead of ‘a bee’ you can say ‘a hornet’ (a stinging insect that flies). So the eloquent person, he can turn the Truth into falsehood and falsehood look like the Truth by means of his eloquence, so beware of this. And therefore the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam he warned against the person who is very eloquent in speech, the person who moves his tongue around just as the cows move the tongue around.1 He (sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) warned against this one and he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“Some speech is like magic.”</strong> </span>[02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning it enchants the people’s hearing (acts like magic upon the hearing of the people). His saying, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“So look and examine, may Allaah have mercy upon you, at the speech of everyone whom you hear from in your time in particular. Do not be hasty and do not enter into anything from it.”</strong> </span>This was at the time of the author [03] and the author was almost at the same time as Imaam Ahmad, because he is one of the students of his students. He says: Do not be hasty in accepting the speech of the people in your time, until you verify it. So where is this in comparison to this time of ours now, the time of desires and the time of ignorance and the time when the different parts of the world are all mixed together? To the extent that trials and tribulations and evils and ideas arise and surge like waves and the enemy now wants to turn the Religion upon its head. He wants us to follow him and to impose his ideas upon us and to impose his politics upon us. Therefore it is upon us to check this affair carefully and to withhold from many affairs and to turn attention to seeking to understand the Speech of Allaah and the speech of His Messenger, and to acquire knowledge and understanding of the Religion of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So al-fiqh (knowledge and understanding of the Religion) contains a protection from trials and tribulations. And al-fiqh means al-fahm (understanding of the Religion). And a person may have memorized a great deal, but he does not have understanding, so therefore he and the common person are just the same. Indeed the common person may be better than him because he withholds himself and he recognizes his own ignorance, while this one does not realise that he is actually an ignorant person. Therefore the matter is not just memorizing a great amount or speaking a great deal. The matter is a matter of fiqh (understanding) and therefore he sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said, “Perhaps one who has something conveyed to him will be better comprehending than the one who heard it (originally).” [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a person may memorize something, and transmit and narrate, and yet there may be someone there who understands it better than he does. (Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“There may be a person who conveys knowledge of the Religion but he is not one who comprehends it.”</strong></span> [05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is a carrier of the knowledge and a transmitter of it, however he is not one who has understanding of it. So fiqh (knowledge and understanding of the Religion) is a gift from Allaah which Allaah gives to whomever He wishes from His servants. However, if he utilizes it properly and advances it/causes it to grow then he will benefit from it. But if he neglects it, it will be lost.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“So do not be hasty and do not enter into anything from it until you ask and look: Did anyone from the Companions of the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam speak with it?”</strong></span> This is a tremendous piece of advice if some speech pleases you regarding the Religion. As for speech about the affairs of this world, then that is not the topic under discussion here. Rather if some speech with regard to the Religion seems pleasing to you then don&#8217;t be hasty until you examine it: Is it founded upon something true and upon proof or is it just from the person&#8217;s own head and his own thinking? For if it is, then it is just scum, like the scum which is carried on the top of flood water. Leave it (in that case). But otherwise if it is founded and based upon the Book and the Sunnah, then it is true. So therefore to do not be hasty in taking speech without restraint, even if it seems pleasing to you in its fine manner of speaking and it is eloquence and its forcefulness and in the style of address, do not be hasty about it until you examine and you test it against the Book and the Sunnah, and examine and see who said it. Is he a person of knowledge and understanding (a faqeeh) or not a person of knowledge and understanding? Until you ask the people of knowledge about it (this matter) and you look and see, did anyone from the Salaf (Predecessors) say it or did they not say it? And this is something I have warned against many times, that I say: Do not introduce personal deductions and opinions and sayings and wording which have not been preceded upon. Take as your example the Salaf and the speech of the Salaf, and if you bring something which you have no one who precedes you upon it, then it will be something odd and strange, and its danger will be far more than its benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the speech of the Companions is the balance because they were the students of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. Their sayings are looked to with regard to an aayah; how did they explain it? And with regard to a hadeeth, how did they explain it? So you take from their sayings and from their explanation because they will be closer to the Truth than anyone who came after them; because they were students of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and they heard the interpretation and the explanation from the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and they took knowledge directly from him, so they will be the people who are closest to the Truth. And no weight is to be given, to the saying of those people who say, “The Companions are not to be counted, they were men and they had their own opinions, and we are men and we have our thoughts. Times change.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Religion remains and will remain until the Hour is established. And it does not change with the changing time; it covers every time and place. What changes is only human deductions, which may sometimes be wrong and sometimes correct. As for the Religion itself, it does not change because it is suitable for every time and every place because it was sent down from One who is all wise, deserving of all praise. And therefore they used to advise and say, “Adhere to the Book and the Sunnah with the understanding of the Pious Predecessors. Do not introduce an understanding from yourself or from the later people.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“or anyone from the People of Knowledge (scholars)”</strong></span> Meaning, did anyone from the scholars who are counted say it, from the Imaams who proceeded upon the way of the Companions of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam? Because they were the ones who narrated from the Companions, and the Companions were the ones who narrated from the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“So if you find a narration from them about it, then cling onto it.”</span></strong> If you find it being in agreement with their saying then cling onto it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“And do not go beyond it for anything.”</span></strong> And do not go beyond the speech of the Salaf for the opinion of so and so, and so and so from those who came after them. His saying, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And do not prefer anything over and above it and thus fall into the Fire.”</strong></span> And do not prefer over what came from the Salaf anything, from that which the later people brought such that you fall into the Fire. Because you have gone against the path leading to Paradise, and the path of Paradise is what (they) were upon, those who&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Those whom Allah has bestowed favor upon, from the Prophets, and the true and truthful followers of the Prophet, and the martyrs, and the righteous people and what a fine companionship they are.&#8221; </strong></span>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), aayah 69)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the path to Paradise, and whatever conflicts with it is a path leading to the Fire. And Allaah the Mighty and Majestic says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;And this is My Straight Path so follow it, and do not follow the multiple paths, for they will cause you to split away from His path”</strong></span> (Sooratul-An`aam (6), aayah 153)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s path is one but as for other than it, then it is many paths. Every devil has a path and he has a path; on each path there will be devils from mankind and from the jinn. So they are many different paths which will throw the person who follows them into confusion. But as for the Straight Path, then it is one. It does not contain any disagreement and you will never become lost if you follow it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Points discussed by Shaykh Saalih al-Fowzaan hafizahullaah:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Concerning matters of the Religion, Muslims should verify:
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Who has said this thing?</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Where did it come from?</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">What is its basis in the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah?</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Did any of the Salaf say it?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">If it is just from a person’s own head and own thinking then leave it</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the person who spoke about this matter, Muslims should verify:
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Where did he study?</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Whom did he take knowledge from?</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The extent of his knowledge and understanding</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">It may be that a person speaks little, yet he is a person of understanding of the Religion</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">It may be that a person speaks plentifully yet he has no knowledge and understanding of the Religion</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">In our time:
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Speech is abundant and knowledge is scarce;</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The recitors are many and the people of knowledge and understanding are few</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The eloquent one can make the Truth look like falsehood and make falsehood like look the Truth</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Allaah hates those men who are eloquent, the one who moves his tongue around, just as the cow moves its tongue around. (hadeeth)</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">He (sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) warned against this one saying, “Some speech is like magic.”</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">It is upon us to:
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Check affairs carefully,</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Withhold from many affairs</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Turn to seeking to understand the Qur·aan and the speech of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Acquire knowledge and understanding of the Religion of Allaah</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Knowledge and understanding of the Religion contains a protection from trials and tribulations</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">A common person may be better than one who has memorized a lot because he recognizes his own ignorance</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">“There may be a person who conveys knowledge of the Religion but he is not one who comprehends it.” (hadeeth)</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Fiqh, knowledge and understanding of the Religion, is a gift from Allaah
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">If a person utilizes this gift properly and advances it he will benefit from it</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">If he neglects it, it will be lost</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Do not introduce personal deductions, opinions, sayings and wording which have not been preceded upon</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The danger of bringing something which has not been preceded upon is more than its benefit.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Take as your example the Salaf and the speech of the Salaf</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Companions took knowledge directly from the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, so they will be the people who are closest to the Truth</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Straight Path is one and you will never become lost if you follow it</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 07 : Point 04B</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Continuation of Point 04 : </strong>The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“And know, may Allaah have mercy upon you, that the Religion is only what came from Allaah, the Exalted and Most High. It was not left to the intellects of men and to their opinions; and knowledge of it is what comes from Allaah and from His Messenger. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">So do not follow anything based upon your desires and therefore depart from the Religion and leave Islaam. There will be no excuse for you, since the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam explained the Sunnah to his nation, and he made it clear to his Companions and they are the Jamaa`ah, and they are the Main Body. And the Main Body is the Truth and its people. So whoever contradicts the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam in anything of the affairs of the Religion he has disbelieved.”</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“So do not follow anything based upon your desires”</strong> &#8211; do not follow anything based upon your desires and your personal wishes, but rather your desires and wishes should follow whatever comes from Allaah and His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. So that you do not desire except what came from Allaah and His Messenger and you do not wish for, except that which came from Allaah and his Messenger, this is the path of salvation. If you were to follow your desires, you would become one of those who follow their desires and who do not follow the Revelation which has been sent down. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So if they (the people of shirk) do not respond to you </span></strong>[01]<strong><span style="color:#008000;"> then know that they are merely following their desires. And who is more astray than one who follows his desires without guidance from Allaah. Allaah does not guide a people who are disobedient wrong-doers.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Qasas (28), aayah 50)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So pass judgement between them with that which Allaah sent down; and do not abandon acting upon that in favour of their desires, so that they lead you astray from the Truth that has come to you.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Maa·idah (5), aayah 48)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Then, after the previous Prophets, We have placed you upon a clear Way with regard to the Religion so follow it and do not follow the desires of those ignorant ones who do not know. They could be of no avail to you against Allaah at all. And the wrong-doers are just allies of each other; and Allaah is the Guardian Lord of those who are dutiful to Him.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Jaathiyah (45), ayaahs 18-19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore you are between two affairs, either you will follow the correct Religion or otherwise you will be following desires. There is no third case.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and therefore depart from the Religion and exit from Islaam.”</strong> Whoever follows his desires, then he departs from the Religion, even if it be something that occurs in the distant future. To begin with he is lax about disobedience and about desires. Then the following of desires grows in seriousness until he exits from the Religion, so that his religion comes to be just whatever he desires. Just as He, the Majestic and Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do you see the one who takes whatever he desires as his object of worship, and Allaah misguides him knowing that he will not be guided, and He seals his hearing and his heart and He places upon his sight a covering.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Jaathiyah (45), aayah 23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So al-hawaa, desires, this is another object of worship (ilaah), and shirk is not restricted to just the worship of an idol or an object that is worshipped. Rather there is something else, which is al-hawaa, desires. So a person may perhaps not worship the idols, and trees and rocks and not worship graves, however he follows his desires. So he is a slave and worshipper of his desires, so it is upon the person to beware and not to follow except that which conforms to the Book and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“</strong></span><strong>Because then there will be no excuse for you, since the Messenger of Allaah sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam explained the Sunnah to his nation, and he clarified it to his Companions</strong><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>.”</strong></span> There will be no excuse/plea/argument for the one who opposes and instead follows his desires, because he went astray after the affair has been made clear and after having knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do you see the one who takes whatever he desires as his object of worship and Allaah misguides him, knowing that if guidance were to come to him he would not follow it.</strong> </span>(Sooratul-Jaathiyah (45), aayah 23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is not an ignorant person, rather he knows and he is aware of the Book and the Sunnah, and he knows and he is aware of the sayings of the People of Knowledge; however they do not agree with his desires, so therefore he abandons them and instead he takes on whatever actually agrees with his desires. This is misguidance, and Allaah&#8217;s refuge is sought. So following desires is very dangerous, so therefore it is upon a person that he should beware of the following of desires. Allaah the Majestic and Most High said to his Prophet Daawood `alayhis-salaatu was-salaam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And do not follow your desires so that they lead you astray from the path of Allaah. Those who stray from the path of Allaah will have a severe punishment on the Day of Resurrection, because of their abandoning Allaah’s commands.</strong> (Soorah Saad (38), aayah 26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Ibnul-Jawzee rahimahullah has a book in a large volume which is entitled ThammulHawaa (The Blameworthiness of Desires) and in it he brought evidences and sayings of the People of Knowledge and wise sayings which warn against the following of desires. So what is obligatory upon the person is that he takes caution against his desires because he may be saved from the worship of idols and rocks and trees and graves and he may know towheed and know the Sunnah; however he may not be secure from the following of desires, and this is a tremendous calamity. So it is upon the Muslim that he should beware of the following of desires, and rather his desires should follow on from that which came from the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, just as occurs in the hadeeth that he sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said, “None of you truly believes until his desires follow on from that which I came with.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was declared saheeh (authentic) by an-Nawawi in al-Arba`een (the 40 hadeeth) and he said, “We have it narrated to us in the book al-Hujjah with an authentic chain of narration.” [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam did not leave anything except that he clearly explained it to his nation, to the extent that one of the Companions said, “<span style="color:#008080;"><strong>Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam did not pass away and there was a bird flapping its wings in the air, except that he had mentioned to us some knowledge concerning it</strong></span>.” [03] He did not leave anything from that which mankind have a need of, from that which will draw them closer to Allaah and distance them from disbelief and misguidance except that he made is clear. And he sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008080;"><strong>“I am leaving amongst you that which if you hold onto it, you will never go astray after me; the Book of Allaah and my Sunnah”</strong></span> [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He left his nation upon clear white evidence; its night is just like its day. And when Allaah had completed through him the Religion, and perfected the favour by means of him, then he moved on to his Lord after he had conveyed the clear Message, and clearly explained the Sunnah to his Companions. And <span style="color:#008080;"><strong>he said in the address of the Farewell Hajj, “Have I conveyed the Message?” So they said, “We bear witness that you have indeed conveyed the Message and have acted sincerely. He said, “O Allaah bear witness.”</strong></span> [05] (Sooratun-Ni0saa· (4) aayah 65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And they are the Jamaa`ah and they are the Main Body.”</strong> His Companions sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam they are the Jamaa`ah, meaning they are the foundation of the Jamaa`ah, then those who followed them, then those who followed them. Just as he sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008080;"><strong>“The best of you is my generation, then those who followed them, then those who followed them.”</strong></span> [06]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Companions and Taabi`oon and the Atbaa`ut-Taabi`een, and they are the most excellent generations, they are the Jamaa&#8217;ah. And whoever comes after them, then he follows on from them. They follow on from the foundation which the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam were upon. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the first and foremost ones from the Muhaajireen and the Ansaar and those who follow them upon goodness</strong></span>. (Sooratut-Towbah (9), aayah 100)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are the Jamaa&#8217;ah whom Allaah has commanded us to be with, and whom the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam commanded us that we should be with, and whom he forbade us from separating from. And they are as-<strong>Sawaadul-A`zam</strong>, the Main Body, who are upon the Truth and upon guidance. So those people who declare that the Salaf were ignorant or unaware and who belittle their status, and those who say, “They were men and we are men,” and who say, “There is nothing to prevent us from introducing new things, and we are not bound to follow the Salaf and the sayings of the Salaf,” &#8211; this is misguidance, and Allaah&#8217;s refuge is sought. This is to separate the later part of this ummah (nation) from its first part. And if its later part indeed becomes separate from its first part it will be destroyed; and they want that the nation should be destroyed, so they bring this trick, and it is the separation of the later people from the first part of the nation. There are to be found now, people who warn against the way of the Salaf and who warn against turning back to their sayings, and who say, “That was a time that has gone by.” So they warn against what the Salaf were upon, and encourage originating new things in the Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Religion is a matter depending upon texts, and it is <strong>ittibaa</strong>`, it is to follow, it is not to innovate or originate new things. Originating new things can only be in the field of manufacturing and of worldly benefits. But as for the Religion, then nothing may be newly introduced in it after the passing away of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam; because laying down Legislation came to an end with the passing away of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. So there is nothing upon us except al-ittibaa`, to follow, and that we do not introduce anything new from our selves and say, “This is what is fitting for this time.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Maalik rahimahullah said, “<strong>Nothing will rectify the latter part of this nation, except that which rectified its first part</strong>.” [07] That which rectified its first part was the Book and the Sunnah. So nothing will rectify the last part of this nation except for the Book and the Sunnah and following the guidance of the Salafus-Saalih (Pious Predecessors).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, <strong>“And the Main Body is the Truth and its people.”</strong> &#8211; As-Sawaad, the Main Body, they are the people of the Truth, and its people, those who cling onto it. And the meaning of as- Sawaadul-A`zam, the Main Body, it does not mean merely the majority of the people/a large number of people. The meaning of as-Sawaadul-A`zam, the Main Body, is those who are upon the Truth, even if they are few in number yet still they are as-Sawaadul-A`zam, the Main Body, even if they be a single man [08]. Whoever is upon the Truth he is the Main Body. We do not look to see where the majority of the people is (what they are upon), rather we look at what they are upon. So majority/a large number may be upon misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if you were to obey most of those people who are upon the earth, they will lead you away from the Path of Allaah.</strong></span> (Sooratul-An`aam (6) aayah 116)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And most of the people, no matter how eager you are, will not be Believers.</span></strong>  Soorah Yoosuf (12) aayah 103)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And we did not find most of them to be true to their covenant, of worshipping Allaah alone and obeying him, rather we found most of them to be disobedient sinners.</span></strong> (Sooratul-A&#8217;raaf (7) aayah 102)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And many of the people are disobedient ones.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Maa·idah (5) aayah 49)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So do not be fooled by a large number of people/the majority of people, and it is not to be followed unless it is upon the Truth. Whoever is upon the Truth then he/it is the Jamaa`ah whether they are few or many. So the discerning factor is: what they are upon; is it Truth or falsehood. So if it is the Truth, then they are the Jamaa&#8217;ah, even if there is only a single person upon it; and if it is falsehood (that they are upon) then it is misguidance, even if the majority or most of the people are upon it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And whoever opposes the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam in anything from the affair of the Religion then he has disbelieved.”</strong> &#8211; he has committed disbelief; this carries a possibility of referring to major disbelief, al-kufrul-akbar, (disbelief that he has left Islam); and it carries a possibility of referring to lesser disbelief al- kufrul-asghar (that which is called disbelief but it does not take a person outside the fold of Islam); in accordance with the level of his opposition. So his saying that he has committed disbelief, it doesn’t mean that he has committed kufr and left the Religion altogether always. This maybe the case, however it maybe lesser disbelief. What is important is that conflicting with the Salaf is kufr, disbelief. It may be major disbelief; it may be lesser disbelief in accordance with the level of the opposition to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or that what is meant is that if he opposes them at the beginning of his affair with something slight, then in gradual stages he becomes worse until he departs from the Religion altogether. So his affair leads him to disbelief, if his opposition continues, his affair leads to major disbelief, so that then he exits from the Religion altogether. (So that) Satan leads him gradually, and desires, and his soul that is prompted by evil, until he departs from the Religion altogether. [09]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] <strong>Translator’s Note:</strong> addressed to the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] Reported by Ibn Abee `Aasim in as-Sunnah, al-Hasan ibn Sufyaan in al-Arba`een and al-Bayhaqee in alMadkhal ilaa Sunanil-Kubraa and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> As for Shaykh al-Albaanee rahimahullaah then he said with regard to this hadeeth in his checking of as-Sunnah of Ibn Abee `Aasim and likewise in his checking of al-Mishkaat (no. 167), the chain of narration is da`eef . It contains Nu`aym ibn Hammaad and he was weak. And al-Haafiz ibn Rajab quoted other weaknesses for it disagreeing with an-Nawawee for his declaring it saheeh so refer to his book Jaami`ul-`Uloom wal-Hikam. Then some of them such as the grandson of Muhammad ibn `Abdil-Wahhab rahimahullaah, Sulaymaan ibn `Abdillaah, he said in regards to this narration, “This chain of narration is authentic as anNawawee said, however Ibn Rajab said declaring it saheeh is something far-fetched from many aspects which he mentioned, and some people criticised that.” He said (Sulaymaan ibn `Abdillaah), “I say that its meaning is authentic/correct for certain, even if its chain of narration is not authentic. And the origin of it occurs in the Qur·aan in many places. Then he quoted a number of aayahs in that regard, such as His saying, He, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;So no by your Lord they will not believe until they make you (Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) judge in whatever disputes occur between them.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] Wakee` reported this narration in az-Zuhd, Imaam Ahmad in the Musnad and Ibn Sa&#8217;d in Tabaqaat&#8230; (and others) from a narration of Aboo Tharr radiyAllaahu `anhu. Shaykh Sulaymaan ibn `Abdillaah said in TayseerulAzeezil-Hameed, “Its chain of narration is good.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh al-Albaanee said it was saheeh, authentic, in his checking of Ibn Hibbaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] This is reported by al-Haakim in al-Mustadrak `alas-Saheehayn and by al-Bayhaqee in as-Sunan al-Kubraa and by al-Aajurree in his book ash-Sharee`ah from a hadeeth of `Abdullaah ibn `Abbaas radiyAllaahu `anhumaa. Translator’s side point: The chain of narration of al-Haakim was hasan, sound, and Shaykh al-Albaanee mentioned that in his checking of al-Mishkaat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[05] Reported by al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh (no. 67) and Muslim (no. 1671) as a hadeeth of Aboo Bakrah radiyAllaahu `anhu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[06] Reported by al-Bukhaaree (no. 3450) and in Muslim (no. 2535), as a hadeeth of `Imraan ibnul-Husayn radiyAllaahu `anhu .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[07] This is reported from him by a number of people such ash-Shaatibee in al-I`tisaam and Ibn `Abdil-Haadee in Tanqeehit-Tahqeeq. And perhaps Imaam Maalik took this point of benefit from his teacher Wahb ibn Kaysaan, for indeed Ibn `Abdil Barr reports in at-Tamheed from Imaam Maalik that he (himself) said, “Wahb ibn Kaysaan used to sit for us, and he would never get up until he had said to us, “<strong>Know that nothing will rectify the latter part of this nation, except what rectified its first part</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[08] Aboo Nu`aym said in Hilyatul-Awliyaa· that a man asked Imaam Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh “<strong>Who is the Main Body (as-Sawaadul-A`zam)?</strong>” So he said, “Muhammad ibn Aslam (that is at-Toosee) and his Companions and whoever follows him.” Then he said, “A man asked Ibnul-Mubaarak, ‘O Aboo Abdir-Rahmaan! Who is the Main Body (as-Sawaadul-A`zam)?’ So he said, ‘Aboo Hamza as-Sukkaree.’” Then Ishaaq said, “Meaning at that time it was Aboo Hamza, and in our time it is Muhammad ibn Aslam, and whoever follows him.” Then Ishaaq said, “And if you were to ask the ignorant people, ‘Who are the Main Body?’ they would say, ‘(It means) the majority of the people.’ And they do not know that the Jamaa`ah is a scholar/Person of Knowledge, adhering to the narrations of Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and his way. So whoever is with him and follows him, then he is the Jamaa`ah, and whoever opposes him in that regard, he has left the Jamaa`ah.” Then Ishaaq said, “And I have not heard a scholar for fifty years who is more knowledgeable than Muhammad ibn Aslam.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[09] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee rahimahullaah said, “The like of this phrase occurs a number of times in the speech of the author rahimahullaah, and it is to be taken to have one of three meanings:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Either it is to be taken to mean, that he (the author) intends a person who denies something that is a fundamental point of the creed and belief of the Religion and he denies it. Then he has disbelieved,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Or he intended that his deeds may lead him into disbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Or that he intended disbelief which is lesser than major disbelief, meaning rejecting (Allaah&#8217;s) favour. And it is not the case that everyone who goes against something which the Companions of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam were upon departs altogether from the Religion, for this is not from the `aqeedah of the AhlusSunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah. For indeed Anas ibn Maalik said when he came to Madeenah at the end of his life, ‘I do not recognize anything from that which I reached except for the Prayer and you are spoiling that as well.’ (This narration was brought by Imaam al-Bukhaaree) and in one narration, ‘and have you not spoiled what you have spoiled from it?’ Meaning: you pray them out of their due times; however he did not declare them to be disbelievers. And no one takes this saying of his from the people of the Sunnah to mean that the people who were in his time had become disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore his saying, ‘Whoever contradicts the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam in anything from the affairs of the Religion has committed kufr,’ it is to be taken to have one of the meanings that we have already mentioned because the `aqeedah of the Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah is that they do not declare disbelievers any one from the Muslims based upon a sin, unless it is major shirk that he has committed, or that he has denied a ruling which is agreed upon, or that he has mocked the Religion or its people or the like of that, those things which are mentioned amongst those things that break a person&#8217;s Islaam. And they do not declare anyone to be a disbeliever based just upon a sin, even if it is a major sin, even if he persists upon it and dies upon it, because the texts of the Book and the Sunnah indicate this creed and belief. (Irshaadus-Saaree fee Sharhis-Sunnati lil- Barbahaaree)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 06 : Point 04A</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And know, may Allaah have mercy upon you, that the Religion is only what came from Allaah, the Exalted and Most High. It was not left to the intellects of men and to their opinions; and knowledge of it is what comes from Allaah and from His Messenger. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">So do not follow anything based upon your desires and therefore depart from the Religion and leave Islaam. There will be no excuse for you, since the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam explained the Sunnah to his nation, and he made it clear to his Companions and they are the Jamaa`ah, and they are the Main Body. And the Main Body is the Truth and its people. So whoever contradicts the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam in anything of the affairs of the Religion he has disbelieved.”</span></strong></p>
<p><em>[ <strong>Note</strong>: In this audio, explanation of the only first paragraph from the above is covered]</em></p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F361148609&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-religion-is-only-what-came-from-allaah-it-was-not-left-to-the-intellectsopinions-of-men" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Religion came only from Allaah, so He is the One who legislated the Religion, He the Perfect. It is not for anyone to legislate religion, which Allaah has not permitted. He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do they have partners who legislate for them religion, not ordained by Allaah.</span> </strong>(Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a rebuke and a warning. So the Religion is that which Allaah has legislated, and which His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam conveyed. This is the Religion about which Allaah the Majestic and Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">He (Allaah) legislated for you the Religion with which He enjoined Nooh, and which He revealed to you, and which He enjoined upon Ibraaheem, and Moosaa and `Eesaa; that you should establish the Religion, and not separate within it.</span> </strong>(Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah13)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the revealed way of the Prophets, specifically those five Prophets, who are those firmest in resolve. This is their Religion. So whoever deviates away from it or differs with it, then he is destroyed and he is astray. And it is built upon the tawheed of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic (singling out Allaah the Mighty and Majestic with all worship) and abandonment of the worship of everything besides Him, and restricting oneself to that which Allaah the Mighty and Majestic legislated, and keeping away from whatever Allaah has forbidden &#8211; this is the Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“It was not left up to the intellects of men and their opinions.”</strong> &#8211; the Religion is not what men deem to be good or what they hold as their opinion, because this is not the Religion of Allaah. This is the Religion of the people, which they have newly invented. As for the Religion of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, then it is what He legislated. As for that which the men hold as their opinion, based upon their own opinions, this is not the Religion of Allaah the Perfect and Most High. Rather it is just a religion of whoever holds that opinion. So nothing can be ascribed to Allaah from the Religion except that which He legislated upon the tongue of His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. And as for what others besides Him legislated, then it cannot be ascribed to Allaah, rather it can only be ascribed to whoever legislated it, and Allaah is free of it. He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do they have partners who legislate for them religion which Allaah has not permitted</strong></span> (Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And its knowledge is with Allaah and His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.”</strong> &#8211; the affairs of the Religion are <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>towqeefiyyah</em> </span>(depend upon text); there must be proofs from Allaah and His Messenger with regard to the affairs of the Religion. The matter is restricted to what occurs in the Book and the Sunnah from the affairs of the Religion. And newly introduced matters and innovations are abandoned, that which Allaah has not sent down any proof for &#8211; even if their people hold them to be religion, and they draw closer to Allaah through them, then we turn no attention to these things and we do not believe in them, because the Religion of Allaah is what He legislated and His Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because the Religion is based upon knowledge which came from Allaah and His Messenger. And do not follow the desires of the people and the opinions of the people and what they declare to be good and what they follow each other upon, and it has no basis in the Book of Allaah or the Sunnah of His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as he `alayhis-salaatu was-salaam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008080;"><strong>“Whoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it, it is rejected.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in one narration:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008080;"><strong>“Whoever does an action which our affair is not in accordance with, it is rejected”</strong></span> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the person who wishes that his action be righteous and be beneficial, then he should adhere to two matters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first matter:</strong> is that he makes his Religion pure for Allaah and free from shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And the second matter:</strong> ittibaa`, following the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, free of innovations and newly introduced affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A person will indeed find many things which contradict what is correct in the `aqeedah, matters which contradict what is correct in matters of worship, many of them; (because) the people have desires, and have their own aspirations, and they have their own opinions and they have their own ways (which they follow). So we do not follow the people, rather we present whatever the people are upon to the Book and the Sunnah. So whatever conforms with the Book and the Sunnah then it is the Truth, and whatever contradicts these two then it is false and futile.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">When Imaam Ahmad was suffering from his final sickness, at times, he would feel pain and groan out loud. So when one of his students came and heard him, he narrated to him with a chain of narration from Muhammad bin Sireen that Anas bin Maalik (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) used to consider it detested (<i>makrooh</i>) to groan. After that, he did not hear Ahmad groan again until he passed away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This mentality on the part of the student and the teacher is that which will enable the student of knowledge, through the Grace of Allaah, to become a scholar in the future, if Allaah wills. And this is the mentality which will enable him to benefit and cause him to always be preoccupied with knowledge – day and night, he is learning. <span style="color:#ff6600;">He should not look down upon a point of benefit that comes to him by way of someone that is young in age or old in age</span>. Some people receive points of benefit from individuals that are younger than them (in age and knowledge), and so they feel arrogant towards him or they don’t give that point their full attention. The reason for this is because they have elevated themselves over the knowledge. And when one elevates himself over knowledge, he will not be from those who are able to acquire it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, a younger or smaller person may have some knowledge that an older or bigger person doesn’t. And likewise one who is younger or smaller may understand some aspects of knowledge whereas one who is older and bigger may not. But if he explains it to him, he should benefit from it. The scholars have mentioned a clear example for this, which is the story of prophet Sulaymaan and the hoopoe bird. Even though the hoopoe bird was lowly in terms of stature and composure and Sulaymaan was elevated in terms of stature, composure and position in the sight of Allaah and before all of creation, the hoopoe bird said to him: <b>“I have grasped knowledge of something that you have not grasped. And I have come to you from Saba’ (Sheba) with certain news.”</b> [Surah An-Naml: 22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the <strong>hoopoe</strong> bird knew something that Sulayman was unaware of. The people of knowledge have derived from this story that you should not be arrogant with someone that brings you a point of benefit (from knowledge), regardless if he is young and lowly or old and prominent.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THE FOURTH FOUNDATION:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowledge means: The statements of Allaah and His Messenger and the statements of the Sahaabah (Companions), along with the unanimous agreement of the scholars (ijmaa’) and correct logical conclusion (qiyaas).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the Qur’aan and Sunnah must be understood in light of the understanding of the Companions and those who followed them in goodness. This is the Way of the Believers, as Allaah says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَمَن يُشَاقِقِ الرَّسُولَ مِن بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ الْهُدَى وَيَتَّبِعْ غَيْرَ<br />
سَبِيلِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ نُوَلِّهِ مَا تَوَلَّى وَنُصْلِهِ جَهَنَّمَ وَسَاءتْ مَصِيرًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And whoever opposes the Messenger after the guidance has been made clear to him, and follows a way other than the Way of the Believers, We will turn him to what He has chosen and land him in Hell – what an evil destination.”</span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 115]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How excellent is the statement of the one who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Knowledge is: (what) Allaah said, (what) His Messenger said, (and what) the Companions said, there being no variance in this. Knowledge is not that you present a difference imprudently between the Messenger and the view of a fool. Nay, nor is it the presenting of a difference ignorantly Between the texts and the view of a Faqeeh (Scholar) Nay, nor is it the rejection of texts intentionally out of fear of falling into tajseem [14] and tashbeeh.” [15]</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Awzaa’ee, may Allaah have mercy on him, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Knowledge is what the Companions of Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم have reported. Anything beyond this is not knowledge.”</strong> [16]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Az-Zuhree, may Allaah have mercy on him, would write down the statements of the Taabi’een, and Saalih bin Kaysaan would oppose him in this. Later, he felt remorse for having abandoned that. [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is also the path that Abu Haneefah An-Nu’maan followed, may Allaah have mercy on him and be pleased with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Al-Mubaarak, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “I heard Abu Haneefah say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> ‘When something is reported from the Prophet, we take it. And when something is reported from the Companions of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, we choose from their opinions. And when something is reported from the Taabi’een, we contest with them (with our views as to which is correct).’”</strong> [18]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the same path taken by Maalik bin Anas Al-Asbahee, the Imaam of Madeenah, may Allaah have mercy on him and be pleased with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When his book al-Muwatta’ was mentioned to him, Maalik said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“It contains the hadeeth of Allaah’s Messenger and the statement(s) and opinion(s) of the Sahaabah and the Taabi’een. I also voiced my opinion based on Ijtihaad (scholarly deduction) and on what I found the people of knowledge upon in our lands, not transgressing that for the views of others.”</strong> [19]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was also the path that Ash-Shaafi’ee adhered to, may Allaah have mercy on him and be pleased with him. [20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ash-Shaafi’ee, may Allaah have mercy on him, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Knowledge is of several categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>First</strong></span>: The Book and the Sunnah, if it is an authentically reported Sunnah;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Second</strong></span>: The unanimous agreement of the scholars in those matters in which proof from the Book and the Sunnah cannot be found;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Third</strong></span>: When some (or one) of the Companions of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said something and we don’t know of any opposition to that from the rest of them;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Fourth</strong></span>: When the Companions of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم differed among themselves, yet he صلى الله عليه وسلم did not object to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Fifth</strong></span>: Qiyaas (analytical deduction) of one of these categories.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should not go to another source apart from the Book and the Sunnah so long as they are both present (i.e. proof is found in them). Knowledge should be taken from the highest source.” [21]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was also the way of Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Hanbal, may Allaah have mercy on him and be pleased with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Hanbal said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“If a hadeeth from the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم exists on an issue, we should not take the opinion of someone else that is in opposition to it – regardless if he is one of the Companions or those that came after them.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And if there exist conflicting views from the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger on a particular issue, we may choose from their opinions. However, we do not transgress from their opinions to the views of someone else.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And if no statement from the Prophet or his Companions exists on an issue, we may choose from the opinions of the Taabi’een…”</strong> [22]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad bin Al-Hasan said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Whoever is knowledgeable of the Book and the Sunnah, and of the opinions of the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم, and the views favored by the Muslim Fiqh scholars is allowed to exert his opinion by way of (scholarly) Ijtihaad in those matters in which he finds difficulty, thus ruling by it and implementing it in his prayer, fast, Hajj, and all of the other things he was commanded and prohibited to do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if he exerts his efforts to come up with an opinion, and investigates and applies analytical deduction, and still doesn’t come up with the correct view, he is permitted to act on his resulting view, even if he did err in attaining the correct view that should be followed.” [23]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad bin Al-Hasan also said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> “Knowledge is of four types:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. That which is found in the clear Book of Allaah, and what is analytically deduced from it;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. That which is found in the reported Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger, and what is analytically deduced from it;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. That which the Sahaabah (Companions), may Allaah have mercy on them, unanimously agreed on, and what is analytically deduced from it;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This also includes the issues they differed on, so long as it doesn’t transgress beyond their views. If one of their opinions is chosen, that (view) is considered knowledge that was analytically arrived at.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. That which the majority of the Muslim Fiqh scholars have favored as well as what is analytically deduced from that and which serves as an equivalent to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowledge does not exceed the boundaries of these four types.” [24]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>* This foundation consists of several matters, amongst which are:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. A student of knowledge should accustom himself to connect issues with their evidences from the Book and the Sunnah, according to the understanding of the pious predecessors (Salaf as- Saalih). This is where the importance of the books written on the rulings found in ayaat and ahaadeeth and the books on the narrations of the Companions comes in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>2. The Sunnh of the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم is divided into two types:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. The apparent Sunnah, which is explicitly clear, and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">B. The unapparent Sunnah, which is not explicitly clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the first type of Sunnah, which is the clear and apparent Sunnah, then it refers to what is clearly attributed to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم from statements, actions, tacit approvals, behavioral descriptions and physical attributes. This is considered “the Sunnah” according to the scholars of Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the categories above, those that are related to religious rulings, and which serve to establish obligations and laws, are: his صلى الله عليه وسلم statements, actions, and tacit approvals. This is why the scholars that formulate principles (Usooliyoon) and those that excel in Jurisprudence (Fuqahaa) have limited the definition of the Sunnah to just these categories, since their main objective was just to clarify the religious laws.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second type of Sunnah, which is the Sunnah that is not explicitly clear, refers to that which is attributed to one of the Companions for which there is no room for opinions in the matter or that which takes on the ruling of being raised to a saying or action of the Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This consists of the following scenarios:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. When a Companion makes a statement on a matter in which there is no room for one’s opinion to enter into it (i.e. so naturally he received knowledge of it from the Prophet);</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">B. When a Companion issues an opinion and there is no text that contradicts it;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">C. When a Companion explains the circumstances under which a verse from the Qur’aan was revealed, in a clear manner;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">D. When a Companion explains something that has been reported;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">E. What has been reported from the Companions concerning their difference of opinion in the description of acts of worship;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">F. What has been reported from the Companions, in that which is known as “Interpretative Recitation”;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">G. What has been reported from them as interpretations of the noble Qur’aan from some of the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is for this reason that a student of knowledge must strive to find out what has been reported on the Companions with regard to issues of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, there are some shortcomings that occur in this aspect, and that is due to several reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First: There is a general lack of concern for finding out which narrations are authentic from which are weak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second: Verifying the opinion of a Companion on an issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Third: Discrediting the ascription of an opinion to a Companion before verifying if it was the last of the views he had on the issue or not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. In order to fully implement this principle, you must know that it is not permissible for us to introduce an opinion on a particular issue that is outside the realm of their views.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their statements – may Allaah have mercy on them – show a unanimous agreement on this approach. So whoever transgresses beyond the fold of their views has departed from the path of the believers. We also just recently quoted their statements in this regard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul-Mudhfar As-Sama’aanee, may Allaah have mercy on him, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“We were ordered to follow and encouraged to do that. And we were prohibited from innovating as well as warned against it. The trademark of Ahlus-Sunnah is their following of the Salaf whilst abandoning everything that is innovated and newly-introduced.” [25]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taimiyyah, may Allaah have mercy on him, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Whoever interprets the Qur’aan or the Hadeeth, explaining them in a way that is different from the well-known interpretations of the Companions and Successors, is fabricating a lie on Allaah, denying Allaah’s verses and distorting words from their proper places. This is opening the door to heresy and atheism. The falsehood of this is known in the religion of Islaam by necessity.”</strong> [26]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not for anyone to interpret a verse or a hadeeth in a manner that contradicts the interpretation of the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger, may Allaah be pleased with them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Rajab, may Allaah have mercy on him, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And in our time – I say: And in our time, this applies even more [27] – the recording of the statements of the exemplary Salaf is restricted to the time of Ash-Shaafi’ee, Ahmad, Ishaaq and Abu ‘Ubayd. So let the individual beware of what was introduced after them, for indeed there were many innovations that were introduced after their time. And there appeared those who ascribed themselves to following the Sunnah and the Hadeeth, such as the Dhaahirees and their likes who are the greatest in opposing it (i.e. the Sunnah) due to their deviation from the Imaams and their isolation from them in coming up with an understanding (of the texts), or their taking a view that the Imaams before them never held.” [28]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say:<br />
Ahmad bin Hanbal, may Allaah have mercy on him, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Beware of speaking on an issue for which you do not have an Imaam (i.e. scholar who preceded you in it).” </strong>[29]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. It is due to this principle – which is understanding the Glorious Qur’aan and the Prophetic Sunnah in light of the understanding of the Companions, may Allaah be pleased with them – that you will not find Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, the people of Hadeeth, engaging in the interpretation of the glorious Qur’aan or the explanation of the meanings of the Hadeeth from a linguistic and intellectual standpoint. Rather, you will find them investigating into the narrations, compiling the reports of the Salaf in their books, and basing their understanding and analytical deductions on that, contrary to the people of innovations and desires!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taimiyyah, may Allaah have mercy on him, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Murji’ah have deviated concerning this foundation (i.e. Eemaan) from what is clearly stated in the Qur’aan, the Sunnah and the statements of the Companions and those who follow them in righteousness. Instead, they have relied on their personal views and on the perverted interpretations they have reached from their understanding of the (Arabic) language. This is the way of the people of innovation. And this is why Imaam Ahmad would say: ‘The majority of the time that people fall into error is due to misinterpretation and incorrect analogy.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why we find the Mu’atazilah, the Murji’ah, the Raafidah and other groups of innovators interpreting the Qur’aan with their own opinions and intellects and what they understand from it linguistically. As a result of this, you will find that they do not rely on the narrations of the Prophet, the Companions, the Successors or the Muslim Imaams. So they neither rely on the Sunnah nor do they rely on the unanimous consensus or reports of the Salaf. Rather, they just rely on the intellect and the language.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also do not find them relying on the recorded books of Tafseer and Hadeeth and the narrations of the Salaf. Instead, they only rely on the books of literature and rhetoric that their leaders fabricated. This is also the way of the heretics. They only accept what is in the books of philosophy, literature and language. As for the books on Qur’aan, Hadeeth and Narrations, they do not give any importance to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These individuals turn away from the texts of the Prophets since according to them, they do not produce any knowledge!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they are the ones who interpret the Qur’aan according to their own personal views and understanding, without resorting to any of the narrations of the Prophet and his Companions. We already mentioned previously the statements of Imaam Ahmad and others which show the prohibition of this and an indication that this is the way of the people of innovation.” [30]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Innovations only entered into the beliefs of the innovators because of the fact that they turned away from this path and began to base the Religion of Islaam on leads that were not correct, either due to what the verbatim indicated or what was understood from the meanings. They did not reflect on the explanation that came from Allaah and His Messenger. All leads that contradict the explanation of Allaah and His Messenger are considered misguidance.” [31]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Disregarding the ahaadeeth and narrations of the Salaf while relying on just the language and intellect to understand the Qur’aan and Hadeeth is a method that has been embarked upon in recent times by the Orientalists. So when they need to research a narration, they simply quote from the books of Al-Jaahidh or from the book al-Aghaanee or from al-‘Aqd-ul-Fareed. And if quoting becomes hard on them, they just say: “This conforms to the intellect!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Contrary to this, a Muslim who follows what the Prophet and his Companions were upon confines his comprehension and understanding of the Glorious Qur’aan and Prophetic Sunnah to conform to the understanding of the Companions, may Allaah be pleased with them, and doesn’t leave from their fold.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if he must resort to Ijtihaad (scholarly deduction) or investigation on an issue, he searches if there is someone before him (Salaf) that held that view so that he may follow him, and if not, he leaves it alone. This is since all good lies in following those who preceded (Salaf), while all evil lies in the innovating of those who came after (Khalaf). So stick to the early generation.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">They consist of the one who has no evidences from the carriers of knowledge. <strong>Doubt</strong> has pierced his heart when it was first presented to him. He grasped it and thus fell into mass <strong>confusion</strong> and <strong>uncertainty</strong>. From that, he came out producing such acts as <strong>innovations</strong> and <strong>misguided affairs</strong>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Category Two: The People of Desires</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their portion is of <strong>two types</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first consists of he who <strong>seeks after the worldly life</strong>, under the pretense of desiring knowledge. So he makes knowledge a means of attaining worldly goals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second portion consists of the one who is <strong>overcome with the desire of amassing</strong> worldly gains, its riches and its treasures.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">None of these types of people are from amongst the shepherds of the Religion. Rather, their similitude is only like that of the cattle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For this reason, Allaah the Most High has compared those who were entrusted with the Torah and then failed that trust to donkeys carrying books. And He has compared the learner of evil, the one who detaches himself from the verses of Allaah, clinging onto this world and following his lusts, with the likeness of a dog. The donkey and the dog are the lowest forms of animals and the worst types of examples.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Category Three: The Carriers of Knowledge</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are the possessors of knowledge. They uphold it, protect it and establish it upon the evidences and clear proofs of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It already has been stated that they are the fewest of people yet greatest in stature in the sight of Allaah. This is an indication towards their few numbers and towards the strangeness of the carriers of knowledge from this category.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan Al-Basree (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The reciters of the Qur’aan are of three types:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who take it as a commodity and gain their sustenance from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who establish its words, yet neglect its commandments (i.e. read it but don’t practice it). Due to (their knowledge of) it, they act arrogantly towards the people of their land and they use it (the Qur’aan) as a support for gaining positions of authority. These types of people from among the bearers of the Qur’aan are many. May Allaah diminish their number!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also a type of people that apply the remedy of the Qur’aan and thus place it over the sickness of their hearts. Due to it, their battles come to a standstill and they feel compassionate in their burnooses (long capes worn by the people of old). And they feel a sense of fear (of Allaah) and the worries (of the worldly life) have left them. They are the ones upon whom Allaah sends His rain down and He sends victory through them over the enemies. By Allaah, this type of people from among the carriers of the Qur’aan are more honorable than that of flaming torches in the sight of the rest of the reciters of the Qur’aan.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, he (rahimahullaah) has informed us that this group – and they are the reciters of the Qur’aan who place it as a cure for their hearts, such that all traces of fear and worry leave them – is more honorable amongst the other reciters than the example of flaming torches.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Third: Humbling Oneself before Allaah and Asking Him for Success and Prosperity</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should also ask his Lord to increase him in seeking knowledge, since an individual is destitute and in the utmost need of Allaah. This is why Allaah has encouraged His servants to ask of Him and to lower themselves before Him, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَقَالَ رَبُّكُمُ ادْعُونِي أَسْتَجِبْ لَكُمْ<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Call unto Me, I will respond to you.”</strong></span> [Surah Ghaafir: 60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Our Lord descends every night to the lowest level of heaven and says: ‘Who is calling Me that I may respond? Who asks of Me that I may give him? Who seeks My forgiveness that I may forgive him?’”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah commanded His Prophet to ask Him for an increase in knowledge, as He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَقُل رَّبِّ زِدْنِي عِلْمًا<br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">“And say: ‘My Lord! Increase me in knowledge.’”</span></strong> [Surah TaHa: 114]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah said speaking on behalf of Ibraaheem:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">رَبِّ هَبْ لِي حُكْمًا وَأَلْحِقْنِي بِالصَّالِحِينَ<br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">“My Lord! Bestow Hukm (i.e. knowledge) on me, and join me with the righteous.”</span></strong><br />
[Surah Ash-Shua’raa: 83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word Hukm refers to knowledge, as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: “If the Haakim (judge), strives hard performing Ijtihaad…”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم supplicated for Abu Hurairah radiya Allaahu &#8216;anhu to be granted the ability to memorize. He صلى الله عليه وسلم also supplicated for Ibn ‘Abbaas to be granted knowledge, as he said: <strong>“O Allaah, give him understanding of the Religion, and teach him the ta’weel (interpretation of the Qur’aan).”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah answered His Prophet’s supplication, such that afterward Abu Hurairah radiya Allaahu &#8216;anhu didn’t hear anything except that he memorized it and Ibn ‘Abbaas radiya Allaahu &#8216;anhu came to be the scholar of the ummah and the interpreter of the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars have continued to carry on this practice, thus lowering themselves before Allaah and asking Him to grant them knowledge. Look at the example of Shaikh-ul- Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah, may Allaah have mercy on him – He would go to the masaajid, prostrate to Allaah and supplicate to Him, saying: <strong>“O teacher of Ibraaheem, teach me! O educator of Sulaymaan, grant me understanding!”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah answered his supplication, such that Ibn Daqeeq-ul-‘Eid said about him: <strong>“Allaah gathered the knowledge for him to the point that it was as if it (i.e. the knowledge) was between his eyes and he would take what he wished from it and leave off what he wished from it.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Posted from : <a title="Permanent Link to Ten Guidelines for Obtaining Knowledge – Shaykh Abdullaah Adh-Dhufairee" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/09/30/ten-guidelines-for-obtaining-knowledge-shaykh-abdullaah-adh-dhufairee/" rel="bookmark"><strong>Ten Guidelines for Obtaining Knowledge – Shaykh Abdullaah Adh-Dhufairee. </strong></a>The treatise has been introduced and praised by Shaikh Ahmad An-Najmee, one of the elder scholars in Saudi Arabia, thus indicating its importance and benefit. </em></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>19.For indeed, (indulging in) theological rhetoric (kalaam) in [22] the matter of Qadar, the Ru’yah, the Qur’aan and other such issues are among the ways that are detested and which are forbidden.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>20. The one Who does so, even if he reaches the truth with his words, is not from Ahlus-Sunnah, until he abandons (using) this mode of argumentation, [and until he] submits and believes in the aathaar (the Prophetic Narrations and those of the Companions [23]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[22] Imaam ash-Shaafi’ee (d. 204H) said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“My ruling regarding the people of theological rhetoric is that they should be beaten with palm leaves and shoes and be paraded amongst the kinsfolk and the tribes with it being announced, ‘This is the reward of the one who abandons the Book and the Sunnah and turns to theological rhetoric (kalaam).”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sharh ‘AqeedatitTahaawiyyah of lbn Abil-’Izz, p. 75.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Abdul-Barr said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The people of Fiqh and Aathaar in all the various towns and cities are agreed unanimously that the Ahlul-Kalaam (People of Theological Rhetoric) are (but) Ahlul-Bida’ waz-Zaigh (the People of Innovations and Deviation). And they are not considered, by all of the above, to be amongst the ranks of the Scholars (in truth).”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Ibn Qudaamah in his Burhaan fee Bayaanil-Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ash-Shaafi’ee (d. 204H) said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“That a person is put to trial with everything that Allaah has forbidden, besides Shirk, is better than that he looks at Kalaam (theological rhetoric).” He also said, “If people knew what (misleading and destructive) desires are contained within theological rhetoric they would certainly flee from it as they would from a lion,”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">he also said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Whoever showed boldness in approaching theological rhetoric will never prosper.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Ibn Qudaamah in his Burhaan fee Bayaanil-Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the Scholars of ash-Shaash said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Every knowledge save that of the Qur’aan is a pre-occupation</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> Except for the Hadeeth and Fiqh (understanding) of the Deen</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> Knowledge is only that about which it is said,</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> ‘Haddathanaa &#8230;‘ (So and so narrated to us)</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> And what is besides that</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> Are but whisperings of the Shayaateen (devils)”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Yoosuf, the companion of Aboo Haneefah said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Whoever sought knowledge by kalaam (theological rhetoric) will turn a heretical apostate,” and Ahmad ibn Hanbal (d. 241H) said, “The person of theological rhetoric will never prosper. And never do you see anyone looking into theological rhetoric except that in his heart is a desire for creating mischief.”</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Both narrations are reported by Ibn Qudaamah in his Burhaan fee Bayaanil-Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[23] Muhammad Ibn Seereen (d. 110H) said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“They (i.e., the Companions and the Taabi’een) used to consider themselves upon the path (of truth) so long as they held onto the narrations.”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by al-Laalikaa’ee in his Sharh Usolil It’iqaad, no. 110.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaadh ibn Yahyaa said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“There is no path which is more straight and direct (in leading) to Paradise than the path of the one who travels upon the aathaar (narrations).”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by al-Laalikaa’ee in his Sharh UsoolilIt’qaad no. 112.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abdullah ibn alMubaarak (d. 181H) said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> “I found that the affair was Ittibaa’ (following and imitation, i.e., following and submission to the narrations).”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by al-Laalikaa’ee in his Sharh Usoolil-l’tiqaad, no. 113</p>

Translation Verified By: Abu Bilal Nahim</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Murtaza bIn Bakhsh:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who is upon the truth and who is upon falsehood? How will we know this and how will we be able to distinguish this? Is it possible without knowledge? Then, when will we seek knowledge? Is it not important that time be allocated? It is important; and knowledge is sought from the scholars. It is notjust sought from books. It is sought from scholars and students of knowledge. Those scholars who teach the Qur’aan and the Sunnah with the understanding of the Salaf of this Ummah &#8211; this confinement is obligatory, that there is the Quraan, authentic Hadeeth and they speak, teach the religion and give rulings according to the understanding of the Sahaabah (companions of Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wasallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you find such a scholar or such a student of knowledge somewhere, then do not leave him; and connect with the scholars, the senior scholars all praise be to Allaah &#8211; such scholars are present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now (seeking) knowledge has become easy, translations have come forth &#8211; in English, in Urdu, in every language. Shaykh bin Baaz rahimahullaah, Shaykh ibn Uthaymeen, (the) Muhaddith, Muhammad Naasiruddeen aI-Albaani rahimahullaah, there are (about) 10,000 cassettes of his &#8211; now we have CDs, but before the CDs there were (about) 10,000 cassettes. And if you just take out any cassette from the middle, you will notice that they contained the lessons of Tawheed and the Manhaj of the Salaf, in each of his cassettes. Far removed is Allah from all imperfections!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Saalih al-Fowzaan is alive [hafidhahullaah], Shaykh Saalih al-Luhaydaan is alive, Shaykh Ubayd al-Jaabiree, Shaykh Rabee&#8217; al-Madkhalee, Shaykh Muhammad bin Haadee aI-Madkhalee &#8211; they are those ‘Ulemaa, that if you attach yourself to them, by Allaah, life changes. There is light [of guidance] in their sayings; there is light in their guidance. If (you) want to learn the methodology of the Salaf, then this is the path, this is the methodology. There are other Salafee scholars as well but I remember these names, their names are known and famous. Do not say that I do not have a way to reach them. By Allaah, by sitting at home, nowadays, all praise be to Allaah, there are online duroos happening as well. Aren’t they happening? Use this technology correctly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People abuse it by listening to songs and what not. You use it correctly and see how you become a part of (seeking) beneficial knowledge and how it benefits you even after your death.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The following is posted from : <strong><a title="Magnificent Points of Advice for those who have turned to the Way of the Salaf – Ahmad Ash-Shihhee" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2014/10/01/magnificent-points-of-advice-for-those-who-have-turned-to-the-way-of-the-salaf-ahmad-ash-shihhee/">Magnificent Points of Advice for those who have turned to the Way of the Salaf </a></strong>– Abu ‘Abdillaah Ahmad bin Muhammad Ash-Shihhee. This book was read to Allaamaah Rabee’ al-Madkhalee who gave some good instructions regarding it.</p>
<p>AUTHOR: Abu ‘Abdillaah Ahmad bin Muhammad ash-Shihhee<br />
SOURCE: His book “Al-Wasaayah as-Saniyyah Lit-Taa’ibeena ilaas-Salafiyyah” (pg. 34-39)<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Second Advice: Seeking Knowledge is the Foundation for the Correctness of your Repentance</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So knowledge is the foundation for the correctness of your repentance. This is due to two reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: For the most part, the misconceptions (you had prior to your repentance) will remain attached to your heart and your mind. So if you do not correct it with beneficial knowledge, you will find yourself accompanied by these misconceptions in your statements, actions and circumstances. Rather, you will find them mixed into your Da’wah (calling to the Way of Allaah), as is the condition of many of those who have leaped from (just) making their repentance to (being active in) the field of Da’wah. So they have begun calling to the Salafee Da’wah, however this call is mixed with the Ikhwaanee misconceptions of gathering people together (regardless of Creed) or the Qutubee misconceptions of making takfeer (declaring Muslims disbelievers) or the Surooree misconceptions of partisanship (hizbiyyah)! So the image displayed is Salafiyyah, but the taste and the smell derived from it is something else!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, their call turns into a Salafiyyah, which consists of particular standards that can have their roots traced back to the misconceptions they had propr to their repentance, which still accompany them and which they have not yet corrected. So you find this person calling to leadership in Da’wah (i.e. that there should be one leader for organizing all the Da’wah in a land).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that one rejects some of the principles of the Salafee Da’wah, claiming that they cause the hearts to be hardened! Or that they cause the brotherly ties to be broken! And this one agrees with the Qutubee ideologies!</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And that one calls to Hizbiyyah (partisanship)!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And this one carries ideas of instigation and provocation (of the masses)!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And that one pitches the tent for gathering the people together (regardless of differences)!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">All of this is done using the name of Salafiyyah, so to Allaah we turn for help! Verily to Allaah we belong and to Him we will return.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: Or perhaps you are carried away by the strong current of a misconception, such that your path and road towards repenting to Salafiyyah has changed course. So now you have become confused on this road or you begin calling to it, thinking that it is the truth when it is in fact misguidance!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How many games do these individuals who claim to have knowledge and stand for Salafiyyah play with the youth who seek to repent to Allaah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is due to nothing else except for their lack of seeking knowledge and their lack of asking questions from the people of knowledge from Ahlus-Sunnah walJamaa’ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, O repentant brother, may Allaah grant you success, you must seek beneficial knowledge, because it is that which will correct your repentance and set your path straight. With knowledge, you will free yourself from the misconceptions and the dangers, and you will save yourself from the hunting nets and snares, by the Will and Permission of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the evidences that indicate the virtue of knowledge and those who possess it, then they are many and well known. I will mention from them, for the purpose of reminding:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allaah bears witness that there is none that has the right to be worshipped but He. And so do the angels, and those having knowledge. (He is always) maintaining His creation with Justice. None has the right to be worshipped but He, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise</strong></span>.” [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is only those who have knowledge amongst His slaves that fear Allaah</strong></span>.” [Surah Faatir: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><span style="color:#000000;">Allaah will raise in degree those of you who believe, and those who have been given knowledge.</span></strong>” [Surah Al-Mujaadilah: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah’s saying, reminding of the blessing He bestowed on His Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) due to what He sent down to him from the Book (Qur’aan) and the Hikmah (Sunnah) and protecting him from people misleading him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Had not the Grace of Allaah and His Mercy been upon you (O Muhammad), a party of them would certainly have made a decision to mislead you, but (in fact) they mislead none except their own selves, and no harm can they do to you in the least. Allaah has sent down to you the Book (Qur&#8217;aan) and the Hikmah (Sunnah), and taught you that which you knew not. And Ever Great is the Grace of Allaah unto you.</strong></span>” [Surah An-Nisaa: 113]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, O repentant brother, when you come to know the importance and virtue of knowledge, and the danger of neglecting it, then know that the first thing you should start with from the various branches of knowledge is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a title="Permanent Link to Begin by Learning the Fundamentals of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/01/15/beginbylearning/" rel="bookmark">Begin by Learning the Fundamentals of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">So this sermon consists of the advice to fear Allaah, which is necessary and it is not exemplified except in the lives of the righteous, truthful scholars as in the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allaah</strong></span>. &gt;&gt;[Fatir: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fear Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em> so you can reach this level and learn so that you can reach that status; because the one who knows the correct <em>‘Aqeedah</em>, <em>Manhaj</em> and rulings, manners and behaviour springing from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> then he is the one who fears Allaah<em>Azza wa Jal</em> and <em>Taqwa</em> is attained with all of these matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when these matters – which we have mentioned – are acknowledged then the slave is driven to the <em>Taqwa</em> of Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em>, to having fear of Him and being aware of Him in every time, place and situation.  This is a great station which is the station of <em>al-Ihsaan</em> (perfection of worship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>That you worship Allaah as if you see Him and if you cannot see Him then know that He sees you</strong></span>.'[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This station of <em>al-Ihsaan</em> (perfection of worship) is that a person has certainty that Allaah sees him and that Allaah hears all he says and hears; the beating of his heart, the feelings of his heart and what he thinks to himself.   Allaah<em>Subhanahu Wa Ta’ala</em> knows it and hears it and He sees his movements and when he is still.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the true believer regards Allaah with true greatness and he acknowledges that Allaah <em>Subhanah</em> hears everything that he says and knows everything he discusses, or thinks to himself and that Allaah has:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Angels <em>Kirâman </em>(honourable)<em> Kâtibîn</em> writing down (your deeds). They know all that you do</strong></span>. &gt;&gt; [al-Infitar: 11-12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if these distinguished feelings are found in the soul of a believer then he has acquired the characteristic of <em>Taqwa</em> which causes him to keep away from sinning,<em>Shirk, Bida’</em> and superstitions and he acquires the station of <em>al-Ihsaan</em>(perfection of worship) since he is aware of Allaah and he feels that Allaah sees him and he cannot hide anything of his affairs from Allaah not a little nor a lot, not even the like of an atom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a noble awareness and distinguished feeling which pushes one <em>-InshAllaah –</em> to the <em>Taqwa</em> of Allaah.  This cannot be reached except for the one who knows the correct <em>‘Aqeedah</em>, the correct rulings of <em>Halaal</em> and <em>Haraam</em> and knows the commands and prohibitions, the promise and the warnings from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam</em><strong><em>.  </em></strong>They are the ones who deserve the praise of Allaah <em>– Tabaraka wa Ta’ala –</em> He said; about them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allaah</strong></span>.&gt;&gt; [Fatir: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong>Allaah will exalt in degree those of you who believe and those who have been granted knowledge</strong>. &gt;&gt; [al-Mujadilah: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So strive to be from these types of people: i.e. that you combine knowledge and action.  That is the fruit of correct knowledge and having the <em>Taqwa</em> of Allaah <em>– Tabaraka wa Ta’ala –</em> and being aware of Him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is upon him to learn from the sources which contain the correct beliefs and correct methodologies, to read the <em>Salafi Tafseer</em> books, which are based upon the <em>Tafseer</em> of the Book of Allaah by the Book of Allaah, by the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah and by the <em>Fiqh</em> of the noble Companions those who lived through the descent of the revelation and were present at the time of the Messenger of Allaah <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> and lived with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They knew the aim of the Book and the Sunnah. They are the ones whose <em>Fiqh </em>should be held on to as they preserved the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam</em><em>.  </em>This is why the noble Messenger –<em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam –</em> when he spoke about splitting up into sects and spoke about the <em>Firqaat-Un Najeeyah</em> said: ‘<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Those who are upon what I am upon and my Companions</strong></span>.'[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this <em>Fiqh</em> of the true <em>Deen</em> of Allaah which the noble Companions had – which they acquired from the Book of Allaah and from the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, from his sayings, actions, his teachings and his directives – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam –</em> it is obligatory upon us to take it as our reference.  The Companions are the intended believers in the saying of Allaah <em>– Tabaraka wa Ta’ala -:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been shown clearly to him and follows other than the believers’ way. We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and burn him in Hell – what an evil destination.</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [an-Nisaa: 115]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a severe threat to the one who contends with Allaah and His Messenger and follows a path other than that of the believers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So pay attention to this matter and strive to understand the way of the believers which they derived from the Book of Allaah, the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam </em>– and from his purifying and educating them upon the Book and the wisdom <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a great opportunity for you; understand from it the true <em>Deen</em> of Allaah and strive earnestly to make it apparent over all religions with proofs and evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is upon you to seek knowledge from its original watering sources; from the <em>Salafi</em> books of <em>Tafseer</em>, from the <em>Salafi</em> books of <em>‘Aqeedah</em>, which gush forth from the Book of Allaah and from the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah –<em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam</em>.  The difference between the way of the truthful believers and the way of the innovating discriminators of the true <em>Manhaj</em> of Allaah will become clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They – I swear by Allaah – are the protectors of this <em>Ummah</em> upon the <em>Deen</em> of Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em>, they had the correct <em>‘Aqeedah</em> and <em>Manhaj</em> and they were firmly upon what Muhammad <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> came with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From what is understood principally, is that it is obligatory upon us to follow the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> to hold on firmly to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> and to bite onto that with our molar teeth, just as the Messenger of Allaah mentioned – when he gave an eloquent sermon whereby tears fell and the hearts trembled  – the Companions requested him to give them some advice they said ; O Messenger of Allaah it is as if this is a farewell sermon, so advise us, he said: ‘<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>I advise you to fear Allaah…….</strong></span>’  pay attention to this advice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>….to hear and obey, whoever lives from amongst you will see many differences so it is upon you to hold on to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly guided <em>Khulafah</em>, bite on to it with your molar teeth, beware of newly invented matters, for every newly invented matter is a <em>Bida</em>’ and every <em>Bida’</em> is misguidance.</strong></span>’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[1] Translator’s note: Due to the saying of the noble Messenger of Allaah<em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> ‘Whoever does not thank the people does not thank Allaah.’ As narrated by Abee Sa’eed, &amp; authenticated by al-Albaani in as-Saheehah, I say that may Allaah reward with all goodness in this life and in the Hereafter the brother who facilitated us with the booklet and aided us in its translation.  And to our editor, may Allaah enter her into the highest grades of His Paradise among the Prophets, the Companions and the righteous for all her efforts.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[2] Narrated by Tirmidhi (2641) from the hadeeth of Abdullaah bin ‘Amr –radhiAllaahu anhu- &amp; regarded as Hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’ (5343).</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">The Explanation of:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>وَبَارِكْ لِي فِيمَا أَعْطَيْتَ</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"> <strong>“Bless me in what You have given…”</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabic word <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>بَرَكَة</strong></span> (<strong>barakah</strong>) “<strong>blessing</strong>” literally means an abundance of anything good that is continuous. The scholars even trace this word and its meaning back to the word <strong>بِرْكَة</strong> (<strong>birkah</strong>) which means a large amount of water or any wide container or gathering of water that is constantly filled with water. Similarly, the word blessing means a continuously large amount of good. So the meaning of this statement is: <strong><em>Send blessings down upon everything you have given me.</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The wording, “…in what you have given…” is comprehensive including anything Allah has given us of wealth, children, knowledge, and anything else Allah ( سبحانه وتعالى ) has bestowed upon us. So you ask Allah to put blessings in all of that. If Allah does not put blessings in what he has given you, you would surely be prevented from a great amount of good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">How many people have a wealth in abundance, yet it is as if they live in poverty?</span></strong> This is because they gain no real benefit from their wealth; they simply collect it and never benefit from it. This is the result of the blessings being removed from it. Likewise, many people have lots of children and grandchildren, yet their children do not benefit their parents in anything due to their disobedience and ungratefulness. Such people have not been blessed in their children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>You also find some people to whom Allah has given a great amount of knowledge, yet it is as if he is illiterate.</strong></span> You see no traces of knowledge upon him in his worship, in his character, in his manners, nor in the way he treats others. Rather, his knowledge may even increase him in arrogance and considering himself to be above the rest of Allah’s worshippers, belittling and humiliating them. Such a person does not realize the one who bestowed this knowledge upon him is none other than Allah. You see that he never benefits people with his knowledge, neither with lessons, nor advice, nor with writings. On the contrary, he is exclusively centered only upon himself. This is without doubt a great loss, even though religious knowledge is one of the most blessed things Allah gives to a servant. One reason for this is that when you teach others and spread this knowledge among people, you are rewarded from several different perspectives:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. When you spread this religious knowledge, you are spreading the religion of Allah ( عزّ وجلّ ). So you work for the sake of Allah, opening people’s hearts with knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. From the blessings of spreading knowledge and teaching it is that by doing so, there is the preservation and protection of Allah’s legislation (religious laws). If it weren’t for the passing on of knowledge, the legislation would not have been preserved.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Also from the blessings of spreading knowledge is that when you teach others, you do them a great deal of good. You give them insight into the religion of Allah. And when that person then worships Allah with knowledge and insight, you are rewarded with similar rewards he is given because it was you who directed him towards a particular good deed, and the one who directs another to do something good is just like the one who actually does it. [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Also, by spreading and teaching religious knowledge, one’s own knowledge increases. It is known that anyone who teaches a particular knowledge to people, his knowledge in that subject will increase. This is because in teaching, one is recalling what he previously learned and memorized as well as learning new things that he must prepare. To this meaning, there is a famous (Arabic) proverb regarding wealth, “It increases by spending it often, and it decreases if held in a tight fist.” Similarly, if knowledge is withheld and not taught, it will eventually decrease.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15] A proof of this is the ḥadīth recorded by Muslim (no. 1893), al-Tirmidhī (no. 2671), Abū Dāwūd (no. 5129), and by Aḥmad in which the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>مَنْ دَلَّ عَلَى خَيْرٍ فَلَهُ مِثْلُ أَجْرِ فَاعِلِهِ</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"> <strong>Whoever directs someone to do something good, he will have a reward like the one who actually did it.</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Explanation of: اللَّهُمَّ اهْدِنِي فِيمَنْ هَدَيْتَ</strong><br />
<strong> “Oh Allah, guide me with those You have guided.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Guide me to the truth and assist me in acting in accordance with it. Complete, beneficial guidance is that in which Allah combines for a servant both knowledge and action. Guidance without action is of no real benefit. Rather it is even harmful because if a person does not act in accordance with what he already knows, his knowledge becomes evidence against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of guidance in the form of knowledge but with no action is the verse of Allah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>As for Thamūd, we guided them but they preferred blindness over guidance.</strong></span> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: We clarified the path to them and we conveyed the knowledge to them. However, they preferred blindness over guidance, and from this we seek refuge with Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from this type of guidance – simply giving the knowledge and clarifying the truth – is the statement of Allah (سبحانه و تعالى)to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And certainly, you guide to the straight path.</strong></span>[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: You direct the people to the straight path and teach them about it. As for the other type of guidance which is the granting of success, an example of this type is the verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Indeed, you can’t guide whoever you like</strong></span>.[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This type is the guidance of granting one success in their deeds. In this case, the messenger ( صلى الله عليه و سلم ) is never able to grant someone the success of their good actions as this type of guidance is specific to Allah alone. If the prophet ( صلى الله عليه و سلم ) were capable of that type of guidance, he would have guided his uncle, Abū Ṭālib. He did try to guide his uncle and even when he was about to die, the Prophet ( صلى الله عليه و سلم ) said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Oh uncle, say, “There is nothing worthy of worship except Allah,&#8221; – a statement by which I will testify on your behalf before Allah.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But the decree of Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) had already passed that the prophet’s uncle would be from the inhabitants of the Fire, and from this we seek refuge with Allah. So Abū Ṭālib neither said nor believed that nothing has the right to be worshipped except Allah. The last thing he said before dying was that he would remain upon the religion of ‘AbdulMuṭṭalib.8 Despite this, Allah allowed his messenger ( صلى الله عليه و سلم ) to intercede for Abū Ṭālib, not just because he was the prophet’s uncle, but because he used to continually defend the prophet ( صلى الله عليه و سلم ) and Islam (even though he did not personally accept Islam). So the Prophet ( صلى الله عليه و سلم ) interceded for Abū Ṭālib and as a result of this intercession, he ( صلى الله عليه و سلم ) said about his uncle:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is in the lowest part of the fire, and if it were not for me, he would have been in the lowest, deepest part of the fire.[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet ( صلى الله عليه و سلم ) also said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Perhaps my intercession will benefit him on the Day of Resurrection so that he will be put into the lowest part of the fire, it reaching only to his ankles, yet from which his brain will boil.</strong></span> [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when we say in the Du’ā of Qunūt, “Guide us with those you have guided,&#8221; we are asking Allah for both types of guidance: the guidance of knowledge and the guidance of being successful in our actions. As an example, the following verse also includes both of these types of guidance:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Guide us to the straight path.</strong></span> [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when anyone says this du’ā he should sincerely call to mind that he is asking for both types of guidance: the guidance of the correct knowledge and the guidance of acting in accordance with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the wording, “…with those you have guided,&#8221; this is a way of seeking nearness to Allah by mentioning his favors on others in that he guided them. So we also ask him to bestow the same favor upon us and guide us. In other words, we ask you (Allah) for guidance, and receiving it is only by virtue of your mercy, your wisdom, and your past favors as you have guided others</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><em><strong>The Forbiddence Of Adhering Blindly To The Saying Of A Scholar In Opposition To An Authentic Text, And The Severe Rebuke Due Upon One Who Is Guilty Of This (Part I)</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn `Abdil-Wahhaab – rahimahullaah – said in &#8220;Fathul-Majeed‟ (2/527-530), in explanation of the saying of Ibn `Abbaas – radiyallaahu `anhumaa &#8211; :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Stones will soon fall upon you from the sky. I say: Allaah‟s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said…, and you say: Aboo Bakr and `Umar said!”</span> :-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“…This saying from Ibn `Abbaas – radiyallaahu `anhumaa – was a response to those who said to him: &#8220;Aboo Bakr and `Umar &#8211; radiyallaahu `anhumaa – did not hold joining the `Umrah along with the Hajj (at-tamattu`), and they held that performing Hajj on its own (al-Ifraad) is better‟, or the like of that…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in summary, it was because of this that Ibn `Abbaas said, when they countered the Hadeeth with the opinion of Aboo Bakr and `Umar -: “Stones are about to fall upon you from the sky…” – the hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <strong>Imaam ash-Shaafi`ee</strong> – rahimahullaah – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The scholars are agreed, by consensus, that whoever is such that the Sunnah of Allaah‟s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) becomes clear to him, then it is not for him to leave it for the saying of anyone.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <strong>Imaam Maalik</strong> – rahimahullaahu ta`aalaa – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There is none of us except that he rebuts and is rebutted, except for the occupant of this grave (صلى الله عليه وسلم)”,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and the speech of the imaams with this meaning is abundant…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…So the speech of Ibn `Abbaas – radiyallaahu `anhumaa – shows that whoever receives a textual proof, and he does not accept it, because of taqleed (blind-following) of his imaam, then it is obligatory to criticize him severely, because of his opposing the proof.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Imaam Ahmad said: “Ahmad ibn `Umar al-Bazzaar narrated to us: Ziyaad ibn Ayyoob narrated to us: Aboo `Ubaydah al-Haddaad narrated to us: from Maalik ibn Deenaar: from `Ikrimah: from Ibn `Abbaas, who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There is not one of us except that some of his sayings are taken, and some are left; except for the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore it is obligatory to criticise whoever leaves the proof in favour of anyone from the scholars, no matter who that is. The recorded sayings of the imaams clearly state this; and state that <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘taqleed’ (blind-following) is not allowable except in matters of ijtihaad (personal deduction) for which no proof is found in the Book or the Sunnah</strong></span>. So this is what some of the scholars meant by their saying: <em>‘There is to be no criticism in the matters of ijtihaad (personal deduction).’</em> As for the one who acts contrary to the Book and the Sunnah, then it is obligatory to refute him; just as was said by Ibn `Abbaas, ash-Shaafi`ee, Maalik, and Ahmad – and this is something agreed upon, as has preceded in the speech of Imaam ash-Shaafi`ee &#8211; rahimahullaahu ta`aalaa…”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><em><strong>The Forbiddence Of Adhering Blindly To The Saying Of A Scholar In Opposition To An Authentic Text, And The Severe Rebuke Due Upon One Who Is Guilty Of This (Part II)</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn `Abdil-Wahhaab – rahimahullaah – said in &#8220;Fathul-Majeed‟ (2/532), in explanation of the saying of Imaam Ahmad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I am amazed at a people who are aware of the chain of narration and its authenticity, and yet they hold on to the opinion of Sufyaan, whereas Allaah – the Most High – says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">So let those who oppose the Messenger‟s command beware, lest a fitnah (affliction) befalls him, or a painful torment be inflicted upon him</span>.[Sooratun-Noor (24):63]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do you know what the affliction is? The affliction is <strong>Shirk</strong>. Perhaps if he rejects something from his saying, some deviation will fall into his heart and he is destroyed.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So the saying of Imaam Ahmad – rahimahullaah – “I am amazed at a people who are aware of the chain of narration and its authenticity…” is a criticism from him of that; and shows that it leads to deviation of the hearts, which causes a person to become a Disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">So this evil has become extremely widespread, particularly amongst those who claim attachment to knowledge. They do whatever they can to prevent people from acting upon the Book and the Sunnah; and they block people from following the Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم), and from honouring and respecting his commands and prohibitions. So from that is their saying: &#8220;No one except a &#8220;mujtahid‟ can use the Book and the Sunnah as proof, and &#8220;ijtihaad‟ has ended‟, and the saying: &#8220;This person who I am blindly following knows better than you do about hadeeth, and about the abrogating and abrogated narrations‟, and the like of these sayings, whose goal is just the abandonment of following of the Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم): he who does not speak from his own desires, in favour of dependence upon sayings of those who can err, and who is contradicted by other imaams and whose saying can be nullified by a textual proof. So there is not an imaam except that he only possessed a portion of knowledge; he did not possess all of it. So what is obligatory upon every legally responsible person, when a proof from the Book of Allaah or the Sunnah of His Messenger reaches him, and he understands its meaning, is that he accepts it and acts upon it, no matter who contradicts it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is just as He – the Most High – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Follow what has been sent down to you from your Lord; and do not take others besides Him: obeying them in disobedience to Him. Little do you remember!</span> [Sooratul-A`raaf (7):3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He – the Most High – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Is it not sufficient for them that We sent down to you this Book which is recited to them?! In it there is mercy and a reminder for those who believe in it</span> [Sooratul-`Ankaboot (29):51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A statement of the consensus (ijmaa`) upon that has already preceded [1] , and an explanation that the blind-follower (muqallid) is not from the people of knowledge; and Aboo `Umar ibn `Abdil-Barr and others also report ijmaa` (consensus) upon that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[1] Transl. Note: [i.e. from Imaam ash-Shaafi`ee.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: And no one disagrees with this except for the ignorant ones from the blind-followers, because of their ignorance of the Book and the Sunnah, and because of their turning away from these two. So those people, even if they think that they are following the imaams, then in reality they have only contradicted them and followed other than their way. So we have already quoted the saying of Maalik, ash-Shaafi`ee, and Ahmad. <strong>However in the speech of Ahmad – rahimahullaah – there is an indication that &#8220;taqleed‟ (blind-following) before the proof reaches is not blameworthy; rather it is only criticised for one whom the proof has reached, and he opposes it in favour of the saying of one of the imaams.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this only comes about as a result of their turning away from seeking to understand the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger; and turning instead to the books of the later people, and sufficing with them to the exclusion of the two parts of Revelation. So this resembles what occurred with the People of the Book: those about whom Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">They took their scholars and monks as lords besides Allaah</span> [Sooratut-Tawbah (9):31],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">an explanation of which will follow in the hadeeth of `Adiyy ibn Haatim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is binding upon the one who is sincere is that when he reads the books of the scholars, and examines them, and becomes aware of their sayings, that he submits them to what is found in the Book, and the Sunnah; for every mujtahid from the scholars, and those who follow him and ascribe themselves to his madhhab, must mention his evidence; and the truth in any matter is one; and the imaams are rewarded for their ijtihaad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore the justly balanced person makes examination of their speech, and consideration of it a path to acquiring awareness of the different issues, and a means to bring them to mind, and a way to distinguish what is correct from what is incorrect – by means of the evidences which those who use the evidences mention; so that in this way he will become aware of which scholar was most fortunate in having the proof.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the proofs for this fundamental principle are more than can be enumerated, in the Book of Allaah and in the Sunnah likewise….</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the imaams – rahimahumullaah – did not fall short in clarifying this matter. Rather they forbade that they be followed blindly when the Sunnah becomes clear, because they knew that there were matters of knowledge unknown to them, and that this knowledge could reach others, and this occurs a great deal; and this will not be hidden from one who examines the sayings of the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Haneefah – rahimahullaah – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“When a hadeeth comes from Allaah‟s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) then it is upon the head and the eyes; and if something comes from the Companions – radiyallaahu `anhum – then upon the head and the eyes; and if something comes from the Taabi`een, then we are men and they were men.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“If I say a saying, and the Book of Allaah contradicts it, then abandon my saying in favour of the Book of Allaah.” It was said: &#8220;If the saying of Allaah‟s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) contradicts it?‟ He said: “Abandon my saying for the narration of the Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم). It was said: &#8220;If the saying of the Companions contradicts it?‟ He said: “Abandon my saying for the saying of the Companions.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And ar-Rabee` said: I heard ash-Shaafi`ee – rahimahullaah – say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“If you find in my book something contrary to the Sunnah of Allaah‟s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم), then take hold of the Sunnah of Allaah‟s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and leave whatever I said.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“When a hadeeth is authentic with something contrary to my saying, then throw my saying against the wall.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Maalik said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Everyone is such that some of his sayings are taken and some are left, except for Allaah‟s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the like of this has already been mentioned from him, so there is no excuse for a blind-follower (muqallid) after this… .”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><em><strong>Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Saalih Al-`Uthaymeen On ‘Taqleed’ (Blindfollowing)</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-`Uthaymeen – rahimahullaah – said in &#8220;al-Qawlul-Mufeed `alaa Kitaabit-Tawheed‟ (2/152):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Some people commit a grievous mistake when it is said to them: &#8220;Allaah‟s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said‟, he says: &#8220;But in the book of so and so there occurs such and such.‟ So it is upon him to fear Allaah, Who said to him in His Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And the Day when Allaah will call to them, and say, &#8220;What response did you give to the Messengers?</span> [Sooratul-Qasas (28):65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He did not say: &#8220;What response did you give to so and so?‟ As for the author of the book, then if it is known that he loves good, and intends good, then supplication for forgiveness and mercy is made for him if he errs. It is not to be said that he is infallible, and his saying used to contradict the saying of the Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم).”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Does the one that listens to the cassette tapes of Ahl-ul-Bid&#8217;ah or reads their books in order to know what they believe fall into sitting with innovators?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân</strong>: It is as sitting with them or maybe even worse. But if he is learned and armed with knowledge and listens to them or reads their books to refute them and warn against them, it is okay.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, were he not to have knowledge and insight and wants to read them or listen to them, it is not allowed. It will get stuck into his head and he has nothing to repel it with. It is not allowed for him to listen to them if he cannot defend himself against these poisons and evilnesses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THE SECOND FOUNDATION:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is meant by the “knowledge” that is mentioned in the ayaat and the ahaadeeth is knowledge of the Religion. As for the universal, physical and material sciences, then these are all a collective obligation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These sciences fall under Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And prepare against them all you can of power, including steeds of war…”</span> [Surah Al- Anfaal: 60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They also fall under the principle: “There is no harming (of oneself) or harming others.” And they fall under the principle: “That which is necessary for the fulfilment of an obligation becomes itself obligatory.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This principle consists of the following matters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The statement: “<strong>This is obligatory for every Muslim or student of knowledge to know</strong>” cannot be applied unrestrictedly to any of the types of knowledge except for the Islamic sciences. An example of this is what is known nowadays as “<strong>Knowledge of Current Affairs</strong>”, which focuses on following reports and information from newspapers and magazines, and which some people say is: “An obligatory form of knowledge that every student of knowledge is required to learn!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The type of knowledge that the Salaf praised and which they intended by their statements is nothing else but <strong>knowledge of the Religion</strong>. This is the knowledge that was intended in statements such as that of Mu’aadh (radhi Allaahu anhu), when he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">Learn knowledge, for indeed learning it for the sake of Allaah is awe (of Him), seeking it is worship, studying it is glorification (of Allaah), researching it is Jihaad, teaching it to those unaware of it is charity, and giving it out to one’s family builds ties. It is a friend in privacy, a companion in solitude, a guide in times of ease, an aide in times of difficulty, a counselor to the friends (of Allaah), a close-relative to the strangers, and a lighthouse for the path to Paradise.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah raises people by way of it, thus making them noble leaders, emulated chiefs in matters of good, and guides to goodness whose footsteps are followed and whose deeds are highly regarded</span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, from the things that this principle entails is that: The knowledge that Allaah, His Messenger and the predecessors, such as the Sahaabah and the Taabi’een have praised is nothing else but knowledge of the Religion. As for all of the other forms of knowledge, they were not the ones intended in the praise for “knowledge” found in these ayaat, ahaadeeth and statements of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So knowledge of medicine, engineering, chemistry, and physics is not what was intended in the ayaat and ahaadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once we come to understand this, we must ask: “What is the ruling on learning these other sciences?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: It falls under the <strong>collective obligations</strong>, Acquiring knowledge of these sciences falls under (the principle): “That which is necessary for the fulfillment of an obligation becomes itself obligatory.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Acquiring knowledge of these sciences falls under the statement of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">And prepare against them all you can of power, including steeds of war…</span>” [Surah Al- Anfaal: 60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the ruling on these sciences. If some people take on the responsibility of learning them, the obligation becomes removed from everyone else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What also falls under the requisites of this principle is what I mentioned to you previously – that it cannot be unrestrictedly stated that these sciences or their likes are obligatory for every Muslim to know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So for all the more reason, <strong><span style="color:#333300;">it is incorrect to unrestrictedly say that the knowledge of that which is associated with newspapers and magazines is from the “knowledge” that every student is obliged to learn</span></strong>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The following is posted from : <strong><a title="Magnificent Points of Advice for those who have turned to the Way of the Salaf – Ahmad Ash-Shihhee" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2014/10/01/magnificent-points-of-advice-for-those-who-have-turned-to-the-way-of-the-salaf-ahmad-ash-shihhee/">Magnificent Points of Advice for those who have turned to the Way of the Salaf </a></strong>– Abu ‘Abdillaah Ahmad bin Muhammad Ash-Shihhee. This book was read to Allaamaah Rabee&#8217; al-Madkhalee who gave some good instructions regarding it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Fourth Advice: Do not take Knowledge except from one who is known to be upon the Sunnah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Muhammad bin Sireen (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">Verily, this knowledge is Religion. So look into (i.e. investigate) whom you take your Religion from</span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said: <span style="color:#008000;">“They (the Sahaabah) did not used to ask concerning the isnaad (chain of narration), but when the fitnah occurred, they began saying: ‘Name your men for us.&#8217; So the People of the Sunnah would be looked to and so their hadeeth would be accepted. And the People of Innovation would be looked to and so their hadeeth would not be accepted.&#8221;</span> [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when one of these repentant individuals neglects these principles and guidelines, he becomes an open target for these misconceptions and he becomes a play object for many of those who (falsely) ascribe themselves to knowledge and Salafiyyah. So all it takes is for a person to claim knowledge or manifest his connection to the scholars from Ahlus-Sunnah, and you will find the repentant youth flocking around him, without thoroughly examining the reality of his condition and without looking into his history (i.e. background). But When he sees that his followers have become many and those who love him have become engrossed with him, he begins to reveal what he was concealing and what (way) he really inclined to. So now you see him calling to (holding) leadership in the field of Da&#8217;wah and pitching a tent for gathering everyone (i.e. regardless of beliefs). Or you see him doing other things that are in opposition to the principles of Ahlus-Sunnah wal Jamaa&#8217;ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the point where the repentant individuals begin to become confused and divided into two or even three categories &#8211; those who agree, those who are against and those who are neutral. This confusion only comes about due to two things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: The repentant individual&#8217;s lack of devoting attention to beneficial knowledge, especially knowledge of the Fundamentals of Ahlus-Sunnah wal Jamaa&#8217;ah, since Knowledge protects the one who has it from deviations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Did you not see how knowledge protected Abu Bakrah (rady Alllaahu &#8216;anhu) in the Campaign of the Camel (Jamal),[9] when the people put the Mother of the Believers, ‘Aa&#8217;ishah (rady Allaahu &#8216;anhaa) forth (for the campaign). So what protected Abu Bakrah (rady Allaahu anhu) was a hadeeth he heard from Allaah&#8217;s Messenger, who said when news reached him of the death of Kisraa and the appointment of his daughter (as the leader): “A people that leave their affairs to be governed by a woman will never prosper.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So When the fitnah occurred, Abu Bakrah remembered this hadeeth and it protected him from that, such that he said: “Allaah protected me with something that I heard from the Messenger of Allaah When Kisraa died. He (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: Who did they put to succeed her?&#8217; They said: &#8216;Her daughter.&#8217; So he (sall Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8216;A people that leave their affairs to be governed by a woman Will never prosper.&#8217; So when &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah approached, i.e. Basrah, I remembered the statement of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger and so Allaah protected me by it.&#8221; [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: A lack or returning to the People Of Knowledge, Since the most deserving to be asked are the People of Knowledge and their students from Ahlus-Sunnah wal- Jamaa&#8217;ah, those who have knowledge of this individual whom the people seek to study under. so this person Should be enquired into:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is he from the Salafee students of knowledge or not?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And did he undergo valid educational studies, Such that he has the right to be sought knowledge from or no?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">SO if the answer is in the negative, then the issue comes to an end, all praise be to Allaah. And if the answer is positive, then he can be Studied under and benefited from, but without going to extremes in that matter. Rather, he should be given his due place and status.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an important point, which is: Differentiating between the enlightened Scholars, those Who are referred to in issues related to knowledge and current events, such as the two Imaams, Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee and ‘AbduI-‘Azeez bin ‘Abdillaah bin Baaz (rahimahumaAllaa) and those enlightened scholars Who remained after them, such as the Mashaayikh, Muhammad bin Saalih Al-‘Uthaymeen, Saalih bin Fawzaan Al-Fawzaan, Rabee&#8217; bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee, our Shaikh, Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi&#8217;ee and others who are at their level amongst the people Of knowledge and fatwaa from AhlusSunnah waI-Jamaa&#8217;ah. So these individuals have their own level and position&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And between the prominent students of knowledge, whose knowIedge is known and whose following of the Sunnah is apparent by way of their books and the commendations of the scholars for them. SO these individuals also have their own level and position&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And between those who are less than them, from the students of knowledge, Whose Salafiyyah is Known and Whose ability to teach is recognized.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] These last two narrations were reported by Imaam Muslim in his Introduction to his Saheeh</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] Translator&#8217;s Note: The Campaign of the Camel occurred after the murder of Uthmaan, radyAlllaahu &#8216;anhu. when there was much turmoil amongst the Muslims. ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib radullaahu &#8216;anhu was given the bav&#8217;ah (oath of allegiance) as the succeeding Khaleefih and he decided to wait for the turmoil to simmer down before seeking revenge from the assassin of ‘Uthmaan. So the Muslims Were divided into those who were With him on this decision and those Who wanted justice for his murder right away. A group was formed to go and voice their case to ‘Alee and they rallied several of the Sahaabah including ‘Aa‘isha radhi Allaahu &#8216;anhaa‘ So she participated in the campaign riding on a camel (hence the name Jamal). When the parties at Basrah, a peaceful agreement was decided, yet due to some misunderstanding and confusion battle broke out and many lives were lost. And Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] Reported by Al-Bukhaaree (7099), An-Nasaa‘ee (5403) and At-Tirmidhee (2365), and the wording mentioned here belongs to him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth: An Upright Heart</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The heart is the container where knowledge is stored. If the container is firm, it will store and protect what is placed in it, and if the container is damaged, it will lose what is placed in it.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه و سلم)&nbsp;made the heart the foundation of everything, as he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily, there is a morsel of flesh in the body that if it is correct, the entire body will be correct, and if it is corrupt, the entire body will be corrupt. Indeed, it is the heart.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An upright heart comes about through <strong>awareness of Allaah and knowledge of His Names, Attributes and Actions</strong>. It also comes about by way of <strong>reflecting on His signs and creations</strong>, and by <strong>pondering on the Qur&#8217;aan</strong>. An upright heart also comes about due to one constantly <strong>prostrating (in prayer)</strong> and frequently observing the <strong>night prayer</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should also avoid the things that corrupt and sicken the heart, since if these things are present in the heart, it will not be able to carry the knowledge. And even if the heart does carry it, it will not be understood, as Allaah says about the hypocrites &#8211; those with diseased hearts:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">They have heart with which they do not comprehend.</span>&#8221; [Surah Al-Araaf: 179]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The diseases of the heart are of two types: <strong>Desires</strong> and <strong>Doubts</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Desires are such as love for this worldly life and its pleasures and being preoccupied with that; love for unlawful images; listening to unlawful things such as musical voices and instruments; and looking at the forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Doubts are such as corrupt beliefs; innovated actions; and ascribing to innovated ideological movements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some other diseases of the heart that also serve as obstacles before knowledge are: jealousy, spite and pride.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some other things that corrupt the heart are: excessive sleep, excessive speech and excessive eating.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, one should avoid these diseases and corruptors in order to rectify the heart and make it upright.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following are the excerpts from  A speech delivered by His Eminence at Al-Jami` Al-Kabir in Riyadh on 27/4/1400 A.H., published in His Eminence&#8217;s book &#8220;Collection of Miscellaneous Fatwas and Articles&#8221;, vol. 9, pp. 128-141. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>Read the full speech  at <a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;PageID=1375&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=14" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.alifta.net</a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also authentically reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;<em><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>If Allah wills to do good to a person, He makes them comprehend Din &#8216;religion&#8217;.</strong></span></em>&#8221; (Agreed upon by Imams Al-Bukhari and Muslim).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This important Hadith shows us the excellence of comprehending Din.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Comprehending religion</strong> includes understanding the Qur&#8217;an, the Sunnah, and Islam. Islam covers the basics of Shari`ah, Allah&#8217;s Ordainment&#8217;s, His Prohibitions, a servant&#8217;s duty towards Allah and other servants and Allah&#8217;s fear, glorification, and watchfulness. In fact, the first step towards attaining knowledge is fearing Allah (Exalted be He), honoring His Sanctities, and watching Him in all deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever does not <strong>fear or be aware of Allah</strong> (Exalted be He) in their deeds, all their knowledge will be worthless. However, true beneficial knowledge and understanding of Din that leads to happiness is that which instills Allah&#8217;s Awe in a Muslim&#8217;s heart, directs them to honor Allah&#8217;s Sanctities, pushes them to obey Allah&#8217;s Orders and abstain from His Prohibitions, and urges them to call to Allah (Exalted be He) and to clarify Shari`ah to people. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So, anyone who is granted comprehension in religion in this way, Allah (Exalted be He) has indeed wanted to do them good.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, anyone deprived of these blessings will be among the ignorant, misguided and negligent who renounce attaining the knowledge that Allah (Exalted be He) has made obligatory. They will be among those whom Allah (Exalted be He) has not wanted to do good to them. Further, Allah (Exalted be He) talks about Kafirs (disbelievers) who turn away from the purpose of their creation, to teach us that it is our duty, as Muslims, to haste to comprehend religion and ask about any unclear matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;But those who disbelieve turn away from that whereof they are warned</span></em>.&#8221; </strong>[Surah Al-Ahqaf, 46: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And who does more wrong than he who is reminded of the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of his Lord, but turns away from them, forgetting what (deeds) his hands have sent forth.&#8221;  </span></em></strong>[Surah Al-Kahf, 18: 57]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consequently, it is the duty of a Muslim to seek for attaining knowledge in religion, to attend to, reflect on, and benefit from the Qur&#8217;an and pay great attention to, study, apply, and memorize the Sunnah as much as possible. When a person neglects these two basics, it is an indication that Allah (Exalted be He) did not will good for him. They are doomed since their heart is corrupt and deviating from the path to guidance. We ask Allah to protect and keep us away from whatever displeases Him!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dear Muslims, it is incumbent upon us to learn our religion and know its rulings and to attend to, meditate, reflect on, recite, and apply the Qur&#8217;an. In addition, we should give great care to, memorize, apply and study the Sunnah along with asking about ambiguous matters. Muslims should ask those who have more knowledge to find out the correct answer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) says: &#8220;<em><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So ask the people of the Scripture, if you do not know</strong></span></em>.&#8221; [Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, a Muslim can attend knowledge lessons and benefit from them and study with other knowledgeable Muslims to benefit from them and add to himself. In this way, a Muslim can attain comprehension of religion and avoid the characteristics of the negligent and heedless.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, <em><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;If Allah wills to do good to a person, He makes him comprehend the Din.&#8221; </strong></span></em>[1]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">From Shaykh, <em>Allaama, Mufti</em> of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Abdul Azeez bin Abdullaah Bin Baz</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">by Umm Yahya </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Noble Shaykh Bin Baz <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The reward for reciting the Book of Allaah is evident. Is there a reward for reading Hadeeth too?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is a great reward for reading the Noble Qur’an in terms of coming closer to Allaah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala, as is reading and memorizing the Hadeeth of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>. And this is because it is worship of Allaah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala (in pursuit of) acquiring knowledge and a greater understanding of the religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Evidence in the <em>Shariah</em> indicates that seeking knowledge and gaining an understanding of the religion is obligatory in order for the slave to worship His Lord upon firm knowledge (<em>Baseerah</em>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of this evidence is the saying of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever Allaah wills good for He grants them the understanding of the Deen (religion)’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The best of you are those who learn the Qur’aan and teach it’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever treads a path seeking knowledge on that path, then Allaah makes the path to paradise easy for him due to his seeking knowledge, and no group of people gather in one of the houses of Allah reciting the Book of Allaah and studying it, except tranquility descends and they are covered with Mercy and the angels surround them and Allaah mentions them to those who are close to Him’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there are many Hadeeth regarding the virtues of reciting the Qur’aan such as the saying of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Recite the Qur’aan for verily it will come as an intercession for the one who recites it on the Day of Resurrection’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And one day the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> came out and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Who would like to go to <em>Bathaan</em> (a valley in Medina) or to <em>al-Aqeeq</em> (a valley in Makkah) and return with two great female camels, without sinning and without severing the ties of kinship?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O Messenger of Allaah we would love that’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If one of you went to the masjid and learnt or read two <em>Ayaat</em> from the Book of Allah Azza wa Jal  (that) is better for him than two female camels and three <em>Ayaat</em> are better than four female camels and in addition to that the same amount in male camels’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As is collected by Imam Muslim in ‘Saheeh Muslim’ and this is an evidence concerning the virtue of reciting the Qur’aan and teaching it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is (another) famous Hadeeth from Ibn Mas’ood which is collected in ‘Jamia Tirmidhi’ with a <em>Hassan</em> (good) chain of narrators that the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever reads one letter from the Book of Allaah he gets one reward for it and one reward is equivalent to ten times the reward of it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is the same for reading the Sunnah, if a believer learns it by reading the<em>Ahadeeth</em> and studying them and memorizing them, distinguishing the authentic from the non authentic, then he will receive a great reward. This is because this is considered acquiring knowledge, concerning which the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever treads a path seeking knowledge on that path, then Allaah makes the path to paradise easy for him due to his seeking knowledge, and no group of people gather in one of the houses of Allaah reciting the Book of Allaah and studying it, except tranquility descends and they are covered with Mercy and the angels surround them and Allaah mentions them to those who are close to Him’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is proof of reading the <em>Ayaat</em> and reflecting upon them, studying Hadeeth and memorizing them, desiring knowledge and (desiring) an understanding of the religion and acting upon it (consequently) is from (one of the reasons) for entering paradise and being saved from the hell-fire. As the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever Allah wills good for He grants them the understanding of the Deen (religion)’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a consensus with regard to its authenticity and it clarifies the virtue of knowledge and seeking it, and that is a sign of goodness as we clarified earlier. And the understanding of the <em>Deen</em> is attained through the Book (The Qur’aan) and through the Sunnah (Hadeeth) therefore (attaining the) understanding the Sunnah is a sign that Allah has intended goodness for His slave, there is a lot of evidence to substantiate (this point).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is for Allah Lord of the worlds</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#666699;">Taken From A lecture ‘From the Principles of the <em>Dawatus-Salafeeyah</em>’</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">By the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a Muslim is guided to the path of goodness, some say that it is necessary for him to adhere to a Shaykh from whom he can take a <em>Tareeqah</em> (a path) because Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; the Most Merciful, so ask about Him one well informed. &gt;&gt; [Furqan: 59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is truthful:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; So ask the people of knowledge if you do not know.  &gt;&gt; [Nahl: 43]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Shaykh Answered:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah –<em>Subhanahu wa Ta’ala</em> – also says: &lt;&lt; So ask the people of knowledge if you do not know. &gt;&gt; [Nahl: 43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said in the story of the man who went on a battle along with some of the Companions of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>.</em>This man became afflicted with wounds, and in the morning he became defiled and thus it was obligatory upon him to have a <em>Ghusl</em> (ritual washing). He asked those around him if they could find a concession for him so that he would not have to make a<em>Ghusl</em>.  They said to him you must make a <em>Ghusl</em>, he did so and died due to those wounds that were upon his body, when that news reached the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>, the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘They killed him, may Allaah fight them, if only they had asked when they did not know indeed that is the cure for any question.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that these two previously mentioned <em>Ayaat</em> and this hadeeth places the Islaamic world in regards to knowledge and ignorance into two categories.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first category are few in number and they are the people of knowledge and the other category are more in number and they are those who do not know, as you have heard in the previous <em>Ayaah</em> &lt;&lt; So ask the people of knowledge if you do not know.  &gt;&gt; [Nahl: 43]   Allaah placed an obligation upon every one of these two types.  He made it obligatory upon those who do not know to ask the People of knowledge and He made it obligatory upon the People of Knowledge to answer the questioner as is authentically reported from the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever is asked about knowledge and he conceals that knowledge then he will be reined with a rein/bridle made of fire on the Day of Judgement.’ [Collected by Abu Dawood, Tirmidhi &amp; authenticated by Albaani in Saheeh Targheeb wa Tarheeb]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is necessary for the one who is not an <em>‘Aalim</em> (scholar) that he should be a student of knowledge or at the very least he should ask the people of knowledge as is mentioned in the <em>Athar</em> from Mu’adh <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Be a scholar, or one who learns knowledge, or one who listens to knowledge, and do not be the fourth and be destroyed.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The last one is the one who does not listen to knowledge nor asks about it, so at that time he lives like an ignorant person not knowing how to worship Allaah –<em>Tabaraka wa Ta’ala</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Asking the people of knowledge is an issue where there is a difference of opinion, as for adhering to a Shaykh, a Shaykh of a <em>Tariqah</em> (following a certain Soofi path), then here you have come to know that the path which reaches to Allaah –<em>Subhanahu wa Ta’ala</em> – is the straight path which the noble Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> left us upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars are those who direct/show/indicate this path, so they are the ones to whom it is obligatory to ask, and it is not permissible to adhere to a Shaykh and single him out to follow, and to learn from him and not to learn from the other scholars, because here occurs a great mistake which is that just like as it is obligatory upon us to single out Allaah –<em>Subhanahu wa Ta’ala</em> – Alone for worship, it is also obligatory upon us to single out the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> in following him and it is not allowed to stick and follow just one from amongst the scholars, no matter how this scholar from amongst them was from the excellent and standing, since this status is not for anyone, except the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and this is from the meaning of the statement of the one who witnesses that: <em>‘Ashhadu all</em><em>a ilaha ‘illa Allaah wahdahu la shareeka lahu wa anna Muhammadan Abduhu wa Rasooluhu</em> (I testify that there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah Alone and He has no partners and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger’)  so he is the one who has to be followed from amongst the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a Muslim adheres to one Shaykh or one teacher who teaches him, and he does not benefit from the other <em>Mushayikh</em> and other scholars from knowledge then this is violation of following the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>because it is necessary to take all the scholars as indicators/directors who show us what our Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>was upon, and one single scholar no matter how much knowledge he has been given, and the matter regarding him and the right of every scholar, Allaah –<em>Subhanahu wa Ta’ala</em> – said: &lt;&lt;And mankind has not been given of knowledge except a little. &gt;&gt; [Al-Isra: 85] so this is an old superstition of the<em>Soofeeyah</em> that it is obligatory that every Muslim has to adhere to a Shaykh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We say: that it is obligatory upon every Muslim that he should be either a scholar or a learner or a listener or otherwise he will be destroyed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for adhering to a Shaykh and singling him out alone then this is from the actions of the <em>Shaytaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah –<em>Subhanahu wa Ta’ala</em> – to give us all the capability to follow the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah and what the Salaf as-Salih were upon and keep us away from following other paths, upon which at the head of every path is a <em>Shaytaan</em> calling the people to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And, [moreover], this is My path, which is straight, so follow it; and do not follow [other] ways, for you will be separated from His way&gt;&gt; [An’am: 153]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And all Praise belongs to Allaah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">The Book of Knowledge Of the Imaam, the Haafidh: Abu Khaithama Zuhair Ibn Harb An-Nasaa’ee</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Checking and Notes by:Imaam Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Translation by:isma’eel alarcon &#8211; al-ibaanah.com</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>INTRODUCTION TO THE BOOK</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah and may His peace and blessings be on the Final Messenger, his family and those who follow him in goodness until the Day of Judgement. To Proceed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are pleased to present this, our seventh E-Book, entitled: “<strong>The Book of Knowledge</strong>” &#8211; a complete translation of the classical work “<strong>Kitaab-ul-‘Ilm</strong>” of Imaam Abu Khaithama An-Nasaa’ee (rahimahullaah). This treatise is comprised of a collection of ahaadeeth (sayings of the Prophet) and athaar (sayings of the Salaf) on the subject of Islaamic Knowledge. By reading the various narrations, it is hoped that the reader will benefit and reflect on the merits and virtues of seeking, acquiring and teaching knowledge. The treatise also provides a first-hand look on how the Salaf’s attitude was with respect to knowledge – how they sought it, how they learned it and how they taught it to others. There are several narrations, also, that give us a description of the characteristics of some of the Salaf, their knowledge and their virtues.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, this treatise is of the utmost importance, as it provides the reader with an account of the Salaf &#8211; those whom we are obligated to follow and take their example. And it deals with one of the most important topics in Islaam, which is Knowledge, since knowledge is the foundation that is required before doing all sayings and actions. Al-Haafidh Ibn &#8216;Abd-il-Barr said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;The scholars have unanimously agreed that there is from knowledge that which is a specified obligation upon every individual with respect to himself (fard ‘ayn) and that which is a collective obligation (fard kifaayah) – if someone rises to fulfill it, its obligation becomes withdrawn from the remaining people of that area.&#8221;</strong></span> [3]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Qudaamah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;As for knowledge of the Religion, all of it is praiseworthy. It is divided into <em>usool</em> (fundamental issues), <em>furoo</em>&#8216; (subsidiary issues), <em>muqaddimaat</em> (introductory knowledge) and <em>mutammimaat</em> (complementary knowledge). The usool consist of the Book of Allaah, the Sunnah of the Prophet, the consensus of the Muslim scholars and the narrations of the Sahaabah. The furoo’ consist of what is understood from these fundamental sources from the meanings that are perceived by the intellect, such that what is understood from it is something other than the written wording.”</strong></span> [4]</p>

And my success is due to none but Allaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh, the Imaam, the &#8216;Aalim (scholar), the Zaahid (ascetic) &#8216;Izz-ud-Deen Abul-Hasan &#8216;Alee Ibn Muhammad Ibn &#8216;Abd-il-Kareem Al-Juzree – may Allaah support him – informed us in the month of Ramadaan of the year 614H in the city of Mausil (In northern &#8216;Iraq) from the home of his brother, saying: The Shaikh, the Imaam, the &#8216;Aalim Majd-ud-Deen Abul-Faraj Yahyaa Ibn Mahmood Ibn Sa&#8217;ad Al-Asfahaanee informed us, saying: The Shaikh, the Imaam Abul-Fath Isma&#8217;eel Ibn Al-Fadl Ibn Ahmad Ibn Al-Akh-sheed As-Sarraaj informed us in the year 518H and in the year 522H, saying: Shaikh Abu Taahir Muhammad Ibn Ahmad Ibn &#8216;Abd-ir-Raheem informed us, saying: Abu Hafs &#8216;Umar Ibn Ibraaheem Al-Kitaanee Al-Muqree informed us, saying: Abul-Qaasim &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Muhammad &#8216;Abdul-&#8216; Azeez Al-Baghawee informed us that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Abu Khaithama Zuhair Ibn Harb narrated to us, saying: Wakee&#8217; reported to us, saying: Al-A&#8217;amash reported to us from Tameem Ibn Salamah from Abu &#8216;Ubaidah that he said: ‘Abdullaah [Ibn Mas’ood] (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) said:</p>
<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I said to ‘Umar Bin ‘Abd-il-‘Azeez: ‘It was said (to me): If you are able to be a scholar, then be a scholar. And if you are not able to do so, then be a student of knowledge. And if you are not able to be a student of knowledge, then love them. And if you can’t love them, then do not hate them.’ </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So ‘Umar said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“By Allaah, any individual that issues a ruling (fatwa) to the people for every matter they ask him of, is truly insane.” </span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Al-A&#8217;amash (one of the narrators) said: “Al-Hakam said to me:</p>
<p>‘Had I heard this hadeeth from you yesterday, I would not have issued fataawaa (on that day) for much of the instances in which I did issue fataawaa.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Muhammad Ibn Khaazim reported to us, saying: Al- A&#8217;amash reported to us from Rajaa Al-Ansaaree from &#8216;Abd-ur-Rahmaan Ibn Bishr Al-Azraq that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Two men entered from the gates of Kinda while Abu Mas&#8217;ood Al-Ansaaree was sitting in a gathering. One of the two men said: &#8216;Is there any man here that can judge between us?&#8217; A man from the gathering said: &#8216;I can.&#8217; So Abu Mas&#8217;ood grabbed a handful of pebbles and struck him with it.

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;The virtue of knowledge is more beloved to me than the virtue of performing worship. And the best of your religious qualities is al-war’ (piety).”</strong></span> [10]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Jareer reported to us from Al-A&#8217;amash from Sulaim from Hudhaifah that he (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“It is enough of knowledge for an individual that he fear Allaah. And it is enough of a lie for him to say: ‘I seek Allaah’s forgiveness and repent to Him’ yet he goes back to doing it.”</span></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“One day we were in the masjid, when Khibaab Ibn Al-Arat came and sat down. Then he remained silent, so the people said to him: “Indeed, your companions have gathered with you so that you may narrate hadeeth to them or command them.’ So he said: ‘And what should I command them with? Perhaps I will command them with something that I do not do myself.’”</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“I met one hundred and twenty of the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) from the Ansaar. There was not one from among them who would be asked about something, except that he loved that his brother replace him (in that matter) and he would not narrate a hadeeth except that he loved that his brother replace him.”</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">22. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Sufyaan reported to us from Az-Zuhree that he said:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;It was once said to &#8216;Alqamah: &#8216;Won&#8217;t you sit in the masjid so that the people may gather around you and ask you questions and so that we may sit with you? For indeed, they ask individuals that are lower than you (in knowledge).&#8217; So &#8216;Alqamah said: &#8216;Indeed, I hate that people walk behind me saying: This is &#8216;Alqamah! This is &#8216;Alqamah!'&#8221;</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">25. Jareer and Ad-Dareer12 narrated to us from Al-A&#8217;amash from Abu Saalih from Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) that the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Whoever treads a path, seeking knowledge by it, Allaah will make easy for him his path towards Paradise.

</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">27. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Sufyaan Ibn &#8216;Uyainah reported to us from Ibraaheem Ibn Maisarah from Taawoos that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;When someone would write to Ibn &#8216;Abbaas asking him on a certain matter, he would respond to the person that brought him the message, &#8216;Inform your companion that the answer to this issue is such and such. Indeed, we do not write anything down on paper, except for letters [14] and the Qur&#8217;aan.'&#8221;</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">28. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Ibn Fudayl reported to us from Ibn Shabramah on the authority of Ash-Sha&#8217;bee that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;I never wrote black (ink) in white (paper). Nor did I ever hear a hadeeth from someone and then want him to repeat it to me again (due to the memory).&#8221;</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">29. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Ibn &#8216;Uyainah reported to us from Ibn Abee An-Najeeh from Mujaahid that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;(Allaah says): &#8216;And make us leaders of the muttaqoon&#8217; [Surah Al-Furqaan: 74] ‘(This means) we take their example and follow them (Prophet and Sahaabah) such that those who come after us will follow our example.'&#8221;</span></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;(Allaah says): &#8216;And He made me (‘Eesaa) blessed wherever I may be.&#8217; [Surah Maryam: 31] ‘This means He made me one who teaches good.&#8217;”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">31. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Jareer reported to us from Mugheerah that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;It was said to Sa&#8217;eed Ibn Jubair: &#8216;Do you know of anyone that is more knowledgeable than you?&#8217; He said: &#8216;Yes, &#8216;Ikrimah.&#8217; So when &#8216;Sa&#8217;eed was killed, Ibraaheem [An-Nakha&#8217;ee] said: &#8216;He did not leave behind him anyone equal to him.&#8217; When news of the death of Ibraaheem reached Ash- Sha&#8217;bee, he said: &#8216;Is this individual dead?&#8217; It was said to him: &#8216;Yes&#8217;, so he said: &#8216;If I had said so, I would have been announcing the death of knowledge. He did not leave behind him anyone equal to him. And what is remarkable is that he preferred Ibn Jubair over himself. I will inform you about that. Indeed he was born to a family with much knowledge in their household, so he took hold of that understanding. Then he sat with us and memorized the best of our hadeeth (and combined that) with the understanding of the members of his household. So who can equal himself to him?'&#8221;</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">32. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Sufyaan Ibn &#8216;Uyainah reported to us, saying: Ayyoob At- Taa&#8217;ee reported to us, saying I heard Ash-Sha&#8217;bee say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;I have not seen one person from all of mankind as far as the horizon spreads that was more desirous of seeking knowledge, than Masrooq.&#8221;</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;A man [15] traveled to Egypt just for this one hadeeth and he did not stop his journey to settle down, until he returned back to his home. (The hadeeth was) &#8216;Whosoever conceals (the faults of) his brother in this world, Allaah will conceal his faults on the Day of Judgement.'&#8221;</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Al-Mugheerah dictated (hadeeth) to me. And I recorded it with my hand.&#8221; [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">36. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Numair reported to us from Al-A&#8217;amash that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Ibraaheem [An-Nakha&#8217;ee] would mention an obligatory matter or a hadeeth and then say: &#8216;Memorize this, for perhaps you may be asked about it someday during your lifetime.'&#8221;</span></strong></p>

</blockquote>

When I lifted my head, he (Salmaan) said: ‘O brother of the tribe of ‘Abas! Go back and drink again.’ So I sat down and drank again even though I did not want to do so, yet I hated to disobey him. Then he said to me: ‘How much do you estimate to have deducted from it (the river)?’ So I said: ‘May Allaah have mercy on you! Is it possible that my drinking can deduct anything from it? He (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) then said: “Likewise with knowledge. You take it, yet you do not deduct anything from it. So stick to those aspects of knowledge that benefits you (most).’”</span></strong></p>

Verily Allaah has said to His Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam): &#8216;Say: I do not ask you for any reward for this (Qur&#8217;aan), nor am I from the pretenders.&#8217; [Surat-un-Nisaa: 86]&#8221;</span></strong></p>

The Muhaajiroon would be involved with their business transactions in the market places [40] and the Ansaar would be preoccupied with directing their funds. So the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8216;Whosoever outspreads his garment, then he will never forget anything that he hears from me.&#8217; So I spread my garment out until he finished (narrating) his hadeeth and I then gathered it up to myself.

(He is) the one who doesn’t cause the people to despair from the mercy of Allaah nor does he allow an individual to commit disobedience to Allaah nor does he leave off the Qur’aan, turning toward something other than it. Indeed, there is no good in any act of worship that has no knowledge in it. Nor is there any good in knowledge that does not have understanding to it. Nor is there any good in reciting the Qur’aan if there is no tadabbur (reflecting on its meaning) to go along with it.”</span></strong></p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Footnotes</span></strong>:</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 This report is authentically attributed to the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam). Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim transmitted it from Mu&#8217;awiyah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 This hadeeth is found in Sunan At-Tirmidhee and other collections, and he (At-Tirmidhee) authenticated it. Some of the reporters stop it as being the saying of a companion only, while others raise it to a saying of the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam). It takes the ruling of marfoo&#8217; (raised to a saying of the Prophet) without a doubt. This is because such a statement is not being said according to ones opinion and view, as has been stated by Ibn &#8216;Abd-il-Barr in Jaami&#8217; Bayaan-ul-&#8216;Ilmi wa Fadlihi (1/32-33).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7 This report is authentically attributed to the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam). At-Tabaraanee transmitted it in Al-Awsat from the hadeeth of Jaabir (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) and At-Tirmidhee from the hadeeth of Abu Umaamah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) and he said it was saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8 Translator’s Note: This advice is to acquire knowledge before taking a position of leadership, for when someone is in that position, it becomes difficult to seek knowledge due to the time and effort that is required for that position. And also, when one is in a position of leadership, no doubt, he will need to have knowledge in order to make the right decisions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9 The chain of this narration is jayyid (good). It is also established in marfoo&#8217; form. Ahmad and At-Tabaraanee reported it from two paths on the authority of Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu). The author (Abu Khaithama) has transmitted one of these two, as shall come later under number 162. Ibn &#8216;Abd-il-Barr also reported it from the hadeeth of Ibn &#8216;Umar (radyAllaahu ‘anhu).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10 This statement is established in marfoo&#8217; form as a saying of the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam). At- Tabaraanee reported it on the authority of Ibn &#8216;Umar and Hudhaifah (radyAllaahu ‘anhum). Al-Mundhiree declared its chain to be hasan. Al-Haakim reported it from Sa&#8217;ad Ibn Abee Waqqaas (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) and he as well as Adh-Dhahabee authenticated it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11 Its chain of narration is jayyid (good) in mawqoof form (i.e. saying of a Companion). It is also authentically attributed to the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu). Muslim and others have transmitted it and it will occur later in this book under number 25.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12 Ad-Dareer is the nickname of Muhammad Ibn Khaazim, Abu Mu&#8217;awiyah. Muslim has transmitted this hadeeth from this path of narrators (18/71-72) in marfoo&#8217; form. Then he reported it from different paths on the authority of Al-A&#8217;amash.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13 Its chain of narration is munqata&#8217; (broken), for Yahyaa Ibn Ja&#8217;ada never met &#8216;Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab. In fact it is even held that he never met Ibn Mas&#8217;ood, and he died ten years after that of &#8216;Umar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You must know that there was an old dispute amongst the Salaf with regard to recording the prophetic hadeeth. Among them were those who forbade it and among them were those who allowed it. There will follow in this book, many narrations regarding both of these sides. Then the matter settled in favor of the permissibility of writing down the hadeeth – rather in favor of its obligation. And this was based on the Prophet&#8217;s command mentioned in more than one hadeeth, such as his saying: &#8220;Write for Abu Shaah.” Al-Bukhaaree reported this hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the matters that are well known is that it is the hadeeth that contains the explanation for the general aspects of the Qur&#8217;aan as well as the detailed aspects of its rulings. And if it were not for the hadeeth, we would have no way of knowing how to perform the prayer, observe the fast, as well as fulfill the other pillars and acts of worship, upon the way that Allaah intended for us. And whatever is essential for an obligatory matter to be fulfilled, becomes itself obligatory. Indeed a people from this era have gone astray for they believe that the Qur&#8217;aan is sufficient for them over the hadeeth. This is in spite of Allaah&#8217;s saying: &#8220;And we revealed to you the Reminder so that it could explain to the people what was already revealed to them (from before).&#8221; [Suratun- Nahl: 44] Thus, Allaah informs us that there is something that is explained, which is the Qur&#8217;aan, and something that is explaining, which is the Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and his hadeeth. Furthermore, his (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) saying in the authentic and famous hadeeth: &#8220;Indeed I was given the Qur&#8217;aan and something equal to it&#8221; confirms this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14 This refers to the letters that the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) used to write to some individuals and to certain tribes. Refer to Zaad al-Ma&#8217;aad (1/30). This narration on Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) has an authentic chain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15 He is &#8216;Uqbah Ibn &#8216;Aamir and he traveled to see Maslama Ibn Mukhallid, who was in charge of Egypt (at that time) as occurs in the Musnad (4/104).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16 Its chain of narration is saheeh (authentic). Muslim has transmitted it in his Saheeh (2/95).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">17 Surat-un-Nisaa: 37</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">18 He is Ibn Abee Saleem and he is da&#8217;eef (weak).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19 Meaning: One sentence, regardless of whether it comes from the Book or the Sunnah. The following is stated in An-Nihaayah: “What is meant by the word ayah in the Qur&#8217;aan is a collection of letters and words. This is derived from the people’s saying: ‘The people left with their ayaat’, meaning they went out with all their possessions not leaving anything behind. The word ayah in any other context means a sign.” Some said in explaining this hadeeth: &#8220;It means a sign, either a gesture or a conveyance.&#8221; This means that if the thing that is being conveyed occurs in the form of an action or a gesture, with the hand or the finger, then indeed it is to convey it in the same way in order to preserve the Sharee&#8217;ah. The hadeeth has a saheeh chain of narration. Al-Bukhaaree reported it through another path on the authority of Al-Awzaa&#8217;ee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">20 Its chain of narration is saheeh from Masrooq. And he is Ibn Al-Ajda&#8217;, a Taabi&#8217;ee (Second generation of Muslims), a Faqeeh (scholar capable of issuing rulings), an &#8216;Aabid (devout worshipper). He died in the year 62H. And he has been mentioned previously in another chain that connects to him under number 15.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">21 He is Ibn Mas&#8217;ood (radyAllaahu ‘anhu). And the chain of narration to him is saheeh upon the standards of the two Shaikhs (Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim). Al-Haakim transmitted it (3/537) from another path on Al-A&#8217;amash without the saying: &#8220;The best interpreter…&#8221; and he (rahimahullaah) authenticated it based on both of their standards. Adh-Dhahabee agreed with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">22 Its chain of narration is munqata&#8217; (broken) because Saalim Ibn Abee Al-Ja&#8217;ad never met Abu Ad-Dardaa (radyAllaahu ‘anhu). It has also been reported on his authority through another path of narrators in marfoo&#8217; form. However, its chain is da&#8217;eef (weak), also.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">23 It is a saheeh hadeeth. Its narrators are all reliable for they are narrators of the standards of the two Shaikhs (Al- Bukhaaree and Muslim). Ahmad and Ibn Maajah have reported this from Wakee&#8217; connected to him (Ibn Umm Lubaid), while Al-Haakim and Ahmad have reported it from the path of narration of &#8216;Amr Ibn Murrah: &#8220;I heard Saalim Ibn Abee Al-Ja&#8217;ad say&#8221; on his (Ibn Umm Lubaid) authority. Al-Haakim authenticated it and mentioned that there were two other paths of narration to them, the first of which is on the authority of &#8216;Awf Ibn Maalik (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) and has been reported by Al-Khateeb Al-Baghdaadee in his book Al-Iqtidaa (no. 90). The other has been reported on the authority of Abu Ad-Dardaa (radyAllaahu ‘anhu). Adh-Dhahabee declared the chains of both of these to be saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">24 The chain of this narration is saheeh. Ibraaheem here refers to Ibn Yazeed An-Nakha&#8217;ee. Although he never met &#8216;Abdullaah, who is Ibn Mas&#8217;ood (radyAllaahu ‘anhu), it is still authentically reported on him that he said: &#8220;If I narrate a hadeeth to you on the authority of a man on the authority of &#8216;Abdullaah, then that means that I heard it (from that person). And if I say, &#8216;Abdullaah said…&#8217; (without mentioning the narrator), then it is from someone reporting on the authority of &#8216;Abdullaah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">25 He is Abu Zur&#8217;ah Ibn &#8216;Amr Ibn Jareer Ibn &#8216;Abdillaah Al-Bajlee Al-Koofee. There is a difference of opinion concerning his name. He was a Taabi&#8217;ee (Second generation of Muslims), reliable and the compilers of the six collections rely on his narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">26 Its chain of narration in mawqoof form (stopped at level of being the saying of a companion and not of the Prophet) upon &#8216;Ubaid Ibn &#8216;Umair is saheeh. Al-Bazaar and At-Tabaraanee have also reported it from the hadeeth of Ibn Mas&#8217;ood in marfoo&#8217; form (raised to a saying of the Prophet), with a chain of narration in which there is no defect, according to Al-Mundhiree.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: Later, it became apparent to me that there is, in fact, a defect in it. Adh-Dhahabee has testified to it, as I have explained in Al-Ahaadeeth Ad-Da&#8217;eefah (no. 5032).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">27 The chain of narration is authentic. &#8216;Abdullaah here refers to Ibn Mas&#8217;ood (radyAllaahu ‘anhu).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">28 Its chain of narration is saheeh (authentic), as well as the one that comes after it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">29 Its chain is saheeh and Mas&#8217;ood Ibn Maalik is Abu Razeen Al-Asadee, a Taabi&#8217;ee who was reliable and<br />
trustworthy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">30 He is Ibn Abee Saleem and he is da&#8217;eef (weak) as has been stated previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">31 He is Al-Hasan Al-Basree, the righteous Taabi&#8217;ee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">32 Translator’s Note: A Mujtahid is a scholar that has reached high levels of knowledge such that he is able to form opinions and issue fataawaa (rulings), without basing it on the scholars before him. They can determine rulings for issues that have no clear mention in the Qur’aan and the Sunnah, and Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">33 Its chain of narration is saheeh according to the standards of Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">34 Its chain is saheeh, just like the one before it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">35 Its chain of narration is saheeh according to the standards of the two Shaikhs (Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim). They have both transmitted it on the authority of (Imaam) Maalik and it is found in Al-Muwatta (2/56/34) within a hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">36 This refers to the non-Arabs. The chain of narration is according to the standards of Muslim. However, it is in mawqoof form. It has been reported in marfoo’ form from three different paths on the authority of Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) without mentioning the Tribe of Farrookh and with the wording: “&#8230;a group of people from Persia would surely grasp it.” These reports have been transmitted by Abu Nu’aim in Akhbaar Asbahaan (1/5) but they all have defects in them. One of them is found in (the Saheeh of) Ibn Hibbaan (no. 2309). And what is authentic is what occurs with the wording: “If Eemaan (Faith) were clinging from the sky, there would be some people from Persia who would surely grasp it.” Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim have reported this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">37 His name is Dhakwaan As-Samaan Az-Ziyaat Al-Madanee. He was the guardian of Juwairiyah Bint Al-Ahmas Al-Ghatfaanee. And he was the father of Suhayl, the one mentioned in the previous chain of narrators. Abu Saalih died in the year 101H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">38 The hadeeth here is mawqoof and in its chain is Laith Ibn Abee Saleem who is da&#8217;eef (weak). Others have reported it from &#8216;Adiyy Ibn &#8216;Adiyy in marfoo&#8217; form. Ibn &#8216;Asaakir (10/28/2) reported it as well as Al-Khateeb Al- Baghdaadee in Iqtidaa-ul-&#8216;Ilm (no. 2). It has a supporting evidence (in a hadeeth reported) on the authority of Abu Burzah in marfoo&#8217; form. At-Tirmidhee reported this one and authenticated it. Ad-Daarimee also reported it as well as Abu Ya&#8217;laa in his Musnad (2/353) with an authentic chain of narration. Also, Al-Khateeb reported this in his book Iqtidaa-ul-&#8216;Ilm under (no. 1).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">39 The original source of this hadeeth is in mawqoof form and not marfoo&#8217;. Some people have mentioned it on the authority of Ka&#8217;ab Al-Ahbaar (radyAllaahu ‘anhu), saying that it is found in the Torah. And some liars and weak reporters have raised it to the level of being a saying of Abu Ad-Dardaa and Jaabir (radyAllaahu ‘anhum). See Al- Laalee Al-Masnoo&#8217;ah of As-Suyootee and Silsilat-ul-Ahaadeeth Ad-Da&#8217;eefah (no. 2750).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">40 Know that there is not found in this description of the Muhaajireen, and likewise this description of the Ansaar, any reviling or derogation of them, as many of the contemporary writers that slander Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) without due right claim. This goes as well for those who interpret his sayings in a way contrary to what he intended. Indeed, doing an action in addition to seeking the halaal is from the Way of Allaah, as has been reported authentically in some ahaadeeth. And Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) was aware of this, for he was one of the reporters. Thus, he made excuses for them in regard to that matter for (their lack) of memorizing hadeeth the way he was able to memorize. Al-Haakim (3/511-512) reported from Talha Ibn &#8216;Ubaidillaah, one of the ten who were given the glad tidings of Paradise, and one of the Muhaajireen and first Muslims, that he (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) said concerning the Muhaajireen and Abu Hurairah something similar to this hadeeth: &#8220;By Allaah, I have no doubt that Abu Hurairah heard from the Messenger of Allaah, that which we did not hear and he learned that which we did not learn. Verily, we were rich people, in possession of houses and large families. We used to go and stay with the Prophet until the end of the day, then we used to go back. And Abu Hurairah was a poor person. He had no money nor family nor children. His hand was only where the Prophet&#8217;s hand was. And he used to stay over wherever he resided. And we have no doubt that he learned what we didn&#8217;t learn and that he heard what we didn&#8217;t hear. And no one among us accuses him.&#8221; Al- Haakim authenticated it and Al-Haafidh mentioned a supporting evidence for it in Fath-ul-Baaree (1/191).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the hadeeth has an authentic chain of narration, according to the standards of the two Shaikhs. Muslim transmitted it through the same path of narrators as the author (Abu Khaithama) and he and Al-Bukhaaree have both transmitted it through other paths on the authority of Sufyaan. And with this chain, Ahmad (2/240) also reported it. Furthermore, he (2/274), Al-Bukhaaree and others reported it through other paths of narration on the authority of Az-Zuhree. Muslim reported it from Az-Zuhree on the authority of Sa&#8217;eed Ibn Al-Musayyib and Abu Salamah Ibn &#8216;Abd-ir-Rahmaan that Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) said: &#8220;Indeed, you…&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">41 He is Ibn &#8216;Abdillaah Al-Qaadee. There is speculation concerning his memory, however Zuhair Ibn Mu&#8217;awiyah followed him and he is reliable. Due to this, At-Tirmidhee authenticated the hadeeth. It is reported in Al- Ahaadeeth As-Saheehah under no. 330.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">42 This is an authentic hadeeth. Its chain is in mursal form (meaning stopped at the level of being a saying of a Taabi&#8217;ee). However Al-Haakim (4/279-280) has reported it from the path of: &#8220;Umayyah Ibn Khallid from Sulaimaan Ibn Al-Mugheerah on the authority of Thaabit on &#8216;Amr Ibn Shu&#8217;ayb on his father on the authority of &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn &#8216;Amr who reported it on the Messenger of Allaah. And he (Al-Haakim) authenticated it based on the standards of Muslim, and Adh-Dhahabee agreed. It is only this hadeeth that is saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">43 Translator’s Note: This means that if you can convey the meaning of a hadeeth, as opposed to quoting it, then there is no harm, in that, and Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">44 Surat-ul-Baqarah: 159</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">45 I say: Its chain of narration is saheeh according to the standards of the two Shaikhs. Al-Bukhaaree (1/42) has transmitted it from the path of Al-A&#8217;araj on Abu Hurairah t.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">43 Translator’s Note: This means that if you can convey the meaning of a hadeeth, as opposed to quoting it, then there is no harm, in that, and Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">44 Surat-ul-Baqarah: 159</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">45 I say: Its chain of narration is saheeh according to the standards of the two Shaikhs. Al-Bukhaaree (1/42) has transmitted it from the path of Al-A&#8217;araj on Abu Hurairah t.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">46 This narration in mawqoof form (saying of a companion only) has an authentic chain. Its narrators are all narrators of the category of the two Saheeh collections, except for &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Yazeed As-Sahbaanee. However, he is trustworthy and his biography occurs in Al-Jarh wat-Ta&#8217;deel.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">47 He is Ibn &#8216;Amr As-Salmaanee. He was a Taabi&#8217;ee, reliable and trustworthy. The one who reports from him, Abu Zaid Al-Muraadee, is Nu&#8217;maan Ibn Qais. Ibn Abee Haatim wrote a biography for him (4/1/446) and reported his reliability from the sayings of Ibn Ma&#8217;een and others. Sufyaan Ath-Thawree reported this narration on his authority also and added to the end of it that he (&#8216;Ubaidah) said: &#8220;Indeed I fear that a people will succeed after it (i.e. his books) and not give it its due place.&#8221; Ad-Daarimee (1/121) reported it as well as Al-Khateeb in Taqyeed-ul-&#8216;Ilm (pg. 61)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">48 I say: Its chain is munqata&#8217; (broken). This is because Ibn &#8216;Abdillaah, who is Abu &#8216;Ubaidah Ibn &#8216;Abdillaah Ibn Mas&#8217;ood did not hear from his father. Therefore, it is cut short to being a saying of Ibn ‘Abdillaah. And it is authentic on Ibn Mas&#8217;ood in marfoo&#8217; form (saying of the Prophet r). At-Tirmidhee reported it and authenticated it, as did Ibn Hibbaan in his Saheeh. And it has been mentioned from other Companions apart from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">49 Its chain is saheeh in mawqoof form. It is also reported from the path of Isma&#8217;eel Ibn Mujaalid on &#8216;Abd-ul-Malik Ibn &#8216;Umair in marfoo&#8217; form (saying of the Prophet r). And it has a supporting witness from the path of Mu&#8217;awiyah t. I have spoken about it in Al-Ahaadeeth As-Saheehah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">50 Its chain of narration is saheeh in mawqoof form. And it is authentic in marfoo&#8217; form from different paths on the authority of Abu Hurairah. Al-Bukhaaree, Muslim and others have transmitted it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">51 He is &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Al-Muthnaa Ibn &#8216;Abdillaah Ibn Anas. He was honest yet made many mistakes. This hadeeth has been reported in marfoo&#8217; form as a saying of the Prophet, and it is not authentic. Later, I encountered many paths of narration for the hadeeth reported in marfoo&#8217; form, such that it directs towards the fact that it is saheeh. I have clarified this in Al-Ahaadeeth As-Saheehah (no. 2026).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">52 Its chain is saheeh according to the standards of the two Shaikhs and they have both reported it. One of the paths of narration reported by Muslim is the same one used by the author (Abu Khaithama) here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">53 Its chain is saheeh according to the standards of the two Shaikhs and they have both transmitted it. Some of its paths of narration are found in Saheeh Muslim on the authority of the author (Abu Khaithama).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">54 He is Al-Haitham Ibn Habeeb, Abu Al-Haitham As-Sairafee. And he is reliable as are the rest of the narrators in this chain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">55 His name is &#8216;Amr Ibn &#8216;Abdillaah As-Subai&#8217;ee. He is reliable, but used to commit tadless and mix (confuse) his narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">56 His name is &#8216;Abdullaah and he is reliable, from the narrators of the category of the two Shaikhs (Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim). This goes the same for the rest of the narrators of the chain. However there is a break in the chain. Taawoos on the authority of &#8216;Umar is in mursal form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">57 This means that there is no one who is able to narrate a hadeeth without there occurring an addition or a subtraction to it. So it is upon one to exert himself and to not fall short with regard to memory and precision. Hence, &#8220;Allaah does not burden a soul with more than it can handle.&#8221; The chain of the narration is saheeh. And Gheelaan is Ibn Jareer Al-Ma&#8217;oolee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">58 This is a well-known city in Yemen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">59 Its chain is saheeh according to the standards of the two Shaikhs. Abu &#8216;Abd-ir-Rahmaan is &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Habeeb As-Sulamee. He was a Taabi&#8217;ee, reciter of the Qur&#8217;aan, reliable and trustworthy. The name of Abu Hiseen is &#8216;Uthmaan Ibn &#8216;Aasim Al-Asadee. He was also reliable and trustworthy. He died in the year 127H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">60 The chain of this narration is jayyid (good). And it shows the praiseworthy manners of Ibn &#8216;Abbaas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">61 He is Ibn Abee Sulaymaan Al-Koofee, the Faqeeh. The Ibraaheem that is mentioned here is Ibn Yazeed An- Nakha&#8217;ee. The name of Ibn &#8216;Awn is &#8216;Abdullaah, and he was a famous Faqeeh (Scholar of Fiqh). All of them are reliable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">62 This is how it was written originally contrary to the format that has been used beforehand and afterwards. The author repeats the same hadeeth again under no. 161, which will come later. And what is meant by the word atraaf, and Allaah knows best, is the first portions of hadeeth (i.e. the first words of a hadeeth), which they used to write out and by which they would remember the ahaadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">63 He is Al-Qarqisaanee, and he was honest yet committed many errors. In spite of this a group of people followed him (in narration) according to Ad-Daarimee (1/122), Al-Khateeb in Taqyeed-ul-&#8216;Ilm (pg. 42) and others. The chain of narration is saheeh when attributed to Abu Hurairah. And Abu Katheer is As-Suhaymee Al-Yamaanee Al-A&#8217;amaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">64 He is Ibn Abee Saleem and he is da&#8217;eef (weak) as has been stated several times previously. However, he is not alone in his narration of this hadeeth. Rather it has supporting evidences which Al-Haakim and Adh-Dhahabee have authenticated. We have discussed this hadeeth in detail in our commentary to it in Mishkaat-ul-Masaabeeh (no. 260). I will further add to it here, saying: Ad-Daarimee (1/96) reported this hadeeth from another path on the authority of Laith in mawqoof form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">65 In mawqoof form (saying of a companion only), this narration is da&#8217;eef. It is authentic in marfoo&#8217; form from the path of &#8216;Ataa on Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu). At-Tirmidhee, Ibn Hibbaan, Al-Haakim and Adh-Dhahabee have authenticated it. See (my book) Tah-dheer-ul-Masaajid (pg. 4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">66 His name is Al-Hasan Ibn &#8216;Uqbah Al-Muraadee. Ibn Ma&#8217;een declared him to be reliable and Abu Haatim said of him: &#8220;He was a shaikh, his hadeeth were written down.&#8221; The chain of narration linked to Ash-Sha&#8217;bee is saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">67 He (&#8216;Ilbaa) is Ibn Ahmar Al-Yushkaree Al-Basree and he was a Taabi&#8217;ee of trustworthy and reliable status. Likewise, the rest of the narrators of the chain are all reliable. So it is saheeh, if &#8216;Ilbaa heard it from &#8216;Alee, because there is no report mentioned from him on his authority.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">68 I do not know who this Abu Damurah is. As for Hamaad, then he is Ibn Abee Salmaan, the Faqeeh. And Ibraaheem here refers to Ibn Yazeed An-Nakha&#8217;ee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">69 He is reliable, as are the rest of the narrators of the chain. Thus it is saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">70 He is Abu Haashim Al-Makkee, a Taabi&#8217;ee that is reliable. The chain of narration linked to him is saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">71 Ibraaheem, and he is (ibn Yazeed) An-Nakha&#8217;ee, may Allaah have mercy on him, means by this that it was not from the actions of the Sahaabah to supplicate for one another after the end of a class or a study session. Therefore, this is an innovation. Another thing similar to it is when the teacher (shaikh) walks ahead of his students and they walk behind him. This is because this action is from that which leads to fitnah and amazement with oneself, as is indicated in the narration mentioned before this one. And both of them (i.e. this narration and the one before it) have authentic chains of narration on the authority of Ibraaheem.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">72 This is a hasan hadeeth. Even though Ibn Lahee&#8217;ah and Darraaj are both weak, it has another path on the authority of Abu Hurairah as well as a supporting evidence on the authority of Ibn &#8216;Umar in marfoo&#8217; form. And it is mentioned through another path on the authority of Salmaan in mawqoof form, as has been stated previously by the author under number 12.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">73 Translator’s Note: He is one of the narrator’s in the chain of narration of the book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">74 Translator’s Note: He was a man who had accepted Islaam, but who later apostated. When he was given the task of collecting Zakaat with another Companion from the Ansaar, he killed him during the journey, apostated, and seeked shelter in Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">75 This hadeeth has an authentic chain of narration, and it is found in Al-Muwatta, and on his (Maalik&#8217;s) authority in the Saheehs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">76 He is &#8216;Abd-ul-Malik Ibn &#8216;Abd-il-&#8216;Azeez Al-Qushairee An-Nasaa&#8217;ee. He is reliable and from the narrators of Muslim. This goes the same for the rest of the narrators of this chain, thus it is authentic according to his (Muslim&#8217;s) standards. It has been transmitted by Ahmad (3/192 &amp; 225) through other paths on the authority of Hamaad. And it is also in (3/283) and in An-Nasaa&#8217;ee (2/316) from the path of Hafs on Anas. It is also found in Saheeh Muslim (8/72) from the hadeeth of Zayd Ibn Arqam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">77 Its chain of narration is hasan and the hadeeth is authentic. The two Shaikhs (Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim) have transmitted it through another path on the authority of &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah, may Allaah be pleased with her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">78 Its chain of narration is saheeh according to the standards of the two Shaikhs. And they have both transmitted it through other paths of narration on the authority of Anas without the mention of his (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) saying: &#8220;…for indeed each of you…&#8221;. There is a supporting evidence for this addition (to the hadeeth) in the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) in marfoo&#8217; form which is found in Saheeh Muslim (7/65) and Ahmad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">79 His name is Muhammad Ibn Ja&#8217;far Ibn Ziyaad and he is reliable. However, his shaikh, Sa&#8217;eed Ibn Maisira, is accused (of weakness). Regardless the hadeeth is saheeh. The two Shaikhs (Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim) as well as others have transmitted it from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu), with different wordings and additions to it. I have gathered and checked all of them in my book Ahkaam-ul-Janaa&#8217;iz wa Bid&#8217;ihaa and it has been published by Al-Maktab-ul-Islaamee.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;" align="center">‘Miftah dar as-Sa’ada’<br />
(Key to the land of happiness)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center">By Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah</p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Knowledge &amp; Ignorance are not equal</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the excellence of knowledge and the people of knowledge, Allaah <em>– Subhana wa Ta’aala –</em> negated equality between the people of knowledge and other than them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just like He negated equality between, the companions of Paradise and the companions of the Hell-fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>Ta’aala</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; <strong>Say: “Are those who know equal to those who know not?</strong>” &gt;&gt; [ Zumar :9 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; <strong>Not equal are the dwellers of the Fire and the dwellers of the Paradise</strong> &gt;&gt; [ Hashr :20 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates the elevated excellence of the people of knowledge and their distinguished nobility.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Vol 1 /11/221</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Wisdom is knowledge</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>Ta’aala</em> testifies for the one who, has been given knowledge, that He has given him lots of good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>Ta’aala</em> said: &lt;&lt;<strong> He grants <em>Hikmah </em>to whom He pleases, and he, to whom<em>Hikmah </em>is granted, is indeed granted abundant good</strong>&gt;&gt; [ Baqarah :269 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qootayba and the majority of the scholars said: Wisdom is to be on the truth and to act upon it, and that is beneficial knowledge and good actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Vol 1/26/227</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Knowledge is the Greatest Blessing</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>Ta’aala</em> has given numerous blessings to His Messenger, and has given him excellence.  Allaah <em>Ta’aala</em> has made the greatest blessing that He gave to him the Book and <em>Hikmah </em>(wisdom).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah taught him that which he did not know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>Ta’aala</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; <strong>Allaah has sent down to you the Book and <em>Al­-Hikmah </em>and taught you that which you did not know. And Ever Great is the Grace of Allaah unto you</strong> &gt;&gt; [Nisa: 113]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Vol 1 / 27 / 227<strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Blessing of knowledge obligates thankfulness to Allaah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>Ta’aala</em> reminded His believing slaves with this blessing, and He commanded them to be thankful for it, and that they should remember Him, for the blessings He bestowed to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>Ta’aala</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; Similarly, We have sent among you a Messenger of your own, reciting to you Our Verses and sanctifying you, and teaching you the Book and the <em>Hikmah </em> and teaching you that which you did not used to know. Therefore remember Me, I will remember you, and be grateful to Me and never be ungrateful to Me. &gt;&gt; [ Baqarah : 151-152 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Vol 1 / 28 / 227</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Knowledge is Goodness in this World</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan said regarding “the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’aala</em> &lt;&lt; “<strong>Our Lord! Give us in this world that which is good!</strong>” &gt;&gt; [ Baqarah: 201]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is knowledge and worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And regard Allaah’s saying &lt;&lt;<strong>and in the Hereafter that which is good</strong>&gt;&gt; [ Baqarah : 201 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is Paradise.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is from the best explanations of this <em>Ayaah</em> indeed the greatest of the goodness of this world, is beneficial knowledge and good actions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah<br />
Taken from ‘Miftah dar as-Sa’ada’ (key to the land of happiness)<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The saying of Allaah Ta’ala :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>((By <em>Al-‘Asr</em> (the time). Verily! Man is in loss, except those who believe and do righteous good deeds, and recommend one another to the truth and recommend one another to patience.))</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ash-Shafiee – may Allaah be pleased with him – said: ‘If all the people reflected over this <em>Soorah</em> it would be sufficient for them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The explanation of this is that this <em>Soorah</em> has four levels, and by completing these, a person can achieve the highest goal in being complete.</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>The first is: Knowing the truth.</li>
<li>The second: his acting upon the truth.</li>
<li>The third: Him teaching the one who is deficient in the truth.</li>
<li>The fourth: Being patient in learning the truth, and acting upon it, and teaching it.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> mentioned these four levels in this <em>Soorah</em>, and Allaah<em>Subhanahu</em> testified in this <em>Soorah</em> by al-Asr (the time) that everyone is in loss, except those who believe and do righteous, good deeds and they are those who knew the truth, and they testified to the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the above is a level.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They did righteous, good deeds and they are those who performed worship with what they knew about the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a level.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They advise with the truth; they advise one another, teaching and guiding each other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the third level.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They advise with patience; they were patient with the truth, and they advised each other with patience upon the truth, and to be steadfast.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is the fourth level.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the end of completeness; indeed completeness is that a person is complete in himself, and completes others.  His completeness is by correcting his two strengths, the strength of knowledge and the strength of actions.  Correction of the strength of knowledge is with <em>Emaan</em>, and correction of the strength of actions is by doing righteous deeds, and by completing people other than himself, and by learning this knowledge, and being patient upon it, and his recommending with patience upon knowledge and action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this <em>Soorah</em>, even though it is brief, is one of the most collective soorahs of the Qur’aan for goodness from all its different angles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allaah Who has made the Qur’aan sufficient for everything, a cure from every disease, a guidance to all that is good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: &#8216;Abdullaah bin Salfeeq Adh-Dhufairee<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This book is a complete translation of a small booklet entitled: <b><i>“Ar-Rakaa’iz-ul-‘Ashar Lit-Tahseel-il-‘Ilmee”</i></b><i></i> (Ten Guidelines for Obtaining Knowledge) printed by Daar-ul-Minhaaj, 1st Edition, 2003.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this short treatise, the author ‘Abdullaah bin Salfeeq Adh-Dhufairee, presents concise advice to the seekers of knowledge in the format of ten simple guidelines. These guidelines cover characteristics and etiquettes that a student of knowledge should adorn himself with in order to obtain knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The treatise has been introduced and praised by Shaikh Ahmad An-Najmee, one of the elder scholars in Saudi Arabia, thus indicating its importance and benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Excerpts from the Book:</b><br />
&#8220;The greatest form of dutifulness (Taqwaa) to Allaah is making one’s intention purely for the sake of Allaah. As for the one who seeks knowledge for the sake of showing off, then apart from being a loser in this world, he will also be punished for this in the Hereafter as has been reported in the hadeeth about the three people who will be dragged on their faces into Hell, amongst whom will be a man who sought knowledge so that it could be said: <b>&#8216;He is a scholar&#8217;</b> and such was said about him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;An upright heart comes about through awareness of Allaah and knowledge of His Names, Attributes and Actions. It also comes about by way of reflecting on His signs and creations, and by pondering on the Qur’aan. An upright heart also comes about due to one constantly prostrating (in prayer) and frequently observing the night prayer.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;One of the ways that help in motivating a person to seek knowledge is: Reading the biographies of the scholars, as well as their patience and endurance in the face of trials. This also includes reading about the journeys they undertook for the sake of acquiring knowledge and obtaining Hadeeth.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The following is posted from : <strong><a title="Magnificent Points of Advice for those who have turned to the Way of the Salaf – Ahmad Ash-Shihhee" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2014/10/01/magnificent-points-of-advice-for-those-who-have-turned-to-the-way-of-the-salaf-ahmad-ash-shihhee/">Magnificent Points of Advice for those who have turned to the Way of the Salaf </a></strong>– Abu ‘Abdillaah Ahmad bin Muhammad Ash-Shihhee. This book was read to Allaamaah Rabee’ al-Madkhalee who gave some good instructions regarding it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Abu ‘Abdillaah Ahmad bin Muhammad ash-Shihhee<br />
SOURCE: His book &#8220;Al-Wasaayah as-Saniyyah Lit-Taa’ibeena ilaas-Salafiyyah&#8221; (pg. 34-39)<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars are the ones to be referred to and turned to regarding the important issues, especially in matters that concern the welfare of the Muslim ummah. If you look at the condition of the first generations from the Salaf as-Saalih, you would find that they were strict with regard to returning back to the senior scholars that were alive in their time, especially in getting rulings that resulted in making <i>tabdee’</i> (declaring someone an innovator) or <i>takfeer</i> (declaring someone a disbeliever). [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look at the example of Yahyaa bin Ya’mar Al-Basree and Humaid bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Himayree Al-Basree, when the Qadariyyah appeared in their time and they began to manifest contradictions to the Fundamentals of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, which necessitated that they be declared disbelievers or that they be pronounced innovators and removed from the fold of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah. However, they did not rush into making a ruling against them. Rather, they went to those who held the position of being referred to with regard to issues of knowledge, from the scholars. And he was ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa</i>). So they informed him of what occurred to them and he issued a ruling to them stating the misguidance and deviation of (this group of) the Qadariyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahyaa bin Ya’mar said: “The first person who spoke (deviant views) with regard to Al-Qadar in Basrah was Ma’bad Al-Juhnee. Humaid bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Himayree and I set out to make Hajj or ‘Umrah, and we said to each other: “If only we could meet one of the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger so that we could ask him about what these people are saying about Al-Qadar. So Allaah granted us that ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa</i>) enter the masjid So I and my companion gathered around him – one of us on his right and the other on his left. I felt as if my companion entrusted me with speaking to him, so I said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Abu ‘Abdur-Rahmaan, a people have appeared in our land that recite the Qur’aan and pursue knowledge…[and he mentioned some other points about them]…and they claim that there is no such thing as Al-Qadar (Divine Pre-Decree) and that it is rejected.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He responded: “If you meet these people, inform them that I am free from them and thy are free from me. By the One whom ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Umar swears by, if one of them had the likes of Mount Uhud in gold and he were to give it away in charity, Allaah would not accept it from him, until he believes in Al-Qadar.“ Then he said: “My father reported to me…” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And look at the example of Zubayd ibn Al-Haarith Al-Yaamee when the Murji’ah appeared in his time and he saw that they had oppositions to the Fundamentals of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, which necessitated that they be ousted from the fold of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah. Yet, he did not rush into making a ruling against them. Instead, he went to one who had the position of being referenced in religious matters in his time from the people of knowledge and fatwaa, those who took their knowledge from the Seniors amongst the Companions, who in this case was Abu Waa’il Shaqeeq bin Salamah Al-Asadee Al-Koofee (<i>rahimahullaah</i>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Zubayd went to him informing him of what had occurred, and Abu Waa’il issued a fatwaa to him based on a text from Allaah’s Messenger, which indicated the falsehood of the misconceptions of the Murji’ah and their deviating from Ahlus-Sunnah. Zubayd said: “When the Murji’ah appeared, I went to Abu Waa’il and mentioned that to him, so he said: ’Abdullaah narrated to me that the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>‘Reviling a Muslim is sinfulness and fighting against him is disbelief.’</b>” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if you were to compare between the condition of these people with regard to how they looked toward the people of knowledge in their time and between the condition of many of those who have become unstable in their repentance in this time of ours, you would find a huge difference between the two examples.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those people (in the first example) strove hard to implement this rule, and they did not rush to make a ruling against those people of their time whose deviation become apparent, until they first presented their case to the people of knowledge, those capable of issuing rulings (fatwaa) from Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah. So when they heard the ruling, they bit onto it with their molar teeth and distanced themselves from those deviants who were in opposition to Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for today, then it is very rare that you can find those who strive hard to implement this rule. Rather, you will find those who have no concern for the words of the people of knowledge and fatwaa with regard to warning against the people of desires and innovation. So they wage war against the fataawaa (religious rulings) of the scholars and they distort their (intended) meanings. We ask Allaah to save and protect us!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b class="Marker">Footnotes:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="Footnotes">[1] This does not mean that a student of knowledge is not to rule on issues altogether. What is meant here is that he should not rule on issues related to current occurrences, from the outset, especially those that are ambiguous from it. As for the clear issues, which are not ambiguous, then he is not required to refer to them (i.e. the scholars).</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Al-Haafidh Ibn Rajab Al-Hanbalee<br />
SOURCE: Fadlu ‘Ilm-is-Salaf ‘alaa ‘Ilm-il-Khalaf (pg. 39-43, Dar-ul-Imam Ahmad Ed.)<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Signs of Non-Beneficial Knowledge:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An indicative sign of this non-beneficial knowledge is that it breeds haughtiness, pride and arrogance in the one who possesses it. And it causes him to seek after grandeur and elevation in the worldly life and to compete for that. It also leads one to pursue competing with the scholars, arguing with the foolish and turning the people’s attention his way. And it has been reported that the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said that whoever seeks knowledge for these reasons, then <b>“the Fire, the Fire.”</b> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It could be that some of the people who possess these types of knowledge claim to know Allaah, seek after Him and abstain from everything apart from that, however, their goal behind that is for nothing else but to gain a high place in certain people’s hearts, such as that of the rulers and their likes. Perhaps their goal is to have these people think good thoughts about them or to gain large gatherings of followers or to have them venerate them because of that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another sign of this is when one openly claims to have a close relationship with Allaah, i.e. claims to be a <i>walee</i>, as the People of the Scripture would do, and as the Qaraamitah,[2] Baatiniyyah[3] and their likes would assert for themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is contrary to what the Salaf were upon for they would constantly belittle and scorn themselves, in hidden and in open. ‘Umar said: “Whoever says he is knowledgeable is really ignorant. And whoever says he is a believer is really a disbeliever. And whoever says he is in Paradise is in the Hellfire.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from its signs is that one fails to accept and submit to the truth, and that he acts arrogantly towards those who speak the truth, especially if that person is considered below them in the eyes of the people. Also from its signs is that one persists upon falsehood out of fear that the people’s hearts will turn away from him if he openly shows his going back to the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps these individuals may even openly condemn and belittle themselves with their tongues in front of large gatherings so that people will believe that they are truly humble, thus drawing (their) praises for that. And this is from the most intricate and subtle forms of showing off (<i>riyaa</i>), as indicated by the Taabi’een and the scholars that came after them. Furthermore, their blatant acceptance and receipt of such praise is to such an extent that it negates any honesty or sincerity on their part. This is since a truly honest person fears hypocrisy for himself and dreads the thought of having a bad end, whereas these individuals busy themselves with accepting and consenting to praises.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So based on this, one of the signs that people have beneficial knowledge is that they don’t see themselves as having any special position or status, and that they hate with their hearts any commendation or praise and that they do not exalt themselves arrogantly over anyone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan said: “The Faqeeh (one with understanding of the Religion) is only he who abstains from the worldly life, longs for the next life, has deep insight into his Religion and is persistent in worshipping his Lord.” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration, he said: “He is one who does not envy those above him, nor does he belittle those below him, nor does he charge any fee for the knowledge that Allaah has given him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A statement with a similar meaning to this last one was reported on Ibn ‘Umar as a saying of his.[5] So every time the people who have beneficial knowledge increase in this type of knowledge, they increase in humbleness, fear, lowliness and submission to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the Salaf said: “A person with knowledge should place dirt upon his head out of humbleness to his Lord.” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For indeed every time he increases in knowledge and awareness of his Lord, He increases in fear and love for Him as well as submission and debasement towards Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Signs of Beneficial Knowledge:</b><br />
From the signs that one has beneficial knowledge is that it leads him to flee from the worldly life and its splendors, as well as from leadership, fame and praise. Keeping far away from these things and exerting one’s efforts in avoiding them are indications that one has beneficial knowledge. And if he were to fall into committing any of these things unintentionally and unwillingly, he would be in immense fear of being punished for that since he would fear that such (praise or leadership or fame) is perhaps a plot or gradual delusion (before inevitable punishment from Allaah). Such was the case with Imaam Ahmad, for he would fear for himself when his name became famous and his reputation spread.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from the signs of beneficial knowledge is that one does not claim to have knowledge nor does he use it to act arrogantly towards anyone, nor does he describe anyone as being ignorant – except for those who oppose the Sunnah and its followers, for in this case, he may speak about them out of anger for the sake of Allaah and not his own sake nor intending to elevate himself over anyone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who does not have beneficial knowledge, his only concern is to use his knowledge to arrogantly elevate himself over people and to manifest the virtue of his knowledge to them while at the same time ascribing them to ignorance. His only concern is to belittle them so that he may exalt himself over them by doing that. This is one of the vilest and most despicable of actions. Perhaps he may even describe those scholars that came before him as being ignorant, negligent and forgetful. So his love for himself and his love for exposing himself leads him to think highly of himself while thinking poorly of those who preceded him!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who possess beneficial knowledge are upon the opposite of this, for they think poorly of themselves while thinking highly of those scholars that came before them. And they affirm with their hearts and souls the virtue and superiority that their predecessors have over them and their own inability to reach and attain the levels that they were at, let alone get near to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How beautiful was the response of Imaam Abu Haneefah[7] when he was asked about ‘Alqamah[8] and Aswad[9] as to which of them was better. He replied saying: “By Allaah, we are not qualified to even mention their names, so how can we choose between them?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the etiquettes of those who preceded would be mentioned, Ibn Al-Mubaarak would recite the following verses of poetry:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>“Do not present our mention along with their mention,<br />
The healthy one who walks is not like the crippled.”</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if this individual with non-beneficial knowledge feels that he is superior to those who came before him in terms of producing elaborate speech and statements, he will then assume that he is also superior to them in knowledge and rank before Allaah, due to his having a special virtue over those who preceded him. This will then lead him to scorn those who came before him (i.e. the Salaf) and audaciously accuse them of having little knowledge. However, this ignoramus doesn’t realize that the reason why the Salaf made such few statements was only because of their piety and fear of Allaah. Had they wanted to speak profusely and elaborate themselves through many statements, they would not have been unable to do it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Footnotes:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] <b>Saheeh:</b> Reported by Ibn Maajah (254) from the narration of Jaabir bin ‘Abdillaah and authenticated by Al-Albaanee in <i>Saheeh-ul-Jaami’ </i>(7370).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] <b>Al-Qaraamitah:</b> They are one of the deviant factions that emerged from the Raafidah whose adherents follow Abu Sa’eed Bahraam Al-Hanaabee who was the founder of the Qaraamitee belief. They believed that ‘Abdullaah bin Al-Haarith Al-Kandee was a prophet and so would worship him. And they have other corrupt beliefs apart from that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] <b>Al-Baatiniyyah:</b> This is a name given to a group that splintered from the Isma’eeli Shiites. They believe that the entire Book of Allaah is open to reinterpretation and claim that it cannot be understood in its apparent (literal) form and so as a result they went astray. Their beliefs have influenced the Sufi movement, which claims that all of the Qur’aan has an apparent as well as a hidden meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Reported by Ahmad in <i>az-Zuhd </i>(pg. 267), Ad-Daarimee (1/89), Al-Aajurree in <i>Akhlaaq-ul-‘Ulamaa </i>(pg. 74), and Abu Nu’aim in Hilyat-ul-Awliyaa (2/147) and its chain of narration is sound (hasan). [A]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Reported by Ad-Daarimee (1/88) as a statement of Ibn ‘Umar. [A]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] Reported by Al-Aajurree in <i>Akhlaaq-ul-‘Ulamaa </i>(pg. 71 and Al-Khateeb in al-Faqeeh wal-Mutafaqqih (2/113) as a statement of Ayoob, and its chain of narration is authentic (saheeh). [A]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] He was the great Imaam, Abu Haneefah An-Nu’maan bin Thaabit, the Jurist from Iraq. He saw Anas bin Maalik on more than one occasion. He was pious, knowledgeable and diligent in performing deeds. Ash-Shaafi’ee said about him: “With regards to Fiqh, the people are dependent upon Abu Haneefah.” He died in 150H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] He was ‘Alqamah bin Qais bin ‘Abdillaah bin Maalik bin ‘Alqamah An-Nakha’ee from Koofah, Iraq. He was born during the lifetime of Allaah’s Messenger but never met him. He was from the major Taabi’een, being the main Jurist and Muhaddith of the people of Iraq. He studied very closely under Ibn Mas’ood and spread his knowledge after him, passing rulings and verdicts. He died in 72H and some say in 73H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] He was Al-Aswad bin Yazeed bin Qais An-Nakha’ee from the companions of Ibn Mas’oodt. His kunyah was Abu ‘Amr, but he was also called Abu ‘Abdir-Rahmaan. He was from the major Taabi’een, reliable and knowledgeable, and he narrated many hadeeth. He passed away in either 74H or 75H.</p>

SOURCE: At-Ta&#8217;seel fee Talab-il-&#8216;Ilm&#8221; (pg. 10-14)<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The First Foundation:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Seeking knowledge – which a Muslim needs in order to establish what is binding on him from worship of his Lord – is an obligation that is compulsory on him. As for what exceeds those limits, then acquiring knowledge of that falls under the collective obligations (fard kifaayah), and it is something recommended and extra for the student of knowledge.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof for this foundation is what has been reported from the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) that he said: <b>“Seeking knowledge is an obligation upon every Muslim.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another proof is the fact that this Religion is founded upon two basic principles, which are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. We don’t worship anyone except Allaah, and<br />
2. We don’t perform worship except with what Allaah has legislated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You cannot truly implement the worship of Allaah unless you first seek the necessary knowledge required for you to properly put into effect this worship that Allaah has made obligatory on you, and for which purpose He created you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Elucidating this point further, Ishaaq bin Raahawaih said: “Seeking knowledge is obligatory, even though the report concerning it is not authentic. However, what it means is that the seeker of knowledge is required to acquire from it what he needs such as for (properly implementing) his ablution, his prayer, his Zakaat – if he has wealth, his Hajj and so on.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said: “So whatever he is obligated to learn from that, then he need not ask the permission of his parents to go out and learn that. But as for what is in excess of that, he should not go out to acquire (knowledge of) that until he first gets permission to do that from his parents.” [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taimiyyah, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “Seeking religious knowledge is a collective obligation (fard kifaayah) except for that which is individually incumbent, such as every person seeking knowledge of what Allaah has ordered him to do and what Allaah has prohibited him to do, since this is an individual obligation.” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is one of the most important foundations, by which, the followers of Hadeeth are distinguished from those apart from them. It is due to this that the followers of innovation accuse the followers of Hadeeth by claiming that the highest objective of their speech is with regard to issues of purification, prayer and their likes!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But in reality, this is not blameworthy, since it is with (knowledge) purification that you will have achieved the key to prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“The key to prayer is purification. Its tahreem (commencement) is the takbeer (i.e. saying Allaahu Akbar) and its Tahleel (ending) is the tasleem (i.e. saying As-Salaam ‘Alaikum).”</b> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) also said: <b>“Islaam is built upon five (pillars): (1) The testimony that there is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah; (2) Establishing the prayer; (3) Paying the Zakaat; (4) Fasting in Ramadaan; and (5) the Pilgrimage (Hajj) to the Sacred House of Allaah for whoever is able to do it.”</b> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is for this reason that the first thing a student of knowledge is advised to do is to strive to obtain the knowledge that is binding upon him first. This is why when Imaam Maalik was asked about seeking knowledge, he said: “All of it is good. However, look into what you need for (the transactions of) your day and night, and then seek (knowledge of) that.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is since you will not truly actualize the worship of Allaah until you first obtain knowledge of what Allaah has legislated for you in those matters (of worship). So once you obtain that knowledge, you will be aware of how to perform wudoo, how to pray, how to perform ghusl, how to give Zakaat – if you have wealth, how to perform the Pilgrimage (Hajj) – if you intend to perform it, the rules of marriage – if you intend to marry someone, the rules of divorce – if you intend to divorce someone, and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This foundation consists of the following things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The ruling of an obligation. This relates to a Muslim that is responsible for his actions. If he is young (i.e. under the age of puberty), then it is upon his parents to teach him the affairs of his Religion that he is in need of. This is since the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“All of you are shepherds and all of you are responsible as to his flock.”</b> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says: <b>“O you who believe! Save yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is men and stones, over which are angels that are stern and severe – they do not disobey what Allaah has ordered them to do, and carry out what they are commanded.”</b> [Surah At-Tahreem: 6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is binding upon the Muslim father and the Muslim mother to teach their children what they are required to know from the matters of the Religion and from manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The student of knowledge must give precedence to acquiring knowledge of what is obligatory upon him to know over what is recommended for him to know. Preoccupying oneself with learning the recommended forms of knowledge whilst neglecting the obligatory forms of knowledge is one of the obstacles and impediments of seeking knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, for example, you may find a person speaking about the intricate issues of the Language, on Grammar, Terminology, the Science of Eloquence and Principles, yet he is not able to properly perform ablution in the same manner as that of the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>), nor is he able to perform the prayer properly like the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) used to pray…and so on and so forth!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. A seeker of knowledge should not oppose his parents by traveling abroad in search of knowledge that in his case is considered to be recommended. But in the case where that knowledge that he intends to travel abroad for is from the forms of knowledge that is binding upon him to know in order to worship Allaah during the night and day, then he may go ahead and travel, as was advised by Imaam Ishaaq in his previously mentioned statement: “So whatever he is obligated to learn from that, then he need not ask the permission of his parents to go out and learn that. But as for what is in excess of that, he should not go out to acquire (knowledge of) that until he first gets permission to do that from his parents.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The supportive sciences, or what some scholars commonly call “The applied sciences”, such as the Arabic Language, the Science of Eloquence, the Science of Principles, Hadeeth Terminology, and the Sciences of the Qur’aan – a student of knowledge should acquire from these that which will enable him to actualize the primary objective, which is to properly worship Allaah – the reason for which we were created. And if this is not the case, then it falls under the realm of being from the extravagant forms of knowledge, and Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not required from a student of knowledge studying Grammar that he becomes like Seebawaih, nor from one studying the Arabic Language that he becomes like Al-Khaleel and Al-Azharee, nor from one studying the Science of Eloquence that he becomes like Al-Jirjaanee!! Rather, it is sufficient for him to only learn from all of that what he needs to properly understand the Book and the Sunnah and to implement what Allaah has obligated upon him from worship.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THE THIRD FOUNDATION:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sincerity in seeking knowledge is a condition that is continuous and not just preliminary:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What this means is that the student of knowledge should continually strive to implement sincerity in himself, and that he should not refrain from his studies due to the claim that he did not achieve sincerity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some scholars have provided the following definition for sincerity (ikhlaas): Ibn Jamaa’ah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“It means that one has a good intention when seeking knowledge, by intending through his studies to please Allaah, to act in accordance with what he learns, to revive the Sharee’ah (Islamic legislation), to illuminate his heart, to elucidate its (i.e. knowledge’s) hidden meanings; to get near to Allaah on the Day of Judgement, and to subject oneself to what Allaah has prepared for those who possess it, such as His Contentment and great virtue.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyaan Ath-Thawree, may Allaah have mercy on him, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“I did not try to rectify anything that was more difficult upon me than my intention.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should not intend, by his search for knowledge, to fulfil some worldly goal such as assuming leadership, gaining status and wealth, competing with colleagues, having people extol him, taking the front seat in a gathering, and so on, since he will be exchanging that which is better for that which is lower.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Yoosuf, may Allaah have mercy on him, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Intend Allaah through your (search for) knowledge, for indeed I never sat in a gathering of people in which I made it my intention to humble myself except that I didn’t leave from it until I had surpassed them. And I never sat in a gathering of people in which I made it my intention to surpass them, except that I didn’t leave from it until I was disgraced.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Knowledge is one of the many acts of worship and one of the many ways of gaining nearness to Allaah. So if one purifies his intention while seeking it, his deed will be accepted and purified. And its blessing will become complete. However, if he intends other than the sake of Allaah when seeking knowledge, his deed becomes nullified and wasted and his transaction is lost. Perhaps he may even miss out on these (worldly) objectives and never achieve any of them. So in this case, he will have failed in his objective and at the same time wasted his efforts.” [11]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* This principle entails several matters, the most important of which is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Devil enters into the hearts of some people desiring to turn them away from knowledge based on the argument that one should leave off seeking knowledge until he first purifies his intention. This is a plot, scheme and deception of the Devil. Rather, it is upon a Muslim to continue and persevere in his search for knowledge, and to constantly re-evaluate his intention, as Sufyaan Ath-Thawree said: “I did not try to rectify anything that was more difficult upon me than my intention.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is Sufyaan we are talking about, so it applies even more so for those other than him!! Therefore, one should not make this into something that diverts him away from seeking knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Hishaam Ad-Dustawaa’ee, may Allaah have mercy on him, said;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“By Allaah, I cannot (honestly) say that I ever went out one day to seek hadeeth for the sake of Allaah”, Adh- Dhahabee, may Allaah have mercy on him, commented on this saying: “By Allaah, me either!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Salaf would seek knowledge for the sake of Allaah, and so they became dignified and went on to become Imaams that were followed and looked up to by the people. And there were other people from among them who did not seek knowledge for the sake of Allaah at first, but yet they still attained the knowledge, then they woke up and examined themselves. And so the knowledge led them to have sincerity while on their path (of seeking knowledge). This becomes clearer in what was stated by Mujaahid and others: “We sought this knowledge while not having a big intention concerning it. Then Allaah granted us the intention (for it) afterward.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Others would say: “We sought this knowledge for other than the sake of Allaah. But the knowledge refused that it should be sought except for the sake of Allaah.” So this is also good.Then, afterwards, they went on to spread the knowledge with righteous intentions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there were other people that sought knowledge with corrupt intentions – for the sake of the worldly life and so that they could be praised by the people. So they got what they intended.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (Sall Allaahu alaihi wa Sallam) said: “<span style="color:#008000;">Whoever fights in battle with the intention of (getting) war booty, he will have what he intends.</span>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You will find this type of people not being illuminated by the light of knowledge. The knowledge has no impact on their souls nor does it produce a noticeable result in their actions. Rather, the one with knowledge is only he who fears Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there were other people that attained knowledge and achieved positions due to it, but they oppressed people and abandoned the requisites of knowledge, thus embarking on committing major sins and lewd acts!! So woe be to them – these people are not scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some other people do not fear Allaah with regard to their knowledge, but rather engage in schemes, issuing verdicts permitting prohibited matters and reporting unauthentic and irregular narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Other people show audacity before Allaah and fabricate ahaadeeth, so Allaah exposed them and their knowledge left them. So their preparation became only for the Hellfire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of these types of people took in a large portion of knowledge, and they excelled in it, in the general sense. Then they were succeeded by later generations that had deficiency in knowledge and action. Then there followed a people after that who ascribed themselves to knowledge outwardly but were not well-versed in it, with the exception of a few among them who thought that because of that they had become noble scholars. However, it did not cross their minds that they were gaining nearness to Allaah through it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason for this is because they did not experience any teacher that was taken as a role model with regard to knowledge. So they became like savage barbarians. The biggest aim of one of their teachers was to obtain and amass costly books which they could look into on any given day. So they would misinterpret what was stated therein and not agree with it. We ask Allaah for salvation and pardon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of them have stated: “I am not a scholar, nor have I seen a scholar.” [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This third foundation is from amongst the important principles – and it is that a student strives to make his intention purely for the sake of Allaah when seeking knowledge. Achieving sincerity is something necessary. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَمَا أُمِرُوا إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ الدِّينَ<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">“And they were commanded not except to worship Allaah sincerely, making the worship purely for His sake.”</span> [Surah Al-Bayyinah: 5}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As we mentioned before, seeking the religious knowledge that is required in order to properly worship Allaah is itself an act of worship and part of the implementation of Laa Ilaaha IllaaAllaah. So in summary, seeking knowledge is an act of worship that one must strive to have sincerity in whilst performing it. The Messenger of Allaah (Sall Allaahu alaihi wa Sallam) said: “Verily, actions are based on intentions. And verily, every man will have what he intends.” [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Based on this, we say: A student of knowledge must continuously strive to correct his intention and to make it purely for the sake of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Someone may say: “Does this mean that I should not seek knowledge until I (first) correct my intention?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: No. Rather, you should seek knowledge. But while you are seeking knowledge, you should examine yourself and rectify yourself by way of correcting your intention. If this person continues, saying: “I want to leave off seeking knowledge until I (first) correct my<br />
intention!!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I will reply by saying: This is a trap from the Devil. He has opened up for you one of the doors of good intending by that to turn you away from that which is better and greater. So therefore, you should continue and be perseverant in your search for knowledge. And you should continuously rectify yourself, for indeed your knowledge – Allaah-willing – will guide you to make your intention sincerely for the sake of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Salaf would say: “We sought this knowledge for other than the sake of Allaah. But the knowledge refused that it should be sought except for the sake of Allaah.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AUTHOR:Shaikh Muhammad &#8216;Umar Bazmool<br />
SOURCE: His treatise &#8220;At-Ta&#8217;seel fee Talab-il-&#8216;Ilm&#8221;<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Second Foundation:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is meant by the “knowledge” that is mentioned in the ayaat and the ahaadeeth is knowledge of the Religion. As for the universal, physical and material sciences, then these are a collective obligation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These sciences fall under Allaah’s statement: <b>“And prepare against them all you can of power, including steeds of war…”</b> [Surah Al-Anfaal: 60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They also fall under the principle: <b>“There is no harming (of oneself) or harming others.” </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they fall under the principle: <b>“That which is necessary for the fulfillment of an obligation becomes itself obligatory.” </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>* This principle entails the following matters:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The statement: “This is obligatory upon every Muslim or student of knowledge.” cannot be applied unrestrictedly to any of the types of knowledge except for the Islamic sciences. An example of this is what is known nowadays as “Knowledge of Current Affairs”, which focuses on following reports and information from newspapers and magazines, and which some people say is: “An obligatory form of knowledge that every student of knowledge is required to learn!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The knowledge that the Salaf praised and which they intended in their statements is nothing else but knowledge of the Religion. This is the knowledge that was intended in statements such as that of Mu’aadh RAA, when he said: “Learn knowledge, for indeed learning it for the sake of Allaah is fear (of Him), seeking it is worship, studying it is glorification of Allaah, researching it is Jihaad, teaching it to those unaware of it is charity, and giving it out to one’s family builds ties. It is a friend in privacy, a companion in solitude, a guide in times of ease, an aide in times of difficulty, a minister to the friends (of Allaah), a close-relative to the strangers, and a lighthouse for the path to Paradise. Allaah raises people by way of it, thus making them noble leaders and chiefs in matters of good who are emulated, as well as guides to goodness whose footsteps are followed and whose deeds are highly regarded.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, from the things that this principle entails is that: The knowledge that Allaah, His Messenger and the predecessors, such as the Sahaabah and the Taabi’een have praised is nothing else but knowledge of the Religion. As for all of the other forms of knowledge, they were not the ones intended in the praise for “knowledge” found in these ayaat, ahaadeeth and statements of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So knowledge of medicine, engineering, chemistry, and physics is not what was intended in the ayaat and ahaadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When we come to understand this, we must ask: “What is the ruling on learning these sciences?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: It falls under the collective obligations, Acquiring knowledge of it falls under (the principle): “That which is necessary for the fulfillment of an obligation becomes itself obligatory.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Acquiring knowledge of these sciences falls under the statement of Allaah: <b>“And prepare against them all you can of power, including steeds of war…”</b> [Surah Al-Anfaal: 60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the ruling on these sciences. If some people take on the responsibility of learning them, the obligation becomes removed from everyone else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What also falls under the requisites of this principle is what I mentioned to you previously – that it cannot be unrestrictedly said that these sciences or their likes are obligatory for every Muslim to know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So for all the more reason, it is incorrect to unrestrictedly say that the knowledge of that which is associated with newspapers and magazines is from the “knowledge” that every student of knowledge is obliged to learn.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Tonight, we will begin with a very important and beneficial, Allaah-willing, introduction on the method of seeking knowledge. The reason for this talk is due to the great response and love for seekingp knowledge that we see from the youth, may Allaah bless them. However, many of them are not aware of the correct method for acquiring it. How should one seek knowledge? Some of them spend a long time, maybe years, seeking knowledge but they don’t achieve the level that others have achieved during that same amount of time. The reason behind this is due to his lack of adhering to the correct methodology with regard to seeking knowledge. This is the methodology by which if a student of knowledge adheres to it, he will achieve a share of what Allaah had decreed for him – a share that will benefit him; a share that is firm and established, which he will be able to convey to others in a clear and doubt-free manner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many of the youth read various writings – sometimes on the subjects of Hadeeth and sometimes on the subjects of Tafseer and Fiqh. They listen to and attend the gatherings of the people of knowledge. However, when they go back and examine themselves – i.e. those who have attended lectures for a year or two – they find that they have not fully understood the subject matter presented to them. Or perhaps they find that they have not acquired a lot of knowledge from this. Their attendance of lectures and lessons has not provided them with a well-founded basis of knowledge, which they can use as a way and method to follow and judge by. The reason for this is due to the lack of adhering to the correct method for seeking knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a student of knowledge must follow a clear and defined methodology when seeking knowledge. If he fails to do so, he will divert from the correct path, which is why we see that many of them get fed-up and impatient with knowledge. They spend years studying, but then grow weary and tired and eventually give it up. Then some more years pass by and they go back to being regular common folk or reciters – something they never expected. So we would like for the new up and coming student of knowledge to abide by two characteristics:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>First: </b>He should adhere to the method of education that those people of knowledge before us adhered to, and due to which they became scholars, after having treaded upon this way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Second: </b>He should be prepared to sacrifice all of his time to seeking knowledge. And he must not get fed up with it regardless of what the situation is.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his book <i>“Al-Jaami’ Li-Akhlaaq-ir-Raawee wa Adaab as-Saami’”</i>, Al-Khateeb Al-Baghdaadee reported: “One of the students of Hadeeth used to crave and yearn for seeking knowledge. So he would visit the elder teachers and sit in their gatherings. Then when some time had passed, he saw that he had not benefited at all and that he had not attained a great deal of knowledge. So he said: ‘I am not fit for this knowledge” and gave it up, since he thought that there was something wrong with his understanding or that he was not qualified for seeking knowledge. One day, after he had left off seeking knowledge for some time, he passed by a rock that had water falling on it, drop by drop. The continuous dripping of water had affected the rock to the point that it had made a hole in it. The man stood there for a while, contemplating and reflecting, and said: ‘This water, in spite of its softness, was able to have an effect on this rock, in spite of its hardness. And my mind and heart are not harder than this rock and neither is this knowledge any softer than the water.’ So he became determined to go back to seeking knowledge, which he did and excelled at. And he later became one of those referred to with regard to it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This shows you that a student of knowledge needs determination. He should not get tired and say: “I have studied and not learned anything!” Rather, he should go back to the cause. The cause is not found in his natural disposition. With regard to most of the youth or most of those who set out to seek knowledge, the cause is not that they don’t understand. Many of them do understand, but the reason why they are not able to acquire knowledge is because they have not followed the correct path and methodology, which produced the people of knowledge that came before us. This path is simple and easy, and it is easier than the paths that many of the people take today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once this point becomes clear, the following important question should come to mind, which is often repeated and which many of the youth continuously ask, and it is: What is the correct way for seeking knowledge? How should a student of knowledge follow this way in accordance with the methodology that will enable him to become a (true) student of knowledge and have the ability to study, if Allaah grants him success in that? This is an extremely important question. Attending the gatherings of knowledge has many benefits to it – the greatest of which is that the student of knowledge comes out from these sittings fully understanding the subjects presented to him such that he is able to make others understand what he has understood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>First: </b>The student of knowledge must have the following necessary and binding characteristics and attributes in his quest for attaining knowledge:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The first and greatest of these characteristics is that he must be sincere to his Lord when seeking knowledge. This is since seeking knowledge is an act of worship and the angels, as stated in an authentic hadeeth, lower their wings for the seeker of knowledge out of contentment for what he is doing. So this act of worship must be done sincerely for Allaah’s sake in order for it to be accepted and blessed by Allaah. This means that one should not seek knowledge in order to achieve some worldly position. One should not seek religious knowledge – knowledge of the Qur’aan and Sunnah – for the sake of status or to be heard or so that he may become a teacher or a lecturer or famous or so that he can give lessons and so on. Rather, his intention behind seeking knowledge should be to worship Allaah and remove ignorance from himself. This is so that he may worship Allaah upon knowledge and clear insight.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, being sincere in seeking knowledge means that (1) one’s intention is for the sake of Allaah and not to attain some worldly position; and that (2) one intends to remove ignorance from himself. Imaam Ahmad was once asked: “How should one have sincerity with regard to knowledge?” He replied saying: “Sincerity in knowledge is that a person intends to uplift ignorance from himself. This is since a person with knowledge and a person that is very ignorant are not equal.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says: <b>“Is one who is obedient to Allaah, prostrating himself and standing in prayer during the hours of the night, fearing the Hereafter and hoping for the Mercy of His Lord (like one who disbelieves)? Say: Are those who know equal to those who don’t know?”</b>[Surah Az-Zumar: 9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says in Surah Al-Mujaadilah: <b>“Allaah will raise those who believe amongst you and those who were given knowledge many levels.” </b>[Surah Al-Mujaadilah: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah has given preference to those who have knowledge over those who don’t. The person who seeks knowledge in order to worship Allaah upon clarity and to remove ignorance from himself and so that he can live his life in accordance with what Allaah has legislated – this is the one who is truly sincere (in his search for knowledge). He is sincere because his intention was for the sake of Allaah. His intention was to free himself from being a follower of desires and from being ignorant and a blind follower.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sincerity is the first of these conditions and the primary characteristic and attribute that the student of knowledge must have. The proper characteristics and attributes one should have are many, such that numerous books and writings, big and small, have been authored on them. However, we will only mention from those characteristics, those that concern us in this discussion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Second: </b>One must apply gentleness and proceed in a slow and calm manner in his search for knowledge. This is since the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) informed us, in general terms, saying: “Verily, Allaah loves gentleness in every affair.” Seeking knowledge falls under this in the general sense. The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) also said: “Gentleness does not enter something except that it beautifies it.” Knowledge and studying fall under this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What does it mean to “apply gentleness?” It means that one should not seek to achieve knowledge all at once, as Ibn Shihaab Az-Zuhree, the famous Imaam from the Taabi’een, once said: <b>“Whoever seeks to attain knowledge in one shot, it will leave from him in one shot. Rather, knowledge is to be sought with the passage of days and nights.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A poet elaborated more on this understanding, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>“Knowledge today and tomorrow the same,<br />
By doing this a man will attain wisdom,<br />
Through choosing knowledge, which is to be gathered,<br />
Since a stream is nothing more than a collection of droplets.”</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So gentleness is something that is required. But how is this gentleness to be applied? It is by not desiring to attain knowledge all at once, i.e. in one shot. For example, a person wishes to gain knowledge of Tafseer, so he goes and reads the “<i>Tafseer</i>” of Ibn Jareer. The Tafseer of Ibn Jareer contains all aspects of Tafseer. So this person has sought to attain knowledge all at once. It is not possible for one to “start” and “finish” the Tafseer of Ibn Jareer. And if you were to ask him a question regarding it, nothing from the Tafseer would stick to his mind except for a small portion. He remembers that he read this and that he read that. But he will not be able to properly explain to you the meaning of a verse in the manner that is necessary. So then how is this gentleness to be applied? It is by seeking knowledge in gradual stages – this is the way that must be adhered to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, we have the example of a man who intends to study the Science of Hadeeth, so he goes to the book “<i>Nail-ul-Awtaar</i>”, and begins with that, or he goes to “<i>Fat’h-ul-Baaree</i>” and says: “That’s it. I finished one chapter from <i>Fat’h-ul-Baaree</i>.” You should know that this type of person will never achieve the level of understanding that the people of knowledge are upon. He may become well-versed or an informed reader having scattered bits of information. But this is not the knowledge that serves as a foundation and which afterward will propel the one who has it to the level of a scholar, if Allaah so grants it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same goes for Fiqh. What have you read concerning Fiqh? He says: “I am reading “<i>Al-Mughnee</i>” or “I am reading the “<i>Majmoo’(-ul-Fataawaa</i>).” It can be honestly said that this person has not applied gentleness in his search for knowledge. He has sought to attain knowledge all at once. “<i>Al-Mughnee</i>” and “<i>Al-Majmoo’</i>” as well as the other larger works – the only ones who should preoccupy themselves with the (Fuqh) issues contained in them are the people of knowledge. As for the beginning student of knowledge, he should not read it from beginning to end. No doubt, he will at some point need to conduct research on a specific issue, in which case he will have to refer to the larger works. However, he should not read these books thoroughly as if he were reading through a novel.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, from the requisites of gentleness is that a student of knowledge should not preoccupy himself with the complex intricate issues. This is since, if while seeking knowledge, he preoccupies himself with intricate issues and complex subjects, he will eventually forget it and never acquire knowledge. The reason for this is because he has not established the proper foundation by which he can understand these complex and intricate (Fiqh) issues. Some of us go to classes that deal with extremely complex issues in which the students spend numerous long years and still have not finished it or they spend months on just one chapter alone, and so on, and they think that they have acquired knowledge. No. This is not the correct way since they has have not applied gentleness. And Allaah, the Mighty and Sublime, says: <b>“But rather, be you Rabbaaniyeen (learned men) because of your teaching the Book and studying it.” </b>[Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 79]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the part of the ayah: <b>“Be you Rabbaaniyeen”</b>, Abu ‘Abdillaah Al-Bukhaaree, may Allaah have mercy on him, interpreted it by saying: <b>“The Rabbaanee is he who nurtures the people using the smaller aspects of knowledge before the bigger ones.” </b>So this person who is well-versed in knowledge and teaching is he who raises the people upon the smaller aspects of knowledge before the bigger ones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is honorable for an instructor or student of knowledge, when teaching, to mention everything he knows about a specific issue. After preparing his lesson, he should mention everything that he remembers on the subject. This is an honorable characteristic. However, this is not beneficial for the one who is teaching since he is reviewing what he knows. The person with knowledge should only deliver what the audience needs. He should not deliver to the audience that which is over their level.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So one must apply gentleness – How should this gentleness be? The reply to this will come when we explain the correct method of seeking knowledge, and that is by seeking knowledge in stages.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Third: </b>He must be persistent in his search for knowledge, giving it the dearest and sweetest parts of his time, and not the dead and lifeless parts of it. So if an individual reserves for knowledge and classes the times in which his mind is exhausted and his understanding is weak, he has opposed the correct method of seeking knowledge and is not being sincere to himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, you should give knowledge the best moments of your time, in which your mind is clear, strong and unoccupied. However, this will only happen if there is something else accompanying it. And that is when the student of knowledge is engulfed in knowledge day and night. He wakes up in the morning with knowledge filling his mind and he passes the evening in the same manner. His life revolves around knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he wants to sleep, he has a book next to him, which he may need to reference for a particular (Fiqh) issue. This is why some of the scholars say: “If you see the books of a student of knowledge neatly arranged in order, then know that he has abandoned (reading) them.” If you pay an unexpected visit to a person and enter his library to find his books neatly arranged – each book in its proper place – this means that he does not look into them. There is no book on the floor, nor is there any book beside him, and if he has a table, there are no books on top of it – this indicates that he reserves a particular time for “reading”, as done by some hired educators. There is no such thing as ”study time” for the student of knowledge! This is because all of his time is spent in seeking knowledge. In the morning and in the evening, his mind is preoccupied with the various issues of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The best period of time in a person’s life in which he can acquire knowledge is in the period of his adolescence. This is when he can devote all of his time to it. He should distribute his time for the various aspects of knowledge, leaving the best portions of it in which his memory is strong to the sciences that require the mind to be overworked, such as the sciences of Jurisprudence (Fiqh), Fundamental Principles (Usool), Grammar (Nahu) and so on. As for normal times, he should reserve that for subjects that do not require his mind to be overworked, such as the subjects of Interpreting the Qur’aan (Tafseer), Narrations (Hadeeth), Terminology of the Hadeeth (Mustalah) and so on. And the times in which his comprehension is at the weakest level, he should use for reading books on etiquettes, books on narrators, the biographies of narrators, history and so on – general learning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he is constantly preoccupied wherever he is. He is always busy with seeking knowledge. No amusement or company can deter him from that. This is why we see that the biggest mistake that some who think that they are students of knowledge commit is that they spend long hours in gatherings engaged in he said/she said talk and speech that does not result in knowledge. He will not become a student of knowledge this way. Rather, he will become something else depending on what he preoccupies his time with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the student of knowledge, then his hopes, desires and aspirations are all preoccupied with seeking knowledge. The gathering in which there occurs discussions on seeking knowledge and a clarification of what Allaah has revealed in His Book or what the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) has stated – this is the place in which one can open his heart and broaden his mind. Or it could be in a place of education or in a place where there is an explanation of the knowledge that Allaah revealed. This is the place where the heart finds ease and relaxation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, from the required characteristics that a student of knowledge must have is that he constantly engulf himself with knowledge. He should not give knowledge some of his time. Rather, he should give all of his time to it or a portion of it, such as the period of his adolescence – the period in which it is easy for one to acquire knowledge. This is why some of the predecessors would say: “Give knowledge all of yourself, and it will give you some of itself.” This is since knowledge is vast and its aspects are numerous and diverse. This is why when one of the Imaams of Hadeeth was on his deathbed, he would still be narrating hadeeth, telling his scribe to write it down – knowledge that was obtained even in a situation such as this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This shows you the extent of his sincerity, following (of the Religion) and the fact that his heart was engulfed in knowledge. When Imaam Ahmad was suffering from his final sickness, at times, he would feel pain and groan out loud. So when one of his students came and heard him, he narrated to him with a chain of narration from Muhammad bin Sireen that Anas bin Maalik (<i>radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</i>) used to consider it detested (<i>makrooh</i>) to groan. After that, he did not hear Ahmad groan again until he passed away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This mentality on the part of the student and the teacher is that which will enable the student of knowledge, through the Grace of Allaah, to become a scholar in the future, if Allaah wills. And this is the mentality which will enable him to benefit and cause him to always be preoccupied with knowledge – day and night, he is learning. He should not look down upon a point of benefit that comes to him by way of someone that is young in age or old in age. Some people receive points of benefit from individuals that are younger than them (in age and knowledge), and so they feel arrogant towards him or they don’t give that point their full attention. The reason for this is because they have elevated themselves over the knowledge. And when one elevates himself over knowledge, he will not be from those who are able to acquire it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, a younger or smaller person may have some knowledge that an older or bigger person doesn’t. And likewise one who is younger or smaller may understand some aspects of knowledge whereas one who is older and bigger may not. But if he explains it to him, he should benefit from it. The scholars have mentioned a clear example for this, which is the story of prophet Sulaymaan and the hoopoe bird. Even though the hoopoe bird was lowly in terms of stature and composure and Sulaymaan was elevated in terms of stature, composure and position in the sight of Allaah and before all of creation, the hoopoe bird said to him: <b>“I have grasped knowledge of something that you have not grasped. And I have come to you from Saba’ (Sheba) with certain news.”</b> [Surah An-Naml: 22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the hoopoe bird knew something that Sulayman was unaware of. The people of knowledge have derived from this story that you should not be arrogant with someone that brings you a point of benefit (from knowledge), regardless if he is young and lowly or old and prominent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These three characteristics are extremely important for the student of knowledge. There are other characteristics besides these, as I mentioned before to you, which you should look up in the books that were written about this subject.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Shaikh Muhammad &#8216;Umar Bazmool<br />
SOURCE: His book &#8220;At-Ta&#8217;seel fee Talab al-&#8216;Ilm&#8221; (pg. 29-31)<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Seventh Foundation: The Ways of Maintaining Knowledge</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the most significant ways of upholding and preserving knowledge is: (1) Acting on it, (2) teaching it to others, and (3) writing concerning it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These three principles have been indicated in Allaah’s statement: <b>“By the time. Verily, mankind is at loss – Except for those who believe and do righteous deeds and mutually advise one another towards truth and mutually advise one another towards patience.”</b> [Surah Al-‘Asr]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has ruled that all of mankind is at loss, but then makes an exception to this for those who believe, so long as they remain believers. This is since they have acquired beneficial knowledge, then acted on it, then called others to this action and to the beneficial knowledge that is with them. So the most important way of consolidating knowledge is acting upon it, teaching it to others and writing about it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Acting upon one’s knowledge is one of the most significant ways by which knowledge can become firmly rooted in a person. Rather, this is the primary objective for seeking knowledge. It has been reported on the Salaf that they used to say: “Knowledge summons actions, so if it does not respond, it departs.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Wakee’ said: “We would seek assistance for memorizing hadeeth, by acting upon them.” [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What falls under the subject of acting upon knowledge is the talk about one’s abandonment of committing sins and acts of disobedience. This is since falling into these acts contradicts everything that knowledge mandates.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are some famous verses that elaborate this understanding further:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>“I complained to Wakee’ about my poor memory</i><br />
<i>So he advised me to abandon sins</i><br />
<i>And he informed me that knowledge is a virtue</i><br />
<i>And Allaah’s virtue is not given to a sinner.” </i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad bin an-Nadr Al-Haarithee said: “It used to be said that the first instruction (for knowledge) was: Remaining silent for it (i.e. knowledge), then listening to it, then memorizing it, then acting upon it, then spreading it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyaan said: “The scholar does not argue nor does he flatter (others). He only spreads the wisdom of Allaah. If it is accepted from him, he praises Allaah. And if it is rejected, he praises Allaah.” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jaabir reported: “Learn to remain silent, then learn to be refrained, then acquire knowledge, then learn to act on it, then spread it.” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They would also be eager to act upon the ahaadeeth that would reach them from Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>), even if there did not appear any directive towards worship in them. This was only done because of their attempt to follow the chosen one (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abdur-Rahmaan bin Mahdee reported: I heard Sufyaan say: “No hadeeth from the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) was ever conveyed to me except that I acted upon it, even if it was just once.” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Ahmad bin Hanbal, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “I never wrote down a hadeeth except that I acted upon it. This was such that it reached me that the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) was cupped (Hijaamah) and gave Abu Tayyibah a deenar. So I gave the blood-cupper a deenar when he cupped me.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when a person is sincere with knowledge and acts upon it, his aspiration is for the Hereafter and he walks upon the earth in humility.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibraaheem bin Adham said: “Whoever seeks knowledge with true sincerity, in order to benefit the servants of Allaah with it and benefit himself, being unknown will be more beloved to him than being arrogant. This is what will cause him to increase in humility with regard to himself, exertion with regard to worship, fear from Allaah, longing for Him, and humbleness in front of the people – not caring for what goes on in the day and night of this worldly life.” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Teaching knowledge also helps one to maintain it. This does not mean that one should actively seek to put himself forward before he is ready. Rather, what it means is that he strives to mutually confer his knowledge and give it to those colleagues who ask him about it, as well as those below him. So he teaches them and repeatedly holds lessons with them. This does not mean that he rushes to be their shaikh (teacher) or seeks leadership before his due time, for indeed these are from the great dangers, as the saying goes: “He becomes a raisin before becoming a dried grape.” And Ash-Shaafi’ee said: “If the young person is put in a leadership role, he is deprived of much good.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Authoring on knowledge means that you write down the issues, arranging them in order and providing research for them based on the foundation of evidence. And it means that you collect the statements of the people of knowledge on every issue, writing them down and putting them in order, whilst avoiding the strange and irregular ones among them, in your earnest attempt to search for the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We don’t mean by a student preoccupying himself with authoring that he strives hard in writing a book and giving it out to the people, since the student, at this stage, has not reached this level yet. Rather, he should present his books and writings to the scholars as well as those above him and those who preceded him in seeking knowledge, for the purpose of seeking their advice and heeding their statements and instructions. What is intended here is that writing down knowledge helps one to memorize and remember knowledge and its issues.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allaah and may the peace and blessings be on His Messenger, our Prophet Muhammad, his family and companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that seeking knowledge is from the most virtuous acts of worship. And it is from the causes that bring about the success of Paradise and honor for those who act on it. From the most important of matters, is that one have sincerity in his search for knowledge, and this is by making his studying for the sake of Allaah and not for any other objective. This is because this is the way for one to derive benefit from it and a means for successfully attaining the highest of positions in this world and the next.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported in the Hadeeth that the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;Whoever learns some knowledge, by which Allaah&#8217;s Face is sought, but he doesn&#8217;t learn it except to achieve some worldly goal by it, he will not smell the fragrance of Paradise on the Day of Judgement.&#8221;</b> &#8211; Reported by Abu Dawood with a hasan (sound) chain of narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At-Timidhee reported a hadeeth with a chain in which there is some weakness, that the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;Whoever seeks knowledge to compete with the scholars or to debate with the ignorant ones or so that the people&#8217;s faces can turn towards him, then Allaah will enter him into the Hellfire.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I advise every student of knowledge and every Muslim to have sincerity with Allaah in all of their actions, acting on the words of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;So whoever hopes for meeting his Lord, then let him do righteous deeds and not mix anyone (or thing) with the worship of His Lord.&#8221;</b> [Surah Al-Kahf: 110]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Saheeh Muslim, the Prophet is reported to have said: <b>&#8220;Allaah said: &#8216;I am the most free of all those who are mixed in worship with Me from shirk. Whoever does a deed in which he mixes someone else along with Me (in the worship), I abandon him and his shirk.'&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, I advise the student of knowledge and every Muslim to fear Allaah and to acknowledge that Allaah is watching Him in every matter, acting on Allaah&#8217;s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Verily those who fear their Lord with the unseen (i.e. they do not see Him), they will have forgiveness and a great reward.&#8221;</b> [Surah Al-Mulk: 12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying: <b>&#8220;And whoever fears the position of His Lord will have two Gardens.&#8221;</b> [Surah Ar-Rahmaan: 46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the Salaf said: <b>&#8220;The pinnacle of knowledge is fear of Allaah.&#8221; And &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Mas&#8217;ood (<i>radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</i>) said: &#8220;It is sufficient as knowledge that one fear Allaah. And it is sufficient as ignorance that one is deceived about this.&#8221;</b> And some of the Salaf said: &#8220;Whoever is the most knowledgeable about Allaah, he is the most fearing of Him.&#8221; What indicates the correctness of this understanding is the saying of the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>): <b>&#8220;As for me, by Allaah, I am the most fearing of Allaah amongst you and the most dutiful (having Taqwaa) to Him amongst you.&#8221;</b> &#8211; Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So every time the servant&#8217;s knowledge of Allaah becomes strengthened, this is a means for the perfection of his Taqwaa and Ikhlaas, and his stopping at the limits (set by Allaah), and his refraining from sinful acts. This is why Allaah said: <b>&#8220;Verily, only those who fear Allaah from His servants are the knowledgeable ones (i.e. the scholars).&#8221;</b> [Surah Al-Faatir: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the ones who are knowledgeable of Allaah and His Religion, they are the ones who fear Him the most and who are the most dutiful to him from amongst the people. At the head of them are the messengers and prophets, &#8216;alayhim as-Salaam, and then those that follow them in goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) informed us that from the signs of success is that the servant of Allaah acquires fiqh (or understanding) of the Religion, as He said: <b>&#8220;Whoever Allaah wants good for, He gives him understanding of the Religion.&#8221;</b> &#8211; Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim from the hadeeth of Mu&#8217;awiyah (<i>radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</i>). This is for no other reason except due to the fact that understanding of the Religion will prompt the servant to establish Allaah&#8217;s Commandments, to fear Him and to carry out His obligations and to stay away from those things that draw His displeasure. And it will call him towards good manners and righteous actions and in being sincere to Allaah and His servants.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I ask Allaah that He grant us and all the students of knowledge, as well as all the Muslims, understanding of His Religion and perseverance upon it. And I ask that He grant us refuge from the evils of our souls and the evils of our actions. Indeed He is in charge of that and able to carry it out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Sixth Foundation: Obstacles in the Path of Seeking Knowledge</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since knowledge is a path that leads towards Paradise, and Paradise is surrounded by many dangers, this means that the path of knowledge is also surrounded by many dangers. So there are many things in it that the evilly-inclined soul dislikes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And since knowledge facilitates the path to Paradise, and the Devil has made a covenant that he will cut off the path to Paradise, then indeed, the path of knowledge is a path in which the Devil places what deceptions he can in order to divert the person on the path away from his objective.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The origins for sins lie in three things: greed, jealousy and pride.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was greed that cast our father Aadam out from Paradise. This is what the Devil whispered to him when he saw his eagerness for Paradise: <b>“Then the Devil whispered suggestions to them both in order to uncover that which was hidden from them (before) of their private parts. He said (to them): ‘Your Lord did not forbid you from this tree save you should become angels or become of the immortals.’ And he (the Devil) swore by Allaah to them both (saying): ‘Verily, I am one of the sincere well-wishers for you both.’”</b> [Surah Al-A’raaf: 20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“Then the Devil whispered to him saying: ‘O Aadam! Shall I lead you to the Tree of Eternity and to a kingdom that will never waste away?’”</b> [Surah TaHa: 120]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was jealousy that caused the enmity to occur between the two sons of Aadam, when they both brought sacrificial offerings and it was accepted from one of them but not from the other, who then raised his hand to kill the other one out of jealousy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was pride that brought Iblees into disbelief: <b>“And (remember) when We said to the angels: ‘Prostrate to Aadam.’ So they all prostrated except for Iblees – he refused and was proud and was one of the disbelievers.”</b> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since these three things are the foundations for all sin, and all offenses can be traced back to them, then indeed the distractions and obstacles of seeking knowledge can also be traced back to them!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Examples of this are as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. A student’s greed for knowledge – if he doesn’t pay attention to his other rights – may cause him to eventually abandon and squander knowledge. There are several scenarios for this, such as:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; When a student crams his daily schedule with acquiring knowledge, thus preoccupying himself with it every day, attending numerous classes and study circles. So his body does not rest, whereas your soul indeed has a right over you and your body also has a right over you. So you must give everything that has a right (over you) its due right.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; Greed may also bring a student to change from one form of knowledge to another before having completed the first one. By doing this, he deprives himself of having the correct understanding and command of both forms of knowledge. An example of this is when a student starts studying a book, then hears about another class in a different place, so he leaves off from finishing the first book with the instructor and goes to the other class.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this is as a result of greed. On the outset, this is good but it can lead to the opposite of what was intended. This reminds me of a statement made by one of the Salaf: “Verily, the Devil opens ninety-nine doors from the doors of good, just so that he can place you into one door from the doors of evil.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Shihaab Az-Zuhree, may Allaah have mercy on him, once said to Yoonus bin Yazeed: “O Yoonus! Do not strive to surpass knowledge, for knowledge is like river basins – whichever of them you set out after, it will cut you off before you can reach it. Rather, you must take it with (the passage of) days and nights. And you must not take knowledge all at once for indeed whoever seeks to attain it all at once, it will leave him all at once. Rather, knowledge must be taken step by step, with (the passage of) days and nights.” [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Jealousy can prevent a student of knowledge from acquiring knowledge. Examples of this are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; When a student envies his colleagues over seeking knowledge and lacks understanding over an issue. So he stubbornly refrains from asking them because he is jealous of them. So he doesn’t research or study with them, whereas the thing that gives knowledge life is consulting and reminding one another about it. Therefore, this deprives him from seeking knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; When a student envies his professor or teacher for what he has and as a result rebels against him in his class and doesn’t want him to teach and benefit the other students. So he feels that there is no difference between him and his teacher. This also prevents him from acquiring knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; When a person feels jealous of his colleagues because of their level of understanding and desire to learn, so he causes disturbances in the class to the point that he deprives them of the ability to benefit, out of jealousy. But he in fact is only depriving himself by doing this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Pride can also prevent the student of knowledge from learning and education. Examples of this are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; Perhaps Allaah has granted someone the ability to attain knowledge. But the envious arrogant person considers him to be lower than himself, so as a result of this, he doesn’t learn from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; Pride can prevent a person from seeking to learn something he doesn’t understand or from asking his teacher about it in order to understand it. In fact, seeking knowledge primarily due to pride can prevent him from sitting in the gatherings of the students of knowledge in front of <i>shuyookh</i>(teachers).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; A person may be jealous of his colleagues and thus refrain haughtily from asking them and trying to learn from them those issues he has difficulty with or those subjects he was not present for.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bayhaqee reported in <i>Shu’ab-ul-Eemaan</i> from Abu Haazim that he said: “You cannot be a scholar until you have three characteristics in you: (!) Do not transgress over those above you, (2) Do not look down with contempt at those below you, and (3) Do not take the worldly life in exchange for your knowledge.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; Pride may lead a person to boast, make pretentious claims, and to argue with others, and these are things that are prohibited in the Religion. Jaabir bin ‘Abdillaah (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) reported that the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“Do not acquire knowledge for the sake of competing with the scholars or to argue with the foolish or to take control over a gathering, for whoever does that, then (for him will be) the Hellfire, the Hellfire.”</b> [2]</p>

PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Ninth Foundation:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People are divided into two categories with respect to knowledge: (1) Those who know, and (2) those who don’t know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who don’t know are obligated to ask the people of knowledge and accept their statements, while expending what effort they can in order to know the proofs and evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says: <b>“And We did not send before you anyone except men that we gave revelation to. So ask the people of remembrance (knowledge) if you don’t know. With clear signs and books (We sent the Messengers). And We also sent down unto you the Reminder (i.e. Sunnah) so that you may explain clearly to the people what was revealed to them (i.e. the Qur’aan), and that they may give thought.”</b>[Surah An-Nahl: 43-44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who knows the religious ruling on an issue, based on its evidences, is from those who know. So he is a person of knowledge (<i>‘aalim</i>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whoever takes the opinion of someone else without knowing its proof, he is a blind-follower (<i>muqallid</i>), and not a person of knowledge. Ibn ‘Abdil-Barr relayed the consensus (<i>Ijmaa’</i>) that the blind-follower – who is the one who accepts the opinion of someone else without knowing its evidence – is not from the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the one who knows an issue based on its evidence, while investigating the different views and proofs used on the issue, while taking the view that appears most correct to him, then he is a<i>Mujtahid</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who has knowledge of an issue based on its evidences, meaning that he has accepted the view for which the proofs are most convincing to him on that issue, without making efforts into examining or looking into the other (differing) opinions. So he only has knowledge of the most correct view based on its evidences. This person is a follower (<i>muttabi’</i>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the Mujtahid is one who abides by this methodology in all of the issues of knowledge and doesn’t restrict himself to just looking into the principles of one specific <i>madh-hab</i>, then this person is an absolute <i>Mujtahid</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he limits himself to investigating an issue by only looking into the principles of one particular <i>madh-hab</i>, then he is a limited <i>Mujtahid</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if his condition is that he performs Ijtihaad in all of the issues of the Religion, then he is a complete<i>Mujtahid</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if his condition is Ijtihaad in just some issues, apart from others, then he is a partial Mujtahid. So with regard to an issue, a person can be a Mujtahid implementing partial Ijtihaad, and some another issue he could be a <i>muttabi’</i> (follower), and yet in another issue, he could be a <i>muqallid</i> (blind-follower). This varies according to what is easy for him during the occurrence of an event that this issue relates to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One must also beware of opinions. This refers to statements in the Religion of Allaah that have no authentic or considerable evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You must also know, my brother, that the Qur’aan and the Sunnah serve as the foundation for opinion and they act as the standard by which opinion is determined. The opinion is not the standard used to determine the Sunnah. Rather, the Sunnah is the standard used to determine the opinion. So whoever doesn’t know the foundation will never attain the branch.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Wahb said: Maalik narrated to me that Iyyaas bin Mu’aawiyah said to Rabee’ah: “When something is built upon crookedness, it will never be able to straighten itself.” Maalik said: “He means by this, the Muftee that speaks based on a foundation, which he builds his speech on.” [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ash-Shaafi’ee, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “Whoever learns the Qur’aan, his value becomes magnified. And whoever speaks about Fiqh, his status becomes increased. And whoever records Hadeeth, his arguments become strengthened. And whoever looks into accounting, his views will become unerring. And whoever does not maintain himself, his knowledge will not benefit him.” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hibbaan, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “Verily, in adhering to his Sunnah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) there is the most complete form of salvation and the most comprehensive form of nobility. Its lights cannot be doused nor can its arguments be refuted. Whoever adheres to it will be protected, and whoever opposes it will be condemned. This is since it is the stronghold and the firm support, whose merit is clear and whose rope is solid. Whoever holds onto it prevails and whoever opposes it becomes destroyed. So those who stick to it will be successful in the next life and blessed amongst the creatures in the present life.” [3]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;">By Shaykh Rabee’ bin Haadee al-Madkhalee</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"> Taken from Mudhakkirah al-Hadeeth an-Nabawee</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"> Source: <a href="http://www.al-ibaanah.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.al-ibaanah.com</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Moosaa al-Ash’aree (radee Allaahu `anhu) reported that the Prophet (sall-Allaahu `alayhi wa sallam) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The example of the guidance and knowledge that Allaah sent me with is like the example of abundant rain that fell upon the earth, some of which was fertile soil that absorbed the water and brought forth vegetation and grass in abundance; and some of which was hard earth that held the water, and Allaah benefited the people through it. So they drank from it, let their animals drink from it and used it for cultivation. And some of the rain fell upon another portion of the land that was barren and it neither held the water nor brought forth vegetation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first is the example of the person that comprehends Allaah’s Religion and benefits (from the knowledge) that Allaah sent me with, so he learns and then teaches others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The last example is that of a person who does not care for it and does not accept the guidance of Allaah that I was sent with.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Reported by Al-Bukhaaree [1], Muslim [2] and Ahmad [3])</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrator of the Hadeeth: He is Abu Moosaa al-Ash’aree, `Abdullaah bin Qais bin Saleem bin Hidaar, the well-known Companion. He migrated to Makkah, then to Abyssinia, then to Madeenah. The Messenger of Allaah put him in charge of one district of Yemen. He was courageous, a scholar and a doer of good deeds. `Umar bin Al-Khattaab appointed him as governor over Koofah and Basrah. He conquered Ahwaaz, Asbahaan and a number of other lands. He died in 50H.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Vocabulary in the Hadeeth:</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Mathal</strong>: (Example) what is meant by it here is an amazing resemblance not a proverbial statement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Hudaa</strong>: (Guidance) means that which leads one to what is being sought</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ghaith Katheer:</strong> abundant rain</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Naqiyyah</strong>: (fertile) means pure and fresh as occurs in another narration of the hadeeth</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Kala</strong>’: (vegetation) is applicable to both wet and dry vegetation</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`<strong>ushb</strong>: (grass) refers to fresh produce</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ajaadib</strong>: (hard earth) is the plural of jadab and it means the land that is solid and which doesn’t absorb water</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Qi’aan</strong>: (barren land) is the plural of qaa’, which means a straight and smooth plain (land) that doesn’t produce vegetation.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">An Explanation of this Parable:</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sall-Allaahu `alayhi wa sallam) put forth an example likening what he came with from the Religion to the common rain, which comes to the people in the circumstance when they need it. Such was the circumstance with the people before the Prophet’s advent. So just as Allaah brings life to the dead earth through rain water, then such is the case with Allaah’s revelation, with which He brings life to the dead hearts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says: “<span style="color:#008000;">Is he who was dead and We gave him life and set for him a light whereby he can walk amongst men – like he who is in the darkness from which he can never come out?</span>” [Soorah Al-An&#8217;aam: 122]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The light here refers to the light of revelation and the darkness refers to the darkness of ignorance, disbelief and misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Prophet (sall-Allaahu `alayhi wa sallam) likened those who hear what (guidance) he came with to the various type of earth, which rain falls upon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. So from among them is the scholar and doer of deeds, who teaches others. He bears the status of fresh earth that intakes the water and benefits itself with it and then produces vegetation thereby benefiting others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. And from among them is the one who gathers knowledge and strives to attain it, but doesn’t act upon its requirements or he doesn’t understand what he has gathered. However, he passes it on to others. So he bears the status of the earth upon which water settles, and which the people benefit from by using.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This type of person was indicated by the Prophet (sall-Allaahu `alayhi wa sallam) in his saying: <span style="color:#008000;">“May Allaah brighten (the face) of a man that hears a statement from me, retains it in memory and then passes it on just as he heard it.”</span> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. And from among them is he who hears the knowledge but doesn’t preserve it or act upon it or pass it along to others. So it bears the status of the smooth barren land that neither intakes water nor passes it onto others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (sall-Allaahu `alayhi wa sallam) only joined the first two praiseworthy groups in this parable due to their sharing in giving off benefit. And he singled out the third condemned group due to there being no benefit in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So take hold of the prophetic knowledge my brother and act upon it, Allaah will raise you due to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;">“Allaah will raise those who believe amongst you and those who have been given knowledge many levels.”</span> [Soorah Al-Mujaadilah: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;">“Say: Are those who have knowledge equal to those who do not have knowledge?”</span> [Soorah Az-Zumar: 9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And stick to acting upon it and calling to it, as Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;">“And who is better in speech than the one who calls to Allaah and does righteous deeds and says: Indeed I am among the Muslims.”</span> [Soorah Fussilat: 33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And yearn to be from the first category, from those who accept this light (knowledge) that the Prophet Muhammad (sall-Allaahu `alayhi wa sallam) brought, for Allaah will put light into your heart due to it and bring life to it. The correct and good livelihood cannot come to be except with it (i.e. this knowledge).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And beware of being from the third category, from those who do not accept the guidance of Allaah nor have any concern for it.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Benefits from the Hadeeth:</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The magnificence of the guidance and knowledge that the Prophet (sall-Allaahu `alayhi wa sallam) came with, which is the Qur’aan and the Sunnah and their effect in the lives of people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. People are in various levels with respect to their willingness to either accept or reject what the Messenger came with. People have different natures.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The virtue of knowledge, teaching and spreading good to the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The danger of turning away from what the Messenger of Allaah (sall-Allaahu `alayhi wa sallam) came with from the Book and the Sunnah from one aspect. This turning away (from knowledge) indicates the malicious natures of these opposers and their low status in the sight of Allaah.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A selected chapter from the classic treatise <b>&#8220;<i>Iqtidaa-ul-&#8216;Ilm-ul-&#8216;Amal</i>&#8220;</b> (Knowledge Mandates Action) by Al-Khateeb Al-Baghdaadee (D. 463H), may Allaah have mercy on him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[119]</b> Abu Sa’eed Muhammad bin Moosaa bin Al-Fadl bin Shaadhaan As-Sayrafee informed us in Naisapur: Abul-‘Abbaas Muhammad bin Ya’qoob Al-Asam narrated to us: Al-‘Abbaas bin Al-Waleed bin Mazeed Al-Bayrootee informed us, saying: My father informed me: <strong>Al-Awzaa&#8217;ee narrated to us, saying</strong>: “I have been informed that it used to be said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Woe to those who acquire (religious) knowledge for other than the sake of worship and to those who permit the unlawful due to doubtful arguments.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[120]</b> Al-Hasan bin ‘Alee Al-Jawharee informed us: Muhammad bin Al-‘Abbaas Al-Kharraaz narrated to us: Yahyaa bin Muhammad bin Saa’id narrated to us: Al-Husayn bin Al-Hasan Al-Marwazee narrated to us, saying: Ibn Al-Mubaarak informed us, saying: Bakaar bin ‘Abdillaah informed us, saying: I heard <strong>Wahb bin Munabbih</strong> say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Allaah, the Most High, said in His censure of the <em>Rabbis</em> (scholars) from amongst the Children of Israa’eel (i.e. Jews): ‘Will you learn for other than the sake of the Religion, and acquire knowledge for other than the sake of acting on it? Will you purchase the worldly life using deeds (meant) for the Hereafter? You wear the skins of sheep yet conceal (within yourselves) the souls of wolves. You quickly clean the filth that falls into your drinks yet you readily swallow the equivalent of mountains from the unlawful. You make the Religion burdensome upon the people like the weight of mountains, and you don’t assist them by even lifting up your pinky fingers. You prolong the prayer and whiten the garments. You illegally seize the wealth of the orphan and the widow. By My might, I swear that I will indeed strike you with a calamity in which the opinion of every opinionative person and the wisdom of every wise person (amongst you) will be led astray.’”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[121]</b> Al-Hasan bin Abee Bakr informed us, saying: ‘Uthmaan bin Ahmad Ad-Daqaaq informed us: Al-Hasan bin Salaam narrated to us: Abu Nu’aim narrated to us: Abul-Jaabiyah narrated to us: Al-Farraa’ narrated to us, saying: <strong>Ash-Sha’abee</strong> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Verily, we are not <em>Fuqahaa</em> (men of understanding). We merely listen to the <em>Hadeeth</em> and then narrate it (to others). Rather, the Fuqahaa are those who when they know something, act upon it.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[122]</b> Al-Hasan bin Muhammad Al-Khallaal narrated to us: ‘Umar bin Ahmad, the Admonisher, narrated to us: ‘Abdullaah bin Muhammad bin Ziyaad narrated to us: Al-‘Abbaas bin Al-Waleed bin Mazeed narrated to us, saying: My father narrated to us, saying: I heard <strong>Al-Awzaa’ee</strong> say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“When Allaah desires evil for a people, He opens the door of argumentation for them and prevents them from (doing good) deeds.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[123]</b> Abu ‘Abdillaah Al-Husayn bin Ja’far As-Salmaasee informed us, saying: Ahmad bin Ibraheem bin Shaadhaan informed us: Ahmad bin Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Kareem Al-Wasaawasee narrated to us: ‘Abdullaah bin Khubaiq narrated to us, saying: I heard Ibraaheem Al-Bakaa say: I heard <strong>Ma’roof bin Fayrooz Al-Kurkhee</strong> say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“When Allaah intends good for a servant, He opens for him the door of actions and closes for him the door of argumentation. And when Allaah intends evil for a servant, He opens for him the door of argumentation and closes for him the door of actions.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[124]</b> Abul-Qaasim ‘Ubaydullaah bin ‘Umar bin Ahmad, the Admonisher, informed us, saying: My father narrated to me, saying: ‘Alee bin Muhammad Al-Misree narrated to us: Muhammad bin Zayd narrated to us that Ibn Suwayd said: Abu Nu’aim Al-Fadl bin Dukain narrated to us, saying: I entered into the presence of Zafar when he was at the point of death, so he raised his head up to me and said to me:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“O Abu Nu’aim, I wished that what we were upon (from seeking hadeeth) was instead <i>tasbeeh </i>(glorification of Allaah).”</strong></span></p>

Chapter 241<br />
Virtues of Knowledge which is Learnt and Taught for the sake of Allah</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And say: `My Rubb! Increase me in knowledge.&#8221; </b></span><b>(20:114)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Are those who know equal to those who know not?&#8221;&#8217;</b></span><b> (39:9)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Allah will exalt in degree those of you who believe, and those who have been granted knowledge.&#8221;</b></span><b> (58:11)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allah.&#8221;</b></span><b> (35:28)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1376.</b> Mu`awiyah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">When Allah wishes good for someone, He bestows upon him the understanding of Deen</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1377.</b> Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, <span style="color:#0000ff;">&#8220;Envy is permitted only in two cases: A man whom Allah gives wealth, and he disposes of it rightfully, and a man to whom Allah gives knowledge which he applies and teaches it</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1378.</b> Abu Musa (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The guidance and knowledge with which Allah has sent me are like abundant rain which fell on a land. A fertile part of it absorbed the water and brought forth profuse herbage and pasture; and solid ground patches which retained the water by which Allah has benefited people, who drank from it, irrigated their crops and sowed their seeds; and another sandy plane which could neither retain the water nor produce herbage. Such is the similitude of the person who becomes well-versed in the religion of Allah and receives benefit from the Message entrusted to me by Allah, so he himself has learned and taught it to others; such is also the similitude of the person who has stubbornly and ignorantly rejected Allah&#8217;s Guidance with which I have been sent</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1379.</b> Sahl bin Sa`d (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to `Ali (May Allah be pleased with him), &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">By Allah, if a single person is guided by Allah through you, it will be better for you than a whole lot of red camels</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1380.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Convey from me even an Ayah of the Qur&#8217;an; relate traditions from Banu Israel, and there is no restriction on that; but he who deliberately forges a lie against me let him have his abode in the Hell.</span>&#8221;<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1384.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The world, with all that it contains, is accursed except for the remembrance of Allah that which pleases Allah; and the religious scholars and seekers of knowledge</span>.&#8221;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>

[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1386.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">A believer never satisfies doing good until he reaches Jannah</span>.&#8221;<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1388.</b> Abud-Darda (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who follows a path in quest of knowledge, Allah will make the path of Jannah easy to him. The angels lower their wings over the seeker of knowledge, being pleased with what he does. The inhabitants of the heavens and the earth and even the fish in the depth of the oceans seek forgiveness for him. The superiority of the learned man over the devout worshipper is like that of the full moon to the rest of the stars (i.e., in brightness). The learned are the heirs of the Prophets who bequeath neither dinar nor dirham but only that of knowledge; and he who acquires it, has in fact acquired an abundant portion</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1389.</b> Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">May Allah freshen the affairs of a person who hears something from us and communicates it to others exactly as he has heard it (i.e., both the meaning and the words). Many a recepient of knowledge understands it better than the one who has heard it</span>.&#8221;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1390.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who is asked about knowledge (of religion) and conceals it, will be bridled with a bridle of fire on the Day of Resurrection</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1391.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah(sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who does not acquire knowledge with the sole intention of seeking the Pleasure of Allah but for worldly gain, will not smell the fragrance of Jannah on the Day of Resurrection.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1392.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Verily, Allah does not take away knowledge by snatching it from the people, but He takes it away by taking away (the lives of) the religious scholars till none of the scholars stays alive. Then the people will take ignorant ones as their leaders, who, when asked to deliver religious verdicts, will issue them without knowledge, the result being that they will go astray and will lead others astray</span>.&#8221;<br />

And as for those who have a yearning for error    they go after the allegorical verses seeking (to cause) dissension, by seeking to explain    them. And none knows their implications but Allah, and those who are sound in knowledge    say: We affirm our faith in everything which is from our Lord. It is only the persons of    understanding who really heed&#8221; (iii. 6). &#8216;A&#8217;isha (further) reported that Allah&#8217;s    Messenger (may peace be upon him) said (in connection with these verses): When you see    such verses, avoid them, for it is they whom Allah has pointed out (in the mentioned    verses).</font></p>

Zubair reported that &#8216;A&#8217;isha said to him: This    news has reached me that &#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Amr al-&#8216;As would pass by us during the Hajj season,    so you meet him and ask him (about religious matters) as he has acquired great knowledge    from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). I thus met him and asked him about things    which he narrated from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). And amongst these the    one he mentioned was that Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: Verily, Allah does    not take away knowledge from people directly but he takes away the scholars and    consequently takes away (knowledge) along with them and leaves amongst persons the    ignorant as their leaders who deliver religious verdicts without (adequate) knowledge and    themselves go astray and lead others astray. &#8216;Urwa said: When I narrated this to &#8216;A&#8217;isha,    she deemed it too much (to believe) and thus showed reluctance to accept that (as    perfectly true) and said to, &#8216;Urwa: Did he (&#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Amr) say to you that he had    heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) as saying: (&#8216;Urwa had forgotten to ask this    from &#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Amr). So when it was the next year, she (&#8216;A&#8217;isha) said to him (&#8216;Urwa):    Ibn Amr has come (for Hajj), so meet him. talk to him and ask him about this hadith that    he narrated to You (last year on the occasion of the Hajj) pertaining to knowledge. He    (&#8216;Urwa), said: So I met him, and asked about it and he narrated to me exactly like one    that he had narrated (to me) for the first time. So when I informed her (&#8216;A&#8217;isha) about    that, she said: I do not think but this that he has certainly told the truth and I find    that be has neither made any addition to it, nor missed anything from it.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Jarir b. Abdullah reported that some desert Arabs clad in    woollen clothes came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). He saw them in sad    plight as they had been hard pressed by need. He (the Holy Prophet) exhorted people to    give charity, but they showed some reluctance until (signs) of anger could be seen on his    face. Then a person from the Ansar came with a purse containing silver. Then came another    person and then other persons followed them in succession until signs of happiness could    be seen on his (sacred) face. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He    who introduced some good practice in Islam which was followed after him (by people) he    would be assured of reward like one who followed it, without their rewards being    diminished in any respect. And he who introduced some evil practice in Islam which had    been followed subsequently (by others), he would be required to bear the burden like that    of one who followed this (evil practice) without their&#8217;s being diminished in any respect.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While the Prophet was saying something in a gathering, a  Bedouin came and asked him, &#8220;When would the Hour (Doomsday) take place?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle continued his talk, so some people said that Allah&#8217;s Apostle had heard the  question, but did not like what that Bedouin had asked. Some of them said that Alllah&#8217;s  Apostle had not heard it. When the Prophet finished his speech, he said, &#8220;Where is  the questioner, who enquired about the Hour (Doomsday)?&#8221; The Bedouin said, &#8220;I am  here, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221; Then the Prophet said, &#8220;When honesty is lost, then  wait for the Hour (Doomsday).&#8221; The Bedouin said, &#8220;How will that be lost?&#8221;  The Prophet said, &#8220;When the power or authority comes in the hands of unfit persons,  then wait for the Hour (Doomsday.)&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once the Prophet remained behind us in a journey. He joined  us while we were performing ablution for the prayer which was over-due.

And I thought  of the date-palm tree but felt shy to answer the others then asked, &#8220;What is that  tree, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;It is the date-palm tree.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While we were sitting with the Prophet in the mosque, a man  came riding on a camel. He made his camel kneel down in the mosque, tied its foreleg and  then said: &#8220;Who amongst you is Muhammad?&#8221; At that time the Prophet was sitting  amongst us (his companions) leaning on his arm. We replied, &#8220;This white man reclining  on his arm.&#8221; The an then addressed him, &#8220;O Son of &#8216;Abdul Muttalib.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;I am here to answer your  questions.&#8221; The man said to the Prophet, &#8220;I want to ask you something and will  be hard in questioning. So do not get angry.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Ask whatever  you want.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;I ask you by your Lord, and the Lord of those who were  before you, has Allah sent you as an Apostle to all the mankind?&#8221; The Prophet  replied, &#8220;By Allah, yes.&#8221; The man further said, &#8220;I ask you by Allah. Has  Allah ordered you to offer five prayers in a day and night (24 hours).? He replied,  &#8220;By Allah, Yes.&#8221; The man further said, &#8220;I ask you by Allah! Has Allah  ordered you to observe fasts during this month of the year (i.e. Ramadan)?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;By Allah, Yes.&#8221; The man further said, &#8220;I ask you by Allah. Has  Allah ordered you to take Zakat (obligatory charity) from our rich people and distribute  it amongst our poor people?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;By Allah, yes.&#8221;  Thereupon that man said, &#8220;I have believed in all that with which you have been sent,  and I have been sent by my people as a messenger, and I am Dimam bin Tha&#8217;laba from the  brothers of Bani Sa&#8217;d bin Bakr.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 3, Number 64: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave a letter to a person and ordered  him to go and deliver it to the Governor of Bahrain. (He did so) and the Governor of  Bahrain sent it to Chousroes, who read that letter and then tore it to pieces. (The  sub-narrator (Ibn Shihab) thinks that Ibn Al-Musaiyab said that Allah&#8217;s Apostle invoked  Allah against them (saying), &#8220;May Allah tear them into pieces, and disperse them all  totally.)&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once the Prophet wrote a letter or had an idea of writing a  letter. The Prophet was told that they (rulers) would not read letters unless they were  sealed. So the Prophet got a silver ring made with &#8220;Muhammad Allah&#8217;s Apostle&#8221;  engraved on it. As if I were just observing its white glitter in the hand of the Prophet </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 3, Number 66: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Waqid Al-Laithi: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While Allah&#8217;s Apostle was sitting in the mosque with some  people, three men came. Two of them came in front of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the third one  went away. The two persons kept on standing before Allah&#8217;s Apostle for a while and then  one of them found a place in the circle and sat there while the other sat behind the  gathering, and the third one went away. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle finished his preaching, he  said, &#8220;Shall I tell you about these three persons? One of them be-took himself to  Allah, so Allah took him into His grace and mercy and accommodated him, the second felt  shy from Allah, so Allah sheltered Him in His mercy (and did not punish him), while the  third turned his face from Allah and went away, so Allah turned His face from him  likewise. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin Abi Bakra&#8217;s father: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once the Prophet was riding his camel and a man was holding  its rein. The Prophet asked, &#8220;What is the day today?&#8221; We kept quiet, thinking  that he might give that day another name. He said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the day of Nahr  (slaughtering of the animals of sacrifice)&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He further  asked, &#8220;Which month is this?&#8221; We again kept quiet, thinking that he might give  it another name. Then he said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the month of Dhul-Hijja?&#8221; We replied,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Verily! Your blood, property and honor are sacred to one  another (i.e. Muslims) like the sanctity of this day of yours, in this month of yours and  in this city of yours. It is incumbent upon those who are present to inform those who are  absent because those who are absent might comprehend (what I have said) better than the  present audience.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Mas&#8217;ud: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet used to take care of us in preaching by  selecting a suitable time, so that we might not get bored. (He abstained from pestering us  with sermons and knowledge all the time). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Facilitate things to people  (concerning religious matters), and do not make it hard for them and give them good  tidings and do not make them run away (from Islam).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Wail: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Abdullah used to give a religious talk to the people on  every Thursday. Once a man said, &#8220;O Aba &#8216;Abdur-Rahman! (By Allah) I wish if you could  preach us daily.&#8221; He replied, &#8220;The only thing which prevents me from doing so,  is that I hate to bore you, and no doubt I take care of you in preaching by selecting a  suitable time just as the Prophet used to do with us, for fear of making us bored.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Muawiya: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;If Allah wants to do  good to a person, He makes him comprehend the religion. I am just a distributor, but the  grant is from Allah. (And remember) that this nation (true Muslims) will keep on following  Allah&#8217;s teachings strictly and they will not be harmed by any one going on a different  path till Allah&#8217;s order (Day of Judgment) is established.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were with the Prophet and a spadix of date-palm tree was  brought to him. On that he said, &#8220;Amongst the trees, there is a tree which resembles  a Muslim.&#8221; I wanted to say that it was the date-palm tree but as I was the youngest  of all (of them) I kept quiet. And then the Prophet said, &#8220;It is the date-palm  tree.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ud: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Do not wish to be like anyone  except in two cases. (The first is) A person, whom Allah has given wealth and he spends it  righteously; (the second is) the one whom Allah has given wisdom (the Holy Qur&#8217;an) and he  acts according to it and teaches it to others.&#8221; (Fateh-al-Bari page 177 Vol. 1) </font></p>

<p></a><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.003.074"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 3, Number 74: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That he differed with Hur bin Qais bin Hisn Al-Fazari  regarding the companion of (the Prophet) Moses. Ibn &#8216;Abbas said that he was Khadir.  Meanwhile, Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b passed by them and Ibn &#8216;Abbas called him, saying &#8220;My friend  (Hur) and I have differed regarding Moses&#8217; companion whom Moses, asked the way to meet.  Have you heard the Prophet mentioning something about him? He said, &#8220;Yes. I heard  Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;While Moses was sitting in the company of some Israelites, a  man came and asked him. &#8220;Do you know anyone who is more learned than you? Moses  replied: &#8220;No.&#8221; So Allah sent the Divine Inspiration to Moses: &#8216;Yes, Our slave  Khadir (is more learned than you.)&#8217; Moses asked (Allah) how to meet him (Khadir). So Allah  made the fish as a sign for him and he was told that when the fish was lost, he should  return (to the place where he had lost it) and there he would meet him (Al-Khadir). So  Moses went on looking for the sign of the fish in the sea. The servant-boy of Moses said  to him: Do you remember when we betook ourselves to the rock, I indeed forgot the fish,  none but Satan made me forget to remember it. On that Moses said: &#8216;That is what we have  been seeking? (18.64) So they went back retracing their foot-steps, and found Khadir.  (And) what happened further to them is narrated in the Holy Qur&#8217;an by Allah. (18.54 up to  18.82) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once I came riding a she-ass and had (just) attained the  age of puberty. Allah&#8217;s Apostle was offering the prayer at Mina. There was no wall in  front of him and I passed in front of some of the row while they were offering their  prayers. There I let the she-ass loose to graze and entered the row, and nobody objected  to it. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that he differed with Hur bin Qais bin Hisn Al-Fazari  regarding the companion of the Prophet Moses. Meanwhile, Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b passed by them and  Ibn &#8216;Abbas called him saying, &#8220;My friend (Hur) and I have differed regarding Moses&#8217;  companion whom Moses asked the way to meet. Have you heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle mentioning  something about him? Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b said: &#8220;Yes, I heard the Prophet mentioning  something about him (saying) while Moses was sitting in the company of some Israelites, a  man came and asked him: &#8220;Do you know anyone who is more learned than you? Moses  replied: &#8220;No.&#8221; So Allah sent the Divine Inspiration to Moses: &#8216;&#8211;Yes, Our slave  Khadir is more learned than you. Moses asked Allah how to meet him (Al-Khadir). So Allah  made the fish a sign for him and he was told when the fish was lost, he should return (to  the place where he had lost it) and there he would meet him (Al-Khadir). So Moses went on  looking for the sign of the fish in the sea. The servant-boy of Moses said: &#8216;Do you  remember when we betook ourselves to the rock, I indeed forgot the fish, none but Satan  made me forget to remember it. On that Moses said, &#8216;That is what we have been seeking.&#8217; So  they went back retracing their footsteps, and found Kha,dir. (and) what happened further  about them is narrated in the Holy Qur&#8217;an by Allah.&#8221; (18.54 up to 18.82) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Musa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The example of guidance and  knowledge with which Allah has sent me is like abundant rain falling on the earth, some of  which was fertile soil that absorbed rain water and brought forth vegetation and grass in  abundance. (And) another portion of it was hard and held the rain water and Allah  benefited the people with it and they utilized it for drinking, making their animals drink  from it and for irrigation of the land for cultivation. (And) a portion of it was barren  which could neither hold the water nor bring forth vegetation (then that land gave no  benefits). The first is the example of the person who comprehends Allah&#8217;s religion and  gets benefit (from the knowledge) which Allah has revealed through me (the Prophets and  learns and then teaches others. The last example is that of a person who does not care for  it and does not take Allah&#8217;s guidance revealed through me (He is like that barren  land.)&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;Just now at this place I have seen what I have never  seen before, including Paradise and Hell. No doubt it has been inspired to me that you  will be put to trials in your graves and these trials will be like the trials of  Masiah-ad-Dajjal or nearly like it (the sub narrator is not sure which expression Asma&#8217;  used). You will be asked, &#8216;What do you know about this man (the Prophet Muhammad)?&#8217; Then  the faithful believer (or Asma&#8217; said a similar word) will reply, &#8216;He is Muhammad Allah&#8217;s  Apostle who had come to us with clear evidences and guidance and so we accepted his  teachings and followed him. And he is Muhammad.&#8217; And he will repeat it thrice. Then the  angels will say to him, &#8216;Sleep in peace as we have come to know that you were a faithful  believer.&#8217; On the other hand, a hypocrite or a doubtful person will reply, &#8216;I do not know,  but I heard the people saying something and so I said it.&#8217; (the same). &#8221; </font></p>

Once Ibn &#8216;Abbas said that a delegation of the tribe of&#8217;Abdul Qais came to the Prophet who  asked them, &#8220;Who are the people (i.e. you)? (Or) who are the delegates?&#8221; They  replied, &#8220;We are from the tribe of Rabi&#8217;a.&#8221; Then the Prophet said to them,  &#8220;Welcome, O people (or said, &#8220;O delegation (of &#8216;Abdul Qais).&#8221;) Neither will  you have disgrace nor will you regret.&#8221; They said, &#8220;We have come to you from a  distant place and there is the tribe of the infidels of Mudar intervening between you and  us and we cannot come to you except in the sacred month. So please order us to do  something good (religious deeds) and that we may also inform our people whom we have left  behind (at home) and that we may enter Paradise (by acting on them.)&#8221; The Prophet  ordered them to do four things, and forbade them from four things. He ordered them to  believe in Allah Alone, the Honorable the Majestic and said to them, &#8220;Do you know  what is meant by believing in Allah Alone?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle  know better.&#8221; Thereupon the Prophet said, &#8220;(That means to testify that none has  the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is His Apostle, to offer prayers  perfectly, to pay Zakat, to observe fasts during the month of Ramadan, (and) to pay  Al-Khumus (one fifth of the booty to be given in Allah&#8217;s cause).&#8221; Then he forbade  them four things, namely Ad-Dubba.&#8217; Hantam, Muzaffat (and) An-Naqir or Muqaiyar(These were  the names of pots in which alcoholic drinks used to be prepared).

Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said, &#8220;How can you keep her as a wife when it has been said (that she is your  foster-sister)?&#8221; Then Uqba divorced her, and she married another man. </font></p>

He used to go one day and  I another day. When I went I used to bring the news of that day regarding the Divine  Inspiration and other things, and when he went, he used to do the same for me. Once my  Ansari friend, in his turn (on returning from the Prophet), knocked violently at my door  and asked if I was there.&#8221; I became horrified and came out to him. He said,  &#8220;Today a great thing has happened.&#8221; I then went to Hafsa and saw her weeping. I  asked her, &#8220;Did Allah&#8217;s Apostle divorce you all?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;I do not  know.&#8221; Then, I entered upon the Prophet and said while standing, &#8220;Have you  divorced your wives?&#8221; The Prophet replied in the negative.

I may not attend the (compulsory congregational) prayer because so and so (the Imam)  prolongs the prayer when he leads us for it. The narrator added: &#8220;I never saw the  Prophet more furious in giving advice than he was on that day. The Prophet said, &#8220;O  people!

On that, the Prophet got angry and his cheeks or his Face became red  and he said, &#8220;You have no concern with it as it has its water container, and its feet  and it will reach water, and eat (the leaves) of trees till its owner finds it.&#8221; The  man then asked about the lost sheep.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Allah does not take  away the knowledge, by taking it away from (the hearts of) the people, but takes it away  by the death of the religious learned men till when none of the (religious learned men)  remains, people will take as their leaders ignorant persons who when consulted will give  their verdict without knowledge. So they will go astray and will lead the people  astray.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Some women requested the Prophet to fix a day for them as  the men were taking all his time. On that he promised them one day for religious lessons  and commandments. Once during such a lesson the Prophet said, &#8220;A woman whose three  children die will be shielded by them from the Hell fire.&#8221; On that a woman asked,  &#8220;If only two die?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Even two (will shield her from the  Hell-fire).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever &#8216;Aisha (the wife of the Prophet) heard anything  which she did not understand, she used to ask again till she understood it completely.  Aisha said: &#8220;Once the Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever will be called to account (about  his deeds on the Day of Resurrection) will surely be punished.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t  Allah say: &#8220;He surely will receive an easy reckoning.&#8221; (84.8) The Prophet  replied, &#8220;This means only the presentation of the accounts but whoever will be argued  about his account, will certainly be ruined.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Shuraih said, &#8220;When &#8216;Amr bin Said was sending the  troops to Mecca (to fight &#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair) I said to him, &#8216;O chief! Allow me to  tell you what the Prophet said on the day following the conquests of Mecca. My ears heard  and my heart comprehended, and I saw him with my own eyes, when he said it. He glorified  and praised Allah and then said, &#8220;Allah and not the people has made Mecca a  sanctuary. So anybody who has belief in Allah and the Last Day (i.e. a Muslim) should  neither shed blood in it nor cut down its trees. If anybody argues that fighting is  allowed in Mecca as Allah&#8217;s Apostle did fight (in Mecca), tell him that Allah gave  permission to His Apostle, but He did not give it to you. The Prophet added: Allah allowed  me only for a few hours on that day (of the conquest) and today (now) its sanctity is the  same (valid) as it was before. So it is incumbent upon those who are present to convey it  (this information) to those who are absent.&#8221; Abu- Shuraih was asked, &#8220;What did  &#8216;Amr reply?&#8221; He said &#8216;Amr said, &#8220;O Abu Shuraih! I know better than you (in this  respect). Mecca does not give protection to one who disobeys (Allah) or runs after  committing murder, or theft (and takes refuge in Mecca). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the year of the Conquest of Mecca, the tribe of Khuza&#8217;a  killed a man from the tribe of Bani Laith in revenge for a killed person, belonging to  them. They informed the Prophet about it. So he rode his Rahila (she-camel for riding) and  addressed the people saying, &#8220;Allah held back the killing from Mecca. (The  sub-narrator is in doubt whether the Prophet said &#8220;elephant or killing,&#8221; as the  Arabic words standing for these words have great similarity in shape), but He (Allah) let  His Apostle and the believers over power the infidels of Mecca. Beware! (Mecca is a  sanctuary) Verily! Fighting in Mecca was not permitted for anyone before me nor will it be  permitted for anyone after me. It (war) in it was made legal for me for few hours or so on  that day. No doubt it is at this moment a sanctuary, it is not allowed to uproot its  thorny shrubs or to uproot its trees or to pick up its Luqatt (fallen things) except by a  person who will look for its owner (announce it publicly). And if somebody is killed, then  his closest relative has the right to choose one of the two&#8211; the blood money (Diyya) or  retaliation having the killer killed. In the meantime a man from Yemen came and said,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Get that written for me.&#8221; The Prophet ordered his companions  to write that for him. Then a man from Quraish said, &#8220;Except Al-Iqhkhir (a type of  grass that has good smell) O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, as we use it in our houses and graves.&#8221;  The Prophet said, &#8220;Except Al-Idhkhiri.e. Al-Idhkhir is allowed to be plucked.&#8221; </font></p>

On that the Prophet said to them,  &#8216;Go away (and leave me alone). It is not right that you should quarrel in front of  me.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas came out saying, &#8220;It was most unfortunate (a great disaster)  that Allah&#8217;s Apostle was prevented from writing that statement for them because of their  disagreement and noise. (Note: It is apparent from this Hadith that Ibn &#8216;Abbes had  witnessed the event and came out saying this statement. The truth is not so, for Ibn  &#8216;Abbas used to say this statement on narrating the Hadith and he had not witnessed the  event personally. See Fath Al-Bari Vol. 1, p.220 footnote.)

Later on he got up at night and then asked whether the  boy (or he used a similar word) had slept? Then he got up for the prayer and I stood up by  his left side but he made me stand to his right and offered five Rakat followed by two  more Rakat. Then he slept and I heard him snoring and then (after a while) he left for the  (Fajr) prayer. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Once the Prophet Moses stood up and  addressed Bani Israel. He was asked, &#8220;Who is the most learned man amongst the people.  He said, &#8220;I am the most learned.&#8221; Allah admonished Moses as he did not attribute  absolute knowledge to Him (Allah). So Allah inspired to him &#8220;At the junction of the  two seas there is a slave amongst my slaves who is more learned than you.&#8221; Moses  said, &#8220;O my Lord! How can I meet him?&#8221; Allah said: Take a fish in a large basket  (and proceed) and you will find him at the place where you will lose the fish. So Moses  set out along with his (servant) boy, Yusha&#8217; bin Nuin and carried a fish in a large basket  till they reached a rock, where they laid their heads (i.e. lay down) and slept. The fish  came out of the basket and it took its way into the sea as in a tunnel. So it was an  amazing thing for both Moses and his (servant) boy. They proceeded for the rest of that  night and the following day. When the day broke, Moses said to his (servant) boy:  &#8220;Bring us our early meal. No doubt, we have suffered much fatigue in this  journey.&#8221; Moses did not get tired till he passed the place about which he was told.  There the (servant) boy told Moses, &#8220;Do you remember when we betook ourselves to the  rock, I indeed forgot the fish.&#8221; Moses remarked, &#8220;That is what we have been  seeking. So they went back retracing their foot-steps, till they reached the rock. There  they saw a man covered with a garment (or covering himself with his own garment). Moses  greeted him. Al-Khadir replied saying, &#8220;How do people greet each other in your  land?&#8221; Moses said, &#8220;I am Moses.&#8221; He asked, &#8220;The Moses of Bani  Israel?&#8221; Moses replied in the affirmative and added, &#8220;May I follow you so that  you teach me of that knowledge which you have been taught.&#8221; Al-Khadir replied,  &#8220;Verily! You will not be able to remain patient with me, O Moses! I have some of the  knowledge of Allah which He has taught me and which you do not know, while you have some  knowledge which Allah has taught you which I do not know.&#8221; Moses said, &#8220;Allah  willing, you will find me patient and I will not disobey you in aught. So both of them set  out walking along the sea-shore, as they did not have a boat. In the meantime a boat  passed by them and they requested the crew of the boat to take them on board. The crew  recognized Al-Khadir and took them on board without fare. Then a sparrow came and stood on  the edge of the boat and dipped its beak once or twice in the sea. Al-Khadir said: &#8220;O  Moses! My knowledge and your knowledge have not decreased Allah&#8217;s knowledge except as much  as this sparrow has decreased the water of the sea with its beak.&#8221; Al-Khadir went to  one of the planks of the boat and plucked it out. Moses said, &#8220;These people gave us a  free lift but you have broken their boat and scuttled it so as to drown its people.&#8221;  Al-Khadir replied, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you that you will not be able to remain patient  with me.&#8221; Moses said, &#8220;Call me not to account for what I forgot.&#8221; The first  (excuse) of Moses was that he had forgotten. Then they proceeded further and found a boy  playing with other boys. Al-Khadir took hold of the boy&#8217;s head from the top and plucked it  out with his hands (i.e. killed him). Moses said, &#8220;Have you killed an innocent soul  who has killed none.&#8221; Al-Kha,dir replied, &#8220;Did I not tell you that you cannot  remain patient with me?&#8221; Then they both proceeded till when they came to the people  of a town, they asked them for food, but they refused to entertain them. Then they found  there a wall on the point of collapsing. Al-Khadir repaired it with his own hands. Moses  said, &#8220;If you had wished, surely you could have taken wages for it.&#8221; Al-Khadir  replied, &#8220;This is the parting between you and me.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;May  Allah be Merciful to Moses! Would that he could have been more patient to learn more about  his story with Al-Khadir. &#8221; </font></p>

I got my head shaved before slaughtering the animal.&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Do  the slaughtering (now) and there is no harm.&#8221; So on that day, when the Prophet was  asked about anything as regards the ceremonies of Hajj performed before or after its due  time his reply was, &#8220;Do it (now) and there is no harm.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 3, Number 127: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was going with the Prophet through the ruins of  Medina and he was reclining on a date-palm leaf stalk, some Jews passed by. Some of them  said to the others: Ask him (the Prophet) about the spirit. Some of them said that they  should not ask him that question as he might give a reply which would displease them. But  some of them insisted on asking, and so one of them stood up and asked, &#8220;O  Aba-l-Qasim ! What is the spirit?&#8221; The Prophet remained quiet. I thought he was being  inspired Divinely. So I stayed till that state of the Prophet (while being inspired) was  over. The Prophet then said, &#8220;And they ask you (O Muhammad) concerning the spirit  &#8211;Say: The spirit &#8212; its knowledge is with my Lord. And of knowledge you (mankind) have  been given only a little).&#8221; (17.85) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aswad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn Az-Zubair said to me, &#8220;Aisha used to tell you  secretly a number of things. What did she tell you about the Ka&#8217;ba?&#8221; I replied,  &#8220;She told me that once the Prophet said, &#8216;O &#8216;Aisha! Had not your people been still  close to the pre-Islamic period of ignorance (infidelity)! I would have dismantled the  Ka&#8217;ba and would have made two doors in it; one for entrance and the other for exit.&#8221;  Later on Ibn Az-Zubair did the same. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 3, Number 129: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu At-Tufail: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>the above mentioned Statement of &#8216;Ali. </font></p>
<hr />
<p></a><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.003.130"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 3, Number 130: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;Once Mu&#8217;adh was along with Allah&#8217;s Apostle as a  companion rider. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Mu&#8217;adh bin Jabal.&#8221; Mu&#8217;adh replied,  &#8220;Labbaik and Sa&#8217;daik. O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; Again the Prophet said, &#8220;O  Mu&#8217;adh!&#8221; Mu&#8217;adh said thrice, &#8220;Labbaik and Sa&#8217;daik, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221;  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;There is none who testifies sincerely that none has the right  to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is his Apostle, except that Allah, will save him  from the Hell-fire.&#8221; Mu&#8217;adh said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle ! Should I not inform the  people about it so that they may have glad tidings?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;When the  people hear about it, they will solely depend on it.&#8221; Then Mu&#8217;adh narrated the  above-mentioned Hadith just before his death, being afraid of committing sin (by not  telling the knowledge). </font></p>

<p></a><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.003.131"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 3, Number 131: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I was informed that the Prophet had said to Mu&#8217;adh,  &#8220;Whosoever will meet Allah without associating anything in worship with Him will go  to Paradise.&#8221; Mu&#8217;adh asked the Prophet, &#8220;Should I not inform the people of this  good news?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;No, I am afraid, lest they should depend upon  it (absolutely).&#8221; </font></p>
<hr />
<p></a><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.003.132"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 3, Number 132: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Um Salama: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Um-Sulaim came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;Verily,  Allah is not shy of (telling you) the truth. Is it necessary for a woman to take a bath  after she has a wet dream (nocturnal sexual discharge?) The Prophet replied, &#8220;Yes, if  she notices a discharge.&#8221; Um Salama, then covered her face and asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! Does a woman get a discharge?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Yes, let your right hand be  in dust (An Arabic expression you say to a person when you contradict his statement  meaning &#8220;you will not achieve goodness&#8221;), and that is why the son resembles his  mother.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 3, Number 133: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Amongst the trees there is  a tree, the leaves of which do not fall and is like a Muslim, tell me the name of that  tree.&#8221; Everybody started thinking about the trees of the desert areas and I thought  of the date-palm tree but felt shy (to answer). The others asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  inform us of it.&#8221; He replied, &#8220;it is the date-palm tree.&#8221; I told my father  what had come to my mind and on that he said, &#8220;Had you said it I would have preferred  it to such and such a thing that I might possess.&#8221; </font></p>

<p></a><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.003.134"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 3, Number 134: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ali: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I used to get the emotional urethral discharge frequently  so I requested Al-Miqdad to ask the Prophet about it. Al-Miqdad asked him and he replied,  &#8220;One has to perform ablution (after it).&#8221; (See Hadith No. 269). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 3, Number 135: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Nafi: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar said: &#8220;A man got up in the mosque  and said: O Allah&#8217;s Apostle &#8216;At which place you order us that we should assume the Ihram?&#8217;  Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8216;The residents of Medina should assure the Ihram from  Dhil-Hulaifa, the people of Syria from Al-Ju,hfa and the people of Najd from Qarn.&#8221;  Ibn &#8216;Umar further said, &#8220;The people consider that Allah&#8217;s Apostle had also said, &#8216;The  residents of Yemen should assume Ihram from Yalamlam.&#8217; &#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar used to say,  &#8220;I do not: remember whether Allah&#8217;s Apostle had said the last statement or not?&#8221;  </font></p>
<hr />
<p></a><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.003.136"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 3, Number 136: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man asked the Prophet : &#8220;What (kinds of clothes)  should a Muhrim (a Muslim intending to perform &#8216;Umra or Hajj) wear? He replied, &#8220;He  should not wear a shirt, a turban, trousers, a head cloak or garment scented with saffron  or Wars (kinds of perfumes). And if he has n slippers, then he can use Khuffs (leather  socks) but the socks should be cut short so as to make the ankles bare.&#8221; (See Hadith  No. 615, Vol. 2). </font></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="title" style="font-weight:bold;color:#494949;text-align:justify;">The following are excerps from <em>‘Sincere Counsel to the Seekers of Sacred Knowledge’</em> by Imaam Ibn al-Jawzi (Rahimahullaahu Ta’aala), in which he is advising his son:</p>
<div class="copy" style="color:#6e7173;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">Observe, my son, the way you deal with the limits of Allaah and see how you can keep yourself within their bounds.<strong> Indeed, he who takes care of these limits is taken great care of, and he who doesn’t, is left to himself.</strong> I shall now mention some of my experience to you so that you may observe my striving and ask the Granter of success to bless me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Truly, <strong>most of the blessings I have been given have not been earned by me but rather they are conferred as a result of the planning of The Gentle One alone.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I remember myself as a child: A highly motivated six-year old sitting in class with older boys. The intellect I had been given superseded of old men. <strong>I do not recall myself playing on the road with other kids or even laughing out loud. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I was seven or so, I attended the gatherings in the Masjid. I would not sit in a circle of mere wordplay, but searching for a Hadeeth Scholar who would narrate about the Prophet’s (Sall-Allaahu ‘alayhi wa Sallam) life. <strong>I would memorize everything he said, then go back home and write it down.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was blessed for being granted my teacher Abu al-Fadl ibn Nasir (Rahimahullaah) who would take me to different Scholars and let me hear the Musnad [of Imaam Ahmad] and other major works.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>All this time I had no idea of why I was made to do these things.</strong> My teacher recorded all I had heard, and when I reached puberty he handed me this record. I accompanied him till his death, and through him I learned the science of Hadeeth and transmission.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The kids used to go down to Tigris River and play on the bridge, <strong>but when I was small I used to take a book and sit far from people by the shore studying Sacred Knowledge. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Then I was inspired to abandon the vanities of this world so I began constant fasting and reduced my food intake to very little.</strong> I trained myself to be patient, embarking on a continuous pursuit in order to do so and staying up at night.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I didn’t feel satisfied with studying just one science so I read jurisprudence, sermon delivery and Hadeeth and followed those who practiced Zuhd. After that I studied linguistics. There was not a narrating Scholar or a preacher where I lived who I didn’t sit with and whenever such a person would arrive from elsewhere I would go to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>I used to choose of virtuous deeds what suited me and if I had to choose between two things I usually chose the right of al-Haqq (Allaah). </strong>He has planned my life and cultivated me in a beautiful fashion, guiding me towards what is best for me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He has protected me from my enemies, the jealous, and those who might plot against me. He has made everything convenient for my studies of Sacred Knowledge and sent me books from unexpected places. He gave me good understanding, the ability to memorize and write quickly and a talent for authoring books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I lacked nothing of this world. As a matter of fact, things were quite the opposite as Allaah gave me more than enough. He put a great deal of acceptance of me into peoples’ hearts and made the impact of my words leave them not questioning the authenticity of what I had to say.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Approximately 200 thimmis [i.e. people of the book who live in Muslim lands according to a truce contract] have become Muslim at my hands <strong>and over 100 000 sinners have repented in my gatherings.</strong> More than 20 000 men have announced their repentance from foolish ways during my exhortations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I used to go around Hadeeth gatherings of different Scholars and run till I was out of breath so no-one would precede me. <strong>I would start my day having nothing to eat and finish it having nothing to eat.</strong> Never did Allaah degrade me to take from another person, instead He provided for me in order to protect my honour.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Truth is, mentioning all my experience would take quite a while. And here I am now and you can see what I have achieved. <strong>I will tell you the whole story in one single sentence,</strong> and that is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">وَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ وَيُعَلِّمُكُمُ اللَّهُ</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">”<strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">Fear Allaah, and Allaah will teach you</span>.</strong>” [Surah al-Baqarah:282]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">Note : The Book &#8220;<em style="font-weight:bold;color:#494949;">‘Sincere Counsel to the Seekers of Sacred Knowledge’&#8221; </em> was published by Dar us Sunnah publishers</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from the etiquettes related to books is that one should make an effort to care for and reinforce their outer and inner parts as well as to keep them clean so that the books can be in a presentable condition that is befitting for others besides you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is since when a student of knowledge buys a book, he must have or should we say it&#8217;s preferred for him to have two types of intentions. The first is that he should intend to benefit from it in order to free himself from ignorance. And secondly, he should intend that others benefit from the book as well &#8211; such as either his wife or his children. Afterward, the books can either remain with that person (in his family) or they can be donated after him. Or perhaps one can give them away to someone as a gift or sell them, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So every time someone takes care of his books &#8211; whether by binding them or preserving them so that they can last longer in the future &#8211; the result of this is that his reward and recompense will be greater for doing that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the amazing stories about negligence shown towards books is what was reported by Al-Qiftee, author of the book<i> Inbaa&#8217;-ur-Ruwaat</i>, concerning the story about him and the book<i> al-Ansaab</i> of As-Sam&#8217;aanee. Perhaps I mentioned it to you before. Al-Qiftee was very enthusiastic for books so much so that he had gathered a collection of books that was from the best of what could be compiled.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8220;The book<i> al-Ansaab</i> of As-San&#8217;aanee in the author&#8217;s own handwriting was presented to me, and it consisted of the second, third and fourth volumes, however, the first volume in the author&#8217;s handwriting was missing.&#8221; Even though there was a span of close to 250 years between the time of Al-Qiftee and that of As-Sam&#8217;aanee, he nevertheless purchased the three volumes and said: &#8220;So I bought them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then some time had passed during which he would continuously ask people about this book trying to find the first volume. He kept asking about it and getting nothing in reply to the point that he thought the book was missing and that that was the end of it. Perhaps the book written in the author&#8217;s handwriting had been borrowed by someone and then went missing or it had gotten lost, and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He went on to say: &#8220;Then one day, my servant brought me a parcel of legumes &#8211; i.e. a kind of vegetable &#8211; wrapped up in pieces of paper that appeared to be originally from a book. So I grabbed the paper before the legumes&#8221; &#8211; since they had no value to him compared to these pieces of paper &#8211; &#8220;and when I looked at it, behold it was the handwriting of As-Sam&#8217;aanee, which I recognized! I then took it to my copy of the book<i> al-Ansaab</i> and discovered that this page was from the first volume that was missing! So I rushed in haste to the one who was selling the legumes and found that only a few pages from it were still left. So I asked him: &#8216;Where are the rest of these papers?&#8217; He replied: &#8216;We wrapped legumes with it and they are dispersed throughout the people&#8217;s homes.'&#8221; So he said: &#8220;Verily, to Allaah we belong and to Him we will return!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Someone&#8217;s loss is another person&#8217;s gain! This one is sad because of his loss, while the other is happy because he found these pieces of paper which contain the handwriting of Al-Haafidh As-Sam&#8217;aanee that have no value to him and which he instead used to wrap legumes in and give out to people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is said that he, i.e. Al-Qiftee, then spent a month mourning over knowledge and its people and for the book<i> al-Ansaab</i> of As-Sam&#8217;aanee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We wanted to say by relaying this story that one must take special care of his books &#8211; whether by way of reinforcing them or by way of preserving them. If one has the pages of a book all over the place then it is easy that the pages will get lost. But if they are preserved and attached to each other, this is the best way to guarantee that they will continue to exist in your library.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The issues related to this subject are many. Perhaps what we mentioned here will serve as a reminder for some of the things that are required with regard to books. I ask Allaah to grant myself and you success, correctness, uprightness and guidance, and may the peace, praises and blessings of Allaah be on our prophet, Muhammad.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from the etiquettes related to caring for books, even though this topic is vast and covers many aspects, is that a student of knowledge should review and examine his books from time to time. This means that he should not amass books without reviewing what he has. So, for example, he goes out and gets this book and that book, puts them in his library and only refers to a small portion from them. One should continuously inspect all of his books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should go and examine what books you have so that you remember the subjects they cover. This is since some people buy the same book twice or three times or maybe even four times due to the fact that they have forgotten that they already have the book! And this is because of the few times that they inspect and review their collection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if one were to have a constant connection to his books &#8211; especially in countries such as ours where the libraries of some of the students of knowledge are big &#8211; if he does not review his books, perhaps he will ask to borrow the book from someone when he already has it himself! Or perhaps he may forget what is in the book or need to research a topic but because he doesn&#8217;t review his collection, he makes no reference to that book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another etiquette regarding books is one&#8217;s concern for donated books. Donated books refer to any book that has an imprint or seal on it that states that it is a donation (i.e.<i> waqf</i>). You may only keep these books in your library so long as you meet the donor&#8217;s conditions. When a person donates books he is (firstly) making them available for the students of knowledge. If you are not using the book and someone else needs it, then giving the book to someone else that needs it is better. Yes, you may have a valid need for the book, even if it is one time in the year that you refer to it. There is nothing wrong with this since this book was given as a donation for the students of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if you do not refer to the book and two years or four to five years have passed by without you looking into it and you acknowledge that you have no interest in referencing this book or these books in general or perhaps you won&#8217;t need the book in the future, then in this case your keeping it contradicts its purpose.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some scholars say that it is not permissible to keep these books (in this situation) and that they should be given to those who deserve them. They should be passed on to those who will use them and benefit from them. This is since the donor has intended them as donations for only those who will use them. If you are not using them then it is more fitting that it should go to someone who will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are some students of knowledge that feel that they are above keeping donated books if they have a lot of money and are able to obtain the book by buying it. This is since perhaps one may store away the book and not use it. So if the book is a charitable copy then it may be that he is sinning for withholding this book from someone who can use it. This is perhaps more noticeable in countries in which books are more scarce.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">A student should arrange his books in such a way that it is easy for him to refer to them if there is an issue that requires him to research some of his books. This means that he should maintain his books in a certain order. The way the books are to be organized depends on the preference of this student. So if he requires that all of his books on Tafseer be arranged together and all of his books on Hadeeth be arranged together, and he further divides the Tafseer section into its various sciences and the Hadeeth section into its various sciences, and the Fiqh books into their respective<i> madh-hab&#8217;s</i> and so on and so forth, then there is no harm in this. And if he decides to arrange his books in some other order that he feels is more beneficial, then there is also no problem with this. The objective is for the book to be in a place where if he looks for it, he will find it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Books are divided into two types: Large books and small treatises. As for the large books, then these are the ones that we see in a library. This is since they are big &#8211; 10 volumes, 15 volumes, 13 volumes, 14 volumes, etc. This is clear. Rather, what deserves special attention are the small treatises, which are also important. It is possible that these smaller books may contain knowledge that cannot be found in the bigger books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he needs to refer to one of these small treatises, he looks for it but can&#8217;t find it. Why? It is because he has not put it in its proper place. One should take special care of these small treatises by putting them in a separate area. This means that they should not be put amidst the works of research and the larger books. So for example, a person may put a large book on his shelf and then next to it place a small book, in terms of its pages, and then next to that a small 40-50 page treatises and so on! The scholars have devoted some of their attention to this aspect, such that they have put forth what they call &#8220;compilations&#8221; consisting of a volume or more in which there can be found 10 or 12 treatises or more.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if it&#8217;s possible, a student of knowledge should compile these small treatises into a collection, placing booklets of a similar subject into one volume. This means that he should put all the small treatises that deal with the manners of seeking knowledge in one specific volume, for example, or the small treatises that deal with the subject of Hadeeth terminology in a separate volume or the essays on the sciences of Tafseer and the sciences of Qur&#8217;aan in one specific collection and so on and so forth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, he should place his Fiqh-related books and treatises separately. It is also appropriate to divide the Fiqh-related books and treatises into different sections, within themselves, according to what topics of Fiqh (jurisprudence) they fall under. So for example, one should place a treatise on crimes in its proper place amongst the chapters of Fiqh, thus organizing his books in this manner. He should begin with the treatises that deal with purification, followed by the treatises that deal with prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even those treatises on prayer should be subdivided into those that deal with the conditions of prayer first followed by the rulings on prayer which include the prostration of forgetfulness, for example. Each book should be put in its proper place. They should not be placed in the section of Zakaat, say, which comes after the prayer. The same should then be done with similar treatises, i.e. these small booklets that are hard to locate if one needs to refer to them. They should be organized according to their subjects of jurisprudence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same goes for the rest of the Islamic sciences whether they deal with history, Creed or their likes. One should put the books that cover Creed in general amongst the general books or treatises on Creed. Or he should place those subjects on Creed that he is researching into different sections on Creed so that it is easy for him to refer back to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the first etiquette with regard to books is that one must organize his books in a good manner. Maintaining one&#8217;s library in order is an indication of a student of knowledge&#8217;s regard for his books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if you visit and are granted access to a person&#8217;s library and find that his books are scattered around, in disorder and so on, this is due to ether one of two possibilities. The books are this way either because (1) the person researches his books a lot and needs to refer to them, thus causing his books to be scattered about &#8211; and even though this is something praiseworthy he should still put them back in their proper places afterward &#8211; or (2) he does not organize his books at all to begin with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his book on the judges of Egypt, which is called<i> Raf&#8217;u-il-Isr &#8216;an Qudaat Misr</i>, Al- Haafidh Ibn Hajr records a biography of one of the judges in Egypt and mentioned that when he was granted his judicial position, he would sit in a place where his books were on display. His books would be arranged in a nice and neat order. A student of knowledge entered his office once and saw his books and said: &#8220;What excellent order these books are in!&#8221; He was insinuating that the neat order and arrangement that his books were in indicated his lack of referencing them and using them. The judge understood this and kept it a secret to himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Later on, this man that had criticized the judge for having his books neatly arranged was put in charge of recording people&#8217;s marriages, i.e. the marriage contracts &#8211; something like an official that is licensed to wed couples. So the judge discovered that he had made an error in one of his marriage certificates and then rebuked him harshly. This shows that he had preserved that statement he made (a long time ago) in his memory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point is that this student used the fact that the judge&#8217;s books were neatly arranged as proof that he didn&#8217;t read or use them. But this is not always the case. If a student of knowledge wants to work on a subject or research an issue and he takes a number of books out, putting them in front of him and looking into this one and looking into that one, when he finishes, he should return them back to their proper place so that it will be easy for him to refer back to them at a later time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From the manners of dealing with books is that a student of knowledge focuses his attention on the revised and accurate editions of books only. In the old days, books used to be bought from a manuscript transcriber known as a<i> warraaq</i>. A person was called a<i> warraaq</i> if he had a place where he would manually transcribe a copy of a book and sell it to buyers or sell it to someone who intended to sell his manuscripts (i.e. dealers). These people were known as <i>warraaqoon</i> &#8211; those who devoted their time to transcribing books by hand or to just selling books. Amongst these transcribers were those who were vary careful in their work and others who weren&#8217;t.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The closest things in resemblance to them in our time are the publishing houses and print shops that exist today. They have inherited the work of the <i>warraaqoon</i> throughout the passage of time. This is why we say that the occupation of the copyists was taken over in detail as time passed on by the scholars. A student of knowledge should strive to buy a verified and edited book or to transcribe one by hand whilst comparing what he has copied to the original manuscript. Or he should buy a book and compare it with a reliable source copy that is studied in the presence of scholars and so on and so forth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What this means is that a student of knowledge should focus on acquiring the authentic and verified editions of book whether in manuscript or published form. In this day and age, most of the students of knowledge devote their attention and concern to only the published books. This is why we see that the books in print today are many.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The publication of books in the Arabic Language began a little more than five centuries ago, i.e. printing books in Arabic started more than 500 years ago, which was around 1400-1500 AD, since that is the time they were dated. However, the majority of the books that were printed in the Arabic Language in the Arab and Muslim lands only occurred in the last two-hundred years. Whatever was printed before that was published in the western countries due to their high regard for publishing books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point of all this is to show that the publication of books is something old and well established. Today one can find displayed in the marketplaces and stores a variety of different publishing companies, books, and names of verifiers and editors, etc. This is why many times that a phrase or a sentence is quoted from a recently published book, which is not necessarily revised accurately or precisely, the result is that discrepancies and mix-ups occur.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This happened to me several times while teaching in the mosque&#8217;s study area. I confirm the reading of a passage (from a book being studied), for example, based on an accurate edition of the book, then one of the students of knowledge comes and presents a recent edition of the same book in which the passage in there is inaccurate. The reason for this is because the contemporary publishing companies are not all precise and meticulous with the books they print. This also can apply to the older publishing companies. So regardless if the book was published a long time ago or recently, you should strive to find which edition of the book is the most accurate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you are interested in purchasing a book or acquiring knowledge on some subject, you must seek to attain the most accurate edition of the book that has been published with precision. So you should ask the people of knowledge or those who have expertise on this subject, saying for example: &#8220;What is the most reliable edition of such and such book?&#8221; &#8220;What is the most accurate edition of <i>Tafseer Al-Qurtubee</i>?&#8221; &#8220;What is the most accurate edition of<i> Tafseer At- </i><i>Tabaree</i>?&#8221; &#8220;What is the most accurate edition of<i> Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree</i>?&#8221; &#8211; which if you acquire, you will keep in your library and have no need for another edition of the book to go along with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What we have observed today from many publications is that you find the publishing companies only print books for commercial purposes and so they come out unreliable. This is why you should ask about which edition you should acquire or which edition you want to purchase. So you should not just buy any book that is thrown at you. Rather, you should ask about it and become aware of the publishing company that has produced it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a certain individual has verified and reviewed the publication of the book, you should ask about whether or not this individual is accurate or inaccurate in his verification. Is he a businessman or not? And so on and so forth. To reiterate, a student of knowledge should focus on acquiring only the most accurate edition of a particular book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He should only buy a book after enquiring about it. For example, you should ask: &#8220;Which is the most accurate edition of<i> Tafseer Al-Qurtubee</i>?&#8221; So if you receive an answer to this question, you should then go and strive to acquire this edition of the book regardless of whether it is printed or photocopied or published in modern times via computer formatting. You should strive to acquire only the correct and accurate editions of books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What I have noticed according to my opinion is that most of the books that the brothers have in their hands are editions that are not accurate and precise. They may have a valid copy of the book however it is not completely accurate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some individual has taken charge of the overview of its publication but what he has done can hardly be called &#8220;taking charge.&#8221; Or it is said that the edition was amended by the publishing house and so on and so forth, however, it contains mistakes and errors the likes of which make the edition defective and not fit for a student of knowledge to acquire and reference and use for researching information.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the second etiquette is that a student of knowledge should strive to acquire the accurate and precise editions regardless of whether they are printed in older form or they are recent publications. What is important is that the edition is accurate. So one should get to know and become acquainted with which publishing companies are meticulous and precise and which publishing companies are not. This is so that he will be able to know and distinguish which editors are just interested in business from which ones show great concern and care for their verifications. By doing this, he will also be able to tell the advantages that certain editions have over others, as well as how many times one book has been published.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We will diverge from the topic a little here and say that a student of knowledge should also be careful when looking into verifications and what people do nowadays such as placing footnotes and comments in their books. He should be aware of the different editions that exist for a book because it may be for example that an editor makes a reference to a volume and page number of a particular book and the reader believes that the book was only printed once. So when he goes to reference the volume and page number of the edition that he has, he cannot find it and says: &#8220;This person has erred or made a mistake.&#8221; It is possible that this same book was published over a hundred times or twenty times of thirty times or five times or four times and so on and so forth. So if a student of knowledge is aware of the different editions of the book and the number of times it was printed and the advantages and merits that some editions have over others, this is from the supplementary forms of knowledge that is from the general etiquettes that a student of knowledge should abide by.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The third etiquette with regard to books is that one must strive to keep his books clean and preserved. This means that his books should be clean and have no dust attached to them. They should not be dirty nor should they have any bad markings on them. They should also not be put in an improper place, meaning the book should be put in an appropriate place that is befitting for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From that which is not befitting for books &#8211; especially the books of the people of knowledge in which can be found a clarification of the meanings of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah &#8211; is that they have dirt, dust and filth on them. Keeping books clean is a sign of one&#8217;s respect for what is contained in them and a proof that one magnifies the symbols of Allaah. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ِبﻮُﻠُﻘْﻟا ىَﻮْﻘَﺗ ﻦِﻣ ﺎَﻬﱠﻧِﺈَﻓ ِﻪﱠﻠﻟا َﺮِﺋﺎَﻌَﺷ ْﻢﱢﻈَﻌُﻳ ﻦَﻣَو<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And whoever magnifies the symbols of Allaah, then that is truly from the piety of the hearts.&#8221;</span> [Surah Al-Hajj: 32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if the book is on Tafseer or on the Sunnah or on Fiqh &#8211; the lawful and unlawful &#8211; or on Creed, then a person should strive to preserve them. Maintaining books clean falls under honoring Allaah and honoring the religious knowledge that is taken from the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When dealing with books, from the perspective of preserving and safeguarding them, a student of knowledge should also be careful of not turning his book into a parcel for his documents, special essays or receipts, i.e. such as the sales receipts for the books he bought and so on. If you were to pick up one of his books and look at it you would find that there is a receipt and a treatise inside it or that there is a pen and an eraser inside it and so on an so forth. Some of the scholars have said: &#8220;Do not turn your book into a bouquet or a parcel.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is one of the important etiquettes with regard to books &#8211; that you not turn them into storage bins such as by placing pens inside them or treating them like repositories for money and currency. So if you were to open up a book you would find all of these things inside them and notice that the book&#8217;s binding has become worn and that the book has changed and so on due to the book not being preserved properly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A book should also not be turned into a bouquet, i.e. it should not be folded in an inappropriate manner, since a book contains the words of Allaah and the words of the Messenger of Allaah (Peace be upon him). So it is not proper to treat a book in this manner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also not proper to put a glass of water or a cup of tea or their likes on top of books. The books of the people of knowledge, which contain texts from the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah should be put in the highest places and not in the lowest places with pieces of paper and such on top of them. Abiding by this etiquette instills respect in the heart for the words of Allaah and the words of the Messenger of Allaah, not to mention the knowledge that is derived from these two sources.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is also related to preserving books is when a student of knowledge is careful in the manner that he records text from books. Sometimes, we see books with written comments in them that are annotated in such a way that their benefit is squandered. In what has preceded, we have seen that the scholars forbade from writing small letters in books, such as when you write notes using tiny lettering or when you make notes on points of benefit found in your book using such small letters that if a student of knowledge wanted to, he would not be able to benefit from them. In what has been reported, Imaam Ahmad one time regretted having recorded<i> ahaadeeth</i> with small handwriting. This is since when he needed to refer to them in his old age, he was not able to extract these points of benefit because they were written in very tiny letters and the ink from the letters were so close to each other that it was hard to read and thus the benefit was lost.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some scholars or students of knowledge may not have good handwriting. This is not a flaw. However, one should arrange his letters in such a way that they are written clearly. This is since some of the scholars who didn&#8217;t possess good handwriting would not be able to read even their own handwriting, as was the case with Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah whose writings would have to be extracted by one of his students. This is mentioned in the books on Biographies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Katheer indicated this in the 14th volume of his collection<i> al- </i><i>Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah</i> while discussing the year in which this student of Ibn Taimiyyah passed away. He said: &#8220;And he was the one who would be able to extract the second sermon of Ibn Taimiyyah. And whenever Ibn Taimiyyah would want to take a portion (from his writings), no one would be able to extract it except for him since Shaikh-ul-Islaam (Ibn Taimiyyah) would write in a hurry and his writings would be unclear, so at times it would appear obscure to him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was due to the letters being written very small. This could work, however it is not possible all the time, which is why a student of knowledge needs to know how to write in his books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars of Hadeeth have advised in their etiquettes on writing that when a student of knowledge wants to write, he should start from the line that he is in or in which can be found the note, then continue by going up towards the top and not the bottom. This means that when you study a book with a teacher or you make notes in a book and you come upon an area where you begin writing (a comment), you should transfer from that line to a line above it. The reason for this is because you may encounter a point of benefit in the line that follows that one, which requires you to write a note for it, and so then you will be confused on how to write it. Start ascending to the line above it. If you write from the bottom to the top, this will ensure that your writing will be clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should also try to make your lines straight but designed in a sloping manner such that if you want to correct anything later, you can insert that correction in the empty spaces that are between the slants. Perhaps some of you have seen some of the old books with notes in them and noticed that these (notes) were written in blocks of text that appear to be in the shape of triangles. This was not done in vain and without purpose. Rather, these books were written this way &#8211; in the manner of the ancestors &#8211; because they needed to be verified afterward. The corrections would be placed in the empty spaces (on the sides of the triangle) or the book would be compared to another manuscript and notes from that manuscript would be annotated in these empty spaces.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, you must give great importance to having handwriting that is clear and organized in terms of knowing the place where the writing starts. So if I were to look at what you wrote and the notes you made, I would know where the note you made for this sentence begins and in which direction it will go.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, if you reference the books on terminology, their authors have explained how to write and make notes in books using guidelines and details that they have established on either preserving the text, explaining a word, making a correction, writing a footnote, clarifying which manuscript it is or how to write valid phrases and so on. So we should refer to these books on terminology because their authors wrote about this and talked about it in detail.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Another etiquette regarding books which deserves attention is: A student of knowledge should maintain (a list of) selected points of benefit for each of his books. This means that if someone reads a book and he doesn&#8217;t feel that he will remember or be able to recall what he read later &#8211; even if he is young &#8211; he should select points of benefit from this book and write them down in a special notebook. Or he can make references to them in the preface of the book, such as in a page at the beginning of the book. So he makes something that resembles a table of contents, however, it is specifically catered to him since these points of benefit that apply to him may not apply to others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they are specifically for you when you need to reference something you learned from this book at a later time. Two nights ago, I took the book<i> al-Fadl-ul- </i><i>Mubeen fee Sharh al-Arba&#8217;een</i> of Jamaal-ud-Deen Al-Qaasimee from its place in my library. It had been almost ten years since I last read the book, but when I opened it up to its first page, lo and behold, I found the points of benefit in the book that I had written down a long time ago. And there were many, many points of benefit of which I had forgotten almost ninety percent of them. So instead of reading the book over again, all I had to do was look at this point of benefit and that point of benefit and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the points of benefit found in the book, for example, was the author&#8217;s discussion on the difference between the<i> &#8216;Aalim</i> and the<i> &#8216;Aarif</i> and the reason why the Sufis renounced the word<i> &#8216;Aalim</i> in favor of using the word<i> &#8216;Aarif</i> and why they say the &#8216;Aarif so and so and not the &#8220;&#8216;Aalim&#8221; (i.e. scholar) so and so. This is one of the points of benefit found in this book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another point of benefit in the book was an excellent and firm quote from Ibn Hazm found in his book<i> al-Fisal</i> on the meanings of the (verbs)<i> qadaa</i> (to divinely ordain) and<i> qaddara</i> (to divinely pre-decree). At the end of the quote, Jamaal-ud-Deen Al-Qaasimee says: &#8220;And this is the most brilliant of what was said concerning the meaning of<i> qadaa</i> and<i> qaddara</i> and what has the most right to be accepted.&#8221; And it is just as he said. Perhaps I will relate that to you at a later time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These points of benefit that you record at the beginning of the book are very important. If you refer to the book some time after reading it, you will find these points before you. This means that when you read a book or a group of books, you should select points from them, which you feel are beneficial and useful to you and annotate them at the beginning of the book in the first page. So it will take the form of an index with brief phrases describing the point of benefit (and the page number where it can be found).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that this is extremely important for a student of knowledge. If you are able to make a special notebook in which you can place selected points that you may need, then this is important and you will definitely refer to it later on in time. It is not proper for you to read a book just like this and say that this (one-time) reading is sufficient because after one or two months or maybe after a year, you will forget what you read.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if you write down (the most important points of) what you read, you can refer back to it years later and find that the points of benefit are available for display before you, as the saying goes: &#8220;Understanding is contingent &#8211; it comes and goes, whereas writing is recorded.&#8221; Write down what you have understood or record what you have learned from the book.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">From the etiquettes related to books, also, is: The manners of lending out books. Giving out books for people to borrow is not allowed unless you are giving them to someone that you trust will care for the books. The reason for this is because you have the most right to your book, unless you find someone else that is in need of it and who, when finished using it, will return it back to you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is mentioned in the biography of Al-Khateeb Al-Baghdaadee that a man once asked him if he could borrow one of his books, so he replied saying: &#8220;You have three days to use it.&#8221; The man said: &#8220;That is not enough time.&#8221; So Al-Khateeb said: &#8220;I have counted its pages, so if you want to make a copy of it, then three days is sufficient for you. And if you want to read it, then three days is sufficient for you. And if you want to do more than that with it, then I have the most right to my book.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is correct, since in the past I had lent the first volume of a large book consisting of eight volumes to a brother &#8211; I don&#8217;t want to mention the title of the book, since perhaps he may hear this and think that I&#8217;m insinuating him &#8211; and now nearly twelve years have passed on, and he still has not returned it to me! And he tells me he doesn&#8217;t know where he put it. Similarly, the eighth volume of another set &#8211; even though I&#8217;m not worried so much over it &#8211; however, more than twenty years have passed and until now, he has not given it back. This is why a poet once said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>&#8220;Do not lend your books<br />
</i><i style="line-height:1.5em;">And make your answer some excuse<br />
</i><i>Whoever does in fact lend a book,<br />
</i><i>I swear he has not done something good.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another person said: &#8220;The perdition of books is in lending them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was once said to a man from India who had opened up a huge library: &#8220;How did you create this library?&#8221; He replied: &#8220;By borrowing books from people.&#8221; He was asked: &#8220;How is that?&#8221; So he said: &#8220;I borrow a book and don&#8217;t return it. This is how I was able to create this library.&#8221; The man asked: &#8220;Isn&#8217;t this a crime against those you borrow from?&#8221; He replied: &#8220;Whoever lends his books to people is insane. And whoever gives back what he borrows is even more insane than him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is since souls are attached to books. In his book<i> al-Qawaa&#8217;id</i>, while speaking about a principle, Al-Haafidh Ibn Rajab mentioned that there is no capital punishment of cutting off the hand for stealing them &#8211; i.e. if a person steals a book, then according to some scholars, he does not have to have his hand cut off. This is since there is a doubt in this &#8211; i.e. that the truth contained in books is (free) for everyone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So for example, one of your fellow students or colleagues may get a book and then believe that he has a right to it, especially if the book is a charitable copy or it was given to you as a gift or so on. So this would cause him to take the issue of returning it lightly. He will be lax in giving the book back. And you will be the one who loses out on the book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, if you are not sure if the one who is asking to borrow a book from you is serious and will benefit from it in a short amount of days and nights, then do not lend him the book. This is since when you lend your books out to people, you are depriving yourself from their benefit. And not every one that borrows a book can be trusted with it, for how many people have borrowed books and not returned them!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">[6] </span><strong style="line-height:1.5em;">Question</strong><span style="line-height:1.5em;">: What are the books you recommend a young person that is starting out in his Islaamic studies to read?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he is a novice, then from the books of Fiqh, we advise him to read <strong>&#8220;Fiqh As-Sunnah&#8221; of Sayyid Saabiq</strong>, while seeking assistance from some of its references, such as <strong>&#8220;Subul-us-Salaam </strong>(the ways of Peace &amp; Safety)<strong> &#8220;</strong> (of Imaam As-Sana&#8217;aanee, rahimahullaah). And if he looks into <strong>&#8220;Tamaam-ul-Mannah&#8221;</strong> (of Al-Albaanee) then that will be stronger for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I advise him to read &#8220;<strong>Ar-Rawdat-un-Nadiyyah</strong>&#8221; (of Sideeq Hasan Khaan).<br />
As for the subject of Tafseer, then he should habitually read from the book <strong>&#8220;Tafseer Al-Qur&#8217;aan-ul-&#8216;Adheem&#8221; of Ibn Katheer</strong> – [chm file download ]even though it is somewhat long – for it is the most authentic from the books of Tafseer today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, on the subject of religious exhortation and heart-softening narrations, he should read the book <strong>&#8220;Riyaad-us-Saaliheen&#8221; of Imaam An-Nawawee.</strong> [Daeef hadeeth in Riyadh us Saleheen &#8211; Albanee ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, with regard to the books related to Creed, I advise him to read the book <strong>&#8220;Sharh Al-&#8216;Aqeedat-ut-Tahaawiyyah&#8221; of Ibn Abee Al-&#8216;Izz Al-Hanafee</strong>. And he should seek assistance, also, from my comments and explanations to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, he should make it his customary practice to study from the<strong> books of Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah</strong> and his student <strong>Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyyah</strong>, may Allaah have mercy on them. For I hold them to be from the rare and unique Muslim scholars that have treaded upon the methodology of the Salaf As-Saalih (righteous predecessors) in their understanding, while having Taqwaa and righteousness. And we do not purify anyone over Allaah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#888888;">Source:Introduction of his classic book Iqtidaa-ul-&#8216;Ilm Al-&#8216;Amal</span><br />
<span style="color:#888888;"> Translator:abu maryam</span><br />
<span style="color:#888888;">al-manhaj.com</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We give thanks to Allaah, the One free of all defects, for having inspired us. And we ask Him to grant us the ability to act upon what He has given us knowledge of. Indeed, goodness cannot be attained, except by His granting and His assistance. Whomsoever Allaah leads astray, there is no one from His creation that can guide him. May Allaah send His blessings upon Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam), the chief of the first and the last (of people), and upon his brothers from among the prophets and messengers. And upon those who follow the light (i.e. the Qur&#8217;aan) that was revealed to him SAW until the Day of Recompense.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed, I advise you O seeker of knowledge to have a sincere and pure intention in your search for knowledge. And that you exert yourself in acting upon what it necessitates (from action). For indeed knowledge is a tree and action is its fruit. And one can never be considered knowledgeable so long as he doesn&#8217;t act upon what he has knowledge of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has also been stated: &#8220;Knowledge is a parent and action is its offspring.&#8221; And &#8220;Knowledge comes with action, while narrating comes with investigating.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So do not feel satisfied with actions so long as you are lacking in knowledge. Nor feel satisfied with knowledge so long as you fall short of producing actions. Rather, combine them both, even if your share of the two is small.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is nothing worse than a scholar, whose knowledge the people abandon because of the corruption of his ways, nor an ignorant person whose ignorance the people accept because of what they see from his worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a little of this (knowledge) along with a little of that (action) is what is most likely to save you in the end, when Allaah bestows His mercy upon His servant and completes his favor upon him. But as for laziness and negligence, love for ease and comfort, preferring the easy life and showing indifference, inclining towards leisure and relaxation, then the results of these characteristics are blameworthy, detestable and disastrous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowledge leads to action, just as action leads to salvation. So if the action falls short of the knowledge, then the knowledge becomes a burden upon the one who possesses that knowledge. And we seek Allaah&#8217;s refuge from knowledge that turns into a burden, is the cause of humiliation and which becomes a shackle on the neck of the one who possesses it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sahl Ibn Muzaahim (rahimahullaah) said: &#8220;The matter is more tighter upon a scholar than when one clenches his fist tightly, even though the ignorant person is not excused because of his ignorance (i.e. he will be held to account also). However, the scholar will receive a greater punishment if he abandons what he has knowledge of and doesn&#8217;t act upon it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So did those of our Salaf (predecessors) from the past reach the high levels that they reached except through sincerity in Creed (Beliefs), righteous actions and overwhelming abstinence of the attractive features of this worldly life? And did the wise people reach the greatest level of success (that they did) except by working hard in their efforts and being pleased with their easy accomplishments, while sacrificing the excess amount from their needs by giving it away to the poor and those who asked?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is not the one who gathers books of knowledge just like the one who gathers gold and silver? Is not the one who has an intense greed for them just like the one who is eager and desirous of gold and silver? Is not the one who is deeply in love with them just like the one who treasures gold and silver?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So just as wealth does not benefit except by it being spent, then likewise, knowledge does not benefit except for one who acts upon it and carries out its obligations. So let each individual examine himself and take advantage of his time, for indeed the resting place (i.e. this world) is short, the (time for) departure is near, the road is hazardous and deviating from it is common. The danger is great, the one who takes note has wisdom, Allaah, the Most High, is watching over, and to Him is the (final) recourse and return. &#8220;And whosoever does an atom&#8217;s weight of good, he shall see it. And whosoever does an atom&#8217;s weight of evil, he shall see it.&#8221; [99: 7-8]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Kumail ibn Ziyaad said: &#8216;Alee ibn Abee Taalib took hold of my hand and took me off towards the desert. When we reached it, he sat down, took a deep breath and then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O Kumail ibn Ziyaad! The hearts are receptacles, so the best of them is the one which preserves the best. So memorise what I say to you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The people are of three (types)</strong>: the Scholar who is rabbaanee [1],  the one learning being upon the path of salvation, and the confused rabble who follow everyone who calls out &#8211; bending along with every wind &#8211; they are not enlightened by the light of knowledge, nor do they lean upon a firm support.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Knowledge is better than wealth</strong>. Knowledge is a protection for you, whereas it is you that has to protect wealth. The zakaat of knowledge is action, whereas spending decreases wealth. And love of the Scholar is part of the Religion. Knowledge brings about obedience for the Scholar in his own lifetime and causes him to have good repute after his death, whereas the benefit of wealth ceases when it passes away. The hoarders of wealth have died even though they are still alive, whereas the Scholars remain for as long as time remains &#8211; their persons are lost, but their examples remain in the hearts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here, indeed here &#8211; (and he pointed to his chest) &#8211; there is knowledge, if only I could find carriers for it. But instead I have found them quick to comprehend, but not trustworthy. They use what pertains to the Religion for worldly ends. They seek to use Allaah&#8217;s proofs against His Book, blindly following the people of truth, but having no insight regarding receiving it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Doubt pierces their hearts when anything problematic arises. They are neither this nor that. They do not know where the truth lies, and if they are mistaken then they do not know why. They are ardently in love with something the true state of which they do not know &#8211; so they become a trial for others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed, the utmost good is for the one to whom Allaah grants understanding of the Religion And it is enough ignorance for a person that he does not know about his Religion. Such a person is passionately addicted to pleasures, accustomed to following desires, or is one given to amassing wealth and piling it up. Such people are not from the callers to the Religion rather they are more like the grazing cattle. And thus knowledge passes away with the passing away of those who carry it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oh Allaah, yes! The earth will not be without one who stands upright for Allaah, with proof &#8211; so that Allaah&#8217;s proofs and clear signs are not abolished. They are the ones who are few in number, but having the most value to Allaah. With them, Allaah asserts His proofs amongst their contemporaries and cultivates them in the hearts of those similar to them. With them, knowledge assaults and comes upon the true state of affairs, so that which those accustomed to easy living find difficult therein, they find easy; and they are at home with that which causes consternation to the ignorant ones. They live in this world with their bodies, whereas their souls are attached to higher things. They are Allaah&#8217;s ambassadors in His land and the callers to His Religion. Oh how I would like to see them, and I seek Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness for myself and for you. If you wish then you may leave.&#8221; [2]</p>

<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Rabbaanee</strong>: The Scholar who acts in accordance with his knowledge and has insight into the condition of the people &#8211; so that he raises them upon the primary matters of knowledge before the more detailed and difficult matters.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh was asked which books he advises a student of knowledge to read in the areas of ‘Aqeedah, Tafseer, Hadeeth and its science, and Fiqh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He specifically stated that a student should memorize and understand (in the topic of <b><i>&#8216;Aqeedah</i></b>):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) <b>al-Usool ath-Thalaathah</b>,<br />
(2) <b>Shuroot us-Salaah wa Arkaanihaa wa Wajibaatihaa</b>,<br />
(3) <b>al-Qawaa’id ul-&#8216;Arba’ah</b>,<br />
(4) <b>Shuroot Laa Ilaaha illAllaah</b>,<br />
(5) <b>Nawaaqid ul-Islaam</b>, and<br />
(6) <b>Kitaab ut-Tawheed</b>, all by Shaykh ul-Islaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for (7) <b>Kashf ush-Shubuhaat</b>, then he said that if a person memorizes it, then that is good, but he did not stress it as with the above works.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, he did not stress memorizing (8) <b>al-Waasitiyyah</b>, but instead said that a student can either memorize it or learn it and understand it well.<br />
He also mentioned that a person should study (9) the various treatises contained in <b>Majmoo’ Fataawaa Shaykh ul-Islaam Bin Taymiyyah</b> (presumably <b>al-Fatwa al-Hamawiyyah al-Kubraa, ar-Risaalat ut-Tadmuriyyah, al-&#8216;Eemaan</b>, etc., although he did not name names), and (10) <b>Sharh ut-Tahaawiyyah</b> by Ibn Abee al-‘Izz al-Hanafee (d. 792) if he wants to expand his scope regarding the subject of Asmaa’ was-Sifaat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the other subjects, I do not recall him specifically saying that a student should memorize anything except for the one who desires to learn about the differences between the four madhaahib in <b><i>Fiqh</i></b>. He said that it is befitting for such a person to memorize a matan (lower level Fiqh manual) for each of the four madhaahib.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the area of <b><i>hadeeth</i></b>, he mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) <b>al-Arba’een an-Nawawiyyah</b>,<br />
(2) <b>‘Umdat ul-Ahkaam</b>, and<br />
(3) <b>Buloogh ul-Maraam</b>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Although he did not specifically say that one should memorize them, I have heard other Scholars (such as Shaykh Saalih ibn ‘Abdul-‘Azeez Aal ash-Shaykh) say that one should begin his course in hadeeth with the memorization and study of <b>al-Arba’een</b>. The more famous explanations for it are that of an-Nawawee (d. 676) himself, which is a very brief explanation for beginners, that of Ibn Daqeeq al-‘Eed (d. 702), which is perhaps a middle-level explanation, and that of Ibn Rajab (d. 795), which is more advanced and thorough than the rest.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Scholars have also recommended that the more advanced and dedicated students should memorize and learn the other two: <b>‘Umdat ul-Ahkaam</b> and <b>Buloogh al-Maraam</b> by ‘Abdul-Ghanee al-Maqdisee (d. 600) and Ibn Hajar al-‘Asqalaanee (d. 852) respectively.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <b><i>tafseer</i></b>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said that a person should start with the tafseer of ‘Abdur-Rahmaan as-Sa’dee (d. 1376), titled <b>Tayseer al-Kareem al-Rahmaan fee Tafseer Kalaam il-Manaan</b>, because its author is a well-known Salafee (and hence does not fall into the same ta’weel and mistakes of the other lower-level tafaaseer, such as al-Jalaalayn).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then said that if a person can find a Salafee teacher to guide him, he should study <b>Fath ul-Qadeer</b> of Shawkaanee (d. 1250) – this is because the teacher will help him:<br />
(a) Be alert to some of the mistakes of Shawkaanee regarding as-Sifaat, and<br />
(b) Help him with the more difficult aspects of the &#8216;Arabic language that occur in the book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally, he mentioned <b>Tafseer Ibn Katheer</b>, stating that it is okay if a student studies from one of the various abridgements available nowadays (like that of ar-Rifaa’ee).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Taken From 22 Question About the Salafee Da&#8217;wah.</b><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Noble Shaykh, we desire that you give us the names of the valueable books in Tawheed and Fiqh?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The books in the science of Tawheed and Islaamic Fiqh of old and of today are numerous, and that which I direct you all to read in the [science of] Tawheed are the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>al-Usool uth-Thalaatha</b>, and <b>Kashf ush-Shubuhaat</b>, and <b>al-Qawaa&#8217;id ul-&#8216;Arba&#8217;ah</b>, and <b>al-Usool ul-&#8216;Eemaan Sittah</b>, and <b>Masaa&#8217;il al-Jaahiliyyah</b>, and <b>Kitaab ut-Tawheed</b>, and all of them are from Shaykh Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdul Wahhaab (rahimahullaah). And after that <b>Kitaab al-Aqeedatul Waasitiyyah</b>, and <b>Kitaabul Hamawiyyah</b>, and both of them are from Shaykh ul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah). And the <b>Nooniyyah</b> of Ibn Qayyim (rahimahullaah) with it&#8217;s explanation, and <b>al-Hayyaat Fee Dhillil Aqeedatil Islaamiyyah</b> by the writer of these letters [meaning the author is the Shaykh himself], and <b>al-Irshaad</b> by Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan, and <b>al-Aqeedatus Saheehah wa Maa Yudaaduhaa</b> by the Noble Shaykh &#8216;Abdul &#8216;Azeez ibn Baaz (rahimahullaah), and <b>Qawlul Mufeed</b> by al-Fawzaan also, and <b>Kitaab ut-Tawheed</b> of Ibn Khuzaymah, and <b>Kutubus-Sunnah</b> that have been written [and or recorded] in the science of &#8216;Aqeedah are numerous, as I have previously mentioned some of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Islaamic Fiqh, likewise the books are numerous, but begin with:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>al-Umdah</b> and it&#8217;s explanation, and the summarized versions of the books of the Hanaabilah, and the <b>Mulakhas al-Fiqhee</b> of al-Fawzaan, and the books of hadeeth that have been explained like the explanation of <b>Umdatul Ahkaam</b>, and <b>Subulus-Salaam</b> [which is the explanation of] <b>Bulughul Maraam</b>, and <b>al-Muntaqaa</b> and it&#8217;s explanation like <b>Naylul Awtaar</b>, then you precede in the reading of the books while exerting ones&#8217; self with the utmost exertion in seeking counsel with those who follow the Salaf in the books that you love to read either by way of telephone or through sending messages.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah make you all successful in that which pleases Him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question:</strong>Which books should a student of knowledge begin with? And then after those, if he wants to widen his study?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The books, which a student of knowledge, who is a beginner, should start reading with [if he can read and write well] are:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Fath ul-Majeed Sharh Kitaab ut-Tawheed , which is a mighty book,</li>
<li>Aqeedat ul-Waasitiyyah<span style="line-height:1.5em;"> by Shaykh ul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah, </span></li>
<li>al-Qawl ul-Mufeed Fee Adillatit Tawheed<span style="line-height:1.5em;"> by our brother Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdul-Wahhaab al-Wasaabee, </span></li>
<li>Bulugh al-Maraam</li>
<li>Riyaadh us-Saaliheen</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When you have read these books, you yourself will crave for more. If you could, start with the memorization of the Qur’aan, and this more good and desirable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the issue, regarding the &#8216;Arabic language, for our foreign brothers, then it is very important. If there is a foreign person who does not speak the &#8216;Arabic language well, then a person may come to him in his Islaamic appearance and then he begins to explain the Qur’aan to him other than how it ought to be, as happened with the Mu’tazilah.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Dealing With The Books Of Knowledge<br />
</span>Author: Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen<br />
Source: Fataawa ash-Shaykh Muhammad bin Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, Kitaab al-Ilm, p. 87-91</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>How should he deal with the book? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dealing with the book involves several things:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Knowing the subject of the book – so that he can benefit from it, because he needs to specialize. It may be a book of sihr (witchcraft) or trickery or falsehood. So he has to know the subject of the book so that he can benefit from it.</li>
<li>He has to know its terminology. Because knowing the terminology means that you will save a lot of time. This is what the scholars do in the introduction to their books, for example we know that when the author of Buloogh al Maraam says “agreed upon”, he means that the hadeeth was narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim, whereas the author of al-Muntaqaa uses this phrase in a different manner – when he says “agreed upon”, he means that the hadeeth was narrated by Imaam Ahmad, al-Bukhaari and Muslim.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly in books of fiqh, the scholars use the words qawlayn, wajhayn, riwaayatayn and ihtimaalayn differently. Riwaayatayn (two reports) means two reports from the imaam; wajhayn (two views) means two views among the companions, i.e., the companions of the leaders of the madhhab; ihtimaalayn (two possibilities) is used in cases of uncertainty as to which of the two views is correct; and qawlayn (two opinions) is more general in meaning than that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, we also need to know what an author means if he says ijmaa’ (consensus) or wifaaq (agreement). If he says ijmaa’, he means consensus among the ummah, and if he says wifaaq he means agreement with the three imams, as is the usage of the author of al-Furoo concerning Hanbali fiqh. Similarly the followers of each madhhab all have their own terminology, so it is essential to know the terminology of the author.</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Knowing the style and phrases used in the book. Hence you will find that when you read a book for the first time, especially the academic books which are filled with knowledge, you will come across a phrase whose meaning you will have to ponder over, because you are not familiar with it. But if you read the book again you will become familiar with it.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also something which needs to be added to the book, which is writing comments in the margins and at the foot of the pages. This is something which the seeker of knowledge needs to make the most of. If he comes across something which needs further explanation or evidence, and he is afraid that he may forget it, then he should make a note either in the margin or at the foot of the page. Often a person misses out on such benefits because he does not make notes which take no more than a minute or two to do. Then when he comes back he may or may not remember it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The seeker of knowledge has to pay attention to that, especially in books of fiqh. In some books you may come across a matter and its rulings which causes you to be confused and have doubts. If you refer to books which are more comprehensive than the book you are reading and you find something which explains the matter, then you should make a note of it so that you can refer to it again if you need to, without having to refer to the original book from which you have quoted it. This will save you time.</p>
<h5 style="text-align:justify;">Reading books is of two types</h5>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Reading in depth to ponder and understand. This necessarily takes time.</li>
<li>A quick reading to get an idea of the subject of the book, the topics covered and the content of the book. This is done by thumbing through the book and skimming it. This does not involve the same level of thinking as the first method. The best way to read books is to ponder the meanings and seek help from scholars who have understanding. It comes as no surprise that the book which is most deserving of such a reading is the Book of Allaah. You must be patient and persist in reading, for man has not been given any greater gift than patience.</li>
</ol>
<h5 style="text-align:justify;">Collecting books</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The seeker of knowledge should be keen to collect books, but he should prioritize. If a person does not have much money, then it is not good and is not wise to buy a lot of books and have to pay for them, because this is bad management. If you cannot buy books with your own money, then you can borrow them from any library.</p>
<h5 style="text-align:justify;">Being keen to read important books</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The seeker of knowledge must be keen to read the most important reference books, not modern works, because some of the modern writers do not have deep knowledge, so if you read what they have written you will find that it is superficial. They may quote things verbatim, or they may distort them to make them longer, but it is all waffle. So you have to read the most important reference works written by the salaf (pious predecessors), because they are better and more blessed than many of the books of the later generation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most of the books of the later writers are short on meanings but long-winded. You may read a whole page which could have been summarized in one or two lines. But you will find the books of the salaf to be easy, straight forward and well written, with not even one word that has no meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Among the best books that the seeker of knowledge must be keen to read are</strong> the books of Shaykh al-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah – rahimahullaah – and his student Ibn al-Qayyim – rahimahullaah. It is known that the books of Ibn al-Qayyim are easier, because the style of Ibn Taymiyyah is strongly-worded because of his abundant knowledge and alert mind, and Ibn al-Qayyim saw the knowledge of Ibn Taymiyyah as a well-built house, and his own role as that of organizing and adorning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But Ibn al-Qayyim was free minded; if he thought that his shaykh’s view differed from what he thought was correct, he would speak up. When he thought that the pilgrim should go out of ihraam for Hajj then re-enter ihraam for ‘Umrah, because Ibn ‘Abbaas (radiAllaahu ‘anhu) thought that if the person who has not brought an animal for sacrifice enters ihraam for Hajj or Qiraan, he must go out of ihraam for Hajj then enter ihraam for ‘Umrah, whereas Ibn Taymiyyah thought that this applied only to the Sahaabah, he [Ibn al-Qayyim] said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I am more inclined towards the opinion of Ibn ‘Abbaas than to the opinion of my shaykh.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He clearly stated that he was of a different view, so he was independent in his thinking. But it comes as no surprise that he followed his shaykh – rahimahullaah – in matters which he thought were true and correct. Undoubtedly if you think about most of the opinions of Ibn Taymiyyah you will find that they are correct. This is something which anyone who ponders his books will know.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Evaluating books</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Books may be divided into three types:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Good books</li>
<li>Bad books</li>
<li>Books which are neither good nor bad.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Try to make sure that your bookshelf is free of books which have bad content. There are books which are described as literature, but they simply kill time without producing any benefit. And there are harmful books which contain specific ideas or promote incorrect ideology. These also should not be allowed on your bookshelf, whether that is because the methodology they use is wrong, or because of their wrong understanding of ‘aqeedah, and revolutionary books which promote a harmful ideology.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In general, no harmful book should be allowed on your bookshelf, because books nourish the soul just as food and drink nourish the body. If you nourish it with books such as those it will cause you a great deal of harm and you will follow a methodology which goes against the methodology of the seeker of sound knowledge.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Ibaanah Magazine , Issue No.3 &#8211; Dhul-Qa’dah 1416H / April 1996<br />
Shaykh Abu Anas Hamad al-’Uthman [1].<br />
From An-Nubadh fî Âdâbit-Talabil-’Ilm (pp.61-66)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hudayfah &#8211; <em>radiallâhu </em><i>’</i><em>anhu</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allâh <em>sallallâhu </em> <i> ’</i><em>alayhi wa sallam</em> related two matters to us. I have seen one of them, and I am waiting for the other. He informed us: <i> “Trustworthiness was sent down in the depths of the heart of the people, then they learnt it from the Qur‘ân, and then they learnt it from the Sunnah.”</i> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hâfidh Ibn Hajr (825H) &#8211; <em>rahimahullâh</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“His saying: <i> “then they learnt it from the Qur‘ân, then they learnt it from the Sunnah.”</i> So it occurs in this narration with the repetition of “then”, which contains an indication that they would learn Qur‘ân before learning the details of the <i>Sunnah</i>. And what is meant by the details of the <i>Sunnah</i> is anything that they would learn from the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> &#8211; whether it was obligatory or recommended.” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Maymûnî said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Abû ’Abdullâh (Imâm Ahmad) which is more beloved to you, that I should begin teaching my son the Qur‘ân or the Hadîth? He said: “No! The Qur‘ân.” I said: Shall I teach him all of it? He replied: “Unless that is difficult, in which case teach him some of it.” Then he said to me: “If he begins reciting first, then he will learn correct recitation and will persevere in it.” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Muflih &#8211; <em>rahimahullâh</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Upon this are the followers of Imâm Ahmad right up until our time.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) &#8211; <em>rahimahullâh</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“As for seeking to memorise the Qur‘ân, then this is to be given preference over many of the things that the people consider to be knowledge, but are &#8211; in reality &#8211; either totally useless, or having little benefit. It is also to be given precedence in learning especially by those who wish to acquire knowledge of the <em>Dîn</em>, its principles and its particulars. Since what is prescribed for such a person at this time is that he should begin by memorising the Qur‘ân, as it is the foundation of the branches of the knowledge of the <em>Dîn</em>. This is contrary to what is done by many of the people of Innovation from the non-Arabs and other than them, in that one of them will pre-occupy himself with superfluous parts of knowledge; such as <em>kalâm</em> (rhetorical speech) and argumentation; or very rare matters of differences; and blind-following; which there is no need for; or very strange and rare <i>ahadîth</i>, which are not established, nor of benefit; and many discussions which do not establish proofs. And he abandons memorising the Qur‘ân which is more important than all of this.” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad ibn al-Fadl said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I heard my grandfather say: I asked my father for permission to study under Qutaybah so he said: “First learn the Qur‘ân and then I will give you permission.” So I memorised the Qur‘ân by heart. So he said to me: “Remain until you have led the people in prayer with it (i.e for Tarawîh Prayer).” So I did so, then after the ’Îd he gave me permission, so I left for Marw.” [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ’Abdul Barr (d.463H) &#8211; <em>rahimahullâh</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Seeking knowledge is of levels and is of different stages which should not be skipped over. Whoever skips over them altogether, then he has overstepped the path of the Salaf &#8211; may Allâh have mercy on all of them. Whoever deliberately takes a path other than this has seriously deviated. However, whoever oversteps due to an <em>ijitihâd</em> (a knowledge based judgment that a qualified Scholar makes, intending to reach the truth), then such a person has erred. So the first knowledge is memorisation of the Book of Allâh and seeking to understand it. And it is obligatory to seek everything which will aid in understanding it. However, I do not say that is obligatory to memorise all of the Qur‘ân, but I do say that it is obligatory and essential for anyone who wishes to become a scholar &#8211; not that it is something obligatory in itself.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Khatîb al-Baghdâdî (d.463H) &#8211; <em>rahimahullâh</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It is fitting for a student that he begins with the memorisation of the Book of Allâh &#8211; <em>the Mighty and Majestic</em>. Since it is the greatest of the branches of knowledge and that which should be placed first and given precedence.” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hâdfidh an-Nawawî (d.676H) &#8211; <em>rahimahullâh</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So the first thing he should begin with is memorisation of the mighty Qur‘ân, which is the most important branches of knowledge. And the <em>Salaf</em> did not use to teach Hadîth or Fiqh, except to one who memorised the Qur‘ân. So when he has memorised it, then let him beware of pre-occupying himself from it with Hadîth, Fiqh or other things, to the extent that it leads him to forget anything of the Qur‘ân, or makes that likely.” [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Seeking Knowledge in Due Amounts</strong> [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh, the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“</b><strong>And this is a Qur‘ân which We have divided into parts, in order that you recite it to men at intervals. And we have sent it down in stages.” </strong>[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>sallallâhu </em><i>’</i><em>alayhi wa sallam </em>said to ’Abdullâh ibn ’Amr ibn al-’Âs <em>radiallâhu </em><i>’</i><em>anhumâ</em>: “<i>Read the Qur‘ân in every month.” </i>I said: I find that I have more strength than that. <i>“Recite it in every twenty nights.”</i> I said: I find that I have more strength than that. <i>“Then recite it in every seven days and do not increase upon that.”</i> [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">’Abdullâh ibn ’Amr ibn al-’Âs <i>radiallâ</i><em>hu </em><i>’</i><em>anhumâ </em>also related from the Prophet <em>sallâhu </em><i>’</i><em>alayhi wa sallam </em>that he said: <i>“He does not understand the Qur‘ân who recites it in less than three days.”</i> [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">’Umar ibn ’Abdul-Wâhid &#8211; a companion of al-Awzâ’î &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We read <i>al-Muwatta</i> to Mâlik (d.179H) in forty days, so he said: “A book that took me forty years to compile, you take from me in forty days! How little you understand of it.” [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Khatîb al-Baghdâdî said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It is fitting that he take care in acquiring knowledge and that he should not take too much in one go. Rather, he should take a little at a time, such that he can bear it, memorize it and be able to understand it. Because Allâh &#8211; <i>the Most High </i>&#8211; says: <strong>“And those who disbelieve say: Why is the Qur‘ân not sent down to him all at once? Thus (is it sent down in parts) that We may strengthen your heart thereby. And We have revealed it to you gradually, in stages.” </strong>[16]” [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Khatîb &#8211; <i>rahimahullâh</i> &#8211; also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And know that the heart is an organ from the organs. It is able to bear some things and unable to bear others &#8211; just like the rest of the body. Thus, some people are able to carry one-hundred pounds, whereas others are unable to carry even twenty. Some people are able to walk a number of mites in a day without tiring, whereas others are unable to even walk a mile in a day before they become tired&#8230; So let each person limit himself to what he is able without expending all his energies, because that will better aid him in learning with a good mind, from a arm and proficient teacher.” [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Supplicating for an Increase in Knowledge</strong> [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Say: My Lord! Increase me in knowledge.</strong><strong>”</strong> [Sûrah Tâ Hâ 20:114]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umm Salamah &#8211; <i>radiallâhu ’anha </i>&#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh&#8217;s Messenger <em>sallallâhu </em><i>’</i><em>alayhi wa sallam</em> used to supplicate in the morning Prayer: <i>“O Allâh! I ask you for beneficial knowledge, righteous action and pure sustenance.” </i>[20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Atlas bin Mâlik &#8211; <i>radiallâhu ’anhu</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allâh&#8217;s Messenger <em>sallallâhu </em><i>’</i><em>alayhi wa sallam</em> supplicated: <i>“O Allâh! Benefit me with knowledge. Teach me that which will benefit me, and provide me with knowledge from which I can derive benefit.” </i>[21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abû Bakr Muhammad ibn Ja’far said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">l heard Ibn Khuzaymah (d.311H) being asked: From where did you acquire this knowledge? So he said: “Allâhs Messenger <em>sallallâhu </em><i>’</i><em>alayhi wa sallam</em> said: <i>“Zam-zam water is that for which it is drunk.” </i>[22] So when I drunk the Zam-zam water, I supplicated to Allâh for beneficial knowledge.” [23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslâm Ibn Taymiyyah said: [24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The reality of this matter is that the servant differs in what he asks of knowledge and guidance, and of what he seeks to ask. So with remembrance of Allâh and turning towards Him, Allâh guides such a person &#8211; as He said &#8211; : <strong>“O My servants! All of you are misguided, except whomsoever I guide. So seek your guidance from Me.”</strong> [25] And as the Prophet <em>sallallâhu </em><i>’</i><em>alayhi wa sallam</em> used to say: <i>“O Allâh! Lord of Jibrîl, Mikaîl and Israfîl. The Originator of the heavens and the earths. Knower of the Unseen and the apparent. You judge between Your servants in that which he differs. So guide me in that which I differ from the truth</i> &#8211; <i>by Your permission. Indeed, You guide whomsoever You please, to a path that is straight</i>.<i>”</i> [26]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source:Al-Bahr-ur-Raa’iq Fee Az -Zuhdi war-Raqaa’iq- (pg. 39-43 of Daar-ul-Eemaan publishing) &#8211;<br />
Translator:isma&#8217;eel alarcon &#8211; al-manhaj.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Etiquettes of a Student of Knowledge</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* The student of knowledge must first know that Allaah has made it obligatory for him to worship Him, and worship cannot be attained except through knowledge. And he must know that it is not befitting for a Muslim to remain in ignorance. Thus, his search for knowledge is so that he may eradicate ignorance from himself and so that he may worship his Lord in the manner in which Allaah has commanded, not in the manner in which his desires deem appropriate. This should be his intention in his efforts for seeking knowledge, such that he has sincerity instilled in his heart, with regard to his exertion. He must not see any merit in his efforts, as belonging to himself, but rather he must see that all of the merit placed upon him, belongs to Allaah. This is because, with seeking knowledge, Allaah has granted him the means by which he may worship Him properly, by way of performing the obligations and abstaining from the prohibitions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* He must avoid all affairs that cause him to draw his attention away from the objective (of knowledge), except for those things which he must involve himself with for needs sake. Allaah says: &#8220;Allaah has not placed two hearts in the body of a man.&#8221; [Surat-ul-Ahzaab: 3] And most importantly, whenever ones thoughts are divided, he is hindered from achieving the realization of his objectives. For this reason, it is said: &#8220;Knowledge will not give you part of itself, until you first give it all of yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* He must also begin by cleansing his soul from reprehensible manners and reprehensible characteristics. This is since knowledge is an act of worship of the heart as well as a hidden link and concealed means of drawing nearer to Allaah. Thus in the same way that prayer, which is a duty upon the visible body’s limbs, is not valid, except by performing visible purification over the filth and uncleanness, hidden acts of worship as well as rectifying the heart with knowledge is not valid, except after purifying it from filthy manners and unclean characteristics. For this reason it is said: &#8220;The heart is purified through knowledge, just as the land is purified though tilling.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* He must not feel proud or arrogant about the knowledge he acquires. Rather, he must display humility in front of his teacher and grant him full control to direct and supervise him in all matters. He should submit himself willingly in the same way that a sick person, that is ignorant about medicine, submits himself to a concerned and proficient doctor. And if his teacher should be younger than him in age and possess little popularity and family status, then it is only by showing humility and patience with the degrading factors of knowledge, that one can truly attain the knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* Similarly, he must carefully select the person he is going to acquire knowledge from. He should not take knowledge, except from one whose qualifications are legitimately established, whose good religious qualities are evident, whose reputation is reliable and whose respectability is well known. Muhammad Ibn Sireen, Maalik Ibn Anas and many more of the Salaf have said: &#8220;Indeed, this knowledge is the Religion! So look carefully towards whom you take your Religion from.&#8221; [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* He must look towards his teacher with an eye of respect and reverence, for indeed this is the best way of deriving benefit from him. When some of our Salaf would go to study with their teacher, they would give something away in charity and say: &#8220;O Allaah, conceal my teacher’s defects from me and do not cause the blessing of his knowledge to be taken away from me.&#8221; Ar-Rabee&#8217;, the companion of Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee (rahimahullaah) would say: &#8220;I never dared to drink water in the presence of Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee, while he was looking at me, for fear of (upsetting) him.&#8221; And it is reported that some of the predecessors used to say: &#8220;From the rights that a teacher has over you is that: You should greet all the people generally with Salaam, but specify him apart from them with a particular greeting. You should sit in front facing him. You should not point toward his direction with your hand nor should you wink at him with your eye. You should not say to him: ‘Such and such person says the opposite of what you say!’ You must not backbite anyone in his presence. You should not consult your partner’s advice while in his gathering. You should not grab onto his garment if he should rise nor should you persistently bother him if he is fatigued. And you should not mind anyone that prolongs his company with him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* He should enter into the presence of his teacher with a clear and purified mind. Thus, his heart should be free of any matters that would prevent him from giving his full attention. He must not enter into his presence without first asking his permission, if his teacher is in a place which necessitates that his asking for permission be sought. He should greet those that attend his gathering with Salaam, when entering, and specify his teacher with a particularized greeting, apart from them. He should not step over the people with disregard, but rather he should sit where the rows of the gathering come to an end, until the teacher grants him permission to draw closer or he understands from the other students that are sitting that they prefer for him to advance. He should not cause anyone to get up from his place and if someone loves for him to sit in his place, then he should not accept, following the example of Ibn &#8216;Umar (raa). This is unless there is a benefit in his sitting up front, for the ones present, or the teacher orders them to do that. He should not sit in the middle of the learning circle, unless there is a necessity. He should not sit between two companions, unless he has their permission to do so. And if space is made for him in a gathering, he should sit and crouch himself in order to fit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* He must be polite with his teacher&#8217;s companions and those that attend his learning circle, for indeed, in doing that, he will be behaving well with the teacher and preserving the well being of the gathering. He should not raise his voice to loud tones nor should he laugh or talk too much, without any need for it. He should not fiddle with his fingers nor should he turn and peer to his right or to his left, unless he has a need to do so. Rather, he must face his teacher and devote his complete and undivided attention to his words.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* He must safeguard and preserve his studies by being diligent and persisting in it during all times in which he has the ability to do so. He should not satisfy himself with a little when he has the ability to attain more. He should not over burden himself with things that he cannot handle, for fear that it will cause him to grow tired and postpone what he desires to attain (of knowledge). This matter varies according to each individual and his circumstances. He must exert himself severely in trying to make free time for himself, maintain vivacity and eagerness, develop a strong and healthy body, have observant and conscious mind and to possess few preoccupations, such as the obstacles that fall in one’s way when he becomes a leading figure or when he gets promoted to a high position. &#8216;Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab (raa) said: &#8220;Acquire knowledge before you become leaders. For indeed, when you become leaders, followed by the people, you will be prevented from acquiring knowledge, due to the elevation of your position and excessiveness of your preoccupations.&#8221; [Kitaab-ul-‘Ilm (The Book of Knowledge) of Abu Khaithama] This statement contains the meaning of Imaam Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee&#8217;s words: &#8220;Acquire knowledge before you are given leadership, for when you become a leader, then there is no recourse for you, except knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Etiquettes of a Teacher</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* The teacher must make his intention purely for the sake of Allaah when teaching. He should not use his knowledge to seek an honorable position in the society nor should he charge any fee in exchange for his knowledge. He should not prefer nearness to the rich and luxurious, whilst distancing himself away from the poor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* He must characterize himself with the good manners mentioned in the texts of the Revelation, as well as the praiseworthy qualities and the pleasant traits that Allaah has guided towards. This includes abstaining from the worldly life, possessing little of its luxuries and not being tested by it and its inhabitants. Other characteristics include generosity, kindness, polite manners, cheerfulness in the face, forbearance and patience. He must be void of being able to grant little benefit to others. He must observe the qualities of piety, humility, tranquility, respect and humbleness. He should refrain from laughing and joking too much. He must observe the prescribed duties of the Religion, such as trimming the mustache, clipping the fingernails, combing the beard and ceasing to have a bad attitude. He must adorn his outer and inner characteristics with the Sunnah of the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). It has been reported on &#8216;Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab (raa) that he said: &#8220;Whosoever displays good characteristics to us, we will have good thoughts about him and love him. And whosoever displays bad characteristics to us, we will have bad thoughts about him and hate him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* He must free himself from performing any matters that have been ruled detestable (makrooh) as well as from indulging excessively in matters that have been ruled allowable (mubaah), while in the presence of his students. He should always have his students see him obeying Allaah and remembering Him much (dhikr), and he must preserve that condition. He must be cautious of all the dangers that are to be heeded, such as jealousy, showing-off, being amazed with oneself, and having contempt for others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* The teacher must be gentle with the one who takes knowledge from him. He must welcome him graciously and be kind to him, according to that person&#8217;s state of being. He must always offer him sincere advice, for indeed, the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: &#8220;The Religion is sincerity (advising): to Allaah, His Book, His Messenger, the Muslim leaders and their common folk.&#8221; [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* He must be gentle and compassionate with the one that seek knowledge from him, and he must look after his needs, just as he looks after the needs of his own child or his own self. He must be humble in the presence of those that frequently go to him and learn from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* He must preserve his habit of teaching students, causing that to have a significant place in his necessities. And when sitting amongst his students, he must rid himself of any affairs that cause him to become preoccupied. He must give to each one of his students, according to what is befitting to them, individually. Thus he should not exceed with one that doesn’t show that he wants to go a step further nor should he undercut from one that does want to progress. He should compliment anyone that shows excellence in his studies, as long as he doesn’t fear that affliction will befall him, by his becoming amazed with himself or something other than that. And he must show strictness with whoever deserves it, so long as he doesn&#8217;t fear that it will chase him away. He should not be jealous of any of his students, if one of them begins to display proficiency in the subject matter being studied. Nor should he continuously mention the favors that Allaah has bestowed on him, in that student&#8217;s presence. For indeed, being jealous of others is forbidden, upon a strict forbiddance. So how can he be jealous, especially of the student, who holds the status of a child?</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Reported by Muslim At-Tirmidhee, An-Nasaa&#8217;ee and others. Ibn Al-Atheer (ra) said: &#8220;Naseeha (Sincerity/Advising) is a word that entails many meanings. It is the desiring of good for the one who is being advised. The meaning of sincerity to Allaah is possessing good beliefs in regards to His Oneness and sincerity of intention in His worship. Sincerity to the Book of Allaah means believing in it and acting upon what is contained within it. Sincerity to His Messenger means believing in his (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) prophethood and rendering obedience to what he has commanded and what he has forbidden. Sincerity to the Muslim leaders means obeying them in matters of truth and not setting out against them in rebellion, if they should be oppressive. And sincerity to Muslim common folk means advising and directing them towards their needs and benefits.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
</span>Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This book is a complete translation of the booklet <b>“At-Ta’seel fee Talab-il-‘Ilm”</b> (Laying the Foundations for Seeking Knowledge). The source used for this translation was the Dar-ul-Imaam Ahmad 1st edition, 2005.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Originally, this treatise was a lecture the Shaikh once gave in a masjid. The talk was then transcribed and published as a book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this treatise, Shaikh Muhammad Baazmool discusses in detail nine fundamental principles with regard to seeking knowledge, which he puts together and backs up with proofs and evidences. Consequently, the treatise is divided into nine chapters and an introduction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This topic is extremely important since every Muslim is obligated to seek knowledge at one point in his life or another be it to implement the Islamic laws that are binding on him or to learn the fundamentals of his faith. So he must know that seeking knowledge has manners, etiquettes and guidelines, some of which have been touched upon by the author in this treatise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Excerpts from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The supportive sciences, or what some scholars commonly call ‘The applied sciences’, such as the Arabic Language, the Science of Eloquence, the Science of Principles, Hadeeth Terminology, and the Sciences of the Qur’aan – a student of knowledge should acquire from these that which will enable him to actualize the primary objective, which is to properly worship Allaah – the reason for which we were created. And if this is not the case, then it falls under the realm of being from the extravagant forms of knowledge, and Allaah knows best. So it is not required from a student of knowledge studying Grammar that he becomes like Seebawaih, nor from one studying the Arabic Language that he becomes like Al-Khaleel and Al-Azharee, nor from one studying the Science of Eloquence that he becomes like Al-Jirjaanee!! Rather, it is sufficient for him to only learn from all of that what he needs to properly understand the Book and the Sunnah and to implement what Allaah has obligated upon him from worship.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Devil enters into the hearts of some people desiring to turn them away from knowledge based on the argument that one should leave off seeking knowledge until he first purifies his intention. This is a plot, scheme and deception of the Devil. Rather, it is upon a Muslim to continue and persevere in his search for knowledge, and to constantly re-evaluate his intention, as Sufyaan Ath-Thawree said: ‘I did not try to rectify anything that was more difficult upon me than my intention.’ And this is Sufyaan we are talking about, so it applies even more so for those other than him!! Therefore, one should not make this into something that diverts him away from seeking knowledge.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Disregarding the ahaadeeth and narrations of the Salaf while relying on just the language and intellect to understand the Qur’aan and Hadeeth is a method that has been embarked upon in recent times by the Orientalists. So when they need to research a narration, they simply quote from the books of Al-Jaahidh or from the book al-Aghaanee or from al-‘Aqd-ul-Fareed. And if quoting becomes hard on them, they just say: ‘This conforms to the intellect!’ Contrary to this, a Muslim who follows what the Prophet and his Companions were upon confines his comprehension and understanding of the Glorious Qur’aan and Prophetic Sunnah to conform to the understanding of the Companions, may Allaah be pleased with them, and doesn’t leave from their fold.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullaah ibn Mas&#8217;ood <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> relates that the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> would supplicate:<i> &#8220;O Allaah! I ask You for guidance, piety, safety and well-being, and contentment and sufficiency.&#8221;</i> [<b><i>Allaahumma innee as&#8217;alukal-hudaa wat-tuqaa wal-&#8216;afaafa wal-ghinaa</i></b>].1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam as-Sa&#8217;dee (d.1376H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <i>du&#8217;aa</i> (supplication) is from the most comprehensive and beneficial <i>du&#8217;aas</i> (supplications), since it includes asking Allaah for well-being with regards to both the Religion and the world. Thus, <i>al-hudaa</i> (the guidance) is beneficial knowledge, and <i>at-tuqaa </i>(i.e. <i>taqwaa</i> or piety) is righteous actions and leaving-off what Allaah and His Messenger have forbidden; and this is (asking) for correctness and well-being of a person&#8217;s Religion. For indeed, the Religion comprises of beneficial knowledge and recognising the truth &#8211; which is guidance &#8211; and standing firm upon obedience to Allaah and His Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> &#8211; and this is piety.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <i>al-&#8216;afaafa</i> (well-being and safety) and <i>al-ghinaa</i> (contentment and sufficiency) comprises of being safe from (the harms of) the creation and that the heart is not attached to them. And it also comprises of being contented with Allaah and what He provides, and seeking whatever will cause the heart to be satisfied with Him. So with this, happiness in this worldly life is completed, and the heart tastes true sweetness and delight &#8211; and this is a goodly life. So whosoever is granted the provisions of guidance, Piety. well-being and contentment has indeed achieved true happiness, and has acquired all that could be possibly sought after, as well as being saved from all that is dreadful and frightening.&#8221;2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>KNOWLEDGE AND HUMILITY</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam adh-Dhahabee (d.748H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whosoever seeks knowledge for actions, then his knowledge makes him humble and fearful, and causes him to weep at (the deficiencies in) himself. But whosoever seeks knowledge for the sake of merely teaching, giving verdicts, in order to brag, or to show-off; becomes foolish, arrogant and looks down in contempt at the people, and is destroyed by pride, and the people hate him. <b>&#8220;Truly he succeeds who purifies his soul, and he fails who corrupts it.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ash-Shams 99:4-5]. Meaning that it is corrupted with sin and disobedience.&#8221;3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>REMEMBERING THE GUIDANCE</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Qaadee &#8216;Iyaadh (d.591H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; relates: &#8220;Mu&#8217;sab ibn &#8216;Abdullaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Imaam Maalik (d.179H) would mention the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, his colour would change and he would have to lean down, and those in his gathering would feel disturbed. So one day, on being asked about this, he said: If you had seen what I have seen, you would not have rejected what you had seen. I have seen Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir (d.130H) &#8211; and he was the leader of the Reciters &#8211; that he would never be asked about a <i>hadeeth</i> (Prophetic narration), except that he would weep, until we had mercy upon him. And I have seen Ja&#8217;far ibn Muhammad (d.148H) who used to smile alot. Yet whenever the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was mentioned to him, he would turn pale. I have never seen him narrating the <i>hadeeth</i> of the Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, except in a state of purification. And when times deteriorated, I never saw him except in one of three conditions: Either Praying, observing silence, or reciting the Qur&#8217;aan. He never uttered a word having no significance, and he was one of the Scholars and worshippers who had great fear of Allaah. Whenever &#8216;Abdur-Rahmaan ibn al-Qaasim (d.126H) mentioned the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, he turned pale, as if the blood had been drained from his face, and his tongue dried-up due to reverence for Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. I went to &#8216;Aamir ibn &#8216;Abdullaah ibn az-Zubayr (d.123H), and whenever the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was mentioned to him, he would weep so much, until he was unable to weep any longer. I saw az-Zuhree (d.124H) &#8211; and he was from the kindest of people, and closest to them &#8211; that when the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was mentioned to him, he would not be able to recognise you, nor would you be able to recognise him. I came to Safwaan ibn Sulaym (d.132H) &#8211; and he was one of the <i>mujtahid</i> Scholars and worshippers &#8211; that whenever he mentioned the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> he would weep, and he would not stop weeping, to the extent that the people would have to get up and leave him.&#8221;4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is from the likes of such weeping souls that we have inherited the knowledge of our Religion!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Student of Knowledge &amp; Books</strong><br />
<strong>طالب العلم والكتب</strong></p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Sālih bin Abdul-Azīz Āl us-Shaykh</strong><br />
<strong>الشيخ صالح بن عبد العزيز آل الشيخ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing &#8211; </span>Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a small on-line booklet called: <b><i>“Taalib-ul-‘Ilm wal-Kutub”</i></b> [The Student of Knowledge and Books] which was originally a lecture delivered by Shaikh Saalih bin ‘Abdil-‘Azeez Aali Shaikh in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and transcribed by a student of knowledge then made available for free on the internet in Arabic. The source used for this translation was the one found in <a href="http://www.sahab.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.sahab.org</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this book, the Shaikh discusses seven etiquettes that a Muslim, and in particular a student of knowledge, should abide by with regard to books. The author has done an excellent job in explaining these general guidelines and points.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed this treatise comes at a crucial time since as the English speaking Muslims in the West increase so does the printed literature that they acquire to learn the fundamentals of their Religion, not to mention those who are able to read and collect books in Arabic. Therefore, such a discussion is necessary to provide guidance and advice on how to acquire, handle, preserve and use these religious books, which are being produced at an ever-increasing rate in recent times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is hoped that this e-book in conjunction with the recently launch Classical Knowledge Series publications will provide the English readers with a solid basis on the basics and principles of knowledge in terms of seeking it, acquiring it, teaching it and propagating it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Excerpts from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It is well known that knowledge is acquired via two methods – either, <b><i>orally by way of hearing</i></b> and sitting with the people of knowledge and taking knowledge from them through listening with one’s ears or <b><i>by way of books</i></b>, and that is through researching, investigating and studying. The first way is the same method as the second way, whereas the correctness of the second method is based on the first. This is as one of the scholars said: ‘Knowledge used to be in the breasts of men then it transferred into the interior of books. However, its keys remained in the hands of men.’ This means that books possess a high level of importance to the student of knowledge. However, the only ones that can properly deal with these books and correctly understand them are those who establish themselves on the path of studying at the hands of the people of knowledge, mixing with them and comprehending what they meant by the words they recorded in these books.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So the first etiquette with regard to books is that one must organize his books in a good manner. Maintaining one’s library in order is an indication of a student of knowledge’s regard for his books. However, if you visit and are granted access to a person’s library and find that his books are scattered around, in disorder and so on, this is due to ether one of two possibilities. The books are this way either because (1) the person researches his books a lot and needs to refer to them, thus causing his books to be scattered about – and even though this is something praiseworthy he should still put them back in their proper places afterward – or (2) he does not organize his books at all to begin with.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is one of the important etiquettes with regard to books – that you not turn them into storage bins such as by placing pens inside them or treating them like repositories for money and currency. So if you were to open up a book you would find all of these things inside them and notice that the book’s binding has become worn and that the book has changed and so on due to the book not being preserved properly. A book should also not be turned into a bouquet, i.e. it should not be folded in an inappropriate manner, since a book contains the words of Allaah and the words of the Messenger of Allaah. So it is not proper to treat a book in this manner.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Also from the etiquettes related to books is that one should make an effort to care for and reinforce their outer and inner parts as well as to keep them clean so that the books can be in a presentable condition that is befitting for others besides you. This is since when a student of knowledge buys a book, he must have or should we say it’s preferred for him to have two types of intentions. The first is that he should intend to benefit from it in order to free himself from ignorance. And secondly, he should intend that others benefit from the book as well – such as either his wife or his children. Afterward, the books can either remain with that person (in his family) or they can be donated after him. Or perhaps one can give them away to someone as a gift or sell them, and so on and so forth.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Question</strong>:We would like some advice about the books which the seeker of Islamic knowledge should obtain, study and refer to</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p>Shaykh Ibn &#8216;Uthaymeen (rahimahullaah)</p>
<p>Praise be to Allaah.</p>
<ol>
<li>‘Aqeedah (basic tenets of faith):
<ul>
<li>Shaykh al-Islam Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab (may Allaah have mercy on him).
<ul>
<li>Thalaathat al-Usool &#8211; The Three Fundamental Bases of Islamic Theology (pdf)</li>
<li>Al-Qawaa’id al-Arba’ah &#8211; Four Principles of Tawheed (pdf)</li>
<li>Kashf al-Shubahaat &#8211; Removal of Doubts ( pdf )</li>
<li>Al-Tawheed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah.
<ul>
<li>Al-‘Aqeedah al-Waasitiyyah (Principles of Islamic Faith ) which deals with Tawheed al-Asmaa’ wa’l-Sifaat
<ul>
<li>This is one of the best books written on this topic, and it is worth reading and studying.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Al-Hamawiyyah</li>
<li>Al-Tadmuriyyah &#8211; These two books are more comprehensive than al-Waasitiyyah</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Al-Tahhaawiyyah
<ul>
<li>Al-‘Aqeedah al-Tahhaawiyyah, by Shaykh Abu Ja’far Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Tahhaawi</li>
<li>Sharh al-‘Aqeedah al-Tahhaawiyyah by Abu’l-Hasan ‘Ali ibn Abi’l-‘Izz</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Al-Durar al-Saniyyah fi’l-Ajoobah al-Najdiyyah, compiled by Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Qaasim</li>
<li>Al-Durrah al-Madiyyah fi ‘Aqeedah al-Firqah al-Mardiyyah by Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Safaareeni al-Hanbali. &#8211;
<ul>
<li>This book contains some general statements which go against the madhhab of the salaf, such as his saying, “Our Lord is not an essence or an attribute or a physical entity, exalted be He.” Therefore the seeker of knowledge has to study it with a shaykh who is well versed in the ‘aqeedah of the salaf, so that he can explain the general statements in it that go against the ‘aqeedah of the righteous salaf.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hadeeth
<ul>
<li>Fath al-Baari Sharh Saheeh al-Bukhaari, by Ibn Hajar al-‘Asqallaani</li>
<li>Subul al-Salaam Sharh Buloogh al-Maraam, by al-San’aani,
<ul>
<li>his book combines between hadeeth and fiqh.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nayl al-Awtaar Sharh Muntaqaa al-Akhbaar by al-Shawkaani</li>
<li>‘Umdat al-Ahkaam by al-Maqdisi.
<ul>
<li>This is an abridged book; most of its ahaadeeth are narrated in al-Saheehayn so their authenticity does not need to be researched.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Al-Arba’een al-Nawawiyyah, by Abu Zakariyya al-Nawawi.
<ul>
<li>This is a good book because it includes etiquette and a good methodology, and important basic principles, such as the hadeeth, “Part of a person’s being a good Muslim is his leaving alone that which does not concern him.” (Narrated by Imaam Ahmad, 1 – 201; al-Tirmidhi, 2318; classed as hasan by al-Nawawi in Riyaadh al-Saaliheen, 73; classed as saheeh by Ahmad Shaakir in al-Musnad, 1737). This principle – if one made it the path upon which one walks – would be sufficient.</li>
<li>Another principle is given concerning when one should speak, “Whoever believes in Allaah and the Last Day, let him say something good or else<br />
remain silent.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, Kitaab al-Adab; Muslim, Kitaab al-Luqtah, Baab al-Diyaafah).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Buloogh al-Maraam, by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar al-‘Asqallaani.
<ul>
<li>This is a very useful book, especially because it mentions the narrators, and quoted the opinions of others scholars, who said whose hadeeth is saheeh and whose is da’eef, and he comments on the hadeeth to say whether they are saheeh or da’eef.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nukhbat al-Fikr by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar al-‘Asqallaani.
<ul>
<li>This is considered to be a comprehensive work. If the seeker of knowledge understands it completely then he will have no need of many other books of mustalah (the science of hadeeth). Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) has a useful way of writing, which involves examining every issue in depth and categorizing the topics he discusses. If the seeker of knowledge reads it he will find it stimulating, because it is based on making one think. I say: it is good for the seeker of knowledge to memorize it because it is a useful summary of the science of mustalah (science of hadeeth).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Six Books (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, Sahih Muslim, al-Nasaa’i, Abu Dawood, Ibn Maajah and Tirmidhi).
<ul>
<li>I advise the seeker of knowledge to read them often, because that will serve two purposes: reviewing the main sources of Islam and reviewing the names of hadeeth narrators. If you often review the names of hadeeth narrators, then whenever you come across the name of one of the narrators of al-Bukhaari in any isnaad, you will know that this is one of the narrators of al-Bukhaari, so you will benefit from this knowledge of hadeeth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Books of fiqh
<ul>
<li>Aadaab al-mashiy ila’l-Salaah by Shaykh al-Islam Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab</li>
<li>Zaad al-Mustaqni’ fi Ikhtisaar al-Muqni’ by al-Hajjaawi.
<ul>
<li>This is one of the best texts of fiqh. It is a blessed book, brief and comprehensive. Our shaykh, ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa’di (may Allaah have mercy on him) told us to memorize it, even though he had memorized the text of Daleel al-Taalib.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Al-Rawd al-Murbi’ Sharh Zaad al-Mustaqni’ by Shaykh Mansoor al-Bahooti</li>
<li>‘Umdat al-Fiqh by Ibn Qudaamah</li>
<li>Al-Usool min ‘Ilm al-Usool.
<ul>
<li>This is an abridged book which serves as an introduction for the seeker of knowledge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Faraa’id (laws of inheritance)
<ul>
<li>Matn al-Rahbiyyah by al-Rahbi</li>
<li>Matn al-Burhaaniyyah by Muhammad al-Burhaani.</li>
<li>This is a useful and comprehensive abridged book dealing with all the laws of inheritance. I think that al-Burhaaniyyah is more comprehensive than al-Rahbiyyah in some ways, and it gives more information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tafseer
<ul>
<li>Tafseer al-Qur’aan al-‘Azeem by Ibn Katheer
<ul>
<li>This book is good for tafseer based on reports and it is useful and trustworthy. But it does pay much attention to matters of grammar and style.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tayseer al-Kareem al-Rahmaan fi Tafseer Kalaam al-Mannaan by Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa’di
<ul>
<li>This is a good, easy and trustworthy book, and I recommend it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Muqaddimah Shaykh al-Islam fi’l-Tafseer.
<ul>
<li>This is an important introduction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adwaa’ al-Bayaan by al-‘Allaamah Muhammad al-Shanqeeti
<ul>
<li>This is a comprehensive book covering hadeeth, fiqh, tafseer and usool al-fiqh.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>General books on some subjects:
<ul>
<li>On (Arabic) grammar: &#8211;
<ul>
<li>Matn al-Ajroomiyyah. This is an abridged book.</li>
<li>Alfiyyah Ibn Maalik; this is a summary of the science of grammar.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On Seerah (Prophet’s biography)
<ul>
<li>Zaad al-Ma’aad by Ibn al-Qayyim &#8211;
<ul>
<li>The best book that I have seen. This is a very useful book in which he mentions the biography of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) from all angels, then he discusses many rulings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rawdat al-‘Uqalaa’ by Ibn Hibbaan al-Busti
<ul>
<li>This is a useful book despite its brevity. He compiled a large amount of useful material and stories of the scholars, muhadditheen and others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Siyar A’laam al-Nubalaa’ by al-Dhahabi.
<ul>
<li>This book is very useful and the seeker of knowledge should read and refer to it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">Certainly there has appeared between the students of knowledge during this time, the taking of knowledge from those young in age. This phenomenon in reality is a cancerous disease and a chronic illness and it hinders the student of knowledge from his intent and turns him away the sound path that will connect him to knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is because taking knowledge from those who are young in age; those who did not firmly establish their feet in knowledge, their beards did not become grey within it (they did not spend a long time with seeking knowledge) along with the presence of those older than them in age, whose feet are grounded, because of this the foundation of the beginner is weak. He is prevented from the benefit of the experience of the major scholars and attainment of their manners which is established by knowledge and time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the evidences that give reason to this is the athar of Ibn Mas&#8217;ud (may Allaah be pleased with him) when he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;The people will not cease to be upon good as long as they take knowledge from their elders, their trusted and their scholars. If they (begin) taking knowledge from their sighaar and evil ones, then they are destroyed&#8221; </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is the affirmed Hadeeth on the authority of Abi Umayyah al Jamhee, that the Messenger of Allaah ملس و هيلع الله ىلص said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;From the signs of the hour is when knowledge sought from al-asaagheer&#8221; </span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people have differed in relation to the explanation of the word: &#8220;as-sighaar&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is some speech which Ibn Abdul Barr (may Allaah have Mercy on him) mentioned in al-Jaami&#8217; and ash-shatibi (may Allaah have Mercy on him) mentioned in al-i&#8217;tisaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qutaybah (may Allaah have mercy on him) took the view that <span style="color:#0000ff;">as-sighaar are those who are young in age</span>. And he said regarding the athar of Ibn Mas&#8217;ud:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;He intended that the people will not cease to be upon good as long as their scholars are mashaayakh (old) and that their scholars are not young (in age), because the shaykh (elderly) has left the pleasure of youth, his temper, his hastiness, his foolishness and he prefers practice and experience and nothing doubtful enters into his knowledge, his desires do not overcome him and he is not tempted by lust or greed. Shaytan does not cause him to fall (but) causes the young to. The one with age has dignity, honor and prestige.” </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The young maybe will enter into some of these affairs that the elderly is safe from. If these affairs enter into him and he makes a ruling (then) he is destroyed and destroys others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn abdul Barr reported that Umar Ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;I knew when the uprightness of the people (was present) and when they became corrupted. When (an issue) of fiqh came from the young (in age) the elderly turned away from following them. And when (an issue) of fiqh came from the elderly; the young followed them and they were both guided.” </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abdul Barr also reported on the authority of Aboo Ahwas from Abdullah who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;Certainly you will always remain upon good as long as knowledge is found in your elderly and when knowledge is found in your young, the young will make the elderly appear foolish.&#8221; </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In these two Athars are proofs for not taking knowledge from the young. Another besides which Ibn Qutaybah mentioned and it was fear of accepting knowledge if it came from the youth. At any rate, if its wording; as-sagheer is general (then) it is used in a way perceived and meaning (young in age).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This ruling is not without exception regarding the young in age, since a group from amongst the companions and taabi’een used to give fataawa and teach during their youth in the presence of those old in age. Certainly it is rare to find the likes of these individual so what about anyone after them. If they (the young) were present and their uprightness was known and their knowledge was examined and its firmness was apparent and no one from amongst the elders were found, then whatever knowledge they (the young) had with them was taken and safe from fitnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hajjaaj bin Ar-Taah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“The people use to dislike that a man speak until grey was seen in his beard.” </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The intent is not that knowledge of the young should be abandoned in the presence of the old; no! The intent is only to put people in their proper places.</strong> </span>So the right of the intelligent young student is that he is benefited from in research, giving reminders and studies. As for putting him forward for giving rulings and questions being put forward to him the no! Certainly no! Because this will kill him and this is a fitna and deception.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fudayl ibn Iyaad said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“If you see a man gathering the people around him, then I say this (person) is crazy. What person gathers the people around him and does not like that they make good his speech” </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“It has reached me that the scholars of the past when they learned they acted, and when they acted they became busy,When they became busy they became lost (missing) and when they became lost they were sought (after) and when they were sought they fled &#8220;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So O seeker of knowledge if you desire knowledge from its source (fountain) then, here are the major scholars, those whose beards have become grey and bodies have become frail and strength have become weak (being exhausted) in knowledge and learning. Their commitments are before their lost and they bring out their treasures before they pass away (along) with them. (As) in the darkness of the night the Badr (moon) passes away.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>A point of attention: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>During these times the standards have been greatly blemished by the common people regarding properly estimating the scholars. So every individual who can give an eloquent speech, or a meaningful lecture, or a Friday sermon haphazardly becomes a scholar. He then becomes someone returned to for rulings and knowledge is taken from him. This is a painful and apparent affliction which its evil is airborne and it harms is circulated. When the connection of knowledge is (connected) to other than its people and when the affair (are in the hands) of other than its people, then look for the hour (Day of Judgment)</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the student must be warned of taking knowledge from these (types). Except if they are known to be from people who possess knowledge. Not everyone who has good expression is a scholar and not everyone who turns the people’s faces towards him with issues regarding the leaders of the Muslims or the mentioning of the death rate of aids and whatever is similarly to that is a scholar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Also) the meaning is not what has proceeded – as some understand it- ex. Not listening to them (the young in age) or not benefitting from their talks, No! The intent is only taking legislative knowledge from them and not raising them to the levels of the scholars and Allaah is the One Who gives success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><b>بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم</b></p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-2CK" target="_blank"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>At the Doorstep of Knowledge</b></span></a></p>
<p> It is reported from ‘Abdullâh b. ‘Abbâs – Allâh be pleased with them – that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After Allâh’s Messenger – Allâh’s peace and blessings be upon him – passed away, I said to a man from the Ansâr, <b>“Come, let us ask [and learn from] the Prophet’s Companions, Allâh’s peace and blessings be upon him, for they are many in number today.”</b> He replied, <b>“I am surprised at you Ibn ‘Abbâs – do you really think people need you when there are so many Companions of the Prophet – Allâh’s peace and blessings be upon him?”</b> So he did not involve himself in this endeavor, but I busied myself asking [the Companions about issues]. If I heard of a hadîth being reported by a man, I would come to him and if he was taking his midday nap I would lay down my garment and lie outside waiting for him, with  the wind blowing dust in my face. The man would come out [for Dhuhr] and see me in that state, and he would exclaim, <b>“O nephew of Allâh’s Messenger! What has brought you here? You should have sent for me and I would have come to you!”</b> I would say, <b>“Rather I should come to you [to seek knowledge].”</b> I would then ask him about the hadîth I heard. The man [who I originally invited to seek knowledge with me] remained as he was, and when he saw how people would gather around me [to seek knowledge] he said, <b>“For sure, this young man was more intelligent than me.”</b><b> [Al-Dârimî, Al-Sunan Vol. 2 p129.]</b></p>
