<h2 style="text-align:center;">(<span style="color:#993300;">وَاعْبُدْ رَبَّكَ حَتَّى يَأْتِيَكَ الْيَقِينُ</span> )</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">(<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And worship your Lord until the certainty comes to you</strong></span>) (15: 99)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari said: &#8220;Salim said, (This means) death.&#8221;&#8217; This Salim is Salim bin Abdullah bin Umar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jarir also recorded from Salim bin Abdullah, (وَاعْبُدْ رَبَّكَ حَتَّى يَأْتِيَكَ الْيَقِينُ ) (And worship your Lord until the Yaqin comes to you.) He said, &#8220;Death.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported in the Sahih from Umm Al-Ala&#8217;- one of the women of the Ansar &#8211; that when the Messenger of Allah entered upon Uthman bin Mazun after he had died, Umm Al-Ala&#8217; said, &#8220;<em>May the mercy of Allah be upon you, Abu As-Saib. My testimony over you is that Allah has honored you</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>«وَمَا يُدْرِيكَ أَنَّ اللهَ أَكْرَمَهُ؟»</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(How do you know that Allah has honored him)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8220;<em>May my father and mother be sacrificed for you, O Messenger of Allah! If not him, then who else</em>&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said,</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">«أَمَّا هُوَ فَقَدْ جَاءَهُ الْيَقِينُ، وَإِنِّي لَأَرْجُو لَهُ الْخَيْر»</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(As far as he is concerned, the death has come to him, and I hope for good for him.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is evidence that the meaning of this Ayah, (وَاعْبُدْ رَبَّكَ حَتَّى يَأْتِيَكَ الْيَقِينُ ) (And worship your Lord until the certainty comes to you.) is that acts of worship, such as prayer and the like, are obligatory on man so long as his mind is sound, so he should pray according to his best ability.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was reported in Sahih Al-Bukhari from Imran bin Husayn that the Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#000000;">صَلِّ قَائِمًا، فَإِنْ لَمْ تَسْتَطِعْ فَقَاعِدًا، فَإِنْ لَمْ تَسْتَطِعْ فَعَلَى جَنْب</span>»</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>Pray standing, and if you cannot, then sitting, and if you cannot, then on your side</strong>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">From this we may understand that it is a mistake to interpret <em>Yaqin</em> (the certainty) as <em>Marifah</em> (&#8220;spiritual knowing&#8221;) as some of the <strong>Sufis</strong> do. According to them, when one of them attains the level of <em>Marifah</em>, they consider him to be free of these obligations. This is disbelief, misguidance and ignorance. The Prophets &#8211; peace be upon them &#8211; and their companions, were the most knowledgeable of people about Allah, about His rights, His attributes, and the glorification that He deserves. But at the same time, they were the people who worshipped Him the most, continuing in good deeds until the time they died. Therefore, what is meant by <em>Yaqin</em> here is death, as we have stated above. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To Allah be praise and thanks. Praise be to Allah for His guidance. It is to Him that we turn for help and it is in Him that we put our trust. He is the One Whom we ask to help us to reach the best of circumstances, for He is the Most Generous and Kind.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Chapter 7: The Soul Inclines Towards Evil</strong></span></p>
<p>The saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ النَّفْسَ لَأَمَّارَةٌ بِالسُّوءِ إِلَّا مَا رَحِمَ رَبِّي</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, the </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(human)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> self is inclined to evil, except when my Lord bestows His Mercy </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(upon whom He wills)</span>. &gt;&gt; [Yusuf: 53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is evidence for the description of the essence of the soul &#8211; it does not leave this description of inclining towards evil except with Allaah’s mercy and concern from Him, because the soul is <strong>oppressive</strong> and <strong>ignorant</strong>. Nothing comes from oppression and ignorance except every evil. Therefore, if Allaah has mercy on His slave and blesses him with <strong>beneficial knowledge</strong> and makes him follow a <strong>path of justice</strong> in his manners and his actions, then his soul loses this description, finds tranquility in the obedience of Allaah and His remembrance and does not command its companion except to do good, and this leads to the grace of Allaah and His reward. Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيَّتُهَا النَّفْسُ الْمُطْمَئِنَّةُ  ارْجِعِي إِلَىٰ رَبِّكِ رَاضِيَةً مَّرْضِيَّةً  فَادْخُلِي فِي عِبَادِي  وَادْخُلِي جَنَّتِي</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;">(It will be said to the pious)<strong>: ‘O </strong>(you) <strong>the one in </strong>(complete) <strong>rest and satisfaction! ‘Come back to your Lord, Well-pleased </strong>(yourself)<strong> and well-pleasing unto Him! ‘Enter you, then, among My honoured slaves, &#8220;And enter you My Paradise!’</strong></span>&gt;&gt; [Fajr: 27-30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is upon the slave of Allaah to work on himself to rectify his soul, and to take this despised characteristic out of it, which is that the soul inclines towards evil. This is done by striving and having the best of manners, asking Allaah to be continuous upon that and repeating the following narrated supplication plentifully:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">‘<strong>O Allaah guide me to the best of actions and manners, no-one guides to the best of them except You, and turn me away from evil actions and evil manners no-one can turn me away from their evil except You.</strong>’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Muslim &amp; Tirmidhi]</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[PS: Arabic version of the above supplication is added below by AbdurRahman.Org for memorization of this important supplication]</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>اللَّهُمَّ اهْدِنِي لِأَحْسَنِ الْأَعْمَالِ وَأَحْسَنِ الْأَخْلَاقِ لَا يَهْدِي لِأَحْسَنِهَا إِلَّا أَنْتَ</strong></span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> وَقِنِي سَيِّئَ الْأَعْمَالِ وَسَيِّئَ الْأَخْلَاقِ لَا يَقِي سَيِّئَهَا إِلَّا أَنْتَ</strong></span></h2>

<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Fourth Treatise: The Three Fundamental Principles Which it is Obligatory to Have Knowledge of.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First Fundamental Principle: Knowledge and Awareness of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَإِذَا قِيلَ لَكَ مَا هي الأُصُولُ الثلاثةُ التي تجبُ معرفتُها؟ فقُلْ معرِفةُ العبدِ رَبَّهُ، ودينَهُ، ونبيَّهُ محمدًا صلى الله عليه وسلم</span><strong> </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>So if it is said to you, “What are the three fundamental principles which must be known?”, then say, “The servant’s knowledge of his Lord, and his Religion, and his Prophet Muhammad</strong> <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>.</span> <strong><sup>1</sup> </strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong>[1]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong><em>al-U<u>s</u>ool </em>(fundamental principles)</strong>”, this is the plural of <em>a<u>s</u>l </em>which is that which something else is built upon. And the word <em>far’ </em>(branch or detail) is that which is built upon something else. Therefore these (matters) are called <em>u<u>s</u>ool </em>because other matters from the religion are built upon them. Therefore they are called <em>u<u>s</u>ool </em>because the matter of the religion is built upon them. And the whole of the religion pivots upon these three fundamentals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#000000;">معرِفةُ العبدِ رَبَّهُ </span>“The servant’s knowledge of his Lord”</strong>: <em>Rabbahu </em>(his Lord) is in the accusative case because it is the object of <em>ma’rifah </em>(knowledge) because the verbal noun <em>ma’rifah </em>(knowledge) is attached to the active particle <em>‘abd </em>(servant). And the verbal noun, if attached to something, acts in the manner of its verb according to the scholars of the Arabic grammar. So the verbal noun here is attached and acts in the manner of the verb.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And his Religion and his Prophet”</strong>: This is joined – meaning: to the <em>man<u>s</u>oob </em>(accusative). These are the fundamentals of the religion in general, and their details will follow in the speech of the Shaykh <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah </em>if Allaah wishes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why are these three fundamental principles specifically mentioned? Because they are the foundations of the religion of Islaam and because they are the matters about which the servant will be asked when he is placed in his grave. (This is) because the servant when he is placed in his grave and earth has been laid over him and the people have departed from him returning to their families, then two angels will come to him in the grave and his soul will be returned to his body and he will be given the life of the <em>barzakh</em> (transitional period between this life and the Hereafter); it is not a life like the life of this world. It is a life which Allaah knows best about. So they will make him sit up in his grave and they will say to him, “Who is your Lord and what is your religion and who is your prophet?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the believer will say, “My Lord is Allaah and my religion is Islaam and Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> is my prophet.” So it will be said to him, “How did you know that?” So he will say, “I read the Book of Allaah so I understood it and I knew.” So then a caller will call out, “My servant has spoken the Truth.” So they will lay out for him a bed from Paradise and there will open for him a door to Paradise and his grave will be extended for him as far as the eye can see and the fragrance of Paradise and its gentle breeze will come upon him. So he will look to his living place in Paradise and he will say, “O my Lord, establish the Hour so that I can return to my family and my wealth.”<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the doubter who lived upon misgivings and doubt and lack of certainty even if he claimed to be upon Islaam, if he had doubts and misgivings about the Religion of Allaah like the <em>munaafiq </em>(hypocrite) he will stutter. So when they say to him, “Who is your Lord?” He will say, “I don’t know.” And when they say, “What is your Religion?” He will say, “I don’t know.” And when it is said: “Who is your Prophet?” He will say, “I don’t know. Haah, haah, I don’t know, I heard the people saying something so I said it.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by al Bukhaaree in abridged from the <u>h</u>adeeth of Anas (1338) and Muslim (2870).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: that in the <em>dunyaa </em>(world) he would just say whatever the people said, without having <em>eemaan </em> &#8211; and Allaah’s refuge is sought. This hypocrite who outwardly displayed Islaam, whilst he did not believe it in his heart; rather he outwardly showed it to gain worldly benefits, so he said in the world, “My Lord is Allaah”, but he did not truly believe it; his heart denied it, and Allaah’s refuge is sought. He used to say, “My religion is Islaam”, but he did not have <em>eemaan </em>in Islaam; his heart denied it! He used to say, “My prophet is Mu<u>h</u>ammad<em> <u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>”, but he did not truly believe in the messengership of Mu<u>h</u>ammad in his heart! Rather he said it upon his tongue only  &#8211; this is the <em>munaafiq </em>(hypocrite). So it will be said to him: “You did not know and you did not read!” So he will be struck with an iron sledgehammer which will cause him to scream in such a manner that if men and jinn were to hear it, they would drop down dead. It will be heard by everything except for mankind; if he were to hear it he would drop down dead – meaning, he would die from terror. He will be crushed in his grave until his ribs cross over and a gate to the Fire will be opened for him and its fierce and poisonous wind will come upon him and its heat. And he will say, “O my Lord, do not establish the Hour!” This will be his life and his condition in the grave &#8211; and Allaah’s refuge is sought – because he did not give the correct answer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore a caller will call out, “My servant has lied”. So they will lay out for him a bed from the Fire and they will open for him a door to the Fire  &#8211; and Allaah’s refuge is sought. So since these matters are this important it is obligatory upon us to learn them and to hold them as our creed and belief. And it is not sufficient just to learn them alone; rather we learn them and we hold them as our creed, and we have <em>eemaan </em>in them and we act upon them for as long as we live, hoping that Allaah makes us firm at the questioning in the grave. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يُثَبِّتُ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا بِالْقَوْلِ الثَّابِتِ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا وَفِي الْآخِرَةِ ۖ وَيُضِلُّ اللَّهُ الظَّالِمِينَ ۚ وَيَفْعَلُ اللَّهُ مَا يَشَاءُ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah makes firm those who truly believe with the firm saying in the life of this world and in the Hereafter. And Allaah misguides the disbelieving wrongdoers. And Allaah does whatever He wishes. </strong></span>[14:27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these three fundamental principles have tremendous importance, and therefore the Shaykh focused upon them in this treatise and he clarified them so that we should study them and carefully examine them and so that we should hold them as our creed and belief and act upon them hoping that Allaah should make us and you firm with the firm saying in the life of this world and in the Hereafter.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that there are three forms of address for the tidings that are given when one dies.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> It may be said, <em><span style="color:#800000;">“Receive good tidings O beloved one of Allaah, of Allaah’s pleasure and of Paradise”</span></em> or </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>it may be said, <span style="color:#800000;"><em>“Receive good tidings O servant of Allaah of Paradise on account of Islaam”</em></span> or </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>it may be said, <span style="color:#800000;"><em>“Receive tidings O enemy of Allaah, of Allaah’s anger and of the Fire.” </em></span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>This was the saying of Ibn Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>.</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The person who is dying whether he is a believer or a disbeliever, will be given tidings at the point of death. So, if he is a believer, he will be given good tidings of Allaah’s mercy and of Paradise. And if he is a disbeliever, he will be given tidings of Allaah’s anger and of the Fire. So, he will not actually die till he knows where he will be and it will not be possible for him to repent or to free himself or to increase in righteous deeds. This is what occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever loves to meet Allaah then Allaah will love to meet him.” So `A`ishah said, “Oh Messenger of Allaah, all of us dislike death.” Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said, “That is not the case, O `A`ishah but rather the believer at the point of death will be given good tidings and so therefore, he will love to meet Allaah and so Allaah will love to meet him. Whereas, the disbeliever will be given tidings of the Fire so therefore, he will hate the meeting with Allaah so Allaah will hate to meet him.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ قَالُوا رَبُّنَا اللَّهُ ثُمَّ اسْتَقَامُوا فَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Those who said, “Our Lord is Allaah” and then they remain upright then there will be no fear upon them nor shall they grieve.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Ahqaaf (46), <em>aayah</em> 13)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ قَالُوا رَبُّنَا اللَّهُ ثُمَّ اسْتَقَامُوا تَتَنَزَّلُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمَلَائِكَةُ أَلَّا تَخَافُوا وَلَا تَحْزَنُوا وَأَبْشِرُوا بِالْجَنَّةِ الَّتِي كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Those who said, “Our Lord is Allaah” then they remained upright then the angels will descend upon them saying, “Fear not and do not grieve and receive glad tidings of Paradise, which you were promised.”</span> </strong>(Soorah-Fussilat (41), <em>aayah</em> 30)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَلَوْ تَرَىٰ إِذْ يَتَوَفَّى الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا ۙ الْمَلَائِكَةُ يَضْرِبُونَ وُجُوهَهُمْ وَأَدْبَارَهُمْ وَذُوقُوا عَذَابَ الْحَرِيقِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And if you could see when the angels take the souls of the disbelievers striking their faces and their backs saying, “Taste the punishment of the Blazing Fire.”</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Anfaal (8), <em>aayah</em> 50)</p>

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong> The Explanation – Point [89]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And deeds will be in accordance with conclusions</strong>: So a person should not allow himself to be fooled by his own deeds, even if he is the most righteous of the righteous people. Rather, he should fear that he may have an evil end (conclusion). And judgment is not passed upon anyone that he is from the people of the Fire based upon his actions because the person does not know what he will be given as is concluding deeds. And this is clarified by a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, from a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Ibn Mas`ood (<em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em>, that the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إن أحدكم يجمع خلقه في بطن أمه أربعين يوماً نطفةً، ثم يكون علقة مثل ذلك، ثم يكون مضغةً مثل ذلك، ثم يرسل إليه الملك، فينفخ فيه الروح، ويؤمر بأربع كلمات‏:‏ بكتب رزقه، وأجله، وعمله، وشقي أو سعيد‏.‏ وإن أحدكم ليعمل بعمل أهل الجنة حتى ما يكون بينه وبينها إلا ذراع، فيسبق عليه الكتاب، فيعمل بعمل أهل النار فيدخلها، وإن أحدكم ليعمل بعلم أهل النار حتى ما يكون بينه وبينها إلا ذراع، فيعمل بعمل أهل الجنة فيدخلها‏</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“The creation of each one of you is brought together in his mother’s womb for forty days as a drop of fluid; then he becomes a clot for a similar period; then a piece of flesh for a similar period; and then the angel is sent to him and the soul is breathed into him.  And he (the angel) is commanded to write four things: to write his provision and his life span and his actions and whether he would be a wretched person (a person of the Hellfire) or a fortunate person (a person of Paradise). And one of you performs the actions of the people of Paradise until there is nothing between him and it except a cubit and then the writing overcomes him and he acts with the actions of the people of the Hellfire and so he enters it.  And one of you may act with the actions of the people of the Fire until there is nothing between him and it except for a cubit (a forearm’s span) and then he acts with the actions of the people of Paradise, and so he enters it.”</span></em> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, therefore, a person fears having an evil end (conclusion). And judgment of having an evil conclusion is not passed upon someone since the person does not know the conclusion that will be given to him, because <em>tawbah</em> (repentance) wipes away whatever came before it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Say to the unbelievers, “If they desist (from their unbelief), then whatever came before will be forgiven for them.”</span></em> (Sooratul-Anfaal (8), <em>aayah </em>38)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, actions are in accordance with their conclusions (that which is final from them).  However, from the subtle kindness of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, towards His servants, is that <strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">whoever lives upon good, then He gives him a good conclusion; and whoever lives upon evil, then He gives him an evil conclusion</span></strong>. So therefore, a person should act and apply the necessary means and should have good thoughts concerning Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And some people say, “<strong>I will repent before I die</strong>.” Then we say to him, “<strong>And do you know when you are going to die?</strong>” It is possible that you could die in a sudden moment such that you are not able to repent; and also, you do not know whether your repentance will be acceptable or not because repentance has conditions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Translator’s Side Point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) said in his notes to A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>a<u>h</u>aawiyyah with regard to this point: “This phrase is part of a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Sahl ibn Sa`ad as-Saa`idee, reported by A<u>h</u>mad and Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree.” He mentions that he has verified it in his checking of the book As-Sunnah of Ibn Abee `Aa<u>s</u>im. The wording of this <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> in Bu<u>kh</u>aaree (no. 6493) is part of a longer <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>; and the relevant wording here is that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إِنَّ الْعَبْدَ لَيَعْمَلُ فِيمَا يَرَى النَّاسُ عَمَلَ أَهْل الْجَنَّةِ، وَإِنَّهُ لَمِنْ أَهْلِ النَّارِ، وَيَعْمَلُ فِيمَا يَرَى النَّاسُ عَمَلَ أَهْل النَّارِ وَهْوَ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، وَإِنَّمَا الأَعْمَالُ بِخَوَاتِيمِهَا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“A servant may act with regard to what the people see with the actions of the people of Paradise, but in reality he is from the people of the Fire; and he may act with regard to what the people see with the actions of the people of the Fire, when he is actually from the people of Paradise. And indeed, actions are in accordance with their conclusions.”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In an earlier lesson, we mentioned that this was an explanation given by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Ibn `U<u>th</u>aymeen <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah,</em> to the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u> </em>of Ibn Mas`ood that we had before.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Explanation of the Creed of the Salaf</strong>,  by Imaam Abee Uthmaan Ismaa’eel bin Abdir-Rahmaan As-Saaboonee,<em>rahimahullaah</em>, as explained by our noble sheikh al-Allaamah Rabee’ bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee, <em>hafidhahullaah</em>.</p>
<p>Audio Lecture by: <strong>Abu Muhammad al Maghribee</strong> (<em>hafidhahullaah)</em></p>
<p><strong>[The below is the Text from the Book]</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Chapter 20: The Outcome of the Slaves is Unknown</strong></span></p>
<p>[115] The People of <em>Hadeeth</em> believe and testify that the end of the slave is unknown. No one knows what his end shall be. They (People of <em>Hadeeth</em>) do not pass judgement on a specific person that he will be from the people of Paradise or from the people of Hell, because that is something which is hidden from them. They do not know in which state a person will die, whether it is upon <em>Islaam</em> or unbelief, so due to this fact they say:</p>
<p>“Indeed we are Believers, if Allaah wills.”</p>
<p>That is, from those Believers who will have a good end, if Allaah wills [134]</p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;">[134] TRANSLATORS NOTE ~ The Prophet(صلى الله عليه وسلم), said:</span></p>
<p><em><span style="color:#008000;">Do not be delighted by the actions of anyone until you see how he ends up&#8221;.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;">Related by Ahmad [ 3:120,223 ] and lbn Abee ‘Aasim [ 393-395 ]. The isnaad is Saheeh.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Chapter 21: The Ruling Upon On One Who Died Upon Belief Or Unbelief</strong></span></p>
<p>[l16] And the People of <em>Hadeeth</em> witness for the one who dies upon <em>Islaam</em> that his end will be Paradise even if their fate was written by Allaah that they will be punished with the Fire for a period, as a result of their sins which they committed and did not repent from. They will eventually enter Paradise and no one from amongst the Muslims will remain in Hell eternally. This is a great blessing and favour from Allaah. If one dies upon unbelief, and Allaah’s protection is sought from this, he will be thrown into the Fire and he will not be saved from it, and he will stay there forever.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[3]</strong> <strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">There are some who say that if a hadeeth contradicts an ayah in the Qur’aan, it should be rejected no matter what level of authenticity it has. Then they use as an example the hadeeth: <strong>“Indeed the deceased person will be punished (in the grave) due to the crying of his family for him.”</strong>[10] They use the statement of ‘Aa’ishah in which she used Allaah’s saying to refute this hadeeth:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">وَلَا تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَى</span></strong><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another.”</strong> [Surah Faatir: 18]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">How do we respond to those who say this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[3] Answer</strong>: Rejecting this hadeeth falls under the issues related to rejecting the Sunnah by way of the Qur’aan. So this shows the deviation of this way of thinking.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the response to this hadeeth – and I am referring here particularly to those who adhere to the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah, then it is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>:<strong> From a hadeeth standpoint:</strong> There is no way to reject this hadeeth from a hadeeth standpoint due to two reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. It has been reported through an authentic chain of narration from Ibn ‘Umar radhi Allaahu anhu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Ibn ‘Umar radhi Allaahu anhu is not alone in reporting it, rather he was followed in that by ‘Umar bin Al- Khattaab radhi Allaahu anhu. Furthermore, he and his son are not alone in reporting it either, for they were also followed in that by Al-Mugheerah bin Shu’bah radhi Allaahu anhu. This is what comes to my mind at this time since the reports of all three of these Companions can be found in the two Saheeh Collections.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if a person were to conduct an exclusive research on this hadeeth, he would find other paths of narration for it. These three ahaadeeth all have authentic chains of narration so they cannot be rejected just based on the claim that they “contradict” the noble Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: <strong>From a tafseer standpoint:</strong> This is since the scholars have explained this hadeeth in two ways:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. This hadeeth only applies to a deceased person who knew during the course of his life that his family would commit oppositions to the Religion after his death and did not advise them. Nor he did direct them to not cry over him since this crying would serve as a means for his being punished in the grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The usage of the word <strong>“the”</strong> when referring to the <strong>“deceased person”</strong> is not allencompassing and inclusive. Meaning: The hadeeth does not mean that every deceased person will be punished due to the crying of his family members. Rather, the word “the” is for a specific designation, meaning it refers to only those who do not advise others to not commit what opposes the Religion after his death. So this is the type of person who will be punished by the crying of his family over him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who takes charge of advising his family and directing them with religious guidelines such as to not wail over him and to not commit the offenses that are done ,particularly in this era, then such a person will not be punished. But if he does not direct and advise (his family), he will be punished.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the detailed breakdown that we are required to understand from the first explanation, in accordance to the interpretation of many well known and famous scholars such as An-Nawawee and others. So when we come to comprehend this detailed breakdown, it becomes clear that there is in fact no contradiction between this hadeeth and Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">وَلاَ تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَى</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another.”</strong></span> [Surah Al-An’aam: 164]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A contradiction only becomes apparent if the word <strong>“the”</strong> in the word <strong>“the deceased person”</strong> is understood to be all-inclusive, meaning that it encompasses everyone who dies. This is where the hadeeth becomes obscure and contradicts the noble ayah in the Qur’aan. But if we comprehend the meaning of the hadeeth according to what was mentioned before, there would be no more contradictions or obscurities since we would understand that the one who is being punished (in the grave) is only like that because he failed to advise and direct his family members (before his death). This is the first manner in which this hadeeth has been interpreted in order to repel this so-called “contradiction.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. A second interpretation has been mentioned by Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah, may Allaah have mercy on him, in some of his writings. And it is that the punishment here does not refer to the punishment in the grave or the punishment in the Hereafter but rather, that it only refers to pain and sorrow. Meaning: When a deceased person hears the crying of his family for him, he will feel bad and sorrowful for their grief over him. This is what Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah said. If it is correct, it would eradicate the root of the misconception.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, I say: Such an explanation goes against two facts, which is why we can only rely on the first explanation of this hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First Fact:</strong> The report from Al-Mugheerah bin Shu’abah radhi Allaahu anhu that I indicated previously has an addition to it that clarifies that the punishment here does not refer to just pain and sorrow, but rather that it refers to actual punishment, i.e. punishment in the Hellfire, unless Allaah forgives him. This is clearly stated in Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">إِنَّ اللّهَ لاَ يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاء</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Verily, Allaah does not forgive that partners be associated with Him (in worship), but He forgives what is less than that to whom He wills.”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the narration of Al-Mugheerah radhi Allaahu anhu it states: <strong>“Indeed, the deceased person will be punished due to the crying of his family over him on the Day of Judgement.”</strong> So this clearly states that the deceased will be punished due to his family crying over him on the Day of Judgement and not in his grave, which is what Ibn Taimiyyah explained as meaning pain and sorrow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second Fact:</strong> When a person dies, he does not feel anything that goes on around him whether good or bad, as indicated by evidences in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, except in certain cases, which have been mentioned in some ahaadeeth either as a rule for every deceased person or for some only whom Allaah enables to hear some things that will cause them pain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So firstly there is the hadeeth reported by Al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh from Anas bin Maalik radhi Allaahu anhu in which he narrated that the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily, when a servant (of Allaah) is placed in his grave, and his companions depart from him – at the point where he can still hear their footsteps – two angels come to him.” </strong>[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This authentic hadeeth affirms a special type of hearing that a deceased person will have at the time he is buried and the people are walking away from him. Meaning: At the time that the two angels come to sit by him, his soul returns to his body and in this state of being, he is able to hear the footsteps (of his loved ones walking away).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the hadeeth does not mean on the outset that this deceased person and all deceased people will have their souls returned to them and that they will remain with the ability to hear the footsteps of the people passing by the graves up until the day that they will be resurrected. No.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a specific circumstance and a special type of hearing on the part of the deceased since his soul has returned to him. So if we were to go by the interpretation of Ibn Taimiyyah at this point, we would be forced to expand the senses of the deceased person to include everything that goes on around him whether at the time he is being transferred to his grave before his burial or after he is placed in his grave – meaning that he can hear his living family members crying over him. This requires a textual proof, which is missing. This is first.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>, some texts from the Qur’aan and the authentic Sunnah indicate that the deceased cannot hear. This is a huge topic and requires an in-depth discussion. However I will mention one hadeeth by which I will close the answer to this question. And it is the statement of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم in which he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily, Allaah has angels that roam throughout earth who convey to me the greetings (of Salaam) on behalf of my ummah.” </strong>[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is meant by <strong>“roam”</strong> is that they frequent gatherings. So every time a Muslim sends Salaat (praises) on the Prophet, there is an assigned angel that conveys this greeting from that Muslim to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم. So if the deceased could hear, the one with the most right from those deceased to hear would be our Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم due to Allaah’s favoring him and particularizing him with special qualities and attributes over all of the prophets, messengers, and rest of mankind. So if anyone had the ability to hear, it would surely be the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم. And furthermore, if the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم were able to hear anything after his death, he would hear the Salaat (praises) of his ummah) on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So here we come to understand the error, or the deviation, of those who ask assistance – not from the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم – but rather from those less than him, whether messengers, prophets or righteous people. This is since if they were to ask assistance from the Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم, he would not hear them as is clearly stated in the Qur’aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ اللّهِ عِبَادٌ أَمْثَالُكُمْ<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And those whom you call besides Allaah are servants (of Allaah) just like you.”</strong></span> [Surah Al-A’raaf: 194]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">إِن تَدْعُوهُمْ لَا يَسْمَعُوا دُعَاءآُمْ<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“If you supplicate to them, they cannot hear your supplication.”</strong></span> [Surah Faatir: 14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, after they die, the deceased cannot hear unless there is some text that applies to a particular situation – as I mentioned before – such as the deceased hearing the footsteps. This concludes the answer to this question.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jābir ( رضي الله عنه) said: Three days before he died, I heard the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) say</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">« لاَ يَمُوتَنَّ أَحَدُكُمْ إِلاَّ وَهُوَ يُحْسِنُ الظَّنَّ بِاللَّهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ »</h2>
<p>[11] <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>None of you should die except while he is having good thoughts about Allah</strong></span> (عزّ وجلّ)</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>al-Nawawī’s Explanation</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following is again from al-Nawawī’s explanation of Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the statement of the prophet » None of you should die except while he is having good thoughts about Allah « scholars have said that this is a warning against losing hope and despairing (of Allah’s mercy) and an encouragement to have hope especially at the time of death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) also said in the previous ḥadīth » “<strong>I am as my servant thinks of Me</strong>.” « and (considering both ḥadīth) scholars explain that » <strong>having good thoughts about Allah</strong> « means that an individual should expect Allah to have mercy on him and pardon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some scholars have also said that during times of wellbeing and health, an individual should have both hope and fear in Allah and these two feelings should be equally balanced. Others say that one’s fear should be more, but when the signs of death approach, a person’s hope in Allah’s mercy should become stronger. This is because the very purpose of having fear of Allah is to prevent oneself from committing sins and ugly deeds and to increase in obedience and good deeds. And those things are most often not possible during that situation (i.e., during the last moments of one’s death).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Instead, in that situation, assuming good thoughts about Allah is preferable which would cause one to have feelings of destitution and submission and to feel oneself in total need of Allah (تعالى).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ḥadīth mentioned by Imām Muslim right after this one also supports this understanding:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">« يُبْعَثُ كُلُّ عَبْدٍ عَلَى مَا مَاتَ عَلَيْهِ »</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Every servant will be resurrected according to what he died upon</strong>.[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Scholars explain that it means each individual will be resurrected in the same state in which he died. The next ḥadīth (in Imām Muslim’s authentic collection) also supports this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">« إِذَا أَرَادَ اللَّهُ بِقَوْمٍ عَذَابًا أَصَابَ الْعَذَابُ مَنْ كَانَ فِيهِمْ ثُمَّ بُعِثُوا عَلَى<br />
أَعْمَالِهِمْ.»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>When Allah intends to punish an entire group of people, the punishment afflicts them all, but then each is resurrected according to (his individual) deeds</strong></span>.[13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the ḥadīth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">« إِنَّمَا يُبْعَثُ النَّاسُ عَلَى نِيَّاتِهِمْ »</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>People will only be resurrected upon their (individual) intentions.</strong></span> [14]</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>al-Manāwī’s Explanation</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following explanation is from al-Manāwī’s, Fayḍ al-Qadīr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) statement » None of you should die except while he is having good thoughts about Allah « means: Let none of you die under any circumstance except while in the state of thinking good about Allah (تعالى) in that He will be merciful with you and pardon you. This is because when a person’s time of passing arrives and his journey comes to an end, his fear (of Allah) has no real purpose (to prevent him from bad deeds during life). It would perhaps lead him to despair and to a feeling of restriction of (Allah’s) mercy and bounties.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever at that time, even if his heart were laden with major sins, begins expecting the best (of his Lord) and increases in hope, he has then perfected his provisions for his arrival to his Lord…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Ṭībī said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) instructs one to ensure he does not die in any state other than expecting and assuming good about Allah. And this does not mean one can change destiny or fate. Rather, what is intended is that an individual is commanded to have good thoughts (about Allah) so that when death overcomes him, he is in such a state.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE RULING CONCERNING WISHING FOR DEATH DUE TO ENCOUNTERING MANY HARDSHIPS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[Q]: I have faced so many hardships in my life that it has made me hate this life. Every time I turned to Allaah and pleaded to Him to take my life at the earliest possible moment. This continues to be my wish up until now, as I do not see any solutions to my problems except death; it is the only thing that can save me from this torment. Is this behaviour <i>haraam</i> (forbidden) for me?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: <strong>Shaykh Ibn al-‘Uthaymeen</strong> – <em>rahima</em><i>hullaah</i> – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“When a person wishes for death due to the hardships and afflictions that have befallen him, then he is doing something that Allaah’s Messenger <i>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i> prohibited, when he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>“None of you should wish for death due to some harm that has come to him, rather, if he has such a wish then let him say: O Allaah! Give me life if You know that life is better for me. And give me death if You know that death is better for me.” </i></span>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is not allowed for anyone to wish for death on account of some harm, hardship or difficulty that has come to him. In fact, he should have <i>sabr</i> (patience) and expect a reward from Allaah – the Most High – due to his being patient, and he should wait for relief to come to him; just as the Prophet <i>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>“And know that victory comes with patience, relief with distress, and ease with hardship.”</i></span>[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the one who is afflicted with any affliction should know that those afflictions are an expiation for some of the sins he has committed. Indeed, no Believer is afflicted with any kind of grief, pain or suffering except that Allaah expiates – due to that – some of his sins; even if it be the harm caused by a mere pricking of a thorn. So when a person has patience and hopes in a reward from Allaah, he reaches the level of being amongst the <i>saabiroon</i> (those who truly have patience), and this is a very lofty level. <span style="line-height:1.5;">Allaah – the Most High said about its people:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“And give glad tidings to the apatient ones; those who, when afflicted by a calamity, say: Indeed we belong to Allaah, and to Him shall we truly return.”</span></em> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:155-156].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The woman in the question feels that there is no solution for her problems except death. I believe that this is a mistaken view.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Death does not solve any problems. In fact, sometimes it only increases the difficulties. How many people die whilst being afflicted with calamities, difficulties and suffering, but they had been wronging themselves by sinning, and did not give up their sins or repent to Allaah. So death, in this case, is just a quicker coming of punishment.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps if such a person had remained alive, then Allaah would have guided him him to the doors of repentance, seeking forgiveness, patience, facing up to the problems and expecting relief. All of this would have been good for him. Therefore, it is upon you – the questioner – to be patient and expect relief from Allaah – the Mighty and Majestic – just as Allaah – the Most High – said in His Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“So indeed with hardship here is relief. Indeed with hardship there is relief.”</span> </em>[Soorah Inshiraah 94:5-6].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet <i>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i> said in the authentic narration:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>“Victory comes with patience; relief with affliction, and ease with hardship.” </i></span>[5] [6]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 62:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">As regard those who bequeath that the Faatihah be recited on behalf of the Prophet’s soul, or on his behalf by the Prophet’s grave?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer by Shaykh Uthaymeen (rahimahullaah):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not binding to execute this bequest, because it is a bequest of an unprescribed matter. For the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) does not prescribe for anyone to worship Allaah and then dedicate the reward of worship to the Messenger (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam). Since, had this been prescribed, then the companions, may Allaah be pleased with them, would have been the most preceding people in attaining it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also because the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is in no need for this. For indeed there is no person who does a righteous deed except that the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) would have a similar reward. Because he (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is the one who has directed to this, and, [as the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said]: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">“The one who guides to what is good is like the one who does it.”</span></strong> [92] So, this bequest is from the <strong>foolish</strong> and <strong>futile</strong> actions as well as a <strong>bid’ah</strong>, something which has not been reported from the righteous predecessors, may Allaah be pleased with them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And similarly if he said: “Recite the Faatihah on my behalf by the Prophet’s grave,” then it is not binding to fulfill this bequest. The reason for this is that <strong>specifying a particular place for a particular worship not prescribed by the sharia, is from the bida’</strong> as it is known in the aforementioned discussion pertaining to the issue of “Pursuance of the Messenger (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam).” [93] And that the following of the Messenger (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) cannot be achieved until the act of worship agrees with the Sharee’ah in six matters: <strong>cause, type, extent, manner, time, and place</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>References</strong> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[92] Reported by at-Tirmithee (no.2672, Arabic). And also in saheeh Muslim: “One who guides to something good has a reward similar to that of its doer”, vol.3, no.4665.</p>

<p>Here’s a narration which I just read today which I found to be very deep. I thought I’d share it with you all.</p>
<p>The Prophet (<i>sallalahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</i>) said:</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“Instruct your dying ones to say ‘None has the right to be worshipped but Allah’, for indeed the soul of a believer departs through perspiration, and the soul of a disbeliever departs from the corner of his mouth just as the soul of the donkey departs.”</b></span></p>

<p>After mentioning its chain of narration, the Sheikh said:</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><b>‘And this chain of narration is hasan (good)’</b>.</span> See <i>As-Saheehah</i> No. 2151.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And the heavens and the earth wept not for them, nor were they given respite)</strong> &#8212; <strong>do the heavens and the earth weep for anybody</strong>&#8216; He, may Allah be pleased with him, said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>`Yes, there is no one who does not have a gate in the heavens through which his provision comes down and his good deeds ascend. When the believer dies, that gate is closed; it misses him and weeps for him, and the place of prayer on earth where he used to pray and remember Allah also weeps for him. </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But the people of Fir`awn left no trace of righteousness on the earth and they had no good deeds that ascended to Allah, so the heavens and the earth did not weep for them</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">Taken from Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah of Shaykh Al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 3112 – On the authority of ‘Aeysha that Prophet<em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Perform a portion of your prayer in your homes and do not make your homes as graves unlike the Jews and the Christians who placed graves in their homes.Indeed the house in which the Qur’aan is recited will be made apparent to the people of the Heaven just as the stars are made apparent to the people of the earth.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dhahabi said at the end of this hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This hadeeth has a clean <em>Isnaad</em> and its text is<em>Hasan</em>. It is a prohibition of burying people in houses and there is a supporting narration with another chain.The Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em>prohibited building over graves and if the people were to be buried in their homes, then graves and houses would become one thing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Prayer in a graveyard is prohibited, whether it is a prohibition due to dislike or a prohibition meaning Haraam. The Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em>said: ‘The best prayer of a man is in his house except for that which is obligatory.’So it is appropriate that homes are not taken as graves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> being buried in the house of ‘Aa’ishah then this is specific to the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.Just as his garment being spread out under him in the niche of his grave was specifically for him and just as it was specific to him that they each Companion prayed over him, individually, without an <em>Imam</em>, since he was their <em>Imam</em> in life and in death, in the <em>Dunya</em>and in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as it was also specific to him that his burial was delayed for two days, contrary to his <em>Ummah</em> for whom it is not allowed to delay the burial, since the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> is protected from change after death unlike us.They delayed his burial so that everyone could pray over him at his house and, therefore, the delay was due to that matter and also their being hesitant regarding his death for half the day until Abu Bakr came forward with his opinion.This was the reason for the delay.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ vol.7 Hadeeth no.3112p.306-307]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken From the <em>Fatawaa</em> of our Shaykh, <em>Allaama Mufti</em> of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Abdul Azeez bin Abdullaah Bin Baz<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is reading the Qur’aan for the deceased- by placing copies of the Qur’aan in the home or house of the deceased – where some Muslim neighbours and friends come and each one of them reads a part for example, then they go off to their work and they are not paid for reciting …… And after they finish reciting they supplicate for the deceased and gift him the reward for reciting the Qur’aan … Does this recitation and supplication reach the deceased and is he rewarded or not?  I hope for a benefit and I am grateful to you….. Taking into account that I heard some of the scholars saying that it is absolutely prohibited, some saying it is disliked and some saying it is permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This action and the like of it has no foundation and it is not recorded on the authority of the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> nor on the authority of his Companions <em>-radiAllaah anhum</em><em> &#8211;</em> that they used to read for the deceased.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> said: ‘Whoever does an action which we have not commanded then it is rejected.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Muslim in his authentic book and Bukhari mentioned it without a complete chain but he was decisive about its authenticity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, in the two Saheehs of Bukhari and Muslim on the authority of ‘Aeysha <em>-radiAllaah anha</em><em> –</em> on the authority of the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – </em>who said: ‘Whoever innovates in this matter of ours, that which is not from it, it will be rejected.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Saheeh of Muslim on the authority of Jaabir <em>-radiAllaah anhu</em><em> &#8211;</em> that the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> used to say in his <em>Khutbah</em> on Fridays: <em>Amma ba’d:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the best speech is the Speech of Allaah, the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>&#8211; and the worst of the affairs are the innovated ones.  Every innovation is a <em>Bida’</em> and every<em>Bida’</em> is misguidance.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nisa’ee mentioned an extra wording with an authentic chain: ‘and every misguidance is in the Hellfire.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for charity for the deceased and supplicating for them, then that benefits and reaches them and the Muslims are in consensus aboutthat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And with Allaah is the capability and Allaah’s aid is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Majmoo’ Fatawa – Ibn Baaz vol. 4 p. 339</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We wish from the eminent Shaykh that he clarifies for the Muslims the ruling of reciting the Qur’aan over the dead, is it permissible or not?  And what is the ruling of the Ahadeeth that mention this?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reading over the dead has no foundation which can be relied upon nor is there any legislation for this.  Indeed what has beensanctioned is reading the Qur’aan amongst the living so they can benefit and reflect upon the Book of Allaah and understand it.  As for reciting over the deceased at his grave or after his death &#8211; before his burial &#8211; or reading for him in any place so that the reward can be gifted to him, then we do not know of a foundation for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some scholars have authored works and written many books, of them there are those who have allowed and encouraged reciting the whole of the Qur’aan upon the deceased and they regarded it from the same category of giving charity with wealth.  There are those from the people of knowledge who say that these matters are dependent upon evidence; which means that they are from aspects of worship so it is not permissible to perform them except with what the <em>Sharia’ </em>affirms.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> said: ‘Whoever does an action which we have not commanded then it is rejected.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no evidence for this issue – as far as we know – which indicates the permissibility of reciting for the dead.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no evidence regarding this issue from what we know which indicates the legality of reading over the dead, so it is necessary to remain upon the original foundation which is that worship is dependent upon evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So reciting for the dead should not be done, in contrast to giving charity on their behalf, supplicating for them, Hajj, Umrah and paying off debts, then these matters benefit them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are texts which mention this and it is established from the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> that he said: ‘When the son of Aadam dies his actions are severed except for three: recurring charity,knowledge which he can benefit from or a righteous child who supplicates for him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah &#8211;<em>Subhanahu &#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And those who came after them [i.e. after his Companions] say: ‘Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in Faith, and put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed. Our Lord! You are indeed full of kindness, Most Merciful’ &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Hashr:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah has praised those who came later because they supplicated for those who preceded them.  This indicates theallowance of supplicating for the deceased of the Muslims and that itdoes benefit them.  Likewise, charity benefits them due to theaforementioned hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is possible to give charity to the poor and needy people with the money used to hire someone to recite over the dead with the intention that it is for the deceased and that the deceased benefits with this money and saves himself from the vulgarity of <em>Bida’</em>.<strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is established in the Saheeh that a man said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah my mother has passed away and did not leave a bequest and I think that if she had spoken she would have given charity.  Will she receive a reward if I gave charity on her behalf?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> said: ‘Yes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> clarified that charity on behalf of the deceased benefits him and likewise Hajj and Umrah on his behalf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are ahadeeth which mention this, likewise paying off debt benefits him.  As for a reward for the deceased for reciting Qur’aan or gifting it to the dead, praying or optional fasting on his behalf then all of this has no basis and what is correct is that it is not fromthe <em>Sharia’</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Majmoo’ Fatawa – Ibn Baaz vol. 4 p. 340- 341</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

Chapter 354<br />
Prohibition of Mourning beyond Three Days (For Women)</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1774.</b>  Zainab bint Abu Salamah (May Allah be pleased with them) said: I went to Umm Habibah (May Allah be pleased with her) the wife of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), when her father Abu Sufyan bin Harb (May Allah be pleased with him) died. Umm Habibah (May Allah be pleased with her) sent for a yellow coloured perfume or something else like it, and she applied it to a slave-girl and then rubbed it on her own cheeks and said: &#8220;By Allah, I have no need for perfume, I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying from the pulpit, `<span style="color:#0000ff;">It is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to mourn for the dead beyond three days, except for the death of her husband; in which case the period of mourning is of four months and ten days</span>.&#8221;&#8217; Zainab said: I then visited Zainab, daughter of Jahsh (May Allah be pleased with her) when her brother died; she sent for perfume and applied it and then said: &#8220;Beware! By Allah, I don&#8217;t feel any need of perfume but I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying from the pulpit, `<span style="color:#0000ff;">It is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to mourn the dead beyond three days except in case of her husband (for whom the period is) four months and ten days.</span>&#8221;&#8217;<br />

Chapter 302<br />
Prohibition of Bewailing the Deceased</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1657.</b> `Umar bin Al-Khattab (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;T<span style="color:#0000ff;">he deceased is tortured in his grave for bewailing over him.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1658.</b> Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who (on befalling a calamity) slaps his cheeks, tears his clothes and follows the ways and traditions of the Days of Ignorance is none of us</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1659.</b> Abu Burdah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: <span style="color:#008000;">(My father) Abu Musa got seriously ill and lost his consciousness. His head was in the lap of a woman of the family and she began to wail. When Abu Musa recovered his consciousness, he said: &#8220;I am innocent of those from whom Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) is innocent. Verily, the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) declared himself free of (the responsibility) for a woman who wails, shaves her head and tears up her clothes</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1660.</b> Al-Mughirah bin Shu`bah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who allows (others) to wail over his death, will be punished for it on the Day of Resurrection.&#8217;</span>&#8216;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1661</b>. Umm `Atiyyah (May Allah be pleased with her) said: <span style="color:#008000;">At the time of giving the pledge of allegiance, the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) took from us an oath that we would not wail</span>.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1662.</b> An-Nu`man bin Bashir (May Allah be pleased with them) said: <span style="color:#008000;">When `Abdullah bin Rawahah (May Allah be pleased with him) became unconscious, his sister began to weep and shout: &#8220;Alas! For the mountain among men. Alas! for such and such (mentioning his virtuous qualities).&#8221; When he recovered his consciousness, he said: &#8220;I was asked (disapprovingly, by the angels) about everything you said concerning me whether I am as you said</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1663.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) visited Sa`d bin `Ubadah during his illness. He was accompanied by `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf, Sa`d bin Abu Waqqas and `Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with them). When they entered his house, they found him unconscious. The Messenger of Allah asked, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Has he died?</span>&#8221; They replied: &#8220;No, O Messenger of Allah.&#8221; Hearing this the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) began to weep. When his Companions saw this, they also began to weep too. He said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Listen attentively: Allah does not punish for the shedding of tears or the grief of the heart, but takes to task or show mercy because of the utterances of this (and he pointed to his tongue).</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1664.</b> Abu Malik Al-Ash`ari (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">If the wailing woman does not repent before she dies, she will be made to stand on the Day of Resurrection wearing a garment of pitch and a garment of scabies (Allah knows the nature thereof)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1665.</b>  Asid bin Abu Usaid reported: A woman who had taken a pledge of allegiance at the hand of the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Among the matters in respect of which we gave the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) the pledge not to disobey him in any Ma`ruf [i.e., all that Islam ordains (V:60:12)] was that we should not slap our faces, bewail, tear our clothes up and tear out our hair (in grief)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1666.</b> Abu Musa (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">If anyone dies and the mourner gets up and says: `Alas! For the mountain among men. Alas! For the chief &#8230;&#8217; and such like, Allah will put two angels in charge of him who will beat on the breast and ask him (disapproving): `Were you like that?</span>&#8216; &#8221;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1667.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Two things are signs of disbelief on the part of those who indulge in them: Slandering one&#8217;s lineage and wailing over the dead</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>

I think that if she were able to talk (alive) she would have given in Sadaqah (charity).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>943.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The soul of the deceased believer remains pending on account of the debt till it (the debt) is repayed.&#8221;</span><br />

Chapter 152<br />
Good Words to be Uttered before a dying Person and his Family</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>920.</b> Umm Salamah (May Allah be pleased with her): The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;When you visit a sick or a dying person, you should utter good words because the angels say `Amin&#8217; at what you say.&#8221;</span> She added: When Abu Salamah (May Allah be pleased with him) died, I came to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, Abu Salamah has died.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) directed me to supplicate thus:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allahummaghfir li wa lahu, wa a`qibni minhu `uqba hasanatan [O Allah, forgive me and him, and bestow upon me a better future (give me a better substitute)].&#8221;</span> So I supplicated as he directed, and Allah gave me a man who was better for me than Abu Salamah (i.e., the Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)). (The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) married Umm Salamah afterwards.)<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>921.</b> Umm Salamah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;When a person suffers from a calamity and utters: `Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raji`un. Allahumma ujurni fi musibati</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">,</span><span style="color:#0000ff;"> wakhluf li khairan minha (We belong to Allah and to Him we shall return. O Allah! Compensate me in my affliction, recompense my loss and give me something better in exchange for it), then Allah surely compensates him with reward and better substitute.&#8221;</span> Umm Salamah (May Allah be pleased with her) said: When Abu Salamah (May Allah be pleased with him) died, I repeated the same supplication as the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) had commanded me (to do). So Allah bestowed upon me a better substitute than him (I was married to Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)).<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>922.</b> Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;When a man&#8217;s child dies, Allah, the Exalted, asks His angels, `Have you taken out the life of the child of My slave?&#8217; and they reply in the affirmative. He (SWT) then asks, `Have you taken the fruit of his heart?&#8217; and they reply in the affirmative. Thereupon He asks, `What did my slave say?&#8217; They say: `He praised You and said: Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raji&#8217;un (We belong to Allah and to Him we shall return).&#8217; Allah says: `Build a house for my slave in Jannah and name it Baitul-Hamd (the House of Praise).&#8221;&#8217;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>923.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah, the Exalted, says: `I have no reward except Jannah for a believing slave of Mine who shows patience and anticipates My reward when I take away his favourite one from the inhabitants of the world.&#8221;&#8217;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>924.</b> Usamah bin Zaid (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: A daughter of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) sent a message to him that her son was at his last breath, and requested him to come to her. The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) sent back the informer saying:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;To Allah belongs what He takes and what He gives, and everything has a limited period (in this world). So ask her to endure patiently, and expect the reward of Allah.&#8221;</span><br />

Chapter 153<br />
The Ruling of crying and wailing over a Dead Person</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Wailing is unanimously forbidden (Haram) as will be mentioned later on. There are some Ahadith which forbid us from crying over somebody&#8217;s death, and which inform us that the dead will be tormented in their graves as a result of their relatives crying over their death. This prohibition applies only to those cases where crying is accompanied with lamenting and wailing. Weeping without these two is, permissible; and the Ahadith in support of this are many, including the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>925.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) visited Sa`d bin `Ubadah during his illness. He was accompanied by `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf, Sa`d bin Abu Waqqas and `Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with them). The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) began to weep. When his Companions saw this, their tears also started flowing. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Do you not hear, Allah does not punish for the shedding of tears or the grief of the heart, but punishes or bestows mercy for the utterances of this (and he pointed to his tongue).&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>926.</b> Usamah bin Zaid (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A grandson (child of the daughter) of the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was presented to him while the child was at his last breath. Tears began to flow from the eyes of the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). Sa`d said to him: &#8220;What is this, O Messenger of Allah?&#8217;<span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;</span> He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;It is mercy which Allah has placed in the hearts of his salves. Allah bestows His Mercy on the merciful among His slaves.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>927.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) came to his son Ibrahim (May Allah be pleased with him) when he was breathing his last. The eyes of the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) began shedding tears. `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf  (May Allah be pleased with him) said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, you too weep?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O Ibn `Auf! It is mercy.&#8221;</span> Then he began to weep and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The eyes are shedding tears and the heart is grieved, and we will not say except what pleases our Rubb. O Ibrahim! Indeed we are grieved by your departure.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>

Following the Funeral, and Matters relating to Illness and Death</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>894.</b> Al-Bara&#8217; bin `Azib (May Allah be pleased with them) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) has ordered us to visit the sick, to follow the funeral (of a dead believer), respond to the sneezer (i.e., by saying to him: Yarhamuk-Allah after he says: Al-hamdu lillah), to help those who vow to fulfill it, to help the oppressed, to accept the invitation extended by the inviter; and to promote greetings (i.e., saying As-Salamu `Alaikum).</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>895.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Every Muslim has five rights over another Muslim (i.e., he has to perform five duties for another Muslim): to return the greetings, to visit the sick, to accompany funeral processions, to accept an invitation, to respond to the sneezer [i.e., to say: `Yarhamuk-Allah (may Allah bestow His Mercy on you),&#8217; when the sneezer praises  Allah].&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>896.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Verily, Allah, the Exalted, and Glorious will say on the Day of Resurrection: `O son of Adam, I was ill but you did not visit Me.&#8217; He would say: `O my Rubb, how could I visit you and You are the Rubb of the worlds?&#8217; Thereupon He would say: `Did you not know that such and such a slave of Mine was ill but you did not visit him? Did you not realize that if you had visited him (you would have known that I was aware of your visit to him, for which I would reward you) you would have found Me with him? O son of Adam, I asked food from you but you did not feed Me.&#8217; He would submit: `My Rubb, how could I feed You and You are the Rubb of the worlds?&#8217; He would say: `Did you not know that such and such a slave of Mine asked you for food but you did not feed him? Did you not realize that if you had fed him, you would certainly have found (its reward) with Me? O son of Adam, I asked water from you but you did not give it to Me.&#8217; He would say: `My Rubb, how could I give You (water) and You are the Rubb of the worlds?&#8217; Thereupon He would say: `Such and such a slave of Mine asked you for water to drink but you did not give it to him. Did you not realize that if you had given him to drink you would have found (its reward) with Me?&#8221;&#8217;   </span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>897.</b> Abu Musa (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Visit the sick, feed the hungry, and (arrange for the) release of the captive.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>898.</b> Thauban (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He who visits his brother in Faith, will remain engaged in picking the fresh fruits from the garden of Jannah till he returns.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>899.</b> `Ali bin Abu Talib (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;When a Muslim visits a sick Muslim at dawn, seventy thousand angels keep on praying for him till dusk. If he visits him in the evening, seventy thousand angels keep on praying for him till the morning; and he will have (his share of) reaped fruits in Jannah.&#8221;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>900.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A young Jewish boy who was in the service of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) fell ill. The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) went to visit him. He sat down by his head and said to him,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Embrace Islam.&#8221;</span> The little boy looked at his father who was sitting beside him. He said: &#8220;Obey Abul-Qasim (i.e., the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)).&#8221; So he embraced Islam and the Prophet ü stepped out saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Praise be to Allah Who has saved him from Hell-fire.&#8221;</span><br />

Supplication to be made soon after a Person&#8217;s Death</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>919.</b> Umm Salamah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) visited Abu Salamah (May Allah be pleased with him) when his eyes were open soon after he died. He closed them (the eyes) for him and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;When the soul is taken away, the sight follows it.&#8221;</span> Some members of his family began to weep. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Do not supplicate for yourselves anything but good, for the angels say `amin&#8217; to what you say.&#8221;</span> Then he ü said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O Allah! Forgive Abu Salamah, raise his rank among those who are rightly-guided and grant him a successor from his descendants who remain behind. Grant him pardon and us, too. O Rubb of the worlds. Make his grave spacious for him and give him light in it.&#8221;</span><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>950.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Some Companions happened to pass by a funeral procession (bier) and they praised him (the deceased). The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He will certainly enter it.&#8221;</span> Then they passed by another funeral procession and they spoke ill of the deceased. The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He will certainly enter it.&#8221;</span> `Umar bin Al-Khattab (May Allah be pleased with him) said: &#8220;(O Messenger of Allah,) what do you mean by `He will certainly enter it?&#8217;<span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;</span> He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;You praised the first person, so he will enter Jannah; and you spoke ill of the second person, so he will enter Hell. You are Allah&#8217;s witnesses on earth.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>951.</b> Abul-Aswad (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I came to Al-Madinah, and while I was sitting beside `Umar bin Al-Khattab, a funeral procession passed by. The people praised the deceased, and `Umar bin Al-Khattab said: &#8220;He will certainly enter it.&#8221; Then another funeral procession passed by and the people praised the deceased. `Umar bin Al-Khattab (May Allah be pleased with him) said: &#8220;He will certainly enter it.&#8221; A third funeral procession passed by and the people spoke ill of the deceased. He said: &#8220;He will certainly enter it.&#8221; I (Abul-Aswad) asked: &#8220;O Amir Al-Mu&#8217;minin (i.e., Leader of the Believers)! What do you mean by `He will certainly enter it&#8217;?&#8221; He replied: &#8220;I said the same as was said by the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `If four persons testify the righteousness of a Muslim, Allah will grant him Jannah.&#8217;</span> We asked: `If three persons testify his righteousness?&#8217; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `Even three&#8217;.</span> Then we asked:<span style="color:#008000;"> `</span>If two?&#8217; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `Even two.&#8217;</span> We did not ask him (regarding the testimony) of one.&#8221;<br />

Chapter 164<br />
Superiority of one who is Bereaved of his Infants</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>952.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Any Muslim who loses three children before they reach the age of maturity, will be granted Jannah by Allah, the Exalted, out of His Mercy for them.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>953.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;A Muslim whose three children die (in infancy) will not be touched by the Fire (of Hell) except for the fulfillment of Allah&#8217;s Oath.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Allah&#8217;s Oath here refers to His Ayah:<span style="color:#ff0000;"> &#8220;There is not one of you but will cross over it (Hell).&#8221;</span> (19:71) And the crossing will be across the `Bridge&#8217; set over the Hell.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>954.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A woman came to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Only men benefit from your talks, so please fix a day for us, to teach us the knowledge which Allah has taught you<span style="color:#008000;">.</span>&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) fixed a day and directed them to assemble. When they gathered, the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) went to them and taught them what Allah had taught him. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) then said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Any woman of you whose three children die (in infancy) they will be a guard for her against Fire (of Hell).&#8221;</span> One of the women asked: &#8220;What if she loses two?&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Even two.&#8221;</span><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>913.</b> `Imran bin Husain (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: A woman belonging to the Juhainah tribe came to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) after having conceived from Zina.

I am liable to Hadd (punishment ordained by Allah), so execute it.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) called her guardian and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Treat her well and bring her to me after delivery.&#8221;</span> He acted accordingly. Then the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) commanded to tie her clothes firmly around her and then stoned her to death.

Chapter 67<br />
Abomination of longing for Death</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>585.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;None of you should wish for death. If he is righteous, perhaps he may add to (his) good works, and if he is a sinner, possibly he may repent (in case he is given a longer life).&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">     In Muslim, Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported : Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Let none of you wish for death, nor he ask for it before it comes to him, because when he dies, his actions will be terminated; certainly the age of a (true) believer does not add but good.&#8221;  </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>586.</b> Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Let none of you wish for death on account of an affliction that befalls him. If he has no alternative, let him pray: `Allahumma ahyine ma kanatil-hayatu khairan li</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">,</span><span style="color:#0000ff;"> wa tawaffani idha kanatil-wafatu khairan li</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';"> (</span><span style="color:#0000ff;">O Allah! Give my life so long as the life is good for me, and take away my life if death is good for me)&#8217;.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>587.</b> Qais bin Abu Hazim (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I went to visit Khabbab bin Aratt (May Allah be pleased with him) during his illness. He had been cauterized in seven places. He said:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Our companions who have died have left (this world) without having enjoyed the pleasures of the world (in order to get a great full reward in the Hereafter) while we have amassed wealth exceeding our needs for which there is no place to keep except in the earth</span>.<span style="color:#008000;"> Had Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) not prohibited us from longing for death, I would have prayed for it.</span>&#8221; Then we visited him again and he was building a wall. He said:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;There is a reward in store for a Muslim in respect of everything on which he spends except for something he places in the earth (i.e., something exceeding our needs or essentials).&#8221;</span><br />

Desirability of visiting the Graves for men, and that they should say</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>581.</b> Buraidah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;(In the past) I forbade you from visiting graves, but visit them now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Whoever wants to visit a graveyard, let him do so, because it reminds us of the Hereafter.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>582.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her): reported Whenever it was her turn to spend with Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), he used to go to the Baqi<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">` (</span>graveyard in Al-Madinah) at the last part of night and say,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;May you be safe, O abode of the believing people. What you have been promised has come to you. You are tarried till tomorrow and certainly we shall follow you if Allah wills. O Allah, forgive the inmates of the Baqi`-al-Gharqad.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>583.</b> Buraidah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to teach them (i.e., the Companions) whenever they came out to visit the graveyard to say:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;As-salamu `alaikum ahlad-diyyari minal-Mu&#8217;minina wal-Muslimina, wa inna in sha&#8217; Allahu bikum lahiqun. As&#8217;alul-laha lana wa-lakumul- `afiyyah  (May you be safe, O inmates of the abodes of the believers and the Muslims, and if Allah pleases, we shall follow you, we pray to Allah for well-being for ourselves and for you).&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>584.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) passed by the graves at Al-Madinah. He turned his face towards them and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;May you be granted safety, O inmates of the graves. May Allah forgive us and you. You have preceded us, and we are to follow.&#8221;</span><br />

Remembrance of Death and Restraint of Wishes</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Allah, the Exalted, says:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Everyone shall taste death. And only on the Day of Resurrection shall you be paid your wages in full. And whoever is removed away from the Fire and admitted to Jannah, he indeed is successful. The life of this world is only the enjoyment of deception (a deceiving thing).&#8221;</b></span><b> (3:185)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;No person knows what he will earn tomorrow, and no person knows in what land he will die&#8230;&#8221;</b></span><b> (31:34)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;when their term comes, neither can they delay nor can they advance it an hour (or a moment).&#8221;</b></span><b> (16:61)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;O you who believe! Let not your properties or your children divert you from the remembrance of Allah. And whosoever does that, then they are the losers. And spend (in charity) of that with which We have provided you, before death comes to one of you, and he says: `My Rubb! If only You would give me respite for a little while (i.e., return to the worldly life), then I should give Sadaqah (i.e., Zakat) of my wealth, and be among the righteous [i.e., perform Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) and other good deeds].&#8217; And Allah grants respite to none when his appointed time (death) comes. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.&#8221;</b></span><b> (63:9-11)</b></p>

The Fire will burn their faces, and therein they will grin, with displaced lips (disfigured). `Were not My Verses (this Qur&#8217;an) recited to you, and then you used to deny them?&#8217; They will say: `Our Rubb!

[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the narration of Muslim it is narrated as `three nights&#8217;. Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) said: Since I heard the Messenger of Allah say this, I have never spent a night without having my will with me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>576.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) drew a few lines and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;One of them represents man and another indicates death; and a man continues like this until the nearest line (i.e., death) overtakes him.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>577.</b> Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) drew up a square and in the middle of it he drew a line, the end of which jutted out beyond the square. Further across the middle line, he drew a number of smaller lines. Then he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The figure represents man and the encircling square is the death which is encompassing him. The middle line represents his desires and the smaller lines are vicissitudes of life. If one of those misses him, another distresses him, and if that one misses him, he falls victim to another.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>

[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>579.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Remember more often the destroyer of pleasures &#8211; death.&#8221;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>580.</b> Ubayy bin Ka`b (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: When one-third of the night would pass, Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) would get up and call out,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O people, remember Allah. The Rajifah (i.e., the first Blowing of the Trumpet which will shake the whole universe and thus cause all life to cease) has come, followed by Ar-Radifah (i.e., the second Blowing of the Trumpet which will restore life and thus mark the Resurrection Day).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Salama bin Al-Akwa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once, while we were sitting in the company of Prophet, a  dead man was brought. The Prophet was requested to lead the funeral prayer for the  deceased. He said, &#8220;Is he in debt?&#8221; The people replied in the negative. He said,  &#8220;Has he left any wealth?&#8221; They said, &#8220;No.&#8221; So, he led his funeral  prayer. Another dead man was brought and the people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Lead  his funeral prayer.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Is he in debt?&#8221; They said,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Has he left any wealth?&#8221; They said, &#8221;Three  Dinars.&#8221; So, he led the prayer. Then a third dead man was brought and the people said  (to the Prophet ), Please lead his funeral prayer.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Has he left any  wealth?&#8221; They said, &#8220;No.&#8221; He asked, &#8220;Is he in debt?&#8221; They said,  (&#8220;Yes! He has to pay) three Diners.&#8217;, He (refused to pray and) said, &#8220;Then pray  for your (dead) companion.&#8221; Abu Qatada said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Lead his  funeral prayer, and I will pay his debt.&#8221; So, he led the prayer. </font></p>

<p></a><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.037.488h"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 37, Number 488h: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;An Israeli man asked another  Israeli to lend him one thousand Dinars. The second man required witnesses. The former  replied, &#8216;Allah is sufficient as a witness.&#8217; The second said, &#8216;I want a surety.&#8217; The  former replied, &#8216;Allah is sufficient as a surety.&#8217; The second said, &#8216;You are right,&#8217; and  lent him the money for a certain period. The debtor went across the sea. When he finished  his job, he searched for a conveyance so that he might reach in time for the repayment of  the debt, but he could not find any. So, he took a piece of wood and made a hole in it,  inserted in it one thousand Dinars and a letter to the lender and then closed (i.e.  sealed) the hole tightly. He took the piece of wood to the sea and said. &#8216;O Allah! You  know well that I took a loan of one thousand Dinars from so-and-so. He demanded a surety  from me but I told him that Allah&#8217;s Guarantee was sufficient and he accepted Your  guarantee. He then asked for a witness and I told him that Allah was sufficient as a  Witness, and he accepted You as a Witness. No doubt, I tried hard to find a conveyance so  that I could pay his money but could not find, so I hand over this money to You.&#8217; Saying  that, he threw the piece of wood into the sea till it went out far into it, and then he  went away. Meanwhile he started searching for a conveyance in order to reach the  creditor&#8217;s country. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>One day the lender came out of his house to see whether a  ship had arrived bringing his money, and all of a sudden he saw the piece of wood in which  his money had been deposited. He took it home to use for fire. When he sawed it, he found  his money and the letter inside it. Shortly after that, the debtor came bringing one  thousand Dinars to him and said, &#8216;By Allah, I had been trying hard to get a boat so that I  could bring you your money, but failed to get one before the one I have come by.&#8217; The  lender asked, &#8216;Have you sent something to me?&#8217; The debtor replied, &#8216;I have told you I  could not get a boat other than the one I have come by.&#8217; The lender said, &#8216;Allah has  delivered on your behalf the money you sent in the piece of wood. So, you may keep your  one thousand Dinars and depart guided on the right path.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 37, Number 489: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Said bin Jubair: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn Abbas said, &#8220;In the verse: To every one We have  appointed &#8216; (Muwaliya Mawaliya means one&#8217;s) heirs (4.33).&#8217; (And regarding the verse) &#8216;And  those with whom your right hands have made a pledge.&#8217; Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;When the  emigrants came to the Prophet in Medina, the emigrant would inherit the Ansari while the  latter&#8217;s relatives would not inherit him because of the bond of brotherhood which the  Prophet established between them (i.e. the emigrants and the Ansar). When the verse: &#8216;And  to everyone We have appointed heirs&#8217; (4.33) was revealed, it cancelled (the bond (the  pledge) of brotherhood regarding inheritance).&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;The verse: To  those also to whom your right hands have pledged, remained valid regarding co-operation  and mutual advice, while the matter of inheritance was excluded and it became permissible  to assign something in one&#8217;s testament to the person who had the right of inheriting  before. </font></p>

<p></a><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.037.490"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 37, Number 490: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf came to us and Allah&#8217;s Apostle  established a bond of brotherhood between him and Sad bin Rabi&#8217;a. </font></p>

<p></a><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.037.491"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 37, Number 491: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Asim: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Anas bin Malik, &#8220;Have you ever heard that the  Prophet said, &#8216;There is no alliance in Islam?&#8217; &#8221; He replied, &#8220;The Prophet made  alliance between Quarish and the Ansar in my house.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr />
<p></a><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.037.492"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 37, Number 492: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Salama bin Al-Akwa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A dead person was brought to the Prophet so that he might  lead the funeral prayer for him. He asked, &#8220;Is he in debt?&#8221; When the people  replied in the negative, he led the funeral prayer. Another dead person was brought and he  asked, &#8220;Is he in debt?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He (refused to lead the  prayer and) said, &#8220;Lead the prayer of your friend.&#8221; Abu Qatada said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I undertake to pay his debt.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then led his funeral  prayer. </font></p>
<hr />
<p></a><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.037.493"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 37, Number 493: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once the Prophet said (to me), &#8220;If the money of  Bahrain comes, I will give you a certain amount of it.&#8221; The Prophet had breathed his  last before the money of Bahrain arrived. When the money of Bahrain reached, Abu Bakr  announced, &#8220;Whoever was promised by the Prophet should come to us.&#8221; I went to  Abu Bakr and said, &#8220;The Prophet promised me so and so.&#8221; Abu Bakr gave me a  handful of coins and when I counted them, they were five-hundred in number. Abu Bakr then  said, &#8220;Take twice the amount you have taken (besides).&#8221; </font></p>
<hr />
<p></a><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.037.494"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 37, Number 494: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(wife of the Prophet) Since I reached the age when I could  remember things, I have seen my parents worshipping according to the right faith of Islam.  Not a single day passed but Allah&#8217;s Apostle visited us both in the morning and in the  evening. When the Muslims were persecuted, Abu Bakr set out for Ethiopia as an emigrant.  When he reached a place called Bark-al-Ghimad, he met Ibn Ad-Daghna, the chief of the Qara  tribe, who asked Abu Bakr, &#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;My people  have turned me out of the country and I would like to tour the world and worship my  Lord.&#8221; Ibn Ad-Daghna said, &#8220;A man like you will not go out, nor will he be  turned out as you help the poor earn their living, keep good relation with your Kith and  kin, help the disabled (or the dependents), provide guests with food and shelter, and help  people during their troubles. I am your protector. So, go back and worship your Lord at  your home.&#8221; Ibn Ad-Daghna went along with Abu Bakr and took him to the chiefs of  Quraish saying to them, &#8220;A man like Abu Bakr will not go out, nor will he be turned  out. Do you turn out a man who helps the poor earn their living, keeps good relations with  Kith and kin, helps the disabled, provides guests with food and shelter, and helps the  people during their troubles?&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So, Quraish allowed Ibn Ad-Daghna&#8217;s guarantee of protection  and told Abu- Bakr that he was secure, and said to Ibn Ad-Daghna, &#8220;Advise Abu Bakr to  worship his Lord in his house and to pray and read what he liked and not to hurt us and  not to do these things publicly, for we fear that our sons and women may follow him.&#8221;  Ibn Ad-Daghna told Abu Bakr of all that, so Abu- Bakr continued worshipping his Lord in  his house and did not pray or recite Qur&#8217;an aloud except in his house. Later on Abu Bakr  had an idea of building a mosque in the court yard of his house. He fulfilled that idea  and started praying and reciting Qur&#8217;an there publicly. The women and the offspring of the  pagans started gathering around him and looking at him astonishingly. Abu Bakr was a  softhearted person and could not help weeping while reciting Qur&#8217;an. This horrified the  pagan chiefs of Quraish. They sent for Ibn Ad-Daghna and when he came, they said, &#8220;We  have given Abu Bakr protection on condition that he will worship his Lord in his house,  but he has transgressed that condition and has built a mosque in the court yard of his  house and offered his prayer and recited Qur&#8217;an in public. We are afraid lest he mislead  our women and offspring. So, go to him and tell him that if he wishes he can worship his  Lord in his house only, and if not, then tell him to return your pledge of protection as  we do not like to betray you by revoking your pledge, nor can we tolerate Abu Bakr&#8217;s  public declaration of Islam (his worshipping).&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Aisha added: Ibn Ad-Daghna came to Abu Bakr and said,  &#8220;You know the conditions on which I gave you protection, so you should either abide  by those conditions or revoke my protection, as I do not like to hear the &#8216;Arabs saying  that Ibn Ad-Daghna gave the pledge of protection to a person and his people did not  respect it.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;I revoke your pledge of protection and am satisfied  with Allah&#8217;s protection.&#8221; At that time Allah&#8217;s Apostle was still in Mecca and he said  to his companions, &#8220;Your place of emigration has been shown to me. I have seen salty  land, planted with date-palms and situated between two mountains which are the two  ,Harras.&#8221; So, when the Prophet told it, some of the companions migrated to Medina,  and some of those who had migrated to Ethiopia returned to Medina. When Abu Bakr prepared  for emigration, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to him, &#8220;Wait, for I expect to be permitted to  emigrate.&#8221; Abu Bakr asked, &#8220;May my father be sacrificed for your sake, do you  really expect that?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied in the affirmative. So, Abu Bakr  postponed his departure in order to accompany Allah&#8217;s Apostle and fed two camels which he  had, with the leaves of Samor trees for four months. </font></p>
<hr />
<p></a><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.037.495"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 37, Number 495: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever a dead man in debt was brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle  he would ask, &#8220;Has he left anything to repay his debt?&#8221; If he was informed that  he had left something to repay his debts, he would offer his funeral prayer, otherwise he  would tell the Muslims to offer their friend&#8217;s funeral prayer. When Allah made the Prophet  wealthy through conquests, he said, &#8220;I am more rightful than other believers to be  the guardian of the believers, so if a Muslim dies while in debt, I am responsible for the  repayment of his debt, and whoever leaves wealth (after his death) it will belong to his  heirs. &#8221; </font></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">When death befalls someone, he should know that it is an hour of serious suffering because it is a moment of severe pain, when he is leaving all objects of love, his loved ones, and to all that the horror of the throes of death and fear of where his wealth go. Then Shaytan comes and attempts to have the slave [of Allah] become discontent with his Lord, he tells him &#8216;Look at you! What made you die? Is it painful? You are leaving your wife, your children and you will be laid under the ground? So he might cause him to become discontent with his Lord, hating Allaah&#8217;s decree, making him say things that include any kind of objection , or he might make him unjust in his will, giving some of the inheritors preference over others, to on and so forth. In this case, we need to cure the whispers of Shaytaan and cure the self .</p>
<p>Abu Dawood reported from Abu al-Yusr (radiy Allaahu anhu) that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) used to say,</p>
<h1 style="text-align:center;"> أعوذ بك أن يتخبطني الشيطان عند الموت</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Aoodhubika an ya takhabaTani ash-Shaytaan ‘indal Mawt</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8220;I seek refuge in You that Shaytaan flounders me at death: [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In that minute Shaytaan tells his assistants,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;If you miss him now [i.e. you do not succeed to lead him astray before he dies], you will never catch him again [i.e. you will never be able to deviate him at any other time].&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the cure for these trials we should first mention that whoever is mindful of Allah while in good health, Allah will protect him when he is ill, and whoever observes Allah in his thoughts, Allah will protect him when he moves his bodily parts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;">Al-Khattaab said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;His seeking refuge in the &#8216;<strong>floundering of Shaytaan at death</strong>&#8216;, that is if Shaytaan seizes him when he leaves this world, preventing him from repenting or hinders him from mending his affairs, leaving an injustice or he makes him despair from the mercy of Allaah or makes him hate death or be sorry for this life, so he becomes discontented with Allah&#8217;s decree in dissolution, going to the hereafter, so one has a bad end and he meets his Lord while he is discontented with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was narrated that the Shaytaan is never tougher on a man as in death and he tells his assistants: &#8216;<strong>Take this person! if you miss him today you will never catch him again</strong>.&#8217; We seek refuge in Allah from his evil, we ask him to bless our death and to have a good end.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[1] Reported by Abu Dawood 1552-1553, al-Nasa&#8217;i[8:283] through the chain of Afla&#8217; Mawla (emancipated slave) of Abu Ayyub from Abu al-Yusr that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) used to pray, <strong>&#8220;O Allah! I seek refuge in you from dying under abolishment, not being deliberate, I seek refuge in you from drowning, from burning and from senility, I seek refuge in you that Shaytaan flounders me at death, I seek refuge in you that I die while escaping from fighting for Your sake and I seek refuge in you from dying because of a sting.&#8221;</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is The Smile On The Face Of A Dead Person An Indication Of Husn Al Khātimah (I.E. Good Ending Of One&#8217;s Worldly Life)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Muhammad Al-Wassãbi</strong> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Husn al-khātimah has been mentioned in various hadīths. So we should rely solely on what was reported from the Messenger (peace be upon him) regarding it and should not add to it based on opinion. From the opinion-based signs of husn al-khātimah is the dead person being light. Some people consider this to be from husn al-khātimah&#8212; that his body was extremely swift and easy (when carried) over people&#8217;s shoulders. This is not a proof. It might be because his body is lean, yet knowing whether or not a person&#8217;s actions are righteous is something else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ok then what if his body were fat? Would it be said that this is from sū&#8217; al-khātimah (i.e. evil ending)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Pay no attention to this. Husn al-Khātimah is when (a Muslim) dies while fasting, performing haj, praying, doing jihaad, when he dies upon a good ending, upon a righteous deed. In this case, you say: Maashaallaah! Wishing him good but not affirming Paradise for him. Conversely, sū&#8217; al-khātimah is when one dies while not praying (i.e. abandoning prayer), (visiting) a sorcerer, while drunk, or committing robbery or any forbidden act. However, affirm for him neither Paradise nor Hell.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Compilation of Tweets from the lecture, &#8220;Having Good Thoughts About Allah&#8221; by Dawud Adib (hafidhahullah) </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having good thoughts of Allah is an enormous act of worship and has a lofty position for those seeking to get close to Allah. It is one of the obligations of Tawheed; in fact, the Tawheed of the slave will not be correct except by having good assumptions of Allah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having good assumptions of Allah brings about praiseworthy effects and beneficial fruits in this life and the next</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jaabir (radhiyAllahu ‘anhu) said, “Three days before the Messenger (sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) died he said, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Do not allow anyone of you to die except that he is perfecting his assumptions about Allah.’”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Side Benefit: The ‘Ulamaa` pay close attention to those statements and actions of the Prophet (sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) that happen close to his death by days, weeks or months because the revelation is about to cease</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having good thoughts about Allah will produce good actions; and this comes from having knowledge of Allah &#8211; one is the result of the other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hasan al-Basree (rahimahullah) said, “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Verily, when the believer perfects his thoughts about his Rabb, he would have perfected his actions and the faajir is the one who has corrupted his thoughts of his Lord, so his actions will also be corrupted</strong></span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Deeply reflect upon this consistent, strong connection between having good thoughts of Allah and good actions. It is based upon having good knowledge of Allah, specifically about his Lofty Names and Perfect Attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you know the Name of Allah, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Al-Ghaffaar</strong></span>, then you have to perfect your thoughts about Him when you make istighfaar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you deeply ponder upon His Beautiful Name, <strong><span style="color:#000000;">At-Tawwaab</span></strong> and that Allah will accept the repentance of His servants and pardon them for their offences, then it is upon you to perfect your assumptions of Him, that He will accept your repentance regardless of what your offense is</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If some of the calamities of this world or pain afflicts you, even some of those diseases that are called incurable or fatal, it is upon you to perfect your assumptions about Allah, that He is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ash-Shaafee</strong></span> and there is no remedy or healing except His healing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Who has created me, and it is He Who guides me; And it is He Who feeds me and gives me to drink. And when I am ill, it is He who cures me; And Who will cause me to die, and then will bring me to life (again)”</span> [Soorah ash-Shu&#8217;araa` :78-81]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These aayaat indicate that Ibraaheem (‘alayhis salaam) had good thoughts about Allah. He did not attribute becoming sick to Allah as he attributed creation, guidance and sustenance to Him. He did not say “when Allah makes me ill” &#8211; he attributed this to himself</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In your du&#8217;aa to Allah for the good things of this dunyaa and aakhirah, you must perfect your thoughts about Allah that He will answer you</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And your Lord said: ‘Invoke Me, I will respond to your (invocation). Verily! Those who scorn My worship will surely enter Hell in humiliation!”</span> [Soorah Ghaafir: 60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad) concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge) I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me.”</span> [Soorah al-Baqarah: 186]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having good thoughts about Allah is from the most tremendous blessings and greatest bounties that Allah gives to whomever He wishes</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abi Dunyaa (rahimahullah) said in &#8220;Having Good Thoughts AboutAllah&#8221;: &#8216;Abdullah Ibn Mas&#8217;ood (radhiyAllahu ‘anhu) said, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I swear by The One Who there is none worthy of worship but Him. A believing slave has not been given anything better than having good assumptions about Allah.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he (Ibn Mas&#8217;ood) said,<strong><span style="color:#000000;"> “And I swear by the One Who there is nothing worthy of worship but Him, that there is no slave who perfects his assumption of Allah except that Allah will give him what he assumed and all of that good is in the Hand of Allah.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is said that whoever is more knowledgeable of Allah will be the most fearing of Him and whoever is most fearing of Him will be foremost in acts of worship and will be furthest from acts of disobedience</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Allah says, <span style="color:#008000;">“It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allah.” </span>[Soorah Faatir :28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, having good thoughts is constructed upon perfecting your knowledge and understanding of Allah. This produces good actions and obedience, and will be your share and portion of the People of Eemaan; this is a description of the People of Eemaan</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The munaafiqoon and mushrikoon have no share regarding having good thoughts of Allah. In fact, they have bad thoughts of Allah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a sign of nifaaq and kufr to have bad thoughts of Allah because those who have bad thoughts of Him are those who do not believe in Him</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And that He may punish the Munaafiqoon, men and women, and also the Mushrikoon men and women, who think evil thoughts about Allah for them is a disgraceful torment, and the Anger of Allah is upon them, and He has cursed them and prepared Hell for them and worst indeed is that destination.&#8221;</span> [Soorah al-Fath :6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, the scholars have said that there is no punishment mentioned in the Qur&#8217;aan more severe than that for having bad thoughts about Allah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They have bad thoughts of Allah due to their disbelief in Allah, their corrupted &#8216;Aqeedah and the deviation in their hearts</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>These tremendous benefits were taken from the lecture, &#8220;Having Good Thoughts of Allah&#8221; by Shaykh &#8216;Abdur Razzaaq Ibn &#8216;Abdul Muhsin al-&#8216;Abbaad(hafidhahumullah)</em></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ar-Raheeq al-Makhtoom</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Start of the Disease</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On Monday the twenty-ninth of Safar in the eleventh year of al-Hijra, he participated in funeral rites in al-Baqee&#8217;. On the way back he had a headache, his temperature rose so high that the heat effect could be felt over his headband. He led the Muslims in prayer for eleven days though he was sick. The total number of his sick days were either thirteen of fourteen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Last Week</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When his sickness grew severe he asked his wives: &#8220;Where shall I stay tomorrow?&#8221; &#8220;Where shall I stay?&#8221; They understood what he wanted. So they allowed him to stay wherever he wished. He moved to &#8216;Aishah&#8217;s room leaning &#8211; while he was walking &#8211; on al-Fadl bin al-&#8216;Abbas and &#8216;Alî bin Abî Tâlib. Head banded as he was, he dragged his feet till he came into her abode. It was there that he spent the last week of his life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During that period, &#8216;Aishah used to recite al-Mu&#8217;awwidhat (Chapters 113 and 114 of the Qur&#8217;ân) and other supplications which he has already taught her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Five days before death</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On Wednesday, five days before he died the Prophet&#8217;s temperature rose so high signalling the severness of his disease. He fainted and suffered from pain. &#8220;Pour out on me seven Qirab (water skin pots) of various water wells so that I may go out to meet people and talk to them.&#8221; So they seated him in a container (usually used for washing) and poured out water on him till he said: &#8220;That is enough. That is enough.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he felt well enough to enter the Mosque. He entered it band-headed, sat on the pulpit and made a speech to the people who were gathering together around him. He said: <em> &#8220;The curse of Allâh falls upon the Jews and Christians for they have made their Prophets’ tombs places of worship.&#8221;</em> [Sahîh al-Bukhârî, 1/62; Muatta&#8217; Imâm Malik, p.360] Then he said: &#8220;Do not make my tomb a worshipped idol.&#8221; [Muatta&#8217; Imâm Malik, p.65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he offered himself and invited the people to repay any injuries he might have inflicted on them, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;He whom I have ever lashed his back, I offer him my back so that he may avenge himself on me. He whom I have ever blasphemed his honour, here I am offering my honour so that he may avenge himself.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he descended, and performed the noon prayer. Again he returned to the pulpit and sat on it. He resumed his first speech about enmity and some other things. A man then said: &#8220;You owe me three Dirhams.&#8221; The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said: &#8220;Fadl, pay him the money.&#8221; He went on saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em> &#8220;I admonish you to be good to Al-Ansar (the Helpers). They are my family and with them I found shelter. They have acquitted themselves credibly of the responsibility that fell upon them and now there remains what you have to do. You should fully acknowledge and appreciate the favour that they have shown, and should overlook their faults.&#8221; </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another version: <em> &#8220;The number of believers would increase, but the number of Helpers would decrease to the extent that they would be among men as salt in the food. So he who from among you occupies a position of responsibility and is powerful enough to do harm or good to the people, he should frilly acknowledge and appreciate the favour that these benefactors have shown and overlook their faults.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And said: &#8220;Allâh, the Great, has given a slave of His the opportunity to make a choice between whatever he desires of Allâh’s provisions in this world, and what He keeps for him in the world, but he has opted for the latter.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abû Sa’id Al-Khudri said: &#8220;Upon hearing that, Abû Bakr cried and said: ‘We sacrifice our fathers and mothers for your sake.’ We wondered why Abû Bakr said such a thing. People said: ‘Look at that old man! The Messenger of Allâh says about a slave of Allâh who was granted the right between the best fortunes of this world and the bounty of Allâh in the Hereafter, but he says: We sacrifice our fathers and mothers for your sake!’ It was later on that we realized what he had aimed at. The Messenger of Allâh was the slave informed to choose. We also acknowledged that Abû Bakr was the most learned among us.&#8221; [Mishkat Al-Masabih, 2/546]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Messenger of Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em> &#8220;The fellow I feel most secure in his company is Abû Bakr. If I were to make friendship with any other one than Allah, I would have Abû Bakr a bosom friend of mine. For him I feel affection and brotherhood of Islam. No gate shall be kept open in the Mosque except that of Abû Bakr’s.&#8221;</em> [Sahîh al-Bukhârî, 1/22,429,449, 2/638; Misbkat Al-Masabih, 2/548]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Four days before his death</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On Thursday, four days before the death of the Messenger of Allâh he said to people — though he was suffering from a severe pain:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Come here. I will cause you to write something so that you will never fall into error.&#8221; Upon this ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab said: &#8220;The Prophet of Allâh is suffering from acute pain and you have the Qur’an with you; the Book of Allâh is sufficient unto you.&#8221; Others however wanted the writing to be made. When Muhammad heard them debating over it, he ordered them to go away and leave him alone. [Sahîh al-Bukhârî, 2/637]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That day he recommended three things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Jews, Christians and polytheists should be expelled out of Arabia .<br />
2. He recommended that delegations should be honoured and entertained, in a way similar to the one he used to do.<br />
3. As for the third — the narrator said that he had forgotten it. It could have been adherence to the Holy Book and the Sunnah. It was likely to be the accomplishment and the mobilization of Osamah’s army, or it could have been performance of prayers and being attentive to slaves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In spite of the strain of disease and suffering from pain, the Prophet used to lead all the prayers till that Thursday — four days before he died. On that day he led the sunset prayer and recited:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;By the winds (or angels or the Messengers of Allah) sent forth one after another.&#8221;</strong> [77:1] [Misbkat Al-Masabih, 1/102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the evening he grew so sick that he could not overcome the strain of disease or go out to enter the Mosque. ‘Aishah said: The Prophet asked: &#8220;Have the people performed the prayer?&#8221; &#8220;No. They haven’t. They are waiting for you.&#8221; &#8220;Put some water in the washing pot.&#8221; Said he. We did what he ordered. So he washed and wanted to stand up, but he fainted. When he came round he asked again &#8220;Have the people prayed?&#8221; Then the sequence of events took place again and again for the second and the third times from the time he washed to the time he fainted after his attempts to stand up. Therefore he sent to Abû Bakr to lead the prayer himself. Abû Bakr then led the prayer during those days [Sahîh al-Bukhârî, 1/99]. They were seventeen prayers in the lifetime of Muhammad sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Three or four times ‘Aishah talked to the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam to exempt Abû Bakr from leadership in prayer lest people should despair of him, but he refused and said: <em> &#8220;You (women) are like the women who tried to entice Joseph (Yusuf) into immorality. Convey my request to Abû Bakr to lead the prayer.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> A Day or Two prior to Death</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On Saturday or on Sunday, the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam felt that he was well enough to perform the prayer; so he went out leaning on two men in order to perform the noon prayer. Abû Bakr, who was then about to lead the prayer withdrew when he saw him coming; but the Prophet made him a gesture to stay where he was and said: &#8220;Seat me next to him.&#8221; They seated him on the left hand side of Abû Bakr. The Prophet led the prayer, and Abû Bakr followed him and raised his voice at every &#8216;Allâhu Akbar&#8217; (i.e. Allâh is the Greatest) the Prophet said, so that the people may hear clearly. [Sahîh al-Bukhârî 1/98,99]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> A Day before his Death</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On Sunday, a day before he died, the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam set his slaves free, paid as a charity the seven Dinars he owned and gave his weapons as a present to the Muslims. So when night fell ‘Aishah had to borrow some oil from her neighbour to light her oil-lantern. Even his armour was mortgaged as a security with a Jew for thirty Sa’ (a cubic measure) of barley.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Last Day Alive</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In a narration by Anas bin Malik, he said: &#8220;While the Muslims were performing the dawn prayer on Monday — led by Abû Bakr, they were surprised to see the Messenger of Allâh raising the curtain of ‘Aishah’s room. He looked at them while they were praying aligned properly and smiled cheerfully. Seeing him, Abû Bakr withdrew to join the lines and give way to him to lead the prayer. For he thought that the Prophet wanted to go out and pray.&#8221; Anas said: &#8220;The Muslims, who were praying, were so delighted that they were almost too enraptured at their prayers. The Messenger of Allâh made them a gesture to continue their prayer, went into the room and drew down the curtain.&#8221; [ibid. 21640]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allâh sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam did not live for the next prayer time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When it was daytime, the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam called Fatimah and told her something in a secret voice that made her cry. Then he whispered to her something else which made her laugh. ‘Aishah enquired from her after the Prophet’s death, as to this weeping and laughing to which Fatimah replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The first time he disclosed to me that he would not recover from his illness and I wept. Then he told me that I would be the first of his family to join him, so I laughed.&#8221; [Sahîh al-Bukhârî, 2/638]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He gave Fatimah glad tidings that she would become the lady of all women of the world [Rahmat-ul-lil’alameen, 1/282]. Fatimah witnessed the great pain that afflicted her father. So she said: &#8220;What great pain my father is in!&#8221;. To these words, the Prophet remarked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em> &#8220;He will not suffer any more when today is over.&#8221;</em> [Sahîh al-Bukhârî, 2/641]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He asked that Al-Hasan and Al-Husain be brought to him. He kissed them and recommended that they be looked after. He asked to see his wives. They were brought to him. He preached them and told them to remember Allah. Pain grew so much severe that the trace of poison he had at Khaibar came to light. It was so sore that he said to ‘Aishah: <em> &#8220;I still feel the painful effect of that food I tasted at Khaibar. I feel as if death is approaching.&#8221;</em> [ibid, 2/637] He ordered the people to perform the prayers and be attentive to slaves. He repeated it several times. [ibid. 2/637]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam breathes his last</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the pangs of death started, ‘Aishah leant him against her. She used to say: One of Allah’s bounties upon me is that the Messenger of Allâh died in my house, while I am still alive. He died between my chest and neck while he was leaning against me. Allâh has mixed his saliva with mine at his death. For ‘Abdur Rahman &#8211; the son of Abû Bakr &#8211; came in with a Siwak (i.e. the root of a desert plant used for brushing teeth) in his hand, while I was leaning the Messenger of Allâh against me. I noticed that he was looking at the Siwak, so I asked him &#8211; for I knew that he wanted it — &#8220;Would you like me to take it for you?&#8221; He nodded in agreement. I took it and gave it to him. As it was too hard for him, I asked him &#8220;Shall I soften it for you?&#8221; He nodded in agreement. So I softened it with my saliva and he passed it (on his teeth).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another version it is said: &#8220;So he brushed (Istanna) his teeth as nice as he could.&#8221; There was a water container (Rakwa) available at his hand with some water in. He put his hand in it and wiped his face with it and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em> &#8220;There is no god but Allah. Death is full of agonies.&#8221;</em> [Sahîh al-Bukhârî, 2/640]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As soon as he had finished his Siwak, brushing, he raised his hand or finger up, looked upwards to the ceiling and moved his lips. So ‘Aishah listened to him. She heard him say: &#8220;With those on whom You have bestowed Your Grace with the Prophets and the Truthful ones (As-Siddeeqeen), the martyrs and the good doers. O Allâh, forgive me and have mercy upon me and join me to the Companionship on high.&#8221; [ibid, 2/638-641] Then at intervals he uttered these words: &#8220;The most exalted Companionship on high. To Allâh we turn and to Him we turn back for help and last abode.&#8221; This event took place at high morning time on Monday, the twelfth of Rabi’ al-Awwal, in the eleventh year of Al-Hijrah. He was sixty-three years and four days old when he died.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Companions’ concern over the Prophet’s Death</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great (loss) news was soon known by everybody in Madinah. Dark grief spread on all areas and hoirizons of Madinah. Anas said: &#8220;I have never witnessed a day better or brighter than that day on which the Messenger of Allâh sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam came to us; and I have never witnessed a more awful or darker day than that one on which the Messenger of Allâh died on.&#8221; [Mishkat-ul-Masabih, 2/547]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he died, Fatimah said: &#8220;O Father, whom his Lord responded to his supplication! O Father, whose abode is Paradise . O Father, whom I announce his death to Gabriel.&#8221; [Sahîh al-Bukhârî, 2/641]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em> ‘Umar’s Attitude</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Umar, who was so stunned that he almost lost consciousness and stood before people addressing them: &#8220;Some of the hypocrites claim that the Messenger of Allâh sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam died. The Messenger of Allâh did not die, but went to his Lord in the same way as Moses bin ‘Imran did. He stayed away for forty nights, but finally came back though they said he had been dead. By Allah, the Messenger of Allâh will come back and he will cut of the hands and legs of those who claim his death.&#8221; [Ibn Hisham, 2/655]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em> Abû Bakr’s Attitude</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abû Bakr left his house at As-Sunh and came forth to the Mosque on a mare-back. At the Mosque, he dismounted and entered. He talked to nobody but went on till he entered ‘Aishah’s abode, and went directly to where the Messenger of Allâh sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam was. The Prophet was covered with a Yemeni mantle. He uncovered his face and tended down, kissed him and cried. Then he said: &#8220;I sacrifice my father and mother for your sake. Allah, verily, will not cause you to die twice. You have just experienced the death that Allâh had ordained.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he went out and found ‘Umar talking to people. He said: &#8220;‘Umar, be seated.&#8221; ‘Umar refused to do so. People parted ‘Umar and came towards Abû Bakr, who started a speech saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And now, he who worships Muhammad sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, Muhammad is dead now. But he who worships Allah, He is Ever Living and He never dies. Allâh says: <em><strong> ‘Muhammad sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam is no more than a Messenger, and indeed (many) Messengers have passed away before him. If he dies or is killed, will you then turn back on your heels (as disbelievers)? And he who turns back on his heels, not the least harm will he do to Allâh, and Allâh will give reward to those who are grateful.’</strong> &#8221; [3:144] </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Abbas said: &#8220;By Allâh it sounded as if people had never heard such a Qur’aanic verse till Abû Bakr recited it as a reminder. So people started reciting it till there was no man who did not recite it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Al-Musaiyab said that ‘Umar had said: &#8220;By Allâh as soon as I heard Abû Bakr say it, I fell down to the ground. I felt as if my legs had been unable to carry me so I collapsed when I heard him say it. Only then did I realize that Muhammad sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam had really died.&#8221; [Sahîh al-Bukhârî, 2/640,641]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Burial and Farewell Preparations to his Honourable Body</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dispute about who would succeed him broke out even before having the Messenger of Allah’s body prepared for burial. Lots of arguments, discussions, dialogues took place between the Helpers and Emigrants in the roofed passage (portico) of Barn Sa’ida. Finally they acknowledged Abû Bakr (RA) as a caliph. They spent the whole Monday there till it was night. People were so busy with their arguments that it was late night — just about dawn of Tuesday — yet his blessed body was still lying on his bed covered with an inked-garment. He was locked in the room.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On Tuesday, his body was washed with his clothes on. He was washed by Al-’Abbas, &#8216;Alî, Al-Fadl and Qathm — the two sons of Al-’Abbas, as well as Shaqran — the Messenger’s freed slave, Osamah bin Zaid and Aws bin Khauli. Al-’Abbas, Al-Fadi and Qathm turned his body round, whereas Osamah and Shaqran poured out water. &#8216;Alî washed him and Aws leant him against his chest.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They shrouded him in three white Sahooli cotton cloth which had neither a headcloth [Sahîh al-Bukhârî, 1/169, Sahîh Muslim, 1/306] nor a casing and inserted him in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A sort of disagreement arose with regard to a burial place. Abû Bakr said: &#8220;I heard the Messenger of Allâh say:<em> ‘A dead Prophet is buried where he dies.’</em>&#8221; So Abû Talhah lifted the bed on which he died, dug underneath and cut the ground to make the tomb.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People entered the room ten by ten. They prayed for the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam. The first to pray for him were people of his clan. Then the Emigrants, then the Helpers. Women prayed for him after men. The young were the last to pray.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This process took Tuesday long and Wednesday night (i.e. the night which precedes Wednesday morning). ‘Aishah said: &#8220;We did not know that the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam was being buried till we heard the sound of tools digging the ground at the depth of Wednesday night.&#8221; [Mukhtasar Seerat Ar-Rasool, p.471; Ibn Hisham, 2/649-665; Talqeeh Fuhoom Ahl M-Athar, p. 38, 39; Rahmat-ul-lil&#8217;alameen 1/277-286]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>From the &#8216;Invitation to Islam&#8217; Newsletter, Issue 5, October 1998</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars differed as to whether it is permissible to give reward to the dead and whether that reaches them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are two views:<br />
1 – That any righteous deed may be given to the dead and that (the reward) reaches them – such as reading Qur&#8217;aan, fasting, praying and other acts of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 – That no righteous deed reaches the dead except those for which there is evidence that it reaches them. This is the more correct view. The evidence for that is the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):<br />
&#8220;And that man can have nothing but what he does&#8221; [al-Najm 53:39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam said: &#8220;When a man dies all his good deeds come to an end except three: ongoing charity (sadaqah jaariyah), beneficial knowledge and a righteous son who will pray for him.&#8221; Narrated by Muslim, 1631, from the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The paternal uncle of the Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam – Hamzah (may Allaah be pleased with him) – died,<br />
as did his wife Khadeejah and three of his daughters, but it is not narrated that he read Qur&#8217;aan for any of them, or offered a sacrifice or fasted or prayed on their behalf. No such thing has been narrated from any of the Sahaabah either. If it were prescribed, then they would have done it before us. The exceptions for which there is evidence that the reward does reach the deceased are: Hajj, &#8216;Umrah, obligatory fasts, charity and du&#8217;aa&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: &#8221; &#8216;And that man can have nothing but what he does&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this verse al-Shaafa&#8217;i and those who followed him understood that the reward for reading Qur&#8217;aan does not reach the deceased, because it is not something that they did or earned. Hence the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not recommend or encourage his ummah to do that, and he did not tell them to do that through any statement or gesture. Nor is it narrated that any of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) did that. If it were good they would have done that before us. So the acts of worship are restricted to those mentioned in the texts, and there is no room for analogy or personal opinions. With regard to du&#8217;aa&#8217; and charity, there is scholarly consensus that the reward for them reaches the deceased and that they are mentioned in sharee&#8217;ah. Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 4/258.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we assume that the reward for all righteous deeds reaches the deceased, then the best thing that can benefit the deceased is du&#8217;aa&#8217;. So why should we ignore that which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)has encouraged us to do, and turn to other things that he did not do and that none of his companions did? All goodness is to be found in the guidance of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn Baaz</strong> (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about giving the reward for reading Qur&#8217;aan and charity to one&#8217;s mother, whether she is alive or dead.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied: With regard to reading Qur&#8217;aan, the scholars differed as to whether the reward for that will reach the deceased. There are two scholarly views, the more correct of which is that it does not reach the deceased because there is no evidence to that effect. The Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam did not do that for his deceased Muslim loved ones such as his daughters who died during his lifetime, and the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) did not do that or approve of it, as far as we know. It is better for the believer not to do that and not to read Qur&#8217;aan for the dead or the living, or to pray on their behalf, or to observe voluntary fasts on their behalf, because there is no evidence for any of that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The basic principle concerning acts of worship is that we do not do anything except that which is proven to be prescribed by Allaah or His Messenger sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Charity benefits both the living and the dead, according to Muslim consensus. Similarly du&#8217;aa&#8217; benefits both the living and the dead according to Muslim consensus. Undoubtedly the living benefit from charity given by them and by others, and they benefit from du&#8217;aa&#8217;. If a person makes du&#8217;aa&#8217; for his parents when they are alive, they benefit from his du&#8217;aa&#8217;, as they also benefit from charity given on their behalf when they are still alive, and from Hajj done on their behalf if they are unable to do it themselves because of old age or incurable sickness. So a person may benefit them by doing that. Hence it is narrated that a woman said to the Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah, Allaah&#8217;s command to perform Hajj has come when my father is an old man and cannot sit firmly in the saddle. Shall I perform Hajj on his behalf?&#8221; He said: &#8220;Perform Hajj on his behalf.&#8221; Another man came to him and said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah, my father is an old man and cannot perform Hajj or travel; shall I perform Hajj and &#8216;Umrah on his behalf?&#8221; He said: &#8220;Perform Hajj and &#8216;Umrah on behalf of your father.&#8221; This indicates that it is permissible to perform Hajj on behalf of one who has died or on behalf of a living man or woman who is unable to do it because of old age. So giving charity, making du&#8217;aa&#8217; and performing Hajj on behalf of one who has died or one who is unable to do it will benefit him, according to all the scholars. Similarly one may fast on behalf of a deceased person, if he owed an obligatory fast – whether as the result of a vow, as an expiation or to make up for a Ramadaan fast – because of the general meaning of the words of the Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam; &#8220;Whoever dies owing a fast, his heir must observe the fast on his behalf.&#8221; Saheeh – agreed upon. And there are other ahaadeeth which say the same thing. But whoever delays Ramadaan fasts for a legitimate reason, such as sickness or travel, then dies before he is able to make them up, there is no need to fast them on his behalf or feed the poor, because he is excused.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Majmoo&#8217; Fataawa wa Maqaalaat al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 4/348.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn &#8216;Uthaymeen</strong> (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: <span style="color:#993300;">Is it permissible for a man to give money in charity and to share the reward for it with someone else?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied: It is permissible for a person to give money in charity and intend for it to be on behalf of his father, his mother or his brother or anyone else he wants among the Muslims, because the reward is great. If charity is given sincerely for the sake of Allaah and from wealth that is acquired in a halaal manner, then the reward will be multiplied greatly, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The likeness of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allaah, is as the likeness of a grain (of corn); it grows seven ears, and each ear has a hundred grains. Allaah gives manifold increase to whom He wills. And Allaah is All-Sufficient for His creatures&#8217; needs, All-Knower&#8221; [al-Baqarah 2:261]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam used to slaughter a single sheep on behalf of himself and the members of his household. Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen, 18/249</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the above it is clear that what you have mentioned about giving the reward of dhikr to your parents is not correct according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions, whether they are alive or deceased.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather what we advise you to do is to make a great deal of du&#8217;aa&#8217; for them and give charity on their behalf, for all goodness is in following the guidance of the Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam and his noble companions. The scholars are agreed that the benefits of du&#8217;aa&#8217;, praying for forgiveness, giving charity and Hajj reach the deceased.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to du&#8217;aa&#8217; and praying for forgiveness, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And those who came after them say: &#8216;Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in Faith'&#8221; [al-Hashr 59:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam said: &#8220;Pray for forgiveness for your brother and ask that he be made steadfast, for now he is being questioned.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam said: &#8220;When you offer the (funeral) prayer for the deceased, then make du&#8217;aa&#8217; sincerely for him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to charity, it was narrated in al-Saheehayn from &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah that a man said to the Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam: &#8220;My mother died suddenly and she did not leave a will, but I think that if she could have spoken she would have given in charity. Will she have a reward if I give in charity on her behalf?&#8221; The Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam said: &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 1388; Muslim,<br />
no. 1004.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it was narrated by al-Bukhaari from Sa&#8217;d ibn &#8216;Ubaadah that his mother died when he was absent, and he said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah, my mother has died when I was absent. Will it benefit her if I give in charity on her behalf?&#8221; He said: &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said: &#8220;I ask you to bear witness that my garden that bears fruit is given in charity on her behalf.&#8221; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2756.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to Hajj, the Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam said to one who asked him about Hajj: &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think that if your mother had a debt, you would pay it off for her?&#8221; She said: &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said: &#8220;A debt owed to Allaah is more deserving of being paid off.&#8221; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6699; Muslim, 1148.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the above you will know that giving charity on behalf of the deceased will benefit him and its reward will reach him. There is a da&#8217;eef (weak) hadeeth about offering prayer on behalf of the dead. Imam Muslim mentioned in his introduction to his Saheeh that &#8216;Abd-Allaah ibn al-Mubaarak regarded this hadeeth as weak, then he said: There is no difference of opinion concerning giving charity (i.e., on behalf of the dead). End quote.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Nawawi said: &#8220;There is no difference of opinion concerning giving charity (i.e., on behalf of the dead)&#8221; means that this hadeeth is not to be taken as evidence. But whoever wants to honour his parents, let him give charity on their behalf, for (the reward of) charity will reach the deceased and benefit them, and there is no difference of opinion among the Muslims concerning this point. This is the correct view. With regard to the report narrated by the qaadi Abu&#8217;l-Hasan al-Maawardi al-Basri al-Faqeeh al-Shaafa&#8217;i in his book al-Haawi from some of the scholars of al-kalaam, that no reward can reach the deceased after his death, this is a view that is definitely wrong and is clearly contrary to the texts of the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah and the consensus of the ummah, so no attention should be paid to it. With regard to praying and fasting on behalf of the dead, the view of al-Shaafa&#8217;i and the majority of the scholars is that the reward for that does not reach the deceased, unless it is a fast that was obligatory for the deceased, so his heir or someone to whom the heir gives permission makes it up on his behalf. Two views concerning this were narrated from al-Shaafa&#8217;i, the better known of which is that it is not valid; the more correct view according to the later Shaafa&#8217;i scholars is that it is valid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to reading Qur&#8217;aan, the well-known view of the Shaafa&#8217;i madhhab is that the reward for that does not reach the deceased. Some of his companions said that its reward does reach the deceased. Some of the scholars were of the view that the reward of all acts of worship – prayer, fasting, reading Qur&#8217;aan, etc – reaches the deceased… Then al-Nawawi mentioned that the reward for du&#8217;aa&#8217;, charity and Hajj reaches the deceased, according to scholarly consensus. End quote.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It says in Tuhfat al-Muhtaaj (7/72): The deceased can benefit from charity given on his behalf, which includes a waqf of a Mus-haf etc, or digging a well, or planting a tree, whether he does that during his lifetime or it is done by someone else on his behalf after his death. With regard to the best ways of benefiting ones deceased loved ones, you should make a lot of du&#8217;aa&#8217; for him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;and say: &#8216;My Lord! Bestow on them Your Mercy as they did bring me up when I was young'&#8221; [al-Isra&#8217; 17:24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam said: &#8220;When a person dies, all his good deeds come to an end except three: ongoing charity, or beneficial knowledge, or a righteous child who will pray for him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to charity, the best things on which charity may be spent are jihad for the sake of Allaah, building mosques, and helping seekers of knowledge by printing books for them or giving them money that they need. And Allaah knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah, his family, his Companions, and those who follow his guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>There is, in the present time, a tradition in many Islamic countries that when a king or a leader dies, people must mourn for three days or more or less. Flags are lowered at half-mast and the State departments stop working. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Undoubtedly, these acts go against Shari`ah (Islamic law) and entail <strong>imitation of the enemies of Islam</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Authentic Hadiths related from the Prophet (peace be upon him) prohibit and warn people, except a <strong>wife</strong>, against mourning. The maximum period of mourning for a woman is four months and ten days, if the deceased is her husband, and three days or less for relatives. The other practices done during mourning a deceased person, whether a king or a leader, are prohibited in Shari`ah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the lifetime of the Prophet (peace be upon him), his son Ibrahim, his three daughters and others died, but he (peace be upon him) did not mourn them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The leaders who joined the Battle of Mu&#8217;tah, including Zayd ibn Harithah, Ja`far ibn Abu Talib and `Abdullah ibn Rawahah (may Allah be pleased with them) were killed during the Prophet&#8217;s era but he (peace be upon him) did not mourn them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) did not mourn the death of the Prophet (peace be upon him), the best of creation and prophets, nor did they mourn Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him), the best of Sahabah and creation after the prophets. When `Umar, `Uthman and `Aly (may Allah be pleased with them), the best creation after the prophets and Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq, were killed, no one mourned them. The same was true with all the Sahabah and the Imams of Islam and guidance of Tabi`un (Followers, the generation after the Companions of the Prophet) and the next generation including Sa`id ibn Al-Musayyib, `Aly ibn Al-Husayn Zayn Al-`Abidin, his son Muhammad ibn `Aly, `Umar ibn `Abdul-`Aziz,Al-Zuhry, Imam Abu Hanifah, his two companions, Imam Malik ibn Anas, Al-Awza`y, Al-Thawry, Imam Al-Shafi`y, Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal, and Is-haq ibn Rahawayh and many others. No Muslim mourned those people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If this (mourning) were good, the Salaf (righteous predecessors) would have done it. All goodness lies in following them and evil lies in opposing them. Therefore, the Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet) affirmed that what the Salaf did concerning avoiding mourning any person except for a dead husband, is the right action.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The mourning practiced nowadays for the death of kings and leaders is unacceptable in Islam. These practices entail <strong>imitating the enemies of Islam and result in much harm, such as suspension of public services</strong>. Consequently, the Muslim authorities and rulers must abandon these acts of mourning and follow the conduct of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the people of knowledge have to warn and inform Muslims about the ruling on these acts as they are obliged to advise people and cooperate in righteousness and piety.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I, therefore, for the sake of Allah, the Prophet (peace be upon him) and all Muslims, Imams and ordinary people, find it necessary to write this brief statement. I ask Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) to grant Muslim rulers and subjects success to do what pleases Him and to follow Shari`ah and warn against opposing it. May Allah purify our hearts and deeds for He is the All-Hearer of supplication, the Ever-Near. May Allah&#8217;s Peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions.</p>

<blockquote><p>Sahih Bukhari : &#8220;Book of Menses&#8221;: No. 311  &#8211; Narrated Um-&#8216;Atiya:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were forbidden to mourn for a dead person for more than three days except in the case of a husband for whom mourning was allowed for four months and ten days. (During that time) we were <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>not allowed to put kohl</strong></span> (antimony eye powder) in our eyes or to <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>use perfumes</strong></span> or to put on <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>colored clothes</strong></span> except a dress made of &#8216;Asb (a kind of Yemen cloth, very coarse and rough). We were allowed very light perfumes at the time of taking a bath after menses and also we were <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">forbidden to go with the funeral procession</span>. </strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Noble Ayaah indicates that the passage of a human is to pass away, and that Allaah did not make it such that anyone could live for eternity before the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, so eternity is not for the Prophet or for anyone else to remain. But rather everyone is moving towards passing away as Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">كُلُّ مَنۡ عَلَيۡهَا فَانٖ ٢٦ وَيَبۡقَىٰ وَجۡهُ رَبِّكَ ذُو ٱلۡجَلَٰلِ وَٱلۡإِكۡرَامِ ٢٧</h4>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8211; <span style="color:#008000;">Whatsoever is on it (the earth) will perish. And the Face of your Lord full of Majesty and Honour will abide forever.  </span>&#8211;<strong>[Rahman: 26-27]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the people of knowledge said: ‘The Mushrikoon used to reject his -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – Prophet hood, and they would say: ‘Muhammad is a poet we await for him some calamity after some time, and perhaps he will die just like such and such poet died from such and such tribe. So Allaah Ta’ala mentioned that indeed Prophets before you died, and Allaah has power over His religion with victory and protection, this is how the Deen and Sharia of the Prophet is protected.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With this Ayaah, it indicates that al-Khidr has indeed died, whether he was a Wali (friend of Allaah Azza wa Jal), or a Prophet, or Messenger, because he was a human being, and he was present at the time of Moosa –alayhim as-Salaam. And Allaah Azza wa Jal had indeed said:</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">وَمَا جَعَلۡنَا لِبَشَرٖ مِّن قَبۡلِكَ ٱلۡخُلۡدَۖ</h4>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8211; And We granted not to any human being immortality before you (O Muhammad) &#8211;</span></p>
<p><strong>[From ‘Min Kanooz Qur&#8217;aan’ by Shaykh AbdulMuhsin p.118]</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#888888;">Compiled &amp; Translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Ahadeeth of Tawheed from the Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah of Shaykh Al-Albaani </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">Chapters of Tawheed and the Shahadtayn Part 14</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>37- What a Muslim does with his close relative who is a Mushrik And Abu Talib died upon Shirk</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">161- The Messenger of Allaah said to Ali bin Abu Ta lib: &#8216;Go and bury your father.&#8217; He said; &#8216;No, I won&#8217;t bury him, because he died as a Mushrik.&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Messenger said to him: &#8216;Go and bury him, and do n&#8217;t speak to anyone until you come to me. &#8216;I came to him and I had signs of dirt and dust upon me. He ordered me to wash, so I washed and he supplicated for me with supplications which would not please me to exchange anything for them on the face of this earth.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>From the benefits of the hadeeth</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <span style="color:#0000ff;">That it is permissible for a Muslim to take the responsibilities of burying his close Mushrik relative</span>. This does not negate his hate for his relative&#8217;s shirk. Do you not see that &#8216;Alee refused to bury his father for the first time. Whereby, he said: &#8216;he died as a mushrik &#8216; thinking that if he buried him then this would enter into being in alliance with his father which is pro hibited. Like the saying of Allaah Ta’ala: &lt;&lt;<em>Take not as friends the people who incurred the Wrath of Allaah</em> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Messenger ordered him again to bury his father he hastened to fulfill the Messenger&#8217;s order. And he left that which seemed to be correct to him the first time. It is also from obedience, that a person leaves his own opinion for the command of his Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It appears to me that the son burying his mushrik father or his mother is the last of what the son possesses of good companionship wit h his mushrik father in this world. As for after the burial then it is not allowed for him to pray for him, nor seek forgiveness for him, this is due to the clear statement of Allaah Ta&#8217;ala: &lt;&lt; <em>It is not proper for the Prophet and those who believe to ask Allaah&#8217;s Forgiveness for the Mushrikeen even though they be of kin</em> &gt;&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">So, if this is the case, what is the situation of t he one who supplicates for mercy and forgiveness on the pages of newspapers and magazines for some of the kuffar , announcing their deaths, for a small amount of dirhams !</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who is concerned for his hereafter should fear Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- <span style="color:#0000ff;">It is not legislated for him to wash the unbeliever, nor should he shroud him. And nor should he pray upon him</span> even if he is a close relative, since, the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam did not order Alee to do so. If this had been permissible, the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam would have mentioned it, since delaying the explanation of an order when there is a need for it, is not permissible. This is the Madhab of the Hambalees and other than them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- <span style="color:#0000ff;">It is not legislated for the relatives of that Mushrik to follow the funeral procession</span>. Because the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam did not do this for his uncle. His uncle was the kindest and the most compassionate of the people to him. Even to the extent that the Prophet supplicated to Allaah for him, whereby his uncle&#8217;s punishment will be the least in the Hellfire, as has been previously explained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in all of this there is a lesson for those peop le who have been deceived by their ancestry, but they do not do any thing for their hereafter with their Lord, and Allaah the Great spoke the truth when He said: &lt;&lt; <em>There will be no kinship among them that Day, nor will they ask of one another.</em> &gt;&gt;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-2a6" target="_blank"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>The bequest of Nooh – alayhi as-Sallam</strong></span></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">134 &#8211; &#8220;When death was approaching the Prophet of Allaah Nooh -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – he said to his son: I will narrate to you my bequest; I command you with two things and prohibit you from two things. I command you with <strong>&#8216;La ilaha ‘illa Allaah&#8217;</strong> (‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah) if the seven heavens and the seven earths were placed upon a scale and &#8216;La ilaha ‘illa Allaah&#8217; was placed on the other, then &#8216;La ilaha ‘illa Allaah&#8217; would be heavier.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">If the seven heavens and the seven earths were a closed off circle then &#8216;La ilaha ‘illa Allaah&#8217; would be able to break it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The second thing I command you with is <strong>Subhana Allaahi wa bihamdihi</strong> (Far is Allaah from imperfection and praise is for Him), since it is a supplication for everything, and by it the creation is given its provision. I prohibit you from shirk and pride.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8211;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">( the narrator said: I asked or someone asked) : O Messenger of Allaah as for shirk then we know about it, but what is pride? Is it that one of us has sandals with two good straps?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Messenger answered: No.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">He asked again: is it that one of us has companions and they sit with him?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Messenger again answered: No.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Someone asked: O Messenger of Allaah, what is pride?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">He said: <strong>ridiculing the truth and belittling the people and reviling them</strong>.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Silsilah Saheehah: 134</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>From the benefits of the hadeeth</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: there are many benefits from this hadeeth; I will suffice by indicating to some of them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- The permissibility of <strong>writing a bequest</strong> at the time of death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- The excellence of saying <strong>&#8216;La ilaha ‘illa Allaah&#8217;</strong> and saying <strong>Subhana Allaah</strong> and that they are a cause for the creation to receive provision from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- <strong>The scales</strong> on the Day of Judgment are true and real, and they have two pans. This is from the belief of the ahl-ul Sunnah, opposing that of the Mu&#8217;tazilah and their followers in the modern times. Who do not believe that which has been affirmed regarding &#8216;Aqeedah in the authentic Ahadeeth, with the claim that these are Ahkbaar al-Ahad (singular narrations) which do not convey certainty. I have exposed this claim in my book &#8216;with ustaadh at-Tantawee&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 &#8211; <strong>The seven earths are like the seven heavens</strong>. There are many Ahadeeth regarding this in Bukharee and Muslim and in other books. Perhaps one day we will have time to follow up these Ahadeeth and research them. What supports these Ahadeeth is the saying of Allaah Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217; aala : &lt;&lt; <em><span style="color:#008000;">I</span><span style="color:#008000;">t is Allaah Who has created seven heavens and of the earth the like thereof (i.e. seven).</span></em> &gt;&gt; I.e. they are similar in creation and in number.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, you should not pay any attention to the one who explains it away, there by it ends up as a negation of similarity as well as in numbers, being deceived by the Europeans and where their knowledge has reached to, from having gone up in to space however they do not know of seven earths, along with that they do not know about seven heavens. Will we reject the speech of Allaah and the speech of His Messenger due to the ignorance of the Europeans and others along with them, declaring that the more they increase their knowledge of the universe, the more they increase in their ignorance of it. Allaah the Most Great has spoken the truth when He said : &lt;&lt; <em><span style="color:#008000;">And of knowledge, you (mankind) have been given only a little</span></em>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 &#8211; <strong>That beautification with good clothing</strong> has nothing to do with pride what so ever. Rather, it is a matter which is permissible, because Allaah is Beautiful and He loves beauty, like the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – said regarding this issue, as is narrated by Muslim in his &#8216;Saheeh&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6- <strong>Pride</strong> which has been equated with Shirk will not allow entrance in to Paradise for the one who has an equivalent of an atoms worth. <span style="color:#ff6600;">That is the pride, which is rejecting the truth after it has been made clear, and defaming innocent people without truth</span>. So, the Muslim should be extremely cautious from being characterized with this type of pride, just like he should be extremely cautious from being characterized with the Shirk which places its companion in the Hell-fire for eternity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">We prepare for many things in life; a new job, moving, a visitor coming&#8230; even just to leave the house, we prepare. So what preparations are we making for the Hereafter?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">What is the interpretation of seeing a deceased every time in dreams?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one sees a deceased in a good state in a dream, this lends hope that he is in a good state. If one sees him in another type of state, this could simply be devils taking on the form of people. Devils take on the shapes of people in a disliked situation in order to grieve the living. This is because devils are very avaricious to do anything that brings grief, worry and sadness to the believers. Allah has said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Secret counsels are only from Satan, in order that he may cause grief to the believers. But he cannot harm them in the least, except as Allah permits&#8221;</span></strong> (al-Mujadalah 10).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a person sees something evil for a deceased in a dream, he must seek refuge in Allah from the evil of Satan and the evil of what he saw. He should not communicate that dream to anyone concerning that deceased. In that way, the deceased will not harm whatsoever. In fact, any time a person sees something disturbing in a dream, he should then seek refuge in Allah from the evil of Satan and the evil of what he saw. Then he should spit three times on his left side. He should then change his side upon which he was sleeping to the other side. If he makes ablution and prays, that is better and superior. He should not communicate that dream to anyone and, in that case, he will not be harmed by it at all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tafseer Ibn Katheer &#8211; Suratul Baqarah [Surah No.2]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;">(155. And certainly, We shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits, but give glad tidings to As-Sabirin (the patient).)</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966;"> (156. Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: &#8220;Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.&#8221;)</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966;"> (157. They are those on whom are the Salawat (i.e., who are blessed and will be forgiven) from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His mercy, and it is they who are the guided ones.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah informs us that He tests and tries His servants, just as He said in another Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And surely, We shall try you till We test those who strive hard (for the cause of Allah) and As-Sabirin (the patient), and We shall test your facts (i.e., the one who is a liar, and the one who is truthful).)</strong> (47:31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, He tests them with the bounty sometimes and sometimes with the afflictions of fear and hunger. Allah said in another Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So Allah made it taste extreme of hunger (famine) and fear.) (16:112)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The frightened and the hungry persons show the effects of the affliction outwardly and this is why Allah has used here the word `Libas&#8217; (cover or clothes) of fear and hunger. In the Ayat above, Allah used the words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(with something of fear, hunger,) meaning, a little of each. Then (Allah said),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(loss of wealth,) meaning, some of the wealth will be destroyed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(lives) meaning, losing friends, relatives and loved ones to death,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and fruits,) meaning, the gardens and the farms will not produce the usual or expected amounts. This is why Allah said next:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(but give glad tidings to As-Sabirin (the patient).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then explained whom He meant by `the patient&#8217; whom He praised:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: &#8220;Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.&#8221;)</strong> meaning, those who recite this statement to comfort themselves in the face of their loss, know that they belong to Allah and that He does what He wills with His servants. They also know that nothing and no deed, even if it was the weight of an atom, will be lost with Allah on the Day of Resurrection. These facts thus compel them to admit that they are Allah&#8217;s servants and that their return will be to Him in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(They are those on whom are the Salawat (i. e., who are blessed and will be forgiven)</strong> from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His mercy,) meaning, Allah&#8217;s praise and mercy will be with them. Sa`id bin Jubayr added, &#8220;Meaning, safety from the torment.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(and it is they who are the guided ones.)</strong> `Umar bin Al-Khattab commented: &#8220;What righteous things, and what a great heights.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(They are those on whom are the Salawat from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His mercy) are the two righteous things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and it is they who are the guided ones) are the heights.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The heights means more rewards, and these people will be awarded their rewards and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are several Ahadith that mention the <strong>rewards of admitting</strong> that the return is to Allah by saying:(&#8220;Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.&#8221;) when afflictions strike.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For instance, Imam Ahmad reported that Umm Salamah narrated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once, Abu Salamah came back after he was with Allah&#8217;s Messenger and said: I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger recite a statement that made me delighted. He said:(No Muslim is struck with an affliction and then says Istirja` when the affliction strikes, and then says: `O Allah! Reward me for my loss and give me what is better than it,&#8217; but Allah will do just that.) Umm Salamah said: So I memorized these words. When Abu Salamah died I said Istirja` and said: &#8220;O Allah! Compensate me for my loss and give me what is better than it.&#8221; I then thought about it and said, &#8220;Who is better than Abu Salamah&#8221; When my `Iddah (the period of time before the widow or divorced woman can remarry) finished, Allah&#8217;s Messenger asked for permission to see me while I was dyeing a skin that I had. I washed my hands, gave him permission to enter and handed him a pillow, and he sat on it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then asked me for marriage and when he finished his speech, I said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! It is not because I do not want you, but I am very jealous and I fear that you might experience some wrong mannerism from me for which Allah would punish me. I am old and have children.&#8221; He said: (As for the jealousy that you mentioned, Allah the Exalted will remove it from you. As for your being old as you mentioned, I have suffered what you have suffered. And for your having children, they are my children too.) She said, &#8220;I have surrendered to Allah&#8217;s Messenger.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Messenger married her and Umm Salamah said later, &#8220;Allah compensated me with who is better than Abu Salamah: Allah&#8217;s Messenger .&#8217; [ Muslim reported a shorter version of this Hadith]</p>
