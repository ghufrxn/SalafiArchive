										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 21 : Point 23</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> in the descent of `Eesaa ibn Maryam <em>`alayhis-salaam</em>. He will descend and he will kill the Dajjaal. He will marry and he will pray behind the one who will be in authority from the family of Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And he will die and the Muslims will bury him.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F366648749&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/eemaan-in-the-descent-of-eesaa-ibn-maryam-alayhis-salaam" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And to have <em>eemaan</em> in the descent of `Eesaa ibn Maryam <em>`alayhissalaatu was-salaam</em> (may Allaah extol him and grant him peace and security).”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he will be from the major signs of the hour.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His ‘<strong>descent</strong>’, meaning from heaven, because Allaah raised him up when the Jews wanted to kill him. And they came to him to kill him and to crucify him, and they entered upon him. Allaah raised him up from amongst them, whilst they were not aware, and he caused another man to look like him. So they killed that man thinking that it was the Messiah, and it was not him. He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they did not kill him and they did not crucify him but it was made to appear so to them</strong></span> (Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), aayah 157)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah caused this man to resemble him. It is said that this man was the one who guided them to him, so therefore Allaah punished him. Or it is said that he was from the followers of `Eesaa from the disciples, that `Eesaa <em>`alayhis-salaam</em> said to him, “You shall be given my appearance and Paradise shall be for you.” So the man had patience and he accepted this resemblance and being killed and being crucified, because he wanted Paradise through that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying that, <strong>“He will descend and he will kill the Dajjaal.”</strong> He will kill the Dajjaal at the gate of Ludd. And it, Ludd, is a well-known place. `Eesaa ibn Maryam <em>`alayhissalaam</em> will chase the Dajjaal. When he (the Dajjaal) sees him, he will dissolve away, just as salt dissolves in water. Then he will draw close to him and strike him with his spear and kill him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And he will marry and he will pray behind the one in authority from the family of Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>”</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And he will marry,”</strong> this occurs in some reports, however it is not established. [01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the fact that he will pray behind the Mahdee then this is established. The Mahdee will ask him to lead the Muslims in Prayer because he will descend at the time of the Fajr prayer. And the Muslims will be gathered for the prayer. So the Mahdee will request from him that he should lead the Muslims in prayer. So the Messiah will say, <strong><span style="color:#808000;">“No some of you are Imaams for the rest.”</span></strong> [02] So he will pray behind the Mahdee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the one in charge he is the Mahdee. (His name will be) Muhammad ibn ` Abdillaah (Muhammad the son of `Abdullaah). His name will be the same as the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and the name of his father will be the like the name of the father of the Messenger. And he will be of the family (descendants) of al-Hassan ibn `Alee <em>radiyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>. They (the People of Knowledge) said, the wisdom, and Allaah knows best, is that al-Hasan <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>, when he stepped down from the Khilaafah in favour of Mu`aawiyah in order to preserve the blood of the Muslims, then because of this, Allaah honoured him and made the Mahdee from his descendants.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying,<strong> “And he will die and the Muslims will bury him.”</strong> This is in the Qur&#8217;aan. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There is not anyone from the people of the Book except that he will believe in him before his </strong>(`Eesaa’s [03] )<strong> death</strong></span>. (Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), aayah 159)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he will die, just as the rest of mankind die.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We did not grant everlasting life to any human before you. So if you die, will they then live forever?</span></strong> (Sooratul-Anbiyaa· (21), aayah 34)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he will die <em>`alayhis-salaatu was-salaam</em> at the end of the life which Allaah has written for him. And the Muslims will bury him, just as they bury their dead. [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] This is related from Ibn `Abbaas. Refer to Fat.hul-Baari and `Umdatul-Qaari (Translator’s Note: two of the explanations of al-Bukhaaree).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Ibnul-Jowzee mentions such a report in al-`Ilal al-Mutanaahiyah, he mentions as a narration of `Abdullaah ibn `Amr as a hadeeth with regard to `Eesaa coming down and getting married. And Ibnul-Jowzee said, “This hadeeth is not authentic.” And Shaykh al-Albaanee said the same about this report in ad-Da`eefah (no. 6562) that this report is munkar, meaning weak/contradictory to what is authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The wording of that report is, that “Eesaa ibn Maryam will descend to the earth and he will marry and he will have offspring and he will remain for forty-five years. Then he will die and he will be buried along with me in my grave. So I and `Eesaa ibn Maryam will get up from one grave in between Aboo Bakr and `Umar.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] Reported by Muslim in his Saheeh from the hadeeth of Jaabir with the wording: So `Eesaa will descend and their leader will say, “Come and lead us in prayer.” So he will say, “<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>No, some of you (or one of you) will lead the others in Prayer as an honour from Allaah upon this nation</strong></span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> As is authentic from Ibn `Abbaas radiyAllaahu `anhumaa, meaning before the death of `Eesaa ibn Maryam `alayhis-salaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> A hadeeth which mentions that is reported by Aboo Daawood (no. 4324), a hadeeth of Aboo Hurayrah radiyAllaahu `anhu that the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said, “There is not between me and him (`Eesaa ibn Maryam) a Prophet; and he will descend&#8230;” the hadeeth. At the end of the hadeeth there occurs: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“And he will destroy the Maseehud-Dajjaal. And he will remain upon the earth for forty years. Then he will die and the Muslims will pray over him</strong></span>.” (pray funeral prayer over him)” Shaykh al-Albaanee said about this hadeeth, “Saheeh.”</p>

<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And to have eemaan in al-Maseehud-Dajjaal (the False Messiah).</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F366642413&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/eemaan-in-al-maseehud-dajjaal-the-false-messiah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the fundamentals of the Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah is to have eemaan in al-Maseehud-Dajjaal. And he is a man from the descendants of Aadam who will emerge amongst the Jews, and the Jews will follow him. And he is the Mahdee who the Jews are awaiting, because everyone lays claim to the Mahdee (this awaited Messiah). <strong>The Jews</strong> lay claim to him, and their Messiah is the al-Maseehud-Dajjaal. <strong>The Shee`ah</strong> are awaiting for the Mahdee who is hidden in the cave, as they say, who is from the descendants of al-Husayn <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>. Whereas the <strong>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah</strong>, they are waiting for the Mahdee whom the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam foretold about in the authentic ahaadeeth which are mutawaatir (reported in huge numbers) in meaning. And he will be a man from the family of the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> from the family of al-Hasan ibn `Alee. He will emerge at the end of time and the Muslims will give him pledge (bay `ah). And he will fight jihaad in Allaah’s cause. And he will fill the earth with justice. And he will lead the Muslims in Prayer. And whilst they are in that condition, al-Maseehud-Dajjaal will emerge. So the Muslims will continue to suffer from him until `Eesaa ibn Maryam `alayhis-salaam descends. So there are two Messiahs:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Messiah of misguidance and he is the Dajjaal, and</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Messiah of right guidance, and he is `Eesaa ibn Maryam <em>`alayhissalaatu was-salaam</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And al-Maseehud-Dajjaal, he is called al-Maseeh because of how quickly he can travel across the earth, because Allaah will make for him means that enable him to proceed quickly upon the earth to cause harm and to bring about evil and tribulations. And he is called ad-Dajjaal which is from the word ad-dajal which means falsehood, because the Dajjaal is the one who is extreme in ad-dajal, falsehood, because he is a great liar to the extent that he will claim that he is Allaah. And the people will be put to trial on account of him except for whomever Allaah makes firm. And there will be with him a garden and a fire. And he will work ‘miracles’, but they are supernatural events of devils; they are not karaamaat (miracles granted for righteous people), they are just supernatural events of the devils. Allaah will cause them to occur at his hand as a trial and as a test for the servants. So his danger is great; and therefore the Prophets warned against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the one who warned most against him is our Prophet Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And he commanded that we should seek refuge from his trial in our prayers in the last tashahhud when we seek refuge with Allaah from four: from the punishment of Hellfire and from the punishment of the grave and from the trials of life and death and from the trial of al-Maseehud-Dajjaal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his trial will be the greatest trial to occur upon the face of the earth, and Allaah’s refuge is sought. This is al-Maseehud-Dajjaal. And whilst he is like that, and he will have caused hardship to the Muslims and harmed them and put them to trial, then the Messiah `Eesaa ibn Maryam will descend from heaven. And he will chase the Dajjaal and he will kill him and relieve the Muslims from him. And he will take charge of the affair, and he will bring about justice upon the earth. And he will break the cross and kill the pigs and no religion will remain except for the religion of Islaam. Judaism, Christianity and the religions of the disbelievers will be abolished and nothing will remain except for Islaam. And he will judge with the sharee `ah, revealed law, given to Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. And he will be a follower of him, because there is no Prophet after Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. So the Messiah will descend as a follower of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and as one who judges by his revealed law, the sharee `ah of Islaam. This is what will occur with regard to the emergence of the Dajjaal and the descent of the Messiah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And `Eesaa is called Maseeh (Messiah), it is said, because he would wipe upon a person suffering an ailment and he would be cured by the permission of Allaah. And this was from his miracles `alayhis-salaatu was-salaam, that he would wipe with his hand upon the blind and the leper and a person born blind and his illness would pass away by his wiping upon him `alayhis-salaatu was-salaam. So therefore he was called al-Maseeh with the meaning of one who wipes.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><small><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do they then wait for anything other than that the angels should come to them, or that your Lord should come, or that some of the Signs of your Lord should come (i.e. portents of the Hour e.g., arising of the sun from the west)! The day that some of the Signs of your Lord do come, no good will it do to a person to believe then, if he believed not before, nor earned good (by performing deeds of righteousness) through his Faith. Say: &#8220;Wait you! we (too) are waiting.&#8221; </strong></span>(Qur&#8217;an 6:158 &#8211; Muhsin Khan &amp; Hilali Translation)</small></p>

Chapter 370<br />
Ahadith about Dajjal and Portents of the Hour</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1808.</b> An-Nawwas bin Sam`an (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: One morning the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) made a mention of Dajjal, and he described him to be insignificant and at the same time described him so significant that we thought he was on the date-palm trees (i.e., nearby). When we went to him (the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) in the evening, he perceived the sign of fear on our faces. He said, &#8220;What is the matter with you?&#8221; We said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, you talked about Dajjal this morning raising your voice and lowering it until we thought he was hiding in the palm-trees grove: He said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Something other than Dajjal make worry about you. If he appears while I am with you, I will defend you against him. But if he appears after I die, then everyone of you is his own defender. Allah is the One Who remains after me to guide every Muslim. Dajjal will be a young man with very curly hair with one eye protruding (with which he cannot see). I compare (his appearance) to that of Al-`Uzza bin Qatan. He who amongst you survives to see him, should recite over him the opening Ayat of Surat Al-Kahf (i.e., Surat 18: Verses 1-8). He will appear on the way between Syria and Iraq and will spread mischief right and left. O slaves of Allah! Remain adhered to the truth</span>.&#8221; We asked: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! How long will he stay on the earth?&#8221; He said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">For forty days. One day will be like a year, one day like a month, one day like a week and the rest of the days will be like your days</span>.&#8221; We said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Will one day&#8217;s Salat (prayer) suffice for the Salat of that day which will be equal to one year?&#8221; Thereupon he said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">No, but you must make an estimate of time and then offer Salat</span>.&#8221; We said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! How quickly will he walk upon the earth?&#8221; Thereupon he said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Like cloud driven by the wind (i.e., very quickly). He will come to the people and call them to his obedience and they will affirm their faith in him and respond to him. He will then give command to the sky and it will send its rain upon the earth and he will then send his command to the earth and it will grow vegetation. Then in the evening their pasturing animals will come to them with their humps very high and their udders full of milk and their flanks stretched. He will then come to another people and invite them, but they will reject him and he will leave them, in barren lands and without any goods and chattels! He would then walk through the waste land and say to it: `Bring forth your treasures&#8217;, and the treasures will come out and follow him like swarms of bees. He will then call a person brimming with youth and strike him with the sword and cut him into two pieces and make these pieces lie at a distance, which is generally between the archer and his target. He will then call that young man and he will come forward, laughing, with his face gleaming out of joy; and it will be at this very time that Allah will send `Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary) who will descend at the white minaret in the eastern side of Damascus, wearing two garments lightly dyed and placing his hands on the wings of two angels. When he will lower his head, there would fall drops of water from his head, and when he will raise it up, drops like pearls would scatter from it. Every disbeliever who will find his (i.e., `Isa&#8217;s) smell will die and his smell will reach as far as he will be able to see. He will then search for Dajjal until he will catch hold of him at the gate of Ludd (village near Jerusalem), and will kill him. Then the people, whom Allah will have protected, will come to `Isa son of Maryam, and he will wipe their faces and will inform them of their ranks in Jannah, and it will be under such conditions that Allah will reveal to `Isa these words: `I have brought forth from amongst my slaves such people against whom none will be able to fight, so take these people safely to the mountain.&#8217; And then Allah will send Ya&#8217;juj and Ma&#8217;juj (Gog and Magog people) and they will sworn down from every slope. The first of them will pass the Lake Tabariyah (near the Dead Sea in Palestine) and drink all its water. And when the last of them will pass, he will say: `There was once water there.&#8217; Prophet `Isa (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and his companions will then be so much hard-pressed that the head of an ox will be dearer to them than one hundred dinar, and `Isa along with his companions, will make supplication to Allah, Who will send insects which will attack their (Ya&#8217;juj and Ma&#8217;juj people) neck until they all will perish like a single person. Prophet, `¦sa and his companions will then come down and they will not find in the earth as much space as a single span which would not be filled with their corpses and their stench. Prophet `Isa and his companions will then again beseech Allah, Who will send birds whose necks will be like those of Bactrian camels, and they will carry them and throw them where Allah will desire. Then Allah will send down rain which will spare no house in the city or in the countryside. It would wash away the earth until it appears like a mirror. Then the earth will be told to bring forth its fruit and restore its blessings; and as a result of this, there will grow such a big pomegranate that a group of people will eat from it and seek shelter under its skin. Milk will be so blessed that the milk of one she-camel will suffice for a large company and the cow will give so much milk, that it will suffice for a whole tribe. The sheep will give so much milk that the whole family will be able to drink out of that, and at that time Allah will send a pleasant wind which will soothe people even under their armpits, and will take the life of every Muslim and true believer, and only the wicked will survive. They will commit adultery in public like asses and the Resurrection Day will be held</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1809.</b> Rib`i bin Hirash (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I accompanied Abu Mas`ud Al-Ansari to Hudaifah bin Al-Yaman (May Allah be pleased with them). Abu Mas`ud said to him: &#8220;Tell us what you heard from the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) about Dajjal (the Antichrist).&#8221; Hudaifah said: He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Dajjal will appear, and with him will be water and fire. That which people consider to be water will in fact be a burning fire, and that which people will consider to be fire will in fact be cool and sweet water. He who from amongst you happens to face him, should jump into that which he sees as fire for that will be nice and sweet water.</span>&#8221; Abu Mas`ud said: &#8220;I have also heard this from the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam).&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1810.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Dajjal (the Antichrist) will appear in my Ummah and he will stay in the world for forty. I do not know whether this will be forty days or forty months or forty years. Allah will then send (Prophet) `Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary). `Isa will pursue him and slaughter him. Then people will survive for seven years (i.e., after the demise of `Isa) in the state that there will be no rancour between two persons. Then Allah will send a cool breeze from the side of Ash-Sham. None will remain upon the face of the earth having the smallest particle of good or Faith in him but he will die, so much so that even if someone amongst you will enter the innermost part of a mountain, this breeze will reach that place also and will cause him to die. Only the wicked people will survive and they will be as fast as birds (i.e., to commit evil) and as ferocious towards one another as wild beasts. They will never appreciate the good, nor condemn evil. Then Shaitan (Satan) will come to them in the garb of a man and will say: `Will you not obey me?&#8217; They will say: `What do you order us to do?&#8217; He will command them to worship idols. They will have abundance of sustenance and will lead comfortable lives. Then the Trumpet will be blown. Every one hearing it, will turn his neck towards it and will raise it. The first one to hear that Trumpet will be a man who will be busy repairing the basin for his camels. He will become unconscious. Allah will send, or will cause to send, rain which will be like dew and there will grow out of it (like wild growth) the bodies of the people. Then the second Trumpet will be blown and they will stand up and begin to look around. Then it will be said: `O people! Go to your Rubb.&#8217; Then there will be a command: `Make them stand there.&#8217; After it they will be called to account. Then it will be said: `Separate from them the share of the Fire.&#8217; It will be asked: `How much?&#8217; It will be said: `Nine hundred and ninety-nine out of every thousand.&#8217; That will be the Day which will make children hoary-headed men because of its terror and that will be the Day when the Shin will be uncovered</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1811.</b> Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">There will be no land which will not be trampled by Dajjal (the Antichrist) but Makkah and Al-Madinah; and there will be no passage leading to them which will not be guarded by the angels, arranged in rows. Dajjal will appear in a barren place adjacent to Al-Madinah and the city will be shaken three times. Allah will expel from it every disbeliever and hypocrite.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1812.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Dajjal (the Antichrist) will be followed by seventy thousand Jews of Isfahan and will be dressed in robes of green coloured satin</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1813.</b> Umm Sharik (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: I heard the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">People will run away from Dajjal (the Antichrist) seeking shelter in the mountains.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1814.</b> `Imran bin Hussain (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Between time of the creation of Adam and the Resurrection Day, there is nothing greater than the mischief of Dajjal (the Antichrist).</span>&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1815.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Dajjal (the Antichrist) will come forth and a person from amongst the believers will go towards him and the armed watchmen of Dajjal will meet him and they will say to him: `Where do you intend to go?&#8217; He will say: `I intend to go to this one who has appeared.&#8217; They will say to him: `Don&#8217;t you believe in our lord (meaning Dajjal)?&#8217; He will say: `There (i.e., we know Him to be Allah, Alone, without any partners) is nothing hidden about our Rubb.&#8217; Some of them will say: `Let us kill him&#8217;, but some others will say: `Has your lord (Dajjal) not forbidden you to kill anyone without his consent?&#8217; So they will take him to Dajjal. When the believer will see him, he will say: `O people! This is Dajjal about whom the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) has informed us.&#8217; Dajjal will have him laid on his stomach and have his head. He will be struck on his back and on his stomach. Dajjal will ask him: `Don&#8217;t you believe in me?&#8217; He will say: `You are the false Messiah.&#8217; He will then give his order to have him sawn with a saw into two from the parting of his hair up to his legs. After that Dajjal will walk between the two halves and will say to him: `Stand up&#8217;, and he will stand on his feet. He will then say to him: `Don&#8217;t you believe in me?&#8217; The person will say: `It has added to my insight that you are Dajjal&#8217;. He will add: `O people! He will not be able to behave with anyone amongst people in such a manner after me.&#8217; Dajjal will try to kill him. The space between his neck and collarbone will turn into copper and he will find no way to kill him. So he will catch hold of him by his hand and feet and throw him into (what appears to be the fire). The people will think that he has been thrown into the fire whereas he will be thrown into Jannah.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) added, &#8220;He will be the most eminent amongst the people with regard to martyrdom near the Rubb of the worlds</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1816.</b> Al-Mughirah bin Shu`bah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: No one asked the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) more about Dajjal than I asked him. He said to me, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He will not harm you</span>.&#8221; I said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, it is reported that he will have with him a mountain of bread and a river full of water.&#8221; Thereupon he said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He (Dajjal) is far too worthless and insignificant near Allah (to let him deceive the believers).</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1817.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">There has not been a Prophet who has not warned his Ummah of that one-eyed liar (Dajjal). Behold, he is blind in one eye and your Rubb (Allah) is not blind. On his forehead are the letters: (K.F.R.) (meaning Kafir- disbeliever</span>).&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1818.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Let me tell you something about Dajjal (the Antichrist) which no Prophet had told his people. He is blind (in one eye) and will bring with him something like Jannah and Hell; but what he calls Jannah will be in fact Hell</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1819.</b> `Abdullah bin `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) said: One day the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) mentioned Al-Masih Dajjal (the Antichrist) in the presence of the people and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Verily, Allah is not one-eyed but Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal is blind in the right eye which looks like a swollen grape</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1820.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah(sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The Last Hour will not come until the Muslims fight against the Jews, until a Jew will hide himself behind a stone or a tree, and the stone or the tree will say: `O Muslim, there is a Jew behind me. Come and kill him,&#8217; but Al-Gharqad tree will not say so, for it is the tree of the Jews.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1821.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, the world will not come to an end until a man passes by a grave and will lie over it saying, `Would that I were in this grave (i.e., dead)!&#8217; Not he will say so because of religious reasons but because of widespread mischief and severe trials of this world</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1822.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The Hour will not come to pass before the River Euphrates dries up to unveil the mountain of gold, for which people will fight. Ninety-nine out of one hundred will die (in the fighting) and every man amongst them will say: `Perhaps I may be the only one to remain alive</span>.&#8221;&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The time is near when the River Euphrates will dry up to unveil a treasure of gold. Whosoever may be alive at that time, should not take anything of it</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1823.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">People will desert Al-Madinah in spite of it being in better condition except for wild beasts and birds. The Last Hour will happen upon two shepherds of the tribe of Muzainah. They will enter Al-Madinah driving their sheep but will find it full of wild beasts and would turn away. When they will arrive at the hill named Thaniyyat-ul-Wada` they will fall on their faces.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1824.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">From your caliphs there will be one in the Last Days who will distribute wealth without counting it</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1825.</b> Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">A time will come when a man will go about with alms from his gold and will not find anyone to receive it. One man will be seen being followed by forty women dependant upon him on account of the scarcity of men and excess of women.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1826.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">A man bought a piece of land from another man, and the buyer found a jar filled with gold in the land. The buyer said to the seller: `Take your gold, as I bought only the land from you and not the gold.&#8217; The owner of the land said: `I sold you the land with everything in it.&#8217; So both of them took their case before a third man who asked: `Have you any children?&#8217; One of them said: `I have a boy.&#8217; The other said, `I have a girl.&#8217; The man said: `Marry the girl to the boy and spend the money on them; and whatever remains give it in charity.</span>&#8221;&#8217;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1827.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">There were two women, each had her child with her. A wolf came and took away the child of one of them. One woman said to her companion: `The wolf has taken your son.&#8217; The other said: `It has taken your son.&#8217; So both of them took the dispute to Prophet Dawud (David) (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) who judged that the boy should be given to the older lady. Then they went to Prophet Sulaiman (Solomon) (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) son of Dawud and put the case before him. Prophet Sulaiman said: `Give me a knife so that I may cut the child into two and give one half to each of you.&#8217; The younger woman said: `Do not do so; may Allah bless you!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1865.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">A man (from amongst the people before you) said: `Indeed! I will give in charity.&#8217; So he took his Sadaqah out and placed it in a thief&#8217;s hand. In the morning the people were talking (about this incident) and saying: `Sadaqah was given to a thief last night.&#8217; The man said: `O Allah! Praise be to You. I have given Sadaqah to a thief. Indeed, I will give in charity!&#8217; So he took his Sadaqah out and he placed it in a prostitute&#8217;s hand. In the morning the people were talking (about this incident) and saying: `Sadaqah was given to a prostitute last night.&#8217; On hearing this, the man said: `Praise be to You, O Allah! I gave Sadaqah to a prostitute. Indeed, I will give in charity!&#8217; So he took his Sadaqah out and placed it in a rich man&#8217;s hand. In the morning the people were talking (about this incident) and saying: `Sadaqah was given to a rich man last night.&#8217; The man said: `O Allah! Praise be to You (for helping me) give charity to a thief, a prostitute and a rich man.&#8217; Then he had a dream in which he was told that his Sadaqah to the thief might result in his refraining from his theft, his Sadaqah to the prostitute might help her abstain from her immorality, and his Sadaqah to the rich man might help him pay heed and spend from what Allah had bestowed upon him</span>.&#8221;<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1866.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: We accompanied the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) to a banquet. The meat of the forearm was presented to him as he was very fond of it. The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) ate a morsel of it and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">I will be the master of all the people on the Day of Resurrection. Do you know why? Allah will gather all human beings, past and present generations on the same ground so that the announcer may be able to make them all hear his voice and the onlookers may be able to see all of them. The sun will come very close to the people, they will suffer such distress and trouble as they will not be able to bear. Then the people will say: `Do you see our (miserable) condition? You should look for someone who can intercede for you with your Rubb.&#8217; Some people will say to the others: `Go to your father, Adam.&#8217; So they will go to Adam and say to him: `You are the father of mankind; Allah created you with His Own Hand, and breathed into you of His spirit, ordered the angels to prostrate before you and He made you dwell in Jannah. So (please) intercede for us with your Rubb. Do you not see our (miserable) condition?&#8217; Adam will say: `Today my Rubb has become so angry as He has never been before, nor will He ever become angry after this. He forbade me to approach the tree, but I disobeyed Him. I am worried about myself. Go to someone else. Go to (Prophet) Nuh (Noah).&#8217; They will come to Nuh and will say to him: `O Nuh! You are the first of Messenger of Allah to the people on the earth, and Allah has named you a grateful slave. Please intercede for us with your Rubb. Do you not see our (miserable) condition?&#8217; He will say: `Today my Rubb his become so angry as He has never been before, nor will He become angry hereafter. I was granted the right to make one definitely accepted invocation. I availed of this opportunity and made it against my nation. I am worried about myself. Go to someone else. Go to (Prophet) Ibrahim (Abraham).&#8217; They will go to Ibrahim and say to him: `O Ibrahim, you are Messenger of Allah and His Khalil (the intimate friend of Allah) from among the people of the earth; so please intercede for us with your Rubb. Don&#8217;t you see our (miserable) condition?&#8217; He will say to them: `Today my Rubb has become so angry as He has never been before; nor will he ever be so hereafter. I had told three lies. I am worried about myself. Go to someone else. Go to (Prophet) Musa (Moses).&#8217; The people will then go to Musa and say to him: `O Musa! You are Messenger of Allah and Allah gave you superiority above the others with His Message and with His direct Talk to you, so intercede for us with your Rubb. Do you not see our (miserable) condition?&#8217; Musa will say: `Today my Rubb has become so angry as he has never been before, nor will He ever be hereafter. I killed a man whom I had not been ordered to kill. I am worried about myself. Go to someone else. Go to (Prophet) `Isa (Jesus).&#8217; So they will go to `¦sa and say to him: `O `Isa! You are Messenger of Allah and His Word (i.e., &#8220;Be&#8221;-and he was) which he bestowed on Maryam (Mary) and a spirit created by Him; and you talked to the people while you were in the cradle. Please intercede for us with your Rubb. Do you not see our (miserable) condition?&#8217; `¦sa will say: `Today my Rubb has become so angry as He has never been before, nor will He ever be like this hereafter.&#8217; `Isa will not mention any sin, but will say: `I am worried about myself. Go to someone else. Go to Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam).</span>&#8221;&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Another narration is: The Messenger of Allah said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">They will come to me and say: `O Muhammad! You are the Messenger of Allah and the Last of Prophets, and Allah has forgiven your past and future sins. Please intercede for us with your Rubb. Do you not see our (miserable) condition?&#8221;&#8217; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) added, &#8220;Then I will proceed under Allah&#8217;s Throne and fall down in prostration before my Rubb. Then, He will bestow upon me knowledge of such praises and glorification to Him as He has never bestowed upon anybody else before me. Then I will be addressed: `O Muhammad! Raise your head. Ask, and your request will be granted. Intercede, and your intercession will be accepted.&#8217; So I will raise my head and say: `My followers, O my Rubb! My followers, O my Rubb! My followers, O my Rubb!&#8217; It will be said: `O Muhammad! Admit into Jannah such people as are not subjected to reckoning through the right gate of Jannah.&#8217; The rest of them will be admitted along with the rest of mankind through the various gates of Jannah.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) further said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is! The distance between every two sides of the gates of Jannah is like the distance between Makkah and Hajar, or that between Makkah and Busra (Syria).</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1867.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Ibrahim (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) brought his wife and her son Isma`il (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka`bah under a tree on the spot of Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. In those days, there was no human being in Makkah, nor was there any water. So he made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Isma`il&#8217;s mother followed him saying: &#8220;O Ibrahim! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?&#8221; She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her. Then she asked him: &#8220;Has Allah commanded you to do so?&#8221; He said: &#8220;Yes.&#8221; She said: &#8220;Then He will not neglect us.&#8221; She returned while Ibrahim proceeded onwards. Having reached the Thaniya, where they could not see him, he faced Ka`bah, raised his both hands and supplicated: &#8220;<span style="color:#ff0000;">O our Rubb! I have made some of my offspring to dwell in an uncultivable valley by Your Sacred House (the Ka`bah at Makkah) in order, O our Rubb, that they may perform As-Salat (Iqamat-as-Salat). So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits so that they may give thanks.</span>&#8221; (14:37).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Isma`il&#8217;s mother went on suckling Isma`il and drinking from the water which she had. When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at Isma`il, tossing in agony. She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of As-Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from As-Safa, and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble till she crossed the valley and reached Al-Marwah mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between As-Safa and Al-Marwah) seven times.&#8221; Ibn `Abbas further related: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">This is the source of the tradition of the Sa`y &#8211; i.e., the going of people between the two mountains. When she reached Al-Marwah (for the last time), she heard a voice and she exclaimed: `Shshs!&#8217; (Silencing herself) and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said: `O (whoever you may be) You have made me hear your voice; have you any succour for me?&#8217; And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or with his wing), till water flowed out from that place. She started to make something like of a basin around it, using her hands in this way and began to fill her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out until she had scooped some of it</span>.&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) further said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">May Allah bestow mercy on Isma&#8217;il&#8217;s mother! Had she let the Zamzam flow without trying to control it (or had she not scooped in that water) while filling her water-skin, Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth</span>.&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) further added, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her: `Do not be afraid of being neglected, for this is the site on which the House of Allah will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah will never let neglected His people.&#8217; The House of Allah (the Ka`bah) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She continued living in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum passed by her and her child. As they were coming from through the way of Kada`, in the lower part of Makkah where they saw a bird that had a habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said: `This bird must be flying over water, though we know that there is no water in this valley.&#8217; They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came towards the water</span>.&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) added, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Isma`il&#8217;s mother was sitting near the water. They asked her: `Do you allow us to stay with you?&#8217; She replied: `Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water.&#8217; They agreed to that</span>.&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) further said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Isma`il&#8217;s mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them. The child (i.e., Isma`il) grew up and learnt Arabic from them (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty, they gave him one of their daughters in marriage. After Isma`il&#8217;s mother had died, Ibrahim came after Isma`il&#8217;s marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Isma`il there. When he asked Isma`il&#8217;s wife about him, she replied: `He has gone in search of our livelihood.&#8217; Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied complaining to him: `We are living in hardship, misery and destitution.&#8217; He said: `When your husband returns, convey my salutations to him and tell him to change the threshold of the door of his house.&#8217; When Isma`il came, he seemed to have perceived something unusual. He asked his wife: `Did anyone visit you?&#8217; She replied: `Yes, an old man of such and such description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and, I told him that we were living in hardship and poverty.&#8217; Thereupon Isma`il said: `Did he advise you anything?&#8217; She replied: `Yes, he told me to convey his salutations to you and to change the threshold of your door.&#8217; Isma`il said: `That was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family.&#8217; So Isma`il divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (Jurhum). Then Ibrahim stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them again but did not find Isma`il. So he came to Isma`il&#8217;s wife and asked her about him. She said: `He has gone in search of our livelihood.&#8217; Ibrahim asked her about their sustenance and living: `How are you getting on?&#8217; She replied: `We are prosperous and well off.&#8217; Then she praised Allah, the Exalted. Ibrahim asked: `What kind of food do you eat?&#8217; She said: `Meat.&#8217; He said: `What do you drink?&#8217; She said: `Water.&#8217; He said, `O Allah! Bless their meat and water!</span>&#8221;&#8217; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) added, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it</span>.&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) further said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected because these things do not suit him unless he lives in Makkah</span>.&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) added, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Then Ibrahim said to Isma`il&#8217;s wife, `When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his door.&#8217; When Isma`il came back, he asked his wife: `Did anyone call on you?&#8217; She replied: `Yes, a good looking old man came to me.&#8217; She praised him and added: `He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in good condition.&#8217; Isma`il asked her: `Did he give you a piece of advice?&#8217; She said: `Yes, he told me to convey his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your door.&#8217; On that Isma`il said: `He was my father and you are the threshold of the door. He has ordered me to keep you with me.&#8217; Then Ibrahim stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them afterwards. He saw Isma`il under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Ibrahim, he rose up to welcome him, and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father. Ibrahim said: `O Isma`il! Allah has given me an order.&#8217; Isma`il said: `Do what your Rubb has commanded you to do.&#8217; Ibrahim asked: `Will you help me?&#8217; Isma`il said: `I will help you.&#8217; Ibrahim said: `Allah has ordered me to build a house here, pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it</span>.&#8221;&#8217; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) added, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e., Ka`bah). Isma`il brought the stones and Ibrahim was building (the house). When the walls became high, Isma`il brought stone and placed it for Ibrahim who stood over it and carried on building the House, while Isma`il was handing over the stones to him, both of them prayed: `O our Rubb! Accept this service from us! Verily, You are the All-Hearer and the All-Knower</span>.&#8221;&#8217;<br />

A person (who had been listening to this badith from Abdullah b. Safwan) said: I bear testimony in regard to you that you are not imputing a lie to Hafsa.

And when they would reach the plain ground they would be sunk. We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, all sorts of people throng the path.

And as they would be busy in distributing the spoils of war (amongst themselves) after hanging their swords by the olive trees, the Satan would cry: The Dajjal has taken your place among your family. They would then come out, but it would be of no avail. And when they would come to Syria, he would come out while they would be still preparing themselves for battle drawing up the ranks. Certainly, the time of prayer shall come and then Jesus (peace be upon him) son of Mary would descend and would lead them in prayer.

I said: You mean Rome? And he said: Yes, and there would be a terrible fight and the Muslims would prepare a detachment (for fighting unto death) which would not return but victorious. They will fight until night will intervene them; both the sides will return without being victorious and both will be wiped out. The Muslims will again prepare a detachment for fighting unto death so that they may not return but victorious. When it would be the fourth day, a new detachment out of the remnant of the Muslims would be prepared and Allah will decree that the enemy should be routed. And they would fight such a fight the like of which would not be seen, so much so that even if a bird were to pass their flanks, it would fall down dead before reaching the end of them. (There would be such a largescale massacre) that when counting would be done, (only) one out of a hundred men related to one another would be found alive. So what can be the joy at the spoils of such war and what inheritance would be divided! They would be in this very state that they would hear of a calamity more horrible than this.

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah b. Umar reported: &#8216;Umar b. Khattab went along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) in the company of some persons toIbn Sayyad that he found him playing with children near the bettlement of Bani Maghala and Ibn Sayyad was at that time just at the threshold of adolescence and he did not perceive (the presence of Holy Prophet) until Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) struck his back with his hands. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Ibn Sayyad, don&#8217;t you bear witness that I am the messenger of Allah? Ibn Sayyad looked toward him and he said: I bear witness to the fact that you the messenger of the unlettered. Ibn Sayyad said to the Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him): Do you bear witness to the fact that I am the messenger of Allah? Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) rejected this and said: I affirm my faith in Allah and in His messengers. Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to him: What do you see? Ibn Sayyad said: It us a Dukh. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: May you be disgraced and dishonoured, you would not not be able to go beyond your rank. &#8216;Umar b. Khattab said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, permit me that I should strike his neck. Therupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: If he is the same (Dajjal) who would appear near the Last Hour, you would not be able to overpower him, and he is not that ther is no good for you to kill him. &#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Umar further narrated that after some time Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and Ubayy b. Ka&#8217;b went towards the palm trees where Ibn Sayyad was. When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) went near the tree he hid himself behind a tree with the intention of hearing something from Ibn sayyad before Ibn Sayyad could see him, but Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may pcxce be upon him) saw him on a bed with a blanket around him from which a murmuring sound was being heard and Ibn Sayyad&#8217;s mother saw Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) behind the trunk of the palm tree. She said to Ibn Sayyad: Saf (that being his name), here is Muhammad. Thereupon Ibn Sayyad jumped up murmuring and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: If she had left him alone he would have made things clear. Abdullah b. Umar told that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) stood up amongst the people and lauded Allah as He deserved, then he made a mention of the Dajjal and said: I warn you of him and there is no Prophet who has not warned his people against the Dajjal. Even Noah warned (against him) but I am going to tell you a thing which no Prophet told his people. You must know that he (the Dajjal) is one-eyed and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, is not one-eyed. Ibn Shihab said: &#8216;Umar b. Thabit al-Ansari informed me that some of the Companions of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) informed him that the day when Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) warned people against the Dajjal, he also said: There would be written between his two eyes (the word) Kafir (infidel) and everyone who would resent his deeds would be able to read or every Muslim would be about to read, and he also said: Bear this thing in mind that none amongst you would be able to see Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, until he dies.</p>

He sometimes described him to be insignificant and sometimes described (his turmoil) as very significant rand we felt) as if he were in the cluster of the date-palm trees. When we went to him (to the Holy Prophet) in the evening and he read (the signs of fear) in our faces, he said: What is the matter with you? We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, you made a mention of the Dajjal in the morning (sometimes describing him) to be insignificant and sometimes very important, until we began to think as if he were present in some (near) part of the cluster of the datpalm trees. Thereupon he said: I harbour fear in regard to you in so many other things besides the Dajjal. If he comes forth while I am among on, I shall contend with him on your behalf, but if he comes forth while I am not amongst you, a man must contend on his own behalf and Allah would take care of every Muslim on my behalf (and safeguard him against his evil). He (Dajjal) would be a young man with twisted, contracted hair, and a blind eye. I compare him to &#8216;Abd-ul-&#8216;Uzza b. Qatan. He who amongst you would survive to see him should recite over him the opening verses of Sura Kahf (xviii.). He would appear on the way between Syria and Iraq and would spread mischief right and left. O servant of Allah! adhere (to the path of Truth). We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, how long would he stay on the earth? He said.. For forty days, one day like a year and one day like a month and one day like a week and the rest of the days would be like your days. We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, would one day&#8217;s prayer suffice for the prayers of day equal to one year? Thereupon he said: No, but you must make an estimate of time (and then observe prayer). We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, how quickly would he walk upon the earth? Thereupon he said: Like cloud driven by the wind. He would come to the people and invite them (to a wrong religion) and they would affirm their faith in him and respond to him. He would then give command to the sky and there would be rainfall upon the earth and it would grow crops. Then in the evening, their posturing animals would come to them with their humps very high and their udders full of milk and their flanks stretched. He would then come to another people and invite them. But they would reject him and he would go away from them and there would be drought for them and nothing would be lef t with them in the form of wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would then walk through the waste, land and say to it: Bring forth your treasures, and the treasures would come out and collect (themselves) before him like the swarm of bees. He would then call a person brimming with youth and strike him with the sword and cut him into two pieces and (make these pieces lie at a distance which is generally) between the archer and his target. He would then call (that young man) and he will come forward laughing with his face gleaming (with happiness) and it would at this very time that Allah would send Christ, son of Mary, and he will descend at the white minaret in the eastern side of Damscus wearing two garments lightly dyed with saffron and placing his hands on the wings of two Angels. When he would lower his head, there would fall beads of perspiration from his head, and when he would raise it up, beads like pearls would scatter from it. Every non-believer who would smell the odour of his self would die and his breath would reach as far as he would be able to see. He would then search for him (Dajjal) until he would catch hold of him at the gate of Ludd and would kill him. Then a people whom Allah had protected would come to Jesus, son of Mary, and he would wipe their faces and would inform them of their ranks in Paradise and it would be under such conditions that Allah would reveal to Jesus these words: I have brought forth from amongst My servants such people against whom none would be able to fight; you take these people safely to Tur, and then Allah would send Gog and Magog and they would swarm down from every slope. The first of them would pass the lake of Tibering and drink out of it. And when the last of them would pass, he would say: There was once water there. Jesus and his companions would then be besieged here (at Tur, and they would be so much hard pressed) that the head of the ox would be dearer to them than one hundred dinirs and Allah&#8217;s Apostle, Jesus, and his companions would supplicate Allah, Who would send to them insects (which would attack their necks) and in the morning they would perish like one single person. Allah&#8217;s Apostle, Jesus, and his companions would then come down to the earth and they would not find in the earth as much space as a single span which is not filled with their putrefaction and stench. Allah&#8217;s Apostle, Jesus, and his companions would then again beseech Allah, Who would send birds whose necks would be like those of bactrin camels and they would carry them and throw them where God would will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah would send rain which no house of clay or (the tent of) camels&#8217; hairs would keep out and it would wash away the earth until it could appear to be a mirror. Then the earth would be told to bring forth its fruit and restore its blessing and, as a result thereof, there would grow (such a big) pomegranate that a group of persons would be able to eat that, and seek shelter under its skin and milch cow would give so much milk that a whole party would be able to drink it. And the milch camel would give such (a large quantity of) milk that the whole tribe would be able to drink out of that and the milch sheep would give so much milk that the whole family would be able to drink out of that and at that time Allah would send a pleasant wind which would soothe (people) even under their armpits, and would take the life of every Muslim and only the wicked would survive who would commit adultery like asses and the Last Hour would come to them.</p>

They would say: No. He would then kill (the man) and then bring him back to life. When he would bring tha@ person to life, he would say: By Allah, I had no better proof of the fact (that you are a Dajjal) than at the present time (that you are actually so). The Dajjal would then make an attempt to kill him (again) but he would not be able to do that. Abu Ishaq reported that it was said: That person would be Khadir (Allah be pleased with him).</p>

He would say: I intend to go to this one who is coming forth. They would say to him: Don&#8217;t you believe in our Lord? He would say: There is nothing hidden about our Lord. They would say: Kill him. Then some amongst them would say: Has your master (Dajjal) not forbidden you to kill anyone without (his consent)? And so they would take him to the Dajjal and when the believer would see him, he would say: O people. he is the Dajjil about whom Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has informed (us). The Dajjal would then order for breaking his head and utter (these words): Catch hold of him and break his head. He would be struck even on his back and on his stomach. Then the Dajjal would ask him: Don&#8217;t you believe in me? He would say: You are a false Masih. He would then order him to be torn (into pieces) with a saw from the parting of his hair up to his legs. After that the Dajjal would walk between the two pieces. He would then say to him: Stand, and he would stand erect. He would then say to him: Don&#8217;t you believe in me? And the person would say: It has only added to my insight concerning you (that you are really the Dajjal). He would then say: O people, he would not behave with anyone amongst people (in such a manner) after me. The Dajjal would try to catch hold of him so that he should kill him (again). The space between his neck and collar bone would be turned into copper and he would find no means to kill him. So he would catch hold of him by his hand and feet and throw him (into the air) and the people would think as if he had been thrown in the Hell-Fire whereas he would be thrown in Paradise. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He would be the most eminent amongst persons in regard to martyrdom in the eye of the Lord of the world.</p>

Thereupon he said: Hallowed be Allah, there is no god but Allah (or the words to the same effect). I have decided that I would not narrate anything to anyone now. I had only said that you would see after some time an important event that the (sacred) House (Ka&#8217;ba) would be burnt and it would happen and definitely happen. He then reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: The Dajjal would appear in my Ummah and he would stay (in the world) for forty-I cannot say whether he meant forty days, forty months or forty years. And Allah would then send Jesus son of Mary who would resemble &#8216;Urwa b Mas&#8217;ud. He (Jesus Christ) would chase him and kill him. Then people would live for seven years that there would be no ran. cour between two persons. Then Allah would send cold wind from the side of Syria that none would survive upon the earth having a speck of good in him or faith in him but he would die, so much so that even if some amongst you were to enter the innermost part of the mountain, this wind would reach that place also and that would cause his heath. I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Only the wicked people would survive and they would be as careless as birds with the charactertistics of beasts. They would never appreciate the good nor condemn evil. Then the Satan would come to them in human form and would say: Don&#8217;t you respond? And they would say: What do you order us? And he would command them to worship the idols but, in spite of this, they would have abundance of sustenance and lead comfortable lives. Then the trumpet would be blown and no one would hear that but he would bend hfs neck to one side and raise it from the other side and the first one to hear that trumpet would be the person who would be busy in setting right the tank meant for providing water to the camels. He would swoon and the other people would also swoon, then Allah would send or He would cause to send rain which would be like dew and there would grow out of it the bodies of the people. Then the second trumpet would be blown and they would stand up and begin to look (around). Then it would be said: O people, go to your Lord, and make them stand there. And they would be questioned. Then it would be said: Bring out a group (out of them) for the Hell-Fire. And then it would be asked: How much? It would be said: Nine hundred and ninty-nine out of one thousand for the Hell-Fire and that would be the day which would make the children old because of its terror and that would be the day about which it has been said:&#8221; On the day when the shank would be uncovered&#8221; (lxviii. 42).</p>

Qais and she was the first amongst the emigrant women: Narrate to me a hadith which you had heard directly from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and there is no extra link in between them. She said: Very well, if you like, I am prepared to do that, and he said to her: Well, do It and narrate that to me. She said: I married the son of Mughira and he was a chosen young man of Quraish at that time, but he fell as a martyr in the first Jihad (fighting) on the side of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). When I became a widow, &#8216;Abd al-Rahman b. Auf, one amongst the group of the Companions of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), sent me the proposal of marriage. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) also sent me such a message for his freed slave Usama b. Zaid. And it had been conveyed to me that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (way peace be upon him) had said (about Usama): He who loves me should also love Usima. When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) talked to me (about this matter), I said: My affairs are in your hand. You may marry me to anyone whom you like. He said: You better shift now to the house of Umm Sharik, and Umm Sharik was a rich lady from amongst the Anqir. She spent generously for the cause of Allah and entertained guests very hospitably. I said: Well, I will do as you like. He said: Do not do that for Umm Sharik is a woman who is very frequently vizited by guests and I do not like that your head may be uncovered or the cloth may be removed from your shank and the strangers may catch sight of them which you abhor. You better shift to the house of your cousin &#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Amr b. Umm Maktum and he is a person of the Bani Fihr branch of the Quraish, and he belonged to that tribe (to which Fatima) belonged. So I shifted to that house, and when my period of waiting was over, I heard the voice of an announcer making an announcement that the prayer would be observed in the mosque (where) congregational prayer (is observed).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I set out towards that mosque and observed prayer along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and I was in the row of the women which was near the row of men. When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had finished his prayer, he sat on the pulpit smiling and said: Every worshipper should keep sitting at his place. He then said: Do you know why I had asked you to assemble? They said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He said: By Allah. I have not made you assemble for exhortation or for a warning, but I have detained you here, for Tamim Dari, a Christian, who came and accepted Islam, told me something, which agrees with what I was-telling, yuu about the Dajjal. He narrated to me that he had sailed in a ship along with thirty men of Bani Lakhm and Bani Judham and had been tossed by waves in the ocean for a month. Then these (waves) took them (near) the land within the ocean (island) at the time of sunset. They sat in a small side-boat and entered that Island. There was a beast with long thick hair (and because of these) they could not distinguish his face from his back. They said: Woe to you, who can you be? Thereupon it said: I am al-Jassasa. They said: What is al-Jassasa? And it said: O people, go to this person in the monastery as he is very much eager to know about you. He (the narrator) said: When it named a person for us we were afraid of it lest it should be a Devil. Then we hurriedly went on till we came to that monastery and found a well-built person there with his hands tied to his neck and having iron shackles between his two legs up to the ankles. We said: Woe be upon thee, who are you? And he said: You would soon come to know about me. but tell me who are you. We said: We are people from Arabia and we embarked upon a boat but the sea-waves had been driving us for one month and they brought as near this island. We got Into the side-boats and entered this island and here a beast met us with profusely thick hair and because of the thickness of his hair his face could not be distinguished from his back. We said: Woe be to thee, who are you? It said: I am al- Jassasa. We said: What is al-Jassasa? And it said: You go to this very person in the monastery for he is eagerly waiting for you to know about you. So we came to you in hot haste fearing that that might be the Devil. He (that chained person) said: Tell me about the date-palm trees of Baisan. We &amp;aid: About what aspect of theirs do you seek information? He said: I ask you whether these trees bear fruit or not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We said: Yes Thereupon he said: I think these would not bear fruits. He said: Inform me about the lake of Tabariyya? We said: Which aspect of it do you want to know? He said: Is there water in it? They said: There is abundance of water in it. Thereupon he said: I think it would soon become dry. He again said: Inform me about the spring of Zughar. They said: Which aspect of it you want to know? He (the chained person) said: Is there water in it and does it irrigate (the land)? We said to him: Yes, there is abundance of water in it and the inhabitants (of Medina) irrigate (land) with the help of it, He said: Inform me about the unlettered Prophet; what has he done? We said: He has come out from Mecca and has settled In Yathrib (Medina). He said: Do the Arabs fight against him? We said: Yes. He said: How did he deal with him? We informed him that he had overcome those in his neighbourhood and they had submitted themselves before him. Thereupon he said to us: Had it actually happened? We said: Yes. Thereupon he said: If it is so that is better for them that they should show obedience to him. I am going to tell you about. myself and I am Dajjal and would be soon permitted to get out and so I shall get out and travel in the land, and will not spare any town where I would not stay for forty nights except Mecca and Medina as these two (places) are prohibited (areas) for me and I would not make an attempt to enter any one of these two. An angel with a sword in his hand would confront me and would bar my way and there would be angels to guard every passage leading to it; then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) striking the pulpit with the help of the end of his staff said: This implies Taiba meaning Medina. Have I not, told you an account (of the Dajjal) like this? &#8216;The people said: Yes, and this account narrated by Tamim Dari was liked by me for it corroborates the account which I gave to you in regard to him (Dajjal) at Medina and Mecca. Behold he (Dajjal) is in the Syrian sea (Mediterranian) or the Yemen sea (Arabian sea). Nay, on the contrary, he As In the east, he is in the east, he is in the east, and he pointed with his hand towards the east.

There will come to me some people whom I know and they know me, and then a barrier will be set up between me and them.&#8221; Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri added that the Prophet further said: &#8220;I will say those people are from me.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever notices something which he dislikes done by his ruler, then he should be patient, for whoever becomes separate from the company of the Muslims even for a span and then dies, he will die as those who died in the Pre-lslamic period of Ignorance (as rebellious sinners).

Will you tell us a Hadith you heard from the Prophet and by which Allah may make you benefit?&#8221; He said, &#8220;The Prophet called us and we gave him the Pledge of allegiance for Islam, and among the conditions on which he took the Pledge from us, was that we were to listen and obey (the orders) both at the time when we were active and at the time when we were tired, and at our difficult time and at our ease and to be obedient to the ruler and give him his right even if he did not give us our right, and not to fight against him unless we noticed him having open Kufr (disbelief) for which we would have a proof with us from Allah.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 181:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zainab bint Jahsh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet got up from his sleep with a flushed red face and said, &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah. Woe to the Arabs, from the Great evil that is nearly approaching them. Today a gap has been made in the wall of Gog and Magog like this.&#8221; (Sufyan illustrated by this forming the number 90 or 100 with his fingers.) It was asked, &#8220;Shall we be destroyed though there are righteous people among us?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes, if evil increased.&#8221;</p>

Isn&#8217;t it the forbidden (Sacred) Town (Mecca)?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; He then said, &#8220;Your blood, your properties, your honors and your skins (i.e., bodies) are as sacred to one another like the sanctity of this day of yours in this month of yours in this town of yours. (Listen) Haven&#8217;t I conveyed Allah&#8217;s message to you?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Yes&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Allah! Be witness (for it). So it is incumbent upon those who are present to convey it (this message of mine) to those who are absent because the informed one might comprehend what I have said better than the present audience who will convey it to him.)&#8221; The narrator added: In fact, it was like that.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hudhaifa bin Al-Yaman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people used to ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle about the good but I used to ask him about the evil lest I should be overtaken by them. So I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We were living in ignorance and in an (extremely) worst atmosphere, then Allah brought to us this good (i.e., Islam); will there be any evil after this good?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; I said, &#8216;Will there be any good after that evil?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Yes, but it will be tainted (not pure.)&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What will be its taint?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;(There will be) some people who will guide others not according to my tradition? You will approve of some of their deeds and disapprove of some others.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;Will there be any evil after that good?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Yes, (there will be) some people calling at the gates of the (Hell) Fire, and whoever will respond to their call, will be thrown by them into the (Hell) Fire.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah s Apostle! Will you describe them to us?&#8221; He said, &#8220;They will be from our own people and will speak our language.&#8221; I said, &#8220;What do you order me to do if such a state should take place in my life?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Stick to the group of Muslims and their Imam (ruler).&#8221; I said, &#8220;If there is neither a group of Muslims nor an Imam (ruler)?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Then turn away from all those sects even if you were to bite (eat) the roots of a tree till death overtakes you while you are in that state.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 207:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Al-Aswad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An army unit was being recruited from the people of Medina and my name was written among them. Then I met &#8216;Ikrima, and when I informed him about it, he discouraged me very strongly and said, &#8220;Ibn &#8216;Abbas told me that there were some Muslims who were with the pagans to increase their number against Allah&#8217;s Apostle (and the Muslim army) so arrows (from the Muslim army) would hit one of them and kill him or a Muslim would strike him (with his sword) and kill him. So Allah revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Verily! As for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves (by staying among the disbelievers).&#8217; (4.97)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 208:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hudhaifa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle related to us, two prophetic narrations one of which I have seen fulfilled and I am waiting for the fulfillment of the other. The Prophet told us that the virtue of honesty descended in the roots of men&#8217;s hearts (from Allah) and then they learned it from the Qur&#8217;an and then they learned it from the Sunna (the Prophet&#8217;s traditions). The Prophet further told us how that honesty will be taken away: He said: &#8220;Man will go to sleep during which honesty will be taken away from his heart and only its trace will remain in his heart like the trace of a dark spot; then man will go to sleep, during which honesty will decrease further still, so that its trace will resemble the trace of blister as when an ember is dropped on one&#8217;s foot which would make it swell, and one would see it swollen but there would be nothing inside. People would be carrying out their trade but hardly will there be a trustworthy person. It will be said, &#8216;in such-and-such tribe there is an honest man,&#8217; and later it will be said about some man, &#8216;What a wise, polite and strong man he is!&#8217; Though he will not have faith equal even to a mustard seed in his heart.&#8221; No doubt, there came upon me a time when I did not mind dealing (bargaining) with anyone of you, for if he was a Muslim his Islam would compel him to pay me what is due to me, and if he was a Christian, the Muslim official would compel him to pay me what is due to me, but today I do not deal except with such-and-such person.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">That he visited Al-Hajjaj (bin Yusuf). Al-Hajjaj said, &#8220;O son of Al-Akwa! You have turned on your heels (i.e., deserted Islam) by staying (in the desert) with the bedouins.&#8221; Salama replied, &#8220;No, but Allah&#8217;s Apostle allowed me to stay with the bedouin in the desert.&#8221; Narrated Yazid bin Abi Ubaid: When &#8216;Uthman bin Affan was killed (martyred), Salama bin Al-Akwa&#8217; went out to a place called Ar-Rabadha and married there and begot children, and he stayed there till a few nights before his death when he came to Medina.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people started asking the Prophet too many questions importunately. So one day he ascended the pulpit and said, &#8220;You will not ask me any question but I will explain it to you.&#8221; I looked right and left, and behold, every man was covering his head with his garment and weeping. Then got up a man who, whenever quarreling with somebody, used to be accused of not being the son of his father. He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Who is my father?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Your father is Hudhaifa.&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar got up and said, &#8220;We accept Allah as our Lord, Islam as our religion and Muhammad as our Apostle and we seek refuge with Allah from the evil of afflictions.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8221; I have never seen the good and bad like on this day. No doubt, Paradise and Hell was displayed in front of me till I saw them in front of that wall,&#8221; Qatada said: This Hadith used to be mentioned as an explanation of this Verse:&#8211; &#8216;O you who believe! Ask not questions about things which, if made plain to you, may cause you trouble.&#8217; (5.101)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salim&#8217;s father:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet stood up beside the pulpit (and pointed with his finger towards the East) and said, &#8220;Afflictions are there! Afflictions are there, from where the side of the head of Satan comes out,&#8221; or said, &#8220;..the side of the sun..&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah! Bestow Your blessings on our Sham! O Allah! Bestow Your blessings on our Yemen.&#8221; The People said, &#8220;And also on our Najd.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Allah! Bestow Your blessings on our Sham (north)! O Allah! Bestow Your blessings on our Yemen.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! And also on our Najd.&#8221; I think the third time the Prophet said, &#8220;There (in Najd) is the place of earthquakes and afflictions and from there comes out the side of the head of Satan.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar came to us and we hoped that he would narrate to us a good Hadith. But before we asked him, a man got up and said to him, &#8220;O Abu &#8216;Abdur-Rahman! Narrate to us about the battles during the time of the afflictions, as Allah says:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And fight them until there is no more afflictions (i.e. no more worshipping of others besides Allah).'&#8221; (2.193) Ibn &#8216;Umar said (to the man), &#8220;Do you know what is meant by afflictions? Let your mother bereave you! Muhammad used to fight against the pagans, for a Muslim was put to trial in his religion (The pagans will either kill him or chain him as a captive). His fighting was not like your fighting which is carried on for the sake of ruling.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Shaqiq:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Hudhaifa saying, &#8220;While we were sitting with &#8216;Umar, he said, &#8216;Who among you remembers the statement of the Prophet about the afflictions?&#8217; Hudhaifa said, &#8220;The affliction of a man in his family, his property, his children and his neighbors are expiated by his prayers, Zakat (and alms) and enjoining good and forbidding evil.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I do not ask you about these afflictions, but about those afflictions which will move like the waves of the sea.&#8221; Hudhaifa said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it, O chief of the believers, for there is a closed door between you and them.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Will that door be broken or opened?&#8221; I said, &#8220;No. it will be broken.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Then it will never be closed,&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; We asked Hudhaifa, &#8220;Did &#8216;Umar know what that door meant?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Yes, as I know that there will be night before tomorrow morning, that is because I narrated to him a true narration free from errors.&#8221; We dared not ask Hudhaifa as to whom the door represented so we ordered Masruq to ask him what does the door stand for? He replied, &#8220;&#8216;Umar.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 217:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ash&#8217;ari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet went out to one of the gardens of Medina for some business and I went out to follow him. When he entered the garden, I sat at its gate and said to myself, &#8220;To day I will be the gatekeeper of the Prophet though he has not ordered me.&#8221; The Prophet went and finished his need and went to sit on the constructed edge of the well and uncovered his legs and hung them in the well. In the meantime Abu Bakr came and asked permission to enter. I said (to him), &#8220;Wait till I get you permission.&#8221; Abu Bakr waited outside and I went to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! Abu Bakr asks your permission to enter.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Admit him, and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise.&#8221; So Abu Bakr entered and sat on the right side of the Prophet and uncovered his legs and hung them in the well. Then &#8216;Umar came and I said (to him), &#8220;Wait till I get you permission.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Admit him and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise.&#8221; So Umar entered and sat on the left side of the Prophet and uncovered his legs and hung them in the well so that one side of the well became fully occupied and there remained no place for any-one to sit. Then &#8216;Uthman came and I said (to him), &#8220;Wait till I get permission for you.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Admit him and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise with a calamity which will befall him.&#8221; When he entered, he could not find any place to sit with them so he went to the other edge of the well opposite them and uncovered his legs and hung them in the well. I wished that a brother of mine would come, so I invoked Allah for his coming. (Ibn Al-Musaiyab said, &#8220;I interpreted that (narration) as indicating their graves. The first three are together and the grave of &#8216;Uthman is separate from theirs.&#8221;)</p>

I will never tell a ruler who rules over two men or more that he is good after I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;A man will be brought and put in Hell (Fire) and he will circumambulate (go around and round) in Hell (Fire) like a donkey of a (flour) grinding mill, and all the people of Hell (Fire) will gather around him and will say to him, O so-and-so! Didn&#8217;t you use to order others for good and forbid them from evil?&#8217; That man will say, &#8216;I used to order others to do good but I myself never used to do it, and I used to forbid others from evil while I myself used to do evil.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 219:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the battle of Al-Jamal, Allah benefited me with a Word (I heard from the Prophet). When the Prophet heard the news that the people of the Persia had made the daughter of Khosrau their Queen (ruler), he said, &#8220;Never will succeed such a nation as makes a woman their ruler.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 220:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Maryam Abdullah bin Ziyad Al-Aasadi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Talha, AzZubair and &#8216;Aisha moved to Basra, &#8216;Ali sent &#8216;Ammar bin Yasir and Hasan bin &#8216;Ali who came to us at Kufa and ascended the pulpit. Al-Hasan bin &#8216;Ali was at the top of the pulpit and &#8216;Ammar was below Al-Hasan. We all gathered before him. I heard &#8216;Ammar saying, &#8220;&#8216;Aisha has moved to Al-Busra. By Allah! She is the wife of your Prophet in this world and in the Hereafter. But Allah has put you to test whether you obey Him (Allah) or her (&#8216;Aisha).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 221:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Wail:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Ammar stood on the pulpit at Kufa and mentioned &#8216;Aisha and her coming (to Busra) and said, &#8220;She is the wife of your Prophet in this world and in the Hereafter, but you people are being put to test in this issue.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 222:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Wail:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Musa and Abii Mas&#8217;ud went to &#8216;Ammar when &#8216;Ali had sent him to Kufa to exhort them to fight (on &#8216;Ali&#8217;s side). They said to him, &#8220;Since you have become a Muslim, we have never seen you doing a deed more criticizable to us than your haste in this matter.&#8221; &#8216;Ammar said, &#8220;Since you (both) became Muslims, I have never seen you doing a deed more criticizable to me than your keeping away from this matter.&#8221; Then Abu Mas&#8217;ud provided &#8216;Ammar and Abu Musa with two-piece outfits to wear, and one of them went to the mosque (of Kufa).</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 223:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Shaqiq bin Salama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was sitting with Abu Mas&#8217;ud and Abu Musa and &#8216;Ammar. Abu Mas&#8217;ud said (to &#8216;Ammar), &#8220;There is none of your companions but, if I wish, I could find fault with him except with you. Since you joined the company of the Prophet I have never seen anything done by you more criticizable by me than your haste in this issue.&#8221; &#8216;Ammar said, O Abu Mas&#8217;ud ! I have never seen anything done by you or by this companion of yours (i.e., Abu Musa) more criticizable by me than your keeping away from this issue since the time you both joined the company of the Prophet.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Abu Mas&#8217;ud who was a rich man, said (to his servant), &#8220;O boy! Bring two suits.&#8221; Then he gave one to Abu Musa and the other to &#8216;Ammar and said (to them), &#8220;Put on these suits before going for the Friday prayer. &#8220;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 224:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;If Allah sends punishment upon a nation then it befalls upon the whole population indiscriminately and then they will be resurrected (and judged) according to their deeds. &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">When Al-Hasan bin &#8216;Ali moved with army units against Muawiya, &#8216;Amr bin AL-As said to Muawiya, &#8220;I see an army that will not retreat unless and until the opposing army retreats.&#8221; Muawiya said, &#8220;(If the Muslims are killed) who will look after their children?&#8221; &#8216;Amr bin Al-As said: I (will look after them). On that, &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amir and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Samura said, &#8220;Let us meet Muawaiya and suggest peace.&#8221; Al-Hasan Al-Basri added: No doubt, I heard that Abu Bakra said, &#8220;Once while the Prophet was addressing (the people), Al-Hasan (bin &#8216;Ali) came and the Prophet said, &#8216;This son of mine is a chief, and Allah may make peace between two groups of Muslims through him.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(Usama&#8217;s Maula) Usama (bin Zaid) sent me to &#8216;Ali (at Kufa) and said, &#8220;&#8216;Ali will ask you, &#8216;What has prevented your companion from joining me?&#8217; You then should say to him, &#8216;If you (&#8216;Ali) were in the mouth of a lion, I would like to be with you, but in this matter I won&#8217;t take any part.&#8217; &#8221; Harmala added: &#8220;&#8216;Ali didn&#8217;t give me anything (when I conveyed the message to him) so I went to Hasan, Hussain and Ibn Ja&#8217;far and they loaded my camels with much (wealth).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 227:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">When the people of Medina dethroned Yazid bin Muawiya, Ibn &#8216;Umar gathered his special friends and children and said, &#8220;I heard the Prophet saying, &#8216;A flag will be fixed for every betrayer on the Day of Resurrection,&#8217; and we have given the oath of allegiance to this person (Yazid) in accordance with the conditions enjoined by Allah and His Apostle and I do not know of anything more faithless than fighting a person who has been given the oath of allegiance in accordance with the conditions enjoined by Allah and His Apostle , and if ever I learn that any person among you has agreed to dethrone Yazid, by giving the oath of allegiance (to somebody else) then there will be separation between him and me.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 228:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">When Ibn Ziyad and Marwan were in Sham and Ibn Az-Zubair took over the authority in Mecca and Qurra&#8217; (the Kharijites) revolted in Basra, I went out with my father to Abu Barza Al-Aslami till we entered upon him in his house while he was sitting in the shade of a room built of cane. So we sat with him and my father started talking to him saying, &#8220;O Abu Barza! Don&#8217;t you see in what dilemma the people has fallen?&#8221; The first thing heard him saying &#8220;I seek reward from Allah for myself because of being angry and scornful at the Quraish tribe. O you Arabs! You know very well that you were in misery and were few in number and misguided, and that Allah has brought you out of all that with Islam and with Muhammad till He brought you to this state (of prosperity and happiness) which you see now; and it is this worldly wealth and pleasures which has caused mischief to appear among you. The one who is in Sham (i.e., Marwan), by Allah, is not fighting except for the sake of worldly gain: and those who are among you, by Allah, are not fighting except for the sake of worldly gain; and that one who is in Mecca (i.e., Ibn Az-Zubair) by Allah, is not fighting except for the sake of worldly gain.&#8221;</p>
<hr />

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abi Waih:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hudhaifa bin Al-Yaman said, &#8216;The hypocrites of today are worse than those of the lifetime of the Prophet, because in those days they used to do evil deeds secretly but today they do such deeds openly.&#8217;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abi Asha&#8217;sha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hudhaifa said, &#8216;In fact, it was hypocrisy that existed in the lifetime of the Prophet but today it is Kufr (disbelief) after belief.&#8217;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 231:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The Hour will not be established till a man passes by a grave of somebody and says, &#8216;Would that I were in his place.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The Hour will not be established till the buttocks of the women of the tribe of Daus move while going round Dhi-al-Khalasa.&#8221; Dhi-al-Khalasa was the idol of the Daus tribe which they used to worship in the Pre Islamic Period of ignorance.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 233:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 234:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The Hour will not be established till a fire will come out of the land of Hijaz, and it will throw light on the necks of the camels at Busra.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 235:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Soon the river &#8220;Euphrates&#8221; will disclose the treasure (the mountain) of gold, so whoever will be present at that time should not take anything of it.&#8221; Al-A&#8217;raj narrated from Abii Huraira that the Prophet said the same but he said, &#8220;It (Euphrates) will uncover a mountain of gold (under it).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 236:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Haritha bin Wahb:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Give in charity because there will come a time on the people when a person will go out with his alms from place to place but will not find anybody to accept it.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 237:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The Hour will not be established (1) till two big groups fight each other whereupon there will be a great number of casualties on both sides and they will be following one and the same religious doctrine, (2) till about thirty Dajjals (liars) appear, and each one of them will claim that he is Allah&#8217;s Apostle, (3) till the religious knowledge is taken away (by the death of Religious scholars) (4) earthquakes will increase in number (5) time will pass quickly, (6) afflictions will appear, (7) Al-Harj, (i.e., killing) will increase, (8) till wealth will be in abundance &#8212;- so abundant that a wealthy person will worry lest nobody should accept his Zakat, and whenever he will present it to someone, that person (to whom it will be offered) will say, &#8216;I am not in need of it, (9) till the people compete with one another in constructing high buildings, (10) till a man when passing by a grave of someone will say, &#8216;Would that I were in his place (11) and till the sun rises from the West. So when the sun will rise and the people will see it (rising from the West) they will all believe (embrace Islam) but that will be the time when: (As Allah said,) &#8216;No good will it do to a soul to believe then, if it believed not before, nor earned good (by deeds of righteousness) through its Faith.&#8217; (6.158) And the Hour will be established while two men spreading a garment in front of them but they will not be able to sell it, nor fold it up; and the Hour will be established when a man has milked his she-camel and has taken away the milk but he will not be able to drink it; and the Hour will be established before a man repairing a tank (for his livestock) is able to water (his animals) in it; and the Hour will be established when a person has raised a morsel (of food) to his mouth but will not be able to eat it.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nobody asked the Prophet as many questions as I asked regarding Ad-Dajjal. The Prophet said to me, &#8220;What worries you about him?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Because the people say that he will have a mountain of bread and a river of water with him (i.e. he will have abundance of food and water)&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Nay, he is too mean to be allowed such a thing by Allah&#8221;&#8216; (but it is only to test mankind whether they believe in Allah or in Ad-Dajjal.)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 239:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Ad-Dajjal will come and encamp at a place close to Medina and then Medina will shake thrice whereupon every Kafir (disbeliever) and hypocrite will go out (of Medina) towards him.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 240:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah bin Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up amongst the people and then praised and glorified Allah as He deserved and then he mentioned Ad-Dajjal, saying, &#8220;I warn you of him, and there was no prophet but warned his followers of him; but I will tell you something about him which no prophet has told his followers: Ad-Dajjal is one-eyed whereas Allah is not.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 242:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said. &#8220;While I was sleeping, I saw myself (in a dream) performing Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba. Behold, I saw a reddish-white man with lank hair, and water was dropping from his head. I asked, &#8220;Who is this?&#8217; They replied, &#8216;The son of Mary.&#8217; Then I turned my face to see another man with a huge body, red complexion and curly hair and blind in one eye. His eye looked like a protruding out grape. They said (to me), He is Ad-Dajjal.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;The man he resembled most is Ibn Qatan, a man from the tribe of Khuza&#8217;a. &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hudhaifa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said about Ad-Dajjal that he would have water and fire with him: (what would seem to be) fire, would be cold water and (what would seem to be) water, would be fire.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 245:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;No prophet was sent but that he warned his followers against the one-eyed liar (Ad-Dajjal). Beware! He is blind in one eye, and your Lord is not so, and there will be written between his (Ad-Dajjal&#8217;s) eyes (the word) Kafir (i.e., disbeliever).&#8221; (This Hadith is also quoted by Abu Huraira and Ibn &#8216;Abbas).</p>
<hr />

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Sa&#8217;id:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One day Allah&#8217;s Apostle narrated to us a long narration about Ad-Dajjal and among the things he narrated to us, was: &#8220;Ad-Dajjal will come, and he will be forbidden to enter the mountain passes of Medina. He will encamp in one of the salt areas neighboring Medina and there will appear to him a man who will be the best or one of the best of the people. He will say &#8216;I testify that you are Ad-Dajjal whose story Allah&#8217;s Apostle has told us.&#8217; Ad-Dajjal will say (to his audience), &#8216;Look, if I kill this man and then give him life, will you have any doubt about my claim?&#8217; They will reply, &#8216;No,&#8217; Then Ad-Dajjal will kill that man and then will make him alive. The man will say, &#8216;By Allah, now I recognize you more than ever!&#8217; Ad-Dajjal will then try to kill him (again) but he will not be given the power to do so.&#8221;</p>
<hr />

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;There are angels at the mountain passes of Medina (so that) neither plague nor Ad-Dajjal can enter it.&#8217;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Ad-Dajjal will come to Medina and find the angels guarding it. So Allah willing, neither Ad-Dajjal, nor plague will be able to come near it.&#8221;</p>

Woe to the Arabs from the Great evil that has approached (them). Today a hole has been opened in the dam of Gog and Magog like this.&#8221; The Prophet made a circle with his index finger and thumb. Zainab bint Jahsh added: I said, &#8220;O Alllah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall we be destroyed though there will be righteous people among us?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes, if the (number) of evil (persons) increased.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Muhammad bin Saalih Al-&#8216;Uthaimeen<br />
Sharh Lumu&#8217;at-ul-&#8216;Itiqaad [pg. 105-110]<br />
Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1. The Emergence of the Dajjaal</b> &#8211; Linguistically, Dajjaal is derived from the word dajl, which means lying and impostering. Religiously, it refers to a man who is an imposter and who will appear during the Last Days, claiming lordship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His emergence is established in the Sunnah as well as the Ijmaa&#8217; (consensus). The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;Say: &#8216;O Allaah, verily I seek refuge in you from the punishment of the Hellfire, and I seek refuge in you from the punishment of the grave, and I seek refuge in you from the trial of Maseeh Ad-Dajjaal. And I seek refuge in you from the trial of life and death.&#8221;</b> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) would seek refuge from him during prayer&#8221; [2] and the Muslims have agreed upon his emergence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His story:</b> He will emerge from a road in an area between Shaam and &#8216;Iraaq and will begin to call the people to worship him. A majority of the people that will follow him will be from the Jews, women and bedouins. Seventy-thousand Jews from Asfahaan (in present-day Iran) will follow him and he will travel throughout the entire earth, just as the wind blows rain in all directions, except for Makkah and Madeenah, for he will be prevented from entering them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The length of his stay will be forty days. One day will be like a year, one day like a month, one day like a week and the rest of the days will be as normal. He is one-eyed (i.e. one eye is good and the other is defective) and between his two eyes will be written KA FA RA (i.e. kaafir or disbeliever). Only the believers will be able to read it. He will bring about great trials, some of which are that he will command the heavens and it will rain and he will command the earth and it will produce vegetation. He will have with him a Garden and a Fire. However, his garden will be a fire, and his fire will be a garden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) warned of him by saying: <b>&#8220;Whosoever hears of him, then let him distance himself from him. And whosoever has him reach him, then let him recite the opening verses of Surah Kahf upon him&#8221; &#8211; or &#8211; &#8220;&#8230;let him recite the opening verses of Surah Kahf.&#8221;</b> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>2. The Descent of &#8216;Eesaa Ibn Maryam</b> &#8211; The descent of &#8216;Eesaa Ibn Maryam is established in the Qur&#8217;aan, the Sunnah and the consensus of the Muslims. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And there is none of the People of the Scripture, except that he must believe in him (&#8216;Eesaa) before his death.&#8221;</b> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This refers to the death of &#8216;Eesaa which will occur after his descent, as has been interpreted by Abu Hurairah. The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;I swear by Allaah, &#8216;Eesaa Ibn Maryam will indeed descend judging (mankind) with justice.&#8221;</b> This hadeeth is agreed upon. [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslims have unanimously agreed upon his descent. He will descend by the white minaret in the east of Damascus, placing his hands upon the wings of two angels. Then it will not be possible for a disbeliever to perceive the scent of his breath, except that he will die. And his breath will extend as far his eyesight extends. He will search for the Dajjaal until he reaches him by the gate of Ludd, where he will kill him. He will break the cross and abolish the jizyah (taxation collected from subjected disbelievers). And the prostration (of worship) will be only one &#8211; for Allaah the Lord of the universe. He will also perform Hajj and &#8216;Umrah. All of this is confirmed in Saheeh Muslim and some of it in both Saheehs. [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad and Abu Dawood reported that <b>&#8220;&#8216;Eesaa will remain for forty years after killing the Dajjaal. Then he will die and the Muslims will pray the funeral prayer (Janaazah) over him.&#8221;</b> [7] Al-Bukhaaree mentioned in his At-Tareekh that he will be buried next to the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) and Allaah knows best. [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>3. The Emergence of Ya&#8217;jooj and Ma&#8217;jooj</b> &#8211; These are two non-Arab names or (perhaps) they are Arab names derived from Ma&#8217;j which means riotous disruption or from Ajeej which means the setting ablaze and kindling of a fire. They are two nations from the tribe of Aadam that are currently in existence, based upon the evidences from the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says concerning the story of Dhul-Qarnain: <b>&#8220;Until when he reached between two mountains, he found before both of them, a people who scarcely understood a word. They said: &#8216;O Dhul-Qarnain! Verily, Ya&#8217;jooj and Ma&#8217;jooj are doing great mischief in the land. Shall we then pay you a tribute in order that you might erect a barrier between them and us?'&#8221;</b> [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;On the Day of Judgement Allaah will say: &#8216;O Aadam, rise and extract the people of the Fire from your offspring.&#8217; Aadam will say: &#8216;Who are the people of the Hellfire?&#8217; Allaah will say &#8216;Out of every thousand, (take out) nine hundred and ninety-nine (persons). At that time, children will become hoary-headed and every pregnant female will drop her load (i.e. miscarriage). And you will see the people as if they were drunk, yet they will not be drunk. But Allaah&#8217;s punishment will be severe.&#8221; News of that distressed the companions severely, so they said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah, who amongst us will be that (one) man (out of a thousand)?&#8221; He (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: &#8220;Give the good tidings, for indeed from among you will be one and from Ya&#8217;jooj and Ma&#8217;jooj will be a thousand.&#8221;</b> [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their emergence, which is one of the signs of the Hour, has not occurred before in the past. However, its first indications were present during the time of the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>). It is confirmed in the two Saheeh collections that the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;&#8216;Today a hole has been opened in the barrier of Ya&#8217;jooj and Ma&#8217;jooj, like this&#8217;, and he (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) made a circle with his index finger and thumb.&#8221;</b> [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, their emergence is established in the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah. Allaah says: <b>&#8220;Until when Ya&#8217;jooj and Ma&#8217;jooj are let loose (from their barrier), and they swoop down from every mound. And the true promise (Day of Resurrection) shall draw near.&#8221;</b> [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;Verily the Hour will never be established until you see ten signs before it.&#8221; Then he (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) mentioned: &#8220;The smoke, the Dajjaal, the Beast, the rising of the sun from the west, the descent of &#8216;Eesaa Ibn Maryam, Ya&#8217;jooj and Ma&#8217;jooj, three tremors (in which the earth will open and swallow those upon it) &#8211; one in the east, one in the west and one in the Arabian peninsula. And the last of them will be a fire that will come out from Yemen, which will drive the people to the (final) place of assembly.&#8221;</b> [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their story is found in the hadeeth of An-Nuwaas Ibn Sam&#8217;aan (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>). The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said concerning &#8216;Eesaa Ibn Maryam, after the Dajjaal is killed: <b>&#8220;It will be that way, when Allaah will reveal to &#8216;Eesaa: &#8216;I have brought forth certain servants of Mine, against whom none will be able to fight. So lead my servants safely to the Mount (Toor).&#8217; And then Allaah will send Ya&#8217;jooj and Ma&#8217;jooj and they will come swarming down from every slope. The first portion of them will pass by the lake of Tiberias and drink from what is in it. Then the last portion of them will pass by it and say: &#8216;There was once water here.&#8217; They will continue traveling until they will stop at the mountain of Al-Khamar, which is the mount of Al-Bait-ul-Maqdis. Then they will say: &#8216;We have killed those on earth, come, let us now kill those in the heavens.&#8217; So they will begin to throw their arrows toward the sky and Allaah will return their arrows back to them, smeared with blood. Then the Prophet of Allaah (&#8216;Eesaa) and his companions will be laid siege (so severely), to the extent that the head of an ox would be better to one of them than one hundred deenars is to one of you today. So the Prophet of Allaah &#8216;Eesaa and his companions will supplicate to Allaah, and Allaah will send down upon them, insects which will set upon their (i.e. Ya’jooj and Ma’jooj) necks (biting at it). In the morning, they will perish, like one single person. The Prophet of Allaah &#8216;Eesaa and his companions will then descend (from the Mount) to the ground and they will not find a place the size of a hand span, except that it would be filled with their putrefaction and stench. So the Prophet of Allaah &#8216;Eesaa and his companions will beseech Allaah and He will send birds, whose necks look like that of bactrian camels, which will throw them (corpses of Ya&#8217;jooj and Ma&#8217;jooj) wherever Allaah wills.&#8221;</b> [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>4. The Emergence of the Beast</b> &#8211; Linguistically, the word Ad-Daabbah refers to every creature that moves about the earth. What it means here, is the Beast that Allaah will bring forth, close to the establishment of the Hour. Its emergence is confirmed in the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And when the word of torment is fulfilled against them, We shall bring out from the earth, a Beast for them, to speak to them because mankind believed not with certainty in Our Ayaat.&#8221;</b> [Surat-un-Naml (27): 82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;Verily the Hour will never be established until you see ten signs before it.&#8221;</b> And he (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) mentioned from among them: <b>&#8220;The Beast.&#8221;</b> [2Saheeh Muslim and its checking has been stated previously]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing mentioned in the Qur&#8217;aan or the authentic Sunnah that indicates the place from where this Beast will emerge or its description. These two have only been mentioned in ahaadeeth, of which there is speculation concerning their authenticity. What is apparent from the Qur&#8217;aan, however, is that it is a Beast that will warn mankind of the nearness of punishment and destruction, and Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>5. The Rising of the Sun from the West</b> &#8211; The rising of the sun from the west is established in the Qur&#8217;aan and the authentic Sunnah. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;The Day that some of the signs of your Lord do come, no good will it do for a person to believe then, if he believed not before nor earned good (by doing good deeds), through his Faith.&#8221;</b> [Surat-ul-Ana&#8217;aam (6): 158]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of this (some of the signs) is the rising of the sun from the west, for the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;The Hour will not be established until the sun rises from the west. And when it rises and the people see it, they will all believe, and that will be when: &#8216;No good will it do for a person to believe then, if he believed not before nor earned good (by doing good deeds), through his Faith.&#8217;</b>[Surat-ul-Ana&#8217;aam (6): 158]&#8221; [15]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] Refer to the hadeeth of An-Nuwaas Ibn Sam’aan t in Saheeh Muslim (no. 2937). As for his saying: <b>&#8220;He will break the cross and abolish the jizyah (taxation collected from subjected disbelievers). And the prostration (of worship) will be only one &#8211; for Allaah the Lord of the universe&#8221;</b> then it is found in the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah t in Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree (no. 3448) and Saheeh Muslim (no. 155). And there occurs in both Saheehs: <b>&#8220;&#8230;until the single prostration becomes better than the world and what is in it.&#8221;</b> However, the wording that the Shaikh (Ibn Saalih Al-‘Uthaimeen) mentioned has been attributed by Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr in Al-Fath (6/492) to Ibn Mardaweeh. As for his saying: &#8220;He will perform Hajj and &#8216;Umrah&#8221;, then it is found in Saheeh Muslim: Book of Hajj (no. 1252) from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>), that the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;By He whose Hand my soul is in, (‘Eesaa) Ibn Maryam) will surely invoke Allaah’s name (i.e. Tahleel) in the valley of Rauhaa, making Hajj or ‘Umrah or a combination of the two.&#8221;</b></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] Reported by Al-Bukhaaree in At-Taareekh-ul-Kabeer (1/263), At-Tirmidhee (3617) and Al-Aajuree in Ash-Sharee’ah (pg. 381) from the path of: ‘Uthmaan Ibn Ad-Dahhaak on Muhammad Ibn Yoosuf Ibn ‘Abdillaah Ibn Salaam on his father on the authority of his granfather who said that: &#8220;It is written in the Torah, the description of Muhammad and the description of ‘Eesaa Ibn Maryam. And he will be buried with him.&#8221; Al-Bukhaaree said: &#8220;This is not authentic in my opinion and should not be followed.&#8221; At-Tirmidhee said: &#8220;This is a hasan ghareeb hadeeth.&#8221; Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr said in Al-Fath (7/66): &#8220;And it is reported on her &#8211; meaning ‘Aa’ishah (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhaa</i>) &#8211; in a hadeeth that is not established, that she asked permission of the Prophet r, that if she were to outlive him, that she be buried alongside him. So he (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>‘And how can you do that when there is nothing in that place except for my grave and the graves of Abu Bakr, ‘Umar and ‘Eesaa Ibn Maryam.’</b> And in the reports of Madeenah (Akhbaar-ul-Madeenah) from a weak source, it is reported that Sa’eed Ibn Al-Musayyib (ra) said: <b>‘Verily, the three graves are in a section of ‘Aa’ishah’s house. And there is the place where the grave of ‘Eesaa Ibn Maryam is located.’&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] Surat-ul-Kahf (18): 93-94</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: Book of Riqaaq (no. 6530) and Saheeh Muslim: Book of Faith (no. 222) from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;’eed Al-Khudree (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>). And the wording found in both of them is: &#8220;He will say: <b>&#8216;Take out the people of the Fire&#8230;&#8221;</b> The wording found in Al-Bukhaaree (no. 6529) is: <b>&#8220;Extract the People of the Hellfire from your offspring.&#8221;</b> This wording is very close to the wording mentioned by Shaikh Ibn Saalih Al-‘Uthaimeen.</p>
