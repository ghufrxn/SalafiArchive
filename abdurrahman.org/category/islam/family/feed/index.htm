<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Introduction to the English Edition</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise and thanks are due to Allaah, Lord of the worlds. May His peace and prayers be upon Muhammad and upon those who follow his Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">More than likely this book shall attract much attention. Perhaps it shall be a gift from a husband to his wife or perhaps those of us awaiting marriage will eagerly study these few pages to better understand what is expected of us and how we can strive towards it. Nevertheless there will be some who shall huff and utter annoyances under their breath claiming that yet again this is targeted at women (not men), censuring and restricting them. Unfortunately such people will rarely study the text but on flicking through these pages shall come to the conclusion that this has been written by a fanatical male Muslim to tyrannise and discredit the role of women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In six short, concise chapters Muhammad Shūmān has brought together a collection of authentic ahaadeeth and many <em>Aayaat</em> to aid the Muslimah towards righteousness and advise and encourage her with regards to her husbands rights upon her and how she can attain the pleasure of her Creator by doing so. You may find some of the wording harsh, or even strange, but the fault isn&#8217;t in the text, rather in ourselves due to this society where the &#8216;choices&#8217; are only the western liberal choices and hence we have become accustomed to moulding ourselves in a particular way &#8211; sometimes quite alien from Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our duty above all is to worship Allaah, obedience to Him taking precedence over the rest of creation. If He asks us to do something then that should become an aim we try our hardest to fulfill. With this in mind, when we now approach the issue of marriage then it should be made clear that obedience to one&#8217;s husband is an Islamic duty and hence earns the pleasure of our Lord. It must be pointed out that the author has kept his own words to a minimum and instead has based this book on the Sayings of Allaah and His Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) (with the explanation of some prominent scholars) &#8211; thus the Believer has no choice but to submit to it wholeheartedly. Allaah, the Most High says,</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا كَانَ لِمُؤْمِنٍ وَلَا مُؤْمِنَةٍ إِذَا قَضَى اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ أَمْرًا أَن يَكُونَ لَهُمُ الْخِيَرَةُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِمْ ۗ وَمَن يَعْصِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلَالًا مُّبِينًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;It is not fitting for any believing man or woman, when Allaah and His Messenger have decreed any matter that they should have any option in their affair, and whoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger has strayed in plain error.&#8221;</span> (Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we read this and digest it with a sincere heart and recognise that there isn&#8217;t hardship imposed on the woman and ease for the man, rather that which is mentioned shall only lead to greater comfort, ease and satisfaction for both parties. A marriage which starts on the right footing where the husband and wife identify their own roles and compliment each other according to what is contained in the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah then theirs shall be the marriage in which there is happiness and joy &#8211; success in both worlds, for they have put their entire trust in Allaah, He who knows what benefits and rectifies the servants and what harms and corrupts them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Although the pages are few, the lessons are many and even if we were to act on half of them we would feel an immediate change in ourselves and our homes. It is about time that a book of this nature and dealing with such an important topic has become available to the Muslim women in the west where we are in much need of instruction from the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah so that we can easily reject western models and replace them with the best of examples.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We hope that this book will not be misused by husbands but rather that it will serve as a reminder to them also and a warning that they are not left to their customary conduct in this affair. There is advise and encouragement for the husband to live with his wife in a good and honourable manner, taking care of her &#8211; highlighting that the success and tranquility of the marriage does not just fall upon his wife, rather it is a shared responsibility.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah to reward the author for this service and his efforts, and may all the Muslim women who read this try to mould their characteristics upon this noble way and may all the Muslim men help and encourage us towards attaining the rewards and excellence for being a righteous wife.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Author&#8217;s Foreword</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah. We praise Him, we seek His aid and we ask for His forgiveness. We seek Allaah&#8217;s refuge from the evils of ourselves and from our evil actions. Whosoever Allaah guides, there is no one who can misguide him; and whosoever Allaah misguides, there is no one who can guide him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, alone, who has no partner; and I testify that Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) is His slave and Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This treatise, &#8220;<strong>The Righteous Wife</strong>&#8221; is concise in its wording, important in its subject and valuable for the points of benefit it contains. We ask Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, to make this treatise of benefit to our Muslim sisters, and to all those who read it, and that He makes it a work done purely and sincerely to seek His Face. Indeed He is the one who gives bounteously and generously.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Seriousness of the Rights of the Husband</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">الرِّجَالُ قَوَّامُونَ عَلَى النِّسَاءِ بِمَا فَضَّلَ اللَّهُ بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ وَبِمَا أَنفَقُوا مِنْ أَمْوَالِهِمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The men have authority over the women due to the excellence which Allaah has given to the man over the woman, and due to the wealth that they spend upon them.&#8221;</span> [01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ibn Katheer </strong></span>says, &#8220;The man is in charge (<em>qayyim</em>) of the woman, i.e. he is the one in-charge of her, her chief, the one having authority over her and the one who corrects her if she inclines away from what is correct.&#8221; [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Abdur-Rahmaan as-Sa&#8217; dee </span></strong>said (regarding the above mentioned <em>Aayah</em>),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;That is due to the excellence of men over women, and the eminence which they have been given over them. So the pre-eminence of the men over the women is from many aspects: holding positions of leadership and authority is particular to men, likewise Prophethood and Messengership. They are also particularised by many acts of worship such as <em>jihaad</em> , the <em>eids</em> and the <em>Jum&#8217;ah</em> prayers. Also due to the characteristics given to them by Allaah, the like of which are not possessed by women such as sound intellect, composure, patience and endurance. Likewise they are particularised with having to spend upon their wives, and indeed spending in many ways which are particular to the men &#8211; which distinguish them from the women. So perhaps this is the reason for His saying:<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> </strong><strong>وَبِمَا أَنفَقُوا</strong> </span> &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;due to the wealth that they spend&#8230;</span>&#8221; &#8211; and exactly what they spend is not stated to indicate that the spending referred to is general. So from all this it is known that the man is like a governor and master for his wife, and she is with him like a captive. So his role is to take care of that which Allaah has placed him in-charge of, and her role is to be obedient to her Lord and to obey her husband.&#8221; [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Al-Qaasimee</span></strong> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">&#8221; <strong>الرِّجَالُ قَوَّامُونَ عَلَى النِّسَاءِ &#8221; </strong></span>&#8216;The men have authority (<em>qawwaamoon</em>) over the women&#8217; [04] &#8211; <em>qawwaamoon</em> is the plural of <em>qawwaam</em>. <em>Qawwaam</em> is the one who is responsible for taking care of their welfare, managing their affairs and disciplining them. That is, they are in-charge of and are to take care of the manners and behaviour of the women; ordering them and forbidding them, just as the ruler is responsible for his subjects. This is due to two reasons: (i) Due to the nature which Allaah gave them, and (ii) due to the role which they carry out.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first is indicated by the Saying of Allaah:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"> بِمَا فَضَّلَ اللَّهُ بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Due to the excellence which Allaah has given to the man over the woman.&#8221;</span> [05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This refers to the relation between the men and women, and means that the men have a position of dominance over them due to the superiority which Allaah has given to the men over the women.&#8221; [06]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَلِلرِّجَالِ عَلَيْهِنَّ دَرَجَةٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Men have a degree over the women.&#8221;</span> [07]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ibn Katheer</strong> </span>said, &#8220;Meaning: in excellence; in the nature given to them; in manners; in status; in the obedience due to them; in their spending and taking care of the (women&#8217;s) welfare; and in excellence in this life and the Hereafter.&#8221; [08]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#808000;"><em>Every soul from the children of Aadam is a master; so the man is the master of his family, and the woman is the mistress of her household</em>.</span> &#8221; [09]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>&#8220;If I were to order anyone to prostrate to other than Allaah, I would have ordered the woman to prostrate to her husband. By Him in whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad, the woman will not fulfill the rights of her Lord until she fulfills the rights of her husband; and even if he were to request her for herself (i.e. to have intercourse with her) whilst she was sitting upon a camel&#8217;s saddle </em></span>[10]<span style="color:#808000;"><em>, she should not refuse him.&#8221; </em></span>[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;It is not right that any human being should prostrate to another human being, and if it were right for a human being to prostrate to another human being I would have ordered the woman to prostrate to her husband due to the greatness of his right upon her. By Him in whose Hand is my soul, if from his foot to the crown of his head there was a wound pouring forth pus, and she (the wife) came and licked that, then she would (still) not have fulfilled his right. &#8220;</span></em> [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>&#8220;The right of the husband over the wife is such that if he had a wound, or his nostrils were pouring forth pus or blood, then she were to swallow that down &#8211; then she would (still) not have fulfilled his right.&#8221;</em></span> [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Hurayrah, <em>radiyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, reports that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>&#8220;It is not right for a woman to fast </em></span>[14]<span style="color:#808000;"><em> whilst the husband is present except with his permission; </em></span>[15]<span style="color:#808000;"><em> and whatever wealth she spends in charity without his order, then half of the reward is for him. &#8221; </em></span>[16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Shaykh al-Albaanee </span></strong>said<strong><span style="color:#000000;">,</span></strong> &#8220;Since it is an obligation upon the woman to obey her husband with regard to fulfillment of his desire with her, then it is even more fitting that it is obligatory upon her to obey him with regard to that which is even more important than that &#8211; such as what pertains to bringing up the children, correcting her family and the like &#8211; all such rights and obligations.&#8221; [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr </strong></span>said, &#8220;The hadeeth shows that the right of the husband upon the wife has priority over her performing optional good deeds, since his right is an obligation, and fulfillment of an obligation takes precedence over carrying out something optional.&#8221; [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah</span></strong>, <em>rahimahullaah</em>, was asked about a man who has a wife who fasts during the day and stands in prayer throughout the nights. Whenever he calls her to his bed she refuses and gives precedence to praying in the night and fasting during the day over obedience to the husband. So is this permissible? Shaykhul-Islaam replied, &#8220;That is not permissible for her by agreement of the Muslims. Rather it is obligatory upon her to obey when he calls her to the bed, this is a binding obligation upon her. However standing the night in prayer and fasting during the day is optional, so how can a believing woman give precedence to something optional over an obligation&#8230; and there is no right, after the rights of Allaah and His Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) more binding upon the woman than the rights of the husband.&#8221; [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mu&#8217;aadh ibn Jabal, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, said that the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;If the woman knew the right of the husband, she would not sit when his morning and evening meals were presented until he finished. &#8220;</span></em> [20]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Encouragement of Obedience to the Husband and Seeking to Please Him</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Hurayrah, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, said that the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;If a woman prays her five (daily prayers), fast her month (i.e. Ramadaan), guards her private parts, and obeys her husband, it will be said to her, &#8216;Enter Paradise through whichever of the gates of Paradise you wish.'&#8221;</span></em> [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>&#8220;Your women from the people of Paradise are the beloved and fertile, the one who is an asset to her husband, who if her husband becomes angry- comes and places her hand in the hand of her husband and says, &#8216;I will not taste sleep until you are pleased (with me). &#8220;&#8216;</em></span> [22]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Warning Against Causing the Husband to Become Angry, Disobeying His Orders and Neglecting His Rights</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fadaalah ibn &#8216;Ubayd, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, said that the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>&#8220;There are three who are not to be asked about: </em></span>[23]<span style="color:#808000;"><em> A man who abandon s the Jamaa&#8217;ah </em></span>[24] <span style="color:#808000;"><em>and disobeys his ruler </em></span>[25]<span style="color:#808000;"><em> and dies in a state of disobedience &#8211; so do not ask about him; a female slave or a male slave who flees from his master; and a woman whose husband is away, and he has provided for her worldly needs, yet she adorns and displays herself </em></span>[26] <span style="color:#808000;"><em>and roams around freely</em></span> [27] <span style="color:#808000;"><em>without him &#8211; so do not ask about them. &#8221; </em></span>[28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;"> &#8220;There are three whose prayers will not be raised above their ears: the runaway slave until he returns; a woman who spends the night whilst her husband is angry with her; </span></em>[29]<em><span style="color:#808000;"> and one who leads a people in prayer and they dislike him.</span></em>[30] [31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;Allaah will not Look at a woman who does not give thanks to her husband and she cannot do without him. &#8220;</span></em> [32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Hurayrah, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, reports that the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;By Him in whose Hand is my soul, there is no man who calls his wife to his bed and she refuses him except that the One who is in the heaven is angry with her until he (her husband) is pleased with her. &#8220;</span></em> [33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;"> &#8220;When a woman spends the night forsaking the bed of her husband, then the angels curse her until she returns. &#8220;</span></em> [34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>&#8220;If a man calls his wife to his bed and she refuses, and he spends the night angry with her, then the angels curse her until morning. &#8220;</em></span> [35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said to a woman, <em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;Indeed he is your Paradise and your Fire.&#8221; </span></em>[36] Meaning her husband.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whichever woman obeys Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, with regard to her husband and fulfills his rights, then he will be her Paradise &#8211; meaning he will be a cause for her entering Paradise; and if she is disobedient to her husband &#8211; then the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mu&#8217;aadh ibn Jabal, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, said that the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;A woman does not harm her husband in this world except that his wife from the large eyed hooris (al-Hoorul &#8216;Een) </span></em>[37]<em><span style="color:#808000;"> says, &#8216;Do not harm him, may Allaah kill you,for he is just a passing guest with you and is about to leave you and come to us.&#8217; &#8220;</span></em>[38]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Excellence of a Righteous Wife</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullaah ibn &#8216;Amr, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, said that the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;All of this world is a utility and the best utility is a righteous wife. &#8220;</span></em> [39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa&#8217;d ibn Abee Waqqaas, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, said that the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;Four things are from prosperity: a righteous woman, a spacious dwelling, a righteous neighbour and an agreeable riding beast; and four things are from adversity: an evil neighbour, an evil woman, a bad riding beast and a cramped dwelling. &#8220;</span> </em>[40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thawbaan, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, nararted, &#8220;When revelation was sent down concerning silver and gold, [41] they said, &#8216;So which wealth shall we possess?&#8217; &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;I shall find this out for you.&#8217; So he hastened upon his camel and went to the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) and I followed him. So he said, &#8216;O Messenger of Allaah, which wealth shall we possess?&#8217; So he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8216;<em>Let one of you possess a heart which is thankful, a tongue which makes mention of(Allaah), and a believing wife who helps one of you upon the affairs of the Hereafter.</em>&#8216;&#8221;</span> [42]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The righteous wife is the one whom the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) advised should be obtained right from the beginning. As Aboo Hurayrah, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, narrated from the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;A woman is married for four reasons: for her wealth; for her lineage; for her beauty; and for her religion (Deen). So marry the one who is good in her religion (Deen) &#8211; may your hands be covered in dust.&#8221;</span></em> [43]  [44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr said</span></strong>, &#8220;The meaning is that what is fitting for a person upon the religion and of good manners is that the religion should be the aim which he gives importance to in all of his affairs &#8211; particularly those affairs which he will be involved in for a long period of time. So the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) commanded him to obtain a woman who is good in her practice of the religion &#8211; which is the goal that is desired.&#8221; [45]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Attributes of the Righteous Wife</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">1. Devotion and obedience to Allaah, the Most High</span></strong>, such that she fulfills His rights, such as the prayer, fasting, chastity, covering herself, withholding her gaze and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">2. Obedience to her husband</span></strong> in that which does not involve disobedience to Allaah, the Most High, such that she fulfills his rights completely, and fro m them are what has proceeded in the first chapter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">3. That she guards and preserves herself and her honour, in the absence of her husband</span></strong>, from the hand of anyone wishing to touch her, the eye of anyone wishing to look upon her, and the ear of anyone wishing to listen to her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise that she preserves her husband&#8217;s children, home and wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">فَالصَّالِحَاتُ قَانِتَاتٌ حَافِظَاتٌ لِّلْغَيْبِ بِمَا حَفِظَ اللَّهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Therefore the righteous women are obedient to Allaah and their husbands, and guard that which Allaah has ordered them to guard (their chastity and their husbands property) in the absence of their husbands.&#8221;</span> [46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Sa&#8217;dee said, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>فَالصَّالِحَاتُ قَانِتَاتٌ</strong></span> meaning they are obedient to Allaah, the Most High; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>حَافِظَاتٌ لِّلْغَيْبِ</strong></span> meaning they are obedient to their husbands even when the husbands are absent, she guards herself and her husband&#8217;s property.&#8221; [47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;If a woman prays her five (daily prayers), fasts her month (i.e. Ramadaan), guards her private parts, and obeys her husband, it will be said to her, &#8216;Enter Paradise through whichever of the gates of Paradise you wish. &#8216;&#8221;</span></em> [48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">4. Serving her husband.</span> </strong>First of all by carrying out what is required in his house, such as bringing up and educating the children, preparing the meals and the beds and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Husayn ibn Mihsan who said that my paternal aunt said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;I came to Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) for some need, so he asked, &#8216;You there! Are you married?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; He then asked, <span style="color:#808000;">&#8216;How are you towards your husband?&#8217;</span> She responded, &#8216;I do not fall short in his service except with regard to what I am unable to do. &#8216; He said, <span style="color:#808000;">&#8216;Then look to your standing with him, for indeed he is your Paradise and your Fire .&#8221;&#8216;</span> </em>[49]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here is an example of how Asmaa&#8217; bint Abee Bakr, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhumaa</em>, served her husband. She said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Az-Zubayr married me and he did not have any property or slaves or anything upon the earth except for a camel which drew water from the well and his horse. So I used to feed his horse, draw the water, stitch his water bucket, and prepare the dough, but I was not proficient in baking bread &#8211; so ladies from the Ansaar who were my neighbours and were honourable used to bake the bread for me. I also used to carry the date-stones upon my head, from the land given to az-Zubayr by Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) &#8211; and it was about two miles away. One day when I was coming with the date-stones on my head, I met Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) and a group of the Ansaar were with him. So he called me and said, &#8216;Ikh, ikh.&#8217; [50] in order to carry me behind him upon the camel. But I felt shy to proceed along with the men, and I thought of az-Zubayr and his sense of jealousy, and he was one of the most jealous of the people. So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) saw my shyness and so passed on. So I came to az-Zubayr and said, &#8216;Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) met me while I was carrying the date stones upon my head and with him were a group of his Companions. He caused his riding camel to kneel, but I felt shy and remembered your sense of jealousy.&#8217; So he said, &#8216;By Allaah your having to carry the date-stones is harder upon me than that you should ride along with him.&#8221;&#8216; She said, &#8220;Then later on Aboo Bakr sent me a servant to look after the horse, so it was as if he had set me free.&#8221; [51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars differ with regard to the ruling about a woman serving her husband. Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah said, &#8220;The scholars differed about whether she has to serve her husband with regard to the like of household bedding, preparing food and drinks, baking the bread, grinding the corn, and providing food for his slaves and cattle &#8211; such as providing fodder for his riding beast and so on. &#8220;Some of them say: It is not obligatory for her to serve him &#8211; and this is a weak saying, like the weakness of the saying that it is not obligatory upon her to live together with him and have intercourse with him! However what is correct is that it is obligatory to serve him, since the husband is her master according to the Book of Allaah, and she is a captive with him according to the Sunnah of the Prophet [52] (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم), and the captive and the slave have to serve &#8211; and this is something known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;the Saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">فَالصَّالِحَاتُ قَانِتَاتٌ حَافِظَاتٌ لِّلْغَيْبِ بِمَا حَفِظَ اللَّهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Therefore the righteous women are obedient to Allaah and their husbands, and guard that which Allaah has ordered them to guard (their chastity and their husbands property) in the absence of their husbands.&#8221;</span> [53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This <em>Aayah</em> shows that it is obligatory upon her to serve her husband unrestrictedly, including: serving him, travelling along with him , making herself available to him, and so on &#8211; just as it is obligatory to obey the parents, since the obedience due from her to the parents transfers to the husband.&#8221; [54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">5. Keeping the husbands secrets.</span></strong> Particularly what occurs between him and her in private &#8211; with regard to sexual matters and the private affairs within the marriage. Disclosing the husbands secrets will hurt him and anger him and this contradicts obedience to him and seeking to please him. Furthermore preserving his secrets is one of the duties of the righteous and obedient women, as described in the Saying of Allaah,</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">حَافِظَاتٌ لِّلْغَيْبِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Guarding that which (Allaah has commanded them to guard) in the absence of their husbands.&#8221;</span> [55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Part of their guarding what they are to guard in the absence of their husbands is that they should not broadcast their secrets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Asmaa&#8217; bint Yazeed, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhaa</em>, who said that she was in the company of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) and men and women were sitting, and he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>&#8220;Perhaps a man mentions that which he did with his wife, and perhaps a woman informs of what she does with her husband?!&#8221; So the people were silent, so I said, &#8220;Yes, by Allaah, O Messenger of Allaah! The women certainly do that, and the men certainly do that.&#8221; He (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said, &#8220;Then do not do so, since that is just like a male devil meeting a female devil upon the way, and he has intercourse with her while the people are watching. &#8220;</em></span> [56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">6. She should appear before the husband in the best appearance</span></strong>, such that if he looks at her it pleases him. Aboo Hurayrah, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, narrates the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) was asked,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;Which of the women is the best?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;The one who gives him </span></em>[57]<em><span style="color:#808000;"> pleasure when he looks;</span></em>[58]<em><span style="color:#808000;"> obeys him when he orders; and does not go against his wishes with regard to herself or her wealth by doing that which he dislikes. &#8220;</span></em> [59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">7. She should not spend any of his wealth or her wealth except with his permission.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From &#8216;Abdullaah ibn &#8216;Amr ibn al-&#8216; Aas, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, who said that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8221; It is not permissible for a woman to give a gift except with the permission of her husband. &#8220;</span> </em>[60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Albaanee</strong> said, &#8220;However it is not becoming for the husband &#8211; if he is a sincere Muslim &#8211; that he should use this ruling to play the tyrant with his wife and to prevent her from utilizing her wealth in a manner which will not harm either of them. Indeed this right is very similar to the right of the girls guardian &#8211; who is such that she cannot get herself married except with his permission. But if he unjustly prevents her, then the matter is raised to the Islamic judge for justice to be attained. Likewise is the ruling with regard to a woman&#8217;s wealth if her husband oppresses her and prevents her from spending her wealth in a lawful and prescribed manner &#8211; then the judge will also bring about justice for her. So there is no problem with the ruling itself, rather the problem is in how it is misused.&#8221; [61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">8. She should not permit anyone to enter her husbands house except with his permission.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Aboo Hurayrah, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, who said that the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;It is not permissible for a woman to fast when her husband is present except with his permission; nor may she permit anyone to enter his house except with his permission; and whatever she spends in charity without his order &#8211; then half of the reward is for him. &#8220;</span></em> [62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>9. She should not ask her husband for divorce without a reason necessitating that.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Thawbaan, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, who said that the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;Whichever woman asks her husband for divorce without a strong reason &#8211; then the fragrance of Paradise will be forbidden for her. &#8220;</span></em> [63]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">10. Avoidance of cursing.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Sa&#8217;eed al-Khudree, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, said</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em> &#8220;The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) went out to the prayer-ground for the (prayer of) Adhaa or Fitr, and he passed by the women and said, &#8216;O women! Give in charity,for I have been shown that you shall be the majority of the people of the Fire .&#8217; So they asked, &#8216;Why is that, 0 Messenger of Allaah?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;You curse frequently and are ungrateful to your husbands. &#8216;&#8221;</em> </span>[64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">11. Being thankful to the husband for the good he does and for his good treatment of his wife.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is accomplished by good words, and by her obedience to him in what is good, and by not forgetting his good treatment and avoiding denying this, since that is one of the reasons which brings about entry into the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn &#8216;Abbaas, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, who said that the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;I was shown the Fire and found that the majority of its inhabitants were women, due to ingratitude. It was said: &#8220;Is it that they disbelieve in Allaah?&#8221; He said: They are ungrateful to their husbands and deny the good they do. If you were to treat one of them well always, and she then saw something (displeasing) from you she would say: &#8216;I have never seen any good from you. &#8216;&#8221;</span></em> [65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;Allaah will not look at a woman who is not thankful to her husband and she cannot do without him.&#8221;</span></em> [66]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">12. She should not remove her clothes outside her husbands house.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;Whichever woman removes her clothes in other than her house, then Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, will tear down His cover from her. &#8220;</span> </em>[67]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Manaawee said</strong>, &#8216;&#8221;Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, will tear down His cover from her&#8217; since because she has failed to take care of what she has been commanded with regard to covering herself from strangers, then this is the recompense she receives, the recompense being of the type of the action. What is apparent is that removal of her clothing means uncovering herself to strange males, for the purpose of sexual intercourse or that which leads to it. As opposed to the case if she were to remove her clothes amongst women, whilst covering her private parts, since there is no reason for that to enter into this warning.&#8221; [68]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">13. Striving to please the husband by every possible means.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hadeeth has already preceded containing the saying of the righteous wife, &#8220;<strong>&#8230; I will not taste sleep until you are pleased (with me)</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There also occurs in <em>al-Kabaa&#8217;ir</em> of adh-Dhahabee, &#8220;What is obligatory upon the woman is that she seeks the pleasure of her husband, and avoids angering him, and does not refuse him whenever he wants her. The woman must also know that she is like a slave to her husband, so she should not do anything affecting herself or her husbands wealth except with his permission. She should give precedence to his rights over her rights, and the rights of his relatives over the rights of her relatives, and she should keep herself clean and be ready for him to enjoy her. She should not boast at his expense of her beauty, nor rebuke him for any ugliness found in him. The woman must also be always modest and reserved in the presence of her husband, lower her eyes in front of him, obey his commands, remain silent when he speaks, keep far away from everything which angers him, avoid treachery when he is absent, with regard to his bed, his wealth and his house. She should ensure that her aroma is pleasant, be accustomed to using musk and perfume and cleaning her mouth with siwaak. She should be constant in adorning herself in his presence and not when he is absent. She should treat his family and relatives honourably, and consider something small from him as something great.&#8221; [69]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Means to Help the Wife to Attain These Attributes</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowing the greatness and exaltedness of Allaah, the Most High, and that He is the True God, the One who watches over His creation, and that His Religion is the true and straight way, and the laws He had prescribed are the straight path, and to know the perfectness of His Wisdom in whatever He orders and forbids, and whatever He decrees and chooses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore that His knowledge comprehends everything to be known, what is apparent and what is hidden: so He knows what benefits the servants and what harms them. He knows what will rectify them and what will ruin and corrupt them. He, the One free of all imperfections, is also the Most Merciful of all those who show mercy, so He does not order His servants except with that which is good for them in their Religion and their worldly-life, and brings about felicity for them in this world and the Hereafter; and He does not forbid them except from that which will bring misery for them in this world and the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whatever He, the One free of all imperfections, has prescribed is a mercy and a blessing; and whoever proceeds upon that way and follows it will be one of those who are happy and successful in both worlds, and will live a fine life filled with happiness and joy, they will not be miserable at all except in those things where they contradict the commandments of their Lord, the Mighty and Majestic. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">مَنْ عَمِلَ صَالِحًا مِّن ذَكَرٍ أَوْ أُنثَىٰ وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَلَنُحْيِيَنَّهُ حَيَاةً طَيِّبَةً ۖ وَلَنَجْزِيَنَّهُمْ أَجْرَهُم بِأَحْسَنِ مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Whoever does a righteous deed, whether male or female, and is a true-Believer, we will give him a good life (by granting him contentment) and we will reward them in the Hereafter in accordance with the best of what they used to do.&#8221;</span> [70]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the One free of all imperfections, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَنْ أَعْرَضَ عَن ذِكْرِي فَإِنَّ لَهُ مَعِيشَةً ضَنكًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And whoever turns away from my reminder, then there is for him a life of hardship and wretchedness.&#8221;</span> [71]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if the wife is aware of the greatness of Allaah, the Most High, and His perfect wisdom, and His all-encompassing knowledge, and His extensive mercy, then she will strive to obey Him, the Majestic and Most High, and to be obedient to her husband as He has commanded her. She will hasten to fulfill his rights without hesitation or laziness, and she will not say: &#8216;why is it the case that the man is in authority over me?!&#8217; &#8216;why do I have to obey him?!&#8217; &#8216;why &#8230; why?!&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا كَانَ لِمُؤْمِنٍ وَلَا مُؤْمِنَةٍ إِذَا قَضَى اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ أَمْرًا أَن يَكُونَ لَهُمُ الْخِيَرَةُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِمْ ۗ وَمَن يَعْصِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلَالًا مُّبِينًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;It is not for any believing man or woman, when Allaah and His Messenger have decreed any matter that they should have any option in their affair, and whoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger has strayed in plain error.&#8221;</span> [72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the One free of all imperfections, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">فَلَا وَرَبِّكَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ حَتَّىٰ يُحَكِّمُوكَ فِيمَا شَجَرَ بَيْنَهُمْ ثُمَّ لَا يَجِدُوا فِي أَنفُسِهِمْ حَرَجًا مِّمَّا قَضَيْتَ وَيُسَلِّمُوا تَسْلِيمًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;So no, by your Lord, they cannot be Believers until they make you, 0 Muhammad, judge in all disputes between them, then they do not find any opposition in themselves against your judgements, and they accept them with full submission.&#8221;</span> [73]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the means which will help her to attain the attribute of the righteous women is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">• Desire for that which Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, has prepared for the righteous women in Paradise </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The comprehensive good and the huge reward which is such as has been seen by no eye, heard by no ear, nor imagined by any human heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>• Fear of the retribution and Anger of Allaah, the One free of all imperfections and the Most High </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fear of all that He has prepared for the disobedient in the Hereafter with regard to punishment, disgrace, and severe and painful torment, may Allaah save us from that, by His grace and favour.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have also already brought two chapters: one in encouragement of looking after the rights of the husband, and the other warning against neglecting his rights.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">• Seeking the Aid of Allaah, the Most High</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since the attainment of the smallest good is not possible unless Allaah, the Most High, guides and sets one straight. Concerning this Allaah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">فَالصَّالِحَاتُ قَانِتَاتٌ حَافِظَاتٌ لِّلْغَيْبِ بِمَا حَفِظَ اللَّهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Therefore the righteous women are obedient to Allaah and their husbands, and guard that which Allaah has ordered them to guard (their chastity and their husbands property) in the absence of their husbands.&#8221;</span> [74]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the meaning of  <strong>بِمَا حَفِظَ اللَّهُ </strong> is:&#8217;by Allaah&#8217;s guarding and protecting them when they become like that.&#8217; This is what at-Tabaree [75] and a group of the scholars of tafseer said.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">From the greatest aids to a wife&#8217;s righteousness is:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>• That she keeps company with righteous and pious women, that she listens to them, and seeks to be like them; and that she avoids the company of corrupt women, and avoids sitting with them and listening to them. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed she should beware of observing their making a display of themselves, and showing their nakedness, and their evil manners, whether this is seen by means of television, video or whatever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;The example of the righteous companion and the evil companion is like that of a seller of musk and the blacksmiths bellows. From the musk seller you will either buy some musk or at least enjoy its good smell. But the bellows of the blacksmith will either burn your house or your clothes, or at least you will receive a bad smell from it. &#8220;</span></em> [76]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>An-Nawawee</strong> <strong>said</strong></span>, &#8220;It shows the excellence of sitting with the righteous, and the people of good, and those possessing good character and fine manners and piety, and the people of knowledge and refinement; and the forbiddence of sitting with the people of evil, and the people of innovation, and those who backbite the people, or those who are commonly involved in shamelessness and idleness, and such reprehensible folk.&#8221; [77]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Ar-Raaghib said</span></strong>, &#8220;This hadeeth indicates that it is a duty upon a person to strive to the utmost of his ability to accompany and sit with good people, since this may cause a bad person to become a person of good, just as accompanying evil people may turn a person from good to bad. So just as it is seen that water and air can be corrupted by being next to a rotting corpse, then what do you think will be the effect upon human souls which are such that they accept and take on the good and the evil which they see?!&#8221; [78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from that which will make it easier for a woman to attain the attributes of the righteous women: is that she should choose a righteous husband, and the woman should straight away reject any proposal of marriage unless they come from a person who is good in his practice of the Religion and his manners, who is such that he will assist her upon the affairs of the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;If there comes to you </span></em>[79] <em><span style="color:#808000;">one </span></em>[80]<em><span style="color:#808000;"> whose character and Religion are pleasing to you, then marry (her) to him; if you do not do so it will result in tribulation upon the earth and widespread corruption.&#8221; </span></em>[81]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Epilogue</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As it is the case that the woman is commanded to be obedient to her husband, and to seek to please him, and to take care of his rights, then it is also the case that the husband is commanded to treat her well, and with kindness, and to have patience with any bad characteristics and the like that may be seen from her. He must give her rights of provision and clothing, and that he lives with her in a good and honourable manner, as Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَعَاشِرُوهُنَّ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And live with them in a good manner.&#8221;</span> [82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#808000;"><em>Take care of the women.</em></span>&#8221; [83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said, &#8220;<em><span style="color:#808000;">The most complete of the Believers are the best of them in manners, and the best of them are those who are best to their women</span></em>.&#8221; [84]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Iyaas ibn &#8216; Abdullaah ibn Abee Dhubaab, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em> , who said that the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>&#8221;Do not beat the female servants of Allaah. So &#8216;Umar came to the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) and said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah! The women have become emboldened towards their husbands. </em></span>[85]<span style="color:#808000;"><em> So he gave permission to strike them, so they were struck. Then many women came to the wives of Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) (complaining about their husbands), so in the morning he said: Seventy women have this night visited the family of Muhammad, each of them complaining about her husband. So you will not find those </em></span>[86] [87]<span style="color:#808000;"><em> men to be the best amongst you.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This concludes what we wished to draw attention to in this brief treatise, which, if Allaah wills, will be beneficial. &#8220;How free and far removed from all imperfections You are, O Allaah, and all praise is for You. I declare You free of all defects and praise You alone. I testify that none has the right to be worshipped but You. I seek Your forgiveness and turn in repentance to You.&#8221; [88]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[86] i.e. those men who beat their wives severely and frequently.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[87] Reported by Aboo Daawood (Eng. transl. 2/575/no.2141), Ibn Maajah and others. al-Albaanee said of it in Saheeh Ibn Maajah: &#8220;Hasan Saheeh&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[88] Reported by al-Haakim ( I/537) and others from Jubayr ibn Mut&#8217;im, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, who said that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;Whoever says, &#8216;How free and far removed from all imperfections You are, 0 Allaah, and all praise is for You. I declare You free of all defects and praise You alone. I testify that none has the right to be worshipped but You. I seek Your forgiveness and turn in repentance to You&#8217;, saying it in a sitting of remembrance (of Allaah), then it will be like a seal upon it, and whoever says it in a sitting of loose talk, then it will be an expiation for it. &#8221; </span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AI-Haakim said: &#8220;Saheeh to the standard of Muslim&#8221; and adh-Dhahabee agreed, and al-Albaanee agreed in Silsilatul-Ahaadeethis-Saheehah (no.8 1).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>[The following article has been extracted from Al-Ibaanah e-Book :<br />
<a title="Your Flesh and Blood : The Rights of Children : Shaikh Muhammad Baazmool" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/01/27/fleshblood/">Your Flesh and Blood : The Rights of Children</a> – Shaikh Muhammad Baazmool ]</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Know that children are a source of trials (<i>fitnah</i>).</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p>وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّمَا أَمْوَالُكُمْ وَأَوْلَادُكُمْ فِتْنَةٌ وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ أَجْرٌ عَظِيمٌ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“And know that your possessions and your children are but a trial and that surely, with </b><b>Allaah is a mighty reward.” </b>[Surah Al-Anfaal 8: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>It is stated in <i>Adwaa-ul-Bayaan</i>: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah ordered the people in this noble ayah to be aware that their properties and children are a trial for them by which they will be tested. Will your wealth and your children be a cause for you to fall into that which Allaah is displeased with?! Elsewhere (in the Qur’aan), He adds to this saying that wives are also a trial just like wealth and children, thus ordering the individual to beware of them putting him into that which Allaah is not pleased with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then He orders the individual – if he should see something he dislikes from these enemies who are the closest and most special of people to him, i.e. his children and wives – to forgive them, pardon them and not hold them accountable. So he should beware of them firstly and then pardon them if some thing should occur from them. This is found in His statement in Surah At-Taghaabun:</p>
<p>يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِنَّ مِنْ أَزْوَاجِكُمْ وَأَوْلَادِكُمْ عَدُوًّا لَّكُمْ فَاحْذَرُوهُمْ ۚ وَإِن تَعْفُوا وَتَصْفَحُوا وَتَغْفِرُوا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ &#8211; 64:14</p>
<p>إِنَّمَا أَمْوَالُكُمْ وَأَوْلَادُكُمْ فِتْنَةٌ ۚ وَاللَّهُ عِندَهُ أَجْرٌ عَظِيمٌ &#8211; 64:15</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>‘O you who believe, verily among your wives and your children are enemies for you, so </b><b>beware of them. But if you pardon (them) and overlook and forgive (their faults), then </b><b>verily, Allaah is All-Forgiving, Most-Merciful. Your wealth and your children are only a </b><b>trial, whereas Allaah – with Him is a great reward.’ </b>[Surah At-Taghaabun 64: 14-15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then asserts somewhere else (in the Qur’aan) that it is forbidden for the believers to let their wealth and children divert them from His Remembrance, stating that whoever let’s this happen is a loser who has been duped out of his shares. The ayah being referred to is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تُلْهِكُمْ أَمْوَالُكُمْ وَلَا أَوْلَادُكُمْ عَن ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ ۚ وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذَٰلِكَ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْخَاسِرُونَ &#8211; 63:9</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>‘O you who believe, let not your properties or your children divert you from the </b><b>Remembrance of Allaah. And whosoever does that, they are the losers.’ </b>[Surah AlMunaafiqoon 63: 9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word <b>‘fitnah’</b>, as mentioned in these verses, means a trial and a test. This is one of the many meanings this word possesses in the Qur’aan.” [28]</p>
<p>~~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Neither the wife nor the children of an individual will pick up the burden of his shortcomings and deficiencies on his behalf. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">لَن تَنفَعَكُمْ أَرْحَامُكُمْ وَلَا أَوْلَادُكُمْ ۚ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ يَفْصِلُ بَيْنَكُمْ ۚ وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ &#8211; 60:3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“Neither your relatives nor your children will be of avail to you on the Day of </b><b>Resurrection. He will judge between you. And Allaah is All-Seer of what you do.” </b>[Surah Al-Mumtahanah 60: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So children are a source of <i>fitnah </i>– they are a trial and a test. Allaah will test us by them. So we should fear Allaah with regard to them and give them the proper rights that they deserve. Or should we forfeit these rights, when Allaah will ask us about them?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan (rahimahullah) reported: ‘Ubaidullaah bin Ziyad went to visit Ma’qil bin Yassaar while he was suffering from the illness that he eventually died from. So Ma’qil said: “I will indeed narrate a hadeeth to you that I heard from Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) . I heard the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>‘There is no servant whom Allaah has granted responsibility over a group of </b><b>people, then fails to look after them in an honest manner, except that he will not </b><b>experience the fragrance of Paradise.’</b>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration of this hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“There is no servant whom Allaah has granted </b><b>responsibility over a group of people, then dies on the day that he dies whilst in a state </b><b>of deceiving his people, except that Allaah makes Paradise forbidden for him.” [</b>29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Children are a source for causing one to divert away from the Remembrance of Allaah. At times, they may even lead you to disobey Him. In these cases, they are an enemy that you should beware of!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) has instructed us how to expiate this <i>fitnah</i>. Hudhaifah ( رضي الله عنه ) reported: “We were sitting one day with ‘Umar ( رضي الله عنه ) when he asked us: ‘Which one of you memorized the words of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) concerning trials?’ I replied: ‘I did, just as he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said it.’ He said: ‘You are quick to respond!!’ I said:‘<b>A man’s trials with regard to his </b><b>family, his wealth, his children and his neighbor are expiated by prayer, fasting, charity, </b><b>and commanding (good) and forbidding (evil).’</b>” [30]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[45] <strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">If a girl has reached the proper age for getting married, can her guardian force her to get married?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: It is not permissible for the guardian of a girl’s affairs to force her into getting married. So if the girl has not reached the proper age and has been forced into marriage, she can look for a way to dissolve this marriage after having reached the age of comprehension and maturity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because there was a girl that was forced into marriage during the time of the Messenger of Allaah, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam. After the marriage, she went to the Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, and said to him: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah! My father has married me to a man that I dislike, in order to raise his own status.&#8221; So the Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, nullified her marriage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this, it is not permissible for a girl’s guardian to force her into marriage, regardless if she is a girl who has reached the legitimate age (of marriage) or she is divorced or she was married and then lost her husband. Rather it is only required of him to direct her towards what is most beneficial for her in her affairs of this world and the hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216; alayhi wa sallam, said: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;There is no marriage except with (the permission of) a guardian and (the presence of) two trustworthy witnesses.&#8221;</span> And he, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, also said: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Do not force your women (to get married), but rather get their consent.&#8221;</span> And he, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, said: &#8220;Her silence is her consent.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are etiquettes and conditions that must be adhered to. However, at times there occurs something that opposes the Divine Legislation, such as when the father prevents his daughter and delays her marriage because of a materialistic ambition. Or because the man proposing marriage to her is poor, and due to this, his status will not be elevated. And so the girl remains without a husband. In this situation, the Divine Legislation has permitted her to marry herself because the Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, has said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Any woman that marries herself without the permission of her guardian, then her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid. But if they differ, then the authoritative figure (sultaan) is the guardian of one who has no guardian.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, this girl – whose father has prevented her marriage due to an obvious materialistic reason – she can take her case to a legitimate judge. So he will investigate the guardian of the girl&#8217;s affairs and interrogate him as to the reason why he is preventing her (from getting married). So if he hears a legitimate reason from him, such as that the man intending marriage is an innovator or he doesn&#8217;t pray or that he drinks alcohol, then the judge cannot oppose him in this. But if he hears illegitimate reasons from him, then at that point, the judge can assume guardianship of her marriage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[48] <strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling concerning putting limitations to the amount of offspring one has?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The person that limits his offspring without having a legitimate reason for doing so, I hold him to be <strong>foolish</strong> if not a disbeliever in the Qadaa and the Qadar (Divine Execution and Preordainment) of Allaah. This is since the individual that limits his progeny to only three children, for example, and he has reached the age of fifty (!), the thought of death does not even cross his mind, or that some violent storm should come and take the lives of his three children, thus leaving him till the end of his life as if he were barren and without offspring. Therefore, those that put limits to the amount of children they have, they do not reflect upon the things that every Muslim reflects on. And it is Al-Qadar (Preordainment), which befalls the people in the way that He wants, not in the way that they want. So this practice that is done in current times, is a severe negligence and a clear deprivation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Asaalah, Issue #2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[49] <strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Does the ruling on birth control differ from that of family limitation (of offspring)? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: Birth control has some detail to it. Therefore, I say that this thing, which has come to be known as &#8220;birth control&#8221; is from that which the Muslims of today are being tested by in the lands of Islaam. However, there are cases from it, which must be referred back to the motive behind it. An example of this is when the motive for this birth control is based on a prescription from Muslim doctors who are advising the couple towards this so-called &#8220;birth control&#8221; to safeguard the health of the woman who has departed from her natural state due to her having delivered many children! So if a skilled Muslim doctor issues these instructions as a form of advice, then that becomes a legitimate excuse for (the allowance of) this birth control.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an example in which birth control is permissible. As for an example that is contrary to this one, then it is such as when the motive behind it is due to poverty (!) or because of bills, which is always on the minds of the disbelievers!! So you can see one of them say: &#8220;My wife and I are two. And I have two children!! And the fifth member of them is their dog!! So this monthly pay that we receive is just enough for us (to pay our bills), and that&#8217;s all [five]!&#8221; This is not permissible in Islaam because this motive emanates from the logic of the Days of Ignorance, which we were warned to avoid and stay away from. Such is found in Allaah&#8217;s saying: &#8220;And do not kill your children for fear of poverty. We will provide you with sustenance as well as them.&#8221; [Surah Al-Ana’aam: 151]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is especially the case since the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Muslims believe that the child comes with his sustenance (already) with him</strong></span>. This is because, before it comes out into this world, its sustenance is ordained for it while it is in the womb of its mother, as has been clarified to us in the Noble Sunnah. So this example of birth control, with this motive, is not permissible at all. As for the baseless and false reasons that some people have used to justify and allow it, then they have no place in the Religion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Q: Is it permissible for a boy to sleep with his mother and his sister if he has reached the age of puberty?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is not permissible for boys who have reached the <strong>age of puberty or ten years of age</strong> to sleep with their mothers or their sisters in the same bed, out of protection of honors, to keep away from Fitnah (temptation) and block the means leading to sin. The Prophet (peace be upon him) asked us to separate the beds of boys and girls when they reach the age of ten in his saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;">Command your children to offer Salah (Prayer) when they become seven years old; beat them for (neglecting) it when they become ten years old; and arrange their beds (to sleep) separately.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Abu Dawud, Sunan, Book on Salah, no. 495; and Ahmad, Musnad, vol. 2, p. 187.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who have not reached the age of puberty yet, they are asked to take permission when entering the rooms three times when people put on light clothes and `Awrah (parts of the body that must be covered in public) most probably could be revealed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;">O you who believe! Let your slaves and slave-girls, and those among you who have not come to the age of puberty ask your permission (before they come to your presence) on three occasions: before Fajr (morning) Salât (prayer), and while you put off your clothes for the noonday (rest), and after the ‘Ishâ’ (late-night) Salât (prayer). (These) three times are of privacy for you; other than these times there is no sin on you or on them to move about, attending to each other. Thus Allâh makes clear the Ayât (the Verses of this Qur’ân, showing proofs for the legal aspects of permission for visits) to you. And Allâh is All-Knowing, All-Wise. <span style="color:#666699;"> [Surah Al-Nur, 24: 58]</span></span></p>
<p>Those who have reached the age of puberty are required to take permission at all times.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;">And when the children among you come to puberty, then let them (also) ask for permission, as those senior to them (in age). Thus Allâh makes clear His Ayât (Commandments and legal obligations) for you. And Allâh is All-Knowing, All-Wise. <span style="color:#666699;">[Surah Al-Nur, 24: 59]</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All this is for the purpose of keeping away Fitnah, protecting honors and eliminating the means leading to evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for boys who are less than ten years old, it is permissible for them to sleep with their mothers and sisters in their beds, as they need care and to remove hardship. However, if there is no fear of Fitnah, it is permissible for them to sleep in the same room, even if they are adults, but each one on a separate bed.<br />
May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 12: A man has many children and lives with his family in a small room that hardly accommodates them. What should he do in order not to contradict the order of the Messenger of Allah that children should be separated in beds at certain age?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Having separate beds for children is Wajib (obligatory) according to one&#8217;s ability. The Muslim should strive hard to fulfill that. Allah (Exalted be He) said, So keep your duty to Allâh and fear Him as much as you can The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, When I command you to do anything, do of it as much as you possibly can.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">By The Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ Muhammad Nasiruddeen al-Albaani </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘A woman went to the hospital and the doctors aborted her four month old fetus, with the argument that the woman had German Measles or measles and if we did not abort it, it would have come out deformed or mentally disabled; what is your opinion?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh Answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I am asked a lot regarding the likes of this situation, and we hold the opinion that you should not respond to these doctors, since their silent expression says: &lt;&lt;we do not think it but as a conjecture, and we have no firm convincing belief (therein).’&gt;&gt; [Al-Jathiyah: 32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have been informed from more than one source that some women had been informed by some doctors the like of this information [of aborting fetuses], but they did not consent to aborting and to miscarrying, and the new-born was delivered naturally, so this confirms that it is nothing but as conjecture.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, every command is in the Hand of Allaah –Tabarak wa Ta’ala- He has the command and He creates everything, so it is not befitting that some doctors participate in the likes of these matters, of which the reality is hidden from all people. Perhaps some people research into some hidden matters more so than others, so it is not allowed to look into the unknown future for all the people, and no-one knows the unseen except Allaah –Tabarak wa Ta’ala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a woman … perhaps gives birth to a fetus that is deformed or similar to a deformed child, or like it is said nowadays, that it is disabled etc. . . . so, in respect to us being Muslims believing in Allaah –Azza wa Jal-  and that He is al-Hakeem (The All-Wise) and al-Aleem (The All-Knowing) there is no fault in His creation. So this variance which we generally see between human beings whether it is in skin colour or in height or shortness in stature or in being males or females, or in health and safety, or regarding diseases and illness etc. then all of this is what al-Azeez (The All-Mighty), al-Aleem (The All-Knowing) has pre-destined. Because the Lord –Azza wa Jal- wants to show His slaves that what they regard as good and ugly, then all of that according to Allaah –Azza wa Jal- is good. The way we look at the creation of Allaah – Azza wa Jal- is not the way the Creator Himself –Tabarak wa Ta’ala- views things, because &lt;&lt;there is nothing like unto Him and He is the All-knowing and All-Seeing.&gt;&gt; [Shura:11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At this opportunity it is necessary for me to mention a hadeeth, which I regard as very great concerning this topic and an answer to this question.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> saw a  man from his Companions, walking wearing a long garment and it was trailing below his ankles, so the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said to him: ‘O so and so, raise your garment since it is closer to piety and better to remain cleaner.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah I am bow-legged.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The shaykh continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘So this person lengthened his garment so that he could cover up this deficiency as he had presumed, and he apologized for this reason for having lengthened his garment so the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said to him: ‘O so and so – [the shaykh said: ‘and here is the main point’ ] – ‘All of Allaah’s creation is good. All of Allaah’s creation is good.’ [Saheeh: ‘Silsilah Saheehah’ 1441]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is why, what we see with our human physical eyes, has to be judged immediately that this is a deficient sight. We see, as is mentioned in an old Arabic proverb: ‘Not past his rabbit like nose’ (tip of his nose).  They used to say of old, ‘so and so does not see past his rabbit like nose’ (does not look further than the tip of his nose).  As for looking far ahead then no! In addition to this no matter how far a human being can see, no matter how very far, it is still a deficient sight.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Companion from the Companions of the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>saw himself as defective due to being bow-legged and the disability which was in his calves, so he covered it up by lengthening his garment. Because if he raised his garment slightly then some of the disability would have become exposed, so the Prophet &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> brought his attention to this. That what you see as a deficiency is not a deficiency because Allaah is the One Who created you like that, and this is not from your own doing. Just like Allaah –Azza wa Jal- said: &lt;&lt;This is the creation of Allaah. So show Me that which those (whom you worship), besides Him have created. &gt;&gt; [Luqman: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore this child, this fetus, if it is born naturally and it was disabled or was afflicted with an illness which the doctors previously had presumed, then this is the Will of Allaah which is the Destiny that Allaah made so that it can be a lesson for healthy people.  As it has been said: ‘Health is a crown placed upon the head of healthy people which none can see except a person who is ill.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also a very great, noble prophetic instruction, which is: ‘Do not look at those above you but look at those below you, since it is more befitting that you do not belittle the blessings of Allaah upon you.’ [Saheeh Lighayrihi: ‘Saheeh Targheeb  wa Tarheeb 2233]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So perhaps there is a person who has a beautiful form, however there are people who look at themselves and view themselves as ugly and they might say that this person really is beautiful.  So this is the variance in the creation and in beauty and it is the predestination of Allaah al-Azeez (The All-Mighty), al-Aleem (The All-Knowing) al-Hakeem (The All-Wise).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when Allaah created beauty He also created its opposite, as we have said that it is created for an Infinite Wisdom, we can express this with what has been said a very long time ago: ‘Opposites clarify each other.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it was not for ugliness, beauty would not be known. If it was not for illness, health would not be known. If it was not for males there would not be females. If it was not for females there would not be males.  So all this creation that we see, that Allaah created the people upon, it is from the Wisdom of Allaah –Azza wa Jal- this is why it is not befitting to conform to the opinions of doctors concerning matters which have not yet entered the sphere of life, and when it comes into the sphere of life then comes the saying of the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>: ‘O slaves of Allaah seek treatment, since indeed Allaah did not send down a disease except that He sent down the cure.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the hadeeth of Usamah bin Shareek <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em>, it was also narrated by another noble Companion and he is none other than Abdullaah bin Mas’ood <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu- </em>with an extra wording, he said: ‘Seek cure O slaves of Allaah since indeed Allaah did not send down a disease except that He sent down the cure, whoever knew it, knew it and whoever was ignorant of it, was ignorant of it.’ [Saheeh: ‘Silsilah Saheehah’ 451]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, there is nothing to hinder seeking cure later on, however there is a condition which needs to be taken into consideration, which is, that this seeking cure is due to a matter which the new-born is exposed to, i.e. that it is not allowed to change the creation of Allaah –Azza wa Jal, because Allaah –Azza wa Jal- mentions about the accursed Shaytan in the Noble Qur’aan, that the Shaytaan challenged the will of the Lord of the worlds –Azza wa Jal- in respect to Adam and his offspring saying: &lt;&lt; I will order them to slit the ears of cattle, and indeed I will order them to change the nature created by Allaah.&gt;&gt; [Nisa’:119]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not allowed to change the creation of Allaah –Azza wa Jal- and this has examples, very many examples.</p>

Prohibition of Breaking ties and Relationships</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>The believers are nothing else than brothers (in Islamic religion). So make reconciliation between your brothers.</b></span><b>&#8221; (49:10)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>But do not help one another in sin and transgression</b></span><b>.&#8221; (5:2)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1591.</b> Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do not desert (stop talking to) one another, do not nurse hatred towards one another, do not be jealous of one another, and become as fellow brothers and slaves of Allah. It is not lawful for a Muslim to stop talking to his brother (Muslim) for more than three days</span><span style="color:#ff0000;">.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1592.</b> Abu Ayyub Al-Ansari (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">It is not lawful for a Muslim to desert (stop talking to) his brother beyond three nights, the one turning one way and the other turning to the other way when they meet, the better of the two is one who is the first to greet the other</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1593.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">People&#8217;s deeds are presented before Allah on Mondays and Thursdays, and then every slave (of Allah) is granted forgiveness (of minor sins) if he does not associate anything with Allah in worship. But the person in whose heart there is rancour against his brother, will not be pardoned. With regard to them, it is said twice: `Hold these two until they are reconciled</span>&#8216;.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1594.</b> Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) as saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The Satan has despaired of being worshipped by those who engage in prayer in the Arabian Peninsula but (has not lost hope) in creating dissension among them.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>

[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1596.</b> Abu Khirash Hadrad bin Abu Hadrad Al-Aslami (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Whosoever forsakes his brother for a year is like one who sheds his blood</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>

If three days have passed, he should meet him and greet him; and if other responds to it they will both share the reward; but if he does not respond, he will bear his sin and the one who (has taken the initiative to) greet (the other) will be absolved of the sin of forsaking (one&#8217;s brother in Faith)</span>.&#8221;<br />

When they came in to him and said: `Salam (peace be upon you),&#8217; He answered: `Salam (peace be upon you),&#8217; and said: `You are a people unknown to me.&#8217; Then he turned to his household, and brought out a roasted calf [as the property of Ibrahim (Abraham) was mainly cows]. And placed it before them, (saying): `Will you not eat?&#8221;&#8217;</b><b> (51: 24-27)</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>&#8220;And his (Lut&#8217;s) people came rushing towards him, and since aforetime they used to commit crimes (sodomy), he said: `O my people! Here are my daughters (i.e., the women of the nation), they are purer for you (if you marry them lawfully). So fear Allah and degrace me not with regard to my guests! Is there not among you a single right-minded man? &#8221;&#8217;</b></span><b> (11:78)</b></p>

[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>707.</b> Abu Shuraih Khuwailid bin `Amr Al-Khuza`i (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He who believes in Allah and the Last Day, should accommodate his guest according to his right.&#8221;</span> He was asked: &#8220;What is his right, O Messenger of Allah?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;It is (to accommodate him) for a day and a night, and hospitality extends for three days, and what is beyond that is charity.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>

Sustentation of the Members of the Family</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;The father of the child shall bear the cost of the mother&#8217;s food and clothing on a reasonable basis&#8221;.</b></span><b> (2:233)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Let the rich man spend according to his means, and the man whose resources are restricted, let him spend according to what Allah has given him. Allah puts no burden on any person beyond what He has given him&#8221;.</b></span><b> (65:7)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And whatsoever you spend of anything (in Allah&#8217;s Cause), He will replace it&#8221;.</b></span><b> (34:39)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>289.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;A dinar you spend in Allah&#8217;s way, or to free a slave, or as a charity you give to a needy person, or to support your family, the one yielding the greatest reward is that which you spend on your family&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>290.</b> Thauban bin Bujdud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The most excellent dinar is one that a person spends on his family, and the dinar which he spends on his riding-animal in the way of Allah (in Jihad), and the dinar he spends on his companions in the way of Allah&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>291.</b> Umm Salamah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: I asked Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), &#8220;Would I be rewarded for what I spend on Abu Salamah&#8217;s sons? For I can&#8217;t let them go here and there (to beg people).&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Spend on them and you will be rewarded for what you spend on them&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>292.</b> Sa`d bin Abu Waqqas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported in a Hadith included in the chapter of Intention, that Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Whatever you spend seeking thereby the Pleasure of Allah, will have its reward, even the morsel which you put in the mouth of your wife&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>293</b>. Abu Mas`ud Al-Badri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;When someone spends on his family seeking his reward for it from Allah, it is counted as a charity from him&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>294.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`as (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Neglecting one&#8217;s own dependents is a reason enough for a man to commit a sin&#8221;</span>.<br />
[Abu Dawud]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narration in Muslim is: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, <span style="color:#0000ff;">&#8220;It is enough sin for a person to hold back the due of one whose provision is in his hand&#8221;</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>295.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Two angels descend every morning, and one says: `O Allah, give him who spends something, in place of what he spends.&#8217; The other one says: `O Allah, give destruction to him who withholds&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>296.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The upper hand is better than the lower one (i.e., the spending hand is better than the receiving hand); and begin (charity) with those who are under your care; and the best charity is that which given out of surplus; and he who asks (Allah) to help him abstain from the unlawful and the forbidden, Allah will fulfill his wish; and he who seeks self-sufficiency will be made self-sufficient by Allah&#8221;.</span><br />

Chapter 41<br />
Prohibition of Disobeying Parents and severance of Relations</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Would you then, if you were given the authority, do mischief in the land, and sever your ties of kinship? Such are they whom Allah has cursed, so that He has made them deaf and blinded their sight.&#8221;</b></span><b> (47:22,23)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And those who break the Covenant of Allah, after its ratification, and sever that which Allah has commanded to be joined (i.e., they sever the bond of kinship and are not good to their relatives), and work mischief in the land, on them is the curse (i.e., they will be far away from Allah&#8217;s Mercy), and for them is the unhappy (evil) home (i.e., Hell).&#8221;</b></span><b> (13:25)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And your Rubb has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them but address them in terms of honour. And lower unto them the wing of submission and humility through mercy, and say: `My Rubb! Bestow on them Your Mercy as they did bring me up when I was young.&#8221;&#8217;</b></span><b> (17:23,24)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>336.</b> Abu Bakrah Nufai` bin Al-Harith (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Shall I not inform you of the biggest of the major sins?&#8221;</span> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) asked this question thrice. We said, &#8220;Yes, O Messenger of Allah. (Please inform us.)&#8221;. He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Ascribing partners to Allah, and to be undutiful to your parents&#8221;.</span> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) sat up from his reclining position and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;And I warn you against giving forged statement and a false testimony; I warn you against giving forged statement and a false testimony&#8221;.</span> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) kept on repeating that warning till we wished he would stop.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>337.</b>  Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`as (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;(Of the) major sins are: to ascribe partners to Allah, disobey parents, murder someone, and to take a false oath (intentionally)&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>338.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`as (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;It is one of the gravest sins to abuse one&#8217;s parents.</span>&#8221; It was asked (by the people): &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, can a man abuse his own parents?&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He abuses the father of somebody who, in return, abuses the former&#8217;s father; he then abuses the mother of somebody who, in return, abuses his mother&#8221;</span>.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;One of the major sins is to curse one&#8217;s parents&#8221;</span>. It was submitted: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! How can a man curse his own parents?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;When someone curses the parents of another man who in return abuses the former&#8217;s father; and when someone abuses the mother of another man who in return abuses his mother.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>339.</b> Abu Muhammad Jubair bin Mut`im (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The person who severs the bond of kinship will not enter Jannah&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>340.</b> Abu &#8216;Isa Al-Mughirah bin Shu`bah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah has forbidden you: disobedience to your mothers, to withhold (what you should give), or demand (what you do not deserve), and to bury your daughters alive. And Allah dislikes idle talk, to ask too many questions (for things which will be of no benefit to one), and to waste your wealth&#8221;.</span><br />

Urging one&#8217;s kith and kin to Obey Allah and refrain from evils</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And enjoin Salat (the prayer) on your family, and be patient in offering them (i.e., the Salat).&#8221;</b></span><b> (20:132)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell), whose fuel is men and stones.&#8221;</b></span><b> (66:6)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>298.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Al-Hasan bin `Ali (May Allah be pleased with them) took one of the dates of the Sadaqah (charity) and put it in his mouth, whereupon Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Leave it, leave it, throw it away. Do you not know that we do not eat the Sadaqah (charity)?&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>299</b>. `Umar bin Abu Salamah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I was a boy under the care of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), and my hand would wander about in the dish. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to me<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Mention Allah&#8217;s Name (i.e., say Bismillah before you start eating), eat with your right hand and eat from what is near to you&#8221;.</span> I always followed this way of eating after this incident.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>300.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;All of you are guardians and are responsible for your subjects. The ruler is a guardian and responsible for his subjects; the man is a guardian of his family; the woman is guardian in her husband&#8217;s house and responsible for her wards; a servant is guardian of his master&#8217;s property and responsible for his ward. So all of you are guardians and are responsible for your subjects&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>315.</b>  Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah created all the creatures and when He finished the task of His creation, Ar-Rahm (ties of relationship) said: `(O Allah) at this place I seek refuge with You against severing my ties.&#8217; Allah said: `That I treat with kindness those who treat you with kindness and sever ties with those who sever ties with you.&#8217; It said: `I am satisfied.&#8217; Allah said: `Then this is yours&#8221;</span>. Then Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;Recite this Ayah if you like:<span style="color:#ff0000;"> `Would you then, if you were given the authority, do mischief in the land, and sever your ties of kinship? Such are they whom Allah has cursed, so that He has made them deaf and blinded their sight&#8221;.</span> (47:22,23).<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The words in Al-Bukhari are: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah (SWT) says: `He who maintains good ties with you, I maintain good ties with him; and he who severs your ties, I sever ties with him&#8221;.</span></p>

He asked, &#8220;Who next?&#8221; He (the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) said again,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Your mother.</span>&#8221; He again asked, &#8220;Then who?&#8221; Thereupon he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;">&#8221; Then your father.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Who is most deserving of my fine treatment?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Your mother, then your mother, then your mother, then your father, then your nearest, then nearest&#8221;.</span><br />

May he be disgraced! May he be disgraced, whose parents, one or both, attain old age during his life time, and he does not enter Jannah (by rendering being dutiful to them)&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>318.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A man said to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam): &#8220;I have relatives with whom I try to keep the ties of relationship but they sever relations with me; and whom I treat kindly but they treat me badly, I am gentle with them but they are rough to me.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;If you are as you say, it is as if you are feeding them hot ashes, and you will be with a supporter against them from Allah as long as you continue to do so&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>319.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He who desires ample provisions and his life be prolonged, should maintain good ties with his blood relations&#8221;.</span> [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>320.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Abu Talhah (May Allah be pleased with him) was the richest among the Ansar of Al-Madinah and possessed the largest property; and among his possessions what he loved most was his garden known as Bairuha&#8217; which was opposite the mosque, and Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) often visited it and drank from its fresh water. When this ayah was revealed:<span style="color:#ff0000;"> &#8220;By no means shall you attain Al-Birr (piety, righteousness &#8211; here it means Allah&#8217;s reward, i.e., Jannah), unless you spend (in Allah&#8217;s Cause) of that which you love,&#8221;</span> (3:92). Abu Talhah came to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), and said: &#8220;Allah says in His Book:<span style="color:#ff0000;"> `By no means shall you attain Al-Birr, unless you spend (in Allah&#8217;s Cause) of that which you love,</span>&#8216; and the dearest of my property is Bairuha&#8217; so I have given it as Sadaqah (charity) for Allah&#8217;s sake, and I anticipate its reward with Him; so spend it, O Messenger of Allah, as Allah guides you&#8221;. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Well-done! That is profitable property. I have heard what you have said, but I think you should spend it on your nearest relatives.</span>&#8221; So Abu Talhah distributed it among his nearest relatives and cousins.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>321.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`as (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: A man came to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) of Allah and said, &#8220;I swear allegiance to you for emigration and Jihad, seeking reward from Allah.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Is any of your parents alive?</span>&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, both of them are alive.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) then asked,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Do you want to seek reward from Allah?</span>&#8221; He replied in the affirmative. Thereupon Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Go back to your parents and keep good company with them&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration it is reported that a person came to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and sought his permission to participate in Jihad. The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) asked,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Are your parents alive?</span>&#8221; He replied in the affirmative. The Prophet a(sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;(You should) consider their service as Jihad.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>322.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr Al-`as (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The person who perfectly maintains the ties of kinship is not the one who does it because he gets recompensed by his relatives (for being kind and good to them), but the one who truly maintains the bonds of kinship is the one who persists in doing so even though the latter has severed the ties of kinship with him&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>323.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The bond of relationship is suspending from the Throne, and says: `He who keeps good relations with me, Allah will keep connection with him, but whosoever severs relations with me, Allah will sever connection with him&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>324.</b> It has been narrated that Maimuna bint Al-Harith (May Allah be pleased with her) had set free a slave-girl without the Prophet&#8217;s permission. When her turn came (the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)  used to visit his wives in turns), she made mention of that to him saying, &#8220;Did you know I have set slave-girl free?&#8221; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Have you, indeed?&#8221;</span> She replied, &#8220;Yes&#8221;. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) then remarked,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Had you given her to your maternal uncles, you would have your reward increased&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>325.</b> Asma&#8217; bint Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (May Allah be pleased with her) said: My mother came to me while she was still a polytheist, so I asked Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), &#8220;My mother, who is ill-disposed to Islam, has come to visit me. Shall I maintain relations with her?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Yes, maintain relations with your mother&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>326.</b> Zainab Ath-Thaqafiyah (May Allah be pleased with her) the wife of `Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: When Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)<span style="color:#0000ff;"> told the women that they should give Sadaqah (charity), even if it should be some of their jewellery,</span> I returned to `Abdullah bin Mas`ud and said, &#8220;You are a man who does not possess much, and Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) has commanded us to give Sadaqah. So go and ask him if giving to you will serve the purpose; otherwise, I shall give it to someone else.&#8221; He asked me that I should better go myself. I went and found a woman of the Ansar at the door of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), waiting to ask a similar question as mine. The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was endowed with dignity, and so we could not go in. When Bilal (May Allah be pleased with him) came out to us, we said to him: &#8220;Go to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and tell him that there are two women at the door who have come to ask him whether it will serve them to give Sadaqah to their husbands and to orphans who are in their charge, but do not tell him who we are. Bilal (May Allah be pleased with him) went in and asked him, and Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)<span style="color:#0000ff;"> asked him who the women were.</span> When he told him that they were a woman of the Ansar and Zainab,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> he asked him which Zainab it was</span>, and when he was told it was the wife of `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;They will have a double reward, one for maintaining the ties of kinship and another for Sadaqah&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>327.</b> Abu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb (May Allah be pleased with him) mentioned Heraclius in a long Hadith and said: Heraclius asked me, &#8220;What does this Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) teach you?&#8221; I said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He orders us to worship Allah Alone and not to associate a thing with Him in worship, to discard what our ancestors said, to perform the Salat (prayer), speak the truth, and maintain the ties of kinship&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>328.</b> Abu Dharr (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;You will soon conquer a land where people deal with Qirat.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> And according to another version: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;You will soon conquer Egypt where Al-Qirat is frequently mentioned. So when you conquer it, treat its inhabitants well. For there lies upon you the responsibility because of blood ties or relationship (with them)&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>329.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: When this Verse was revealed:<span style="color:#ff0000;"> &#8220;And warn your tribe (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) of near kindred&#8221;.</span> (26:214) Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) called the Quraish; when they gathered, he said to them:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O sons of `Abd Shams; O sons of Ka`b bin Lu&#8217;ai, rescue yourselves from the Fire! O sons of Murrah bin Ka`b, rescue yourselves from the Fire! O sons of `Abd Manaf, rescue yourselves from the Fire! O sons of `Abdul-Muttalib, rescue yourselves from the Fire! O Fatimah, rescue yourself from the Fire, for I have no power (to protect you) from Allah in anything except that I would sustain relationship with you&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>330.</b> Abu Abdullah `Amr bin Al-`as (May Allah be pleased with them) said: I heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying openly not secretly,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The family of so-and-so (i.e., Abu Talib) are not my supporters. My supporter is Allah and the righteous believing people. But they (that family) have kinship (Rahm) with whom I will maintain good the ties of kinship&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>331.</b> Abu Ayyub Khalid bin Zaid Al-Ansari (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A man came to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and said, &#8220;Direct me to a deed which will admit me to Jannah and take me away from the Fire&#8221;. The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Worship Allah and associate no partner with Him, perform As-Salat, pay Zakat, and maintain the ties of kinship&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>332.</b> Salman bin `Amir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;When you break fast, you should do it with a date-fruit for there is blessing in it, and if you do not find a date-fruit, break it with water for it is pure.&#8221;</span> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) added:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Charity towards a poor person is charity, and towards a relation is both charity and maintaining the ties (of kinship)&#8221;.</span><br />
[Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>333.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: I had a wife whom I loved but `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) disliked her. He asked me to divorce her and when I refused, `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) went to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and mentioned the matter to him. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)<span style="color:#0000ff;"> asked me to divorce her.</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi and Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>334.</b> Abud-Darda&#8217; (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A man came to me and said, &#8220;I have a wife whom my mother commands me to divorce&#8221;. I replied him that I had heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;A parent is the best of the gates of Jannah; so if you wish, keep to the gate, or lose it.&#8221;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>335.</b> Al-Bara&#8217; bin `Azib (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: I heard the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;A mother&#8217;s sister is equivalent to (real) mother (in status)&#8221;.</span><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Huraira reported that Juraij was one who was devoted to    (prayer) in the temple. His mother came to him. Humaid said that Abu Rafi&#8217; demonstrated    before us like the demonstration made by abu Huraira to whom Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace    be upon him) had demonstrated as his mother called him placing her palms upon the eyebrows    and lifting her head for calling him and said: Juraij, it is your mother, so talk to her.    She found him at that time absorbed in prayer, so he said (to himself): O Lord, my mother    (is calling me) (whereas I am absorbed) in my prayer. He opted for prayer. She (his    mother) went back, then came again for the second time and said: O Juraij, it is your    mother (calling you), so talk to me. He said: O Allah. there is my mother also and my    prayer, and he opted for prayer. She said: O Allah, this Juraij is my son. I pray to talk    to him but he refuses to talk to me. O Allah, don&#8217;t bring death to him unless he has seen    the prostitutes, and had she invoked the curse upon him (from the heart of her heart) he    would have been involved in some turmoil. There was a shepherd living near by his temple    (the temple where Juraij was engaged in prayer). It so happened that a woman of that    village came there and that shepherd committed fornication with her and she became    pregnant and gave birth to a child. It was said to her: Whose child is this? She said: He    is the child of one who is living in this temple. So there came persons with hatchets and    spades. They called Juraij. He was absorbed in prayer and he did not talk to them and they    were about to demolish that temple that he saw them and then came to them and they said:    Ask her (this woman) what she says. He smiled and then touched the head of the child and    said: Who is your father? He (the child) said: My father is the shepherd of the sheep, and    when they heard this, they said: We are prepared to rebuild with gold and silver what we    have demolished from your temple. He said: No, rebuild it with clay as it had been before.    He then went up (to his room and absorbed himself in prayer).</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Huraira reported Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon    him) as saying: None spoke in the cradle but only three (persons), Christ son of Mary, the    second one the companion of Juraij. Juraij had got constructed a temple and confined    himself in that. His mother came to him as he was busy in prayer and she said: Juraij. He    said: My Lord, my mother (is calling me while I am engaged in) my prayer. He continued    with the prayer. She returned and she came on the next day and he was busy in prayer, and    she said: Juraij. And he said: My Lord, my mother (is calling me while I am engaged) in    prayer, and he continued with the prayer and she went back, and then on the next day she    again came and he was busy in prayer and she said: Juraij. And he said: My Lord, my mother    (is calling me while I am engaged in my prayer, and he continued with the prayer, and she    said: My Lord, don&#8217;t give him death unless he has seen the fate of the prostitutes. The    story of Juraij and that of his meditation and prayer gained currency amongst Bani    Isra&#8217;il. There was a prostitute who had been a beauty incarnate. She said (to the people):    If you like I can allure him to evil. She presented herself to him but he paid no heed (to    her). She came to a shepherd who lived near the temple and she offered herself to him and    he had a sexual intercourse with her and so she became pregnant arid when she gave birth    to a child she said: This is from Juraij. So they came and asked him to get down and    demolished the temple and began to beat him. He said: What is the matter? They said: You    have committed fornication with this prostitute and she has given birth to a child from    your loins. He said: Where is the child? They brought him (the child) and he said: just    leave me so that I should observe prayer. And he observed prayer and when he finished, he    came to the child. He struck his stomach and said: O boy, who is your father? lie said: He    is such shepherd. So they turned towards Juraij, kissed him and touched him (for seeking    blessing) and said: We are prepared to construct your temple with gold. He said. No, just    rebuild it with mud as it had been, and they did that. Then there was a babe who was    sucking his mother that a person dressed in fine garment came riding upon a beast. His    mother said: O Allah, make my child like this one. He (the babe) left sucking and began to    see towards him, and said: O Allah, don&#8217;t make me like him. He then returned to the chest    and began to suck the milk of his mother. He (Abu Huraira) said: I perceived as if I am    seeing Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as he is explaining the scene of his    sucking milk with his forefinger in his mouth and sucking that. He (Abu Huraira) further    reported Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may be peace upon him) as saying: There happened to pass by him    a girl who was being beaten and they were saying: You have committed adultery and you have    committed theft and she was saying: Allah is enough for me and He is my good Protector,    and his mother said: O Allah, don&#8217;t make my child like her and he left sucking the milk,    and looked towards her and said: O Allah, make me like her, and there was a talk between    them. She said: O with shaven head, a good-looking person happened to pass by and I said:    O Allah, make my child like him, and you said: O Allah, don&#8217;t make me like him, and they    passed by a girl while they were beating her and saying: You committed fornication and you    committed theft, and I said: O Allah, don&#8217;t make my child like her, and you said: O Allah,    make me like her. Thereupon he said: That person was a tyrant, and I said: O Allah, don&#8217;t    make me like him, and they were saying about her: You committed fornication whereas in    fact she had not committed that and they were saying: You have committed theft whereas she    had not committed theft, so I said: O Allah, make me like her.</font></p>

O My    servants, all of you are hungry (needy) except one whom I feed, so beg food from Me, so    that I may give that to you. O My servants, all of you are naked (need clothes) except one    whom I provide garments, so beg clothes from Me, so that I should clothe you. O My    servants, you commit error night and day and I am there to pardon your sins, so beg pardon    from Me so that I should grant you pardon. O My servants, you can neither do Me any harm    nor can you do Me any good. O My servants, even if the first amongst you and the last    amongst you and even the whole of human race of yours, and that of jinns even, become    (equal in) God-conscious like the heart of a single person amongst you, nothing would add    to My Power. O My servants, even if the first amongst you and the last amongst you and the    whole human race of yours and that of the Jinns too in unison become the most wicked (all    beating) like the heart of a single person, it would cause no loss to My Power. O My    servants, even if the first amongst you and the last amongst you and the whole human race    of yours and that of jinns also all stand in one plain ground and you ask Me and I confer    upon every person what he asks for, it would not. in any way, cause any loss to Me (even    less) than that which is caused to the ocean by dipping the needle in it. My servants,    these for you I shall reward you for thern, so he who deeds of yours which I am recording    finds good should praise Allah and he who does not find that should not blame anyone but    his ownself. Sa&#8217;id said that when Abu Idris Khaulini narrated this hadith he knelt upon    his knees.</font></p>

Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: He is not a Raqub but Raqub is one who    does not find his child as the forerunner (in Paradise). He then said: Whom do you count    as a wrestler amongst you? We said: He who wrestles with persons. He said: No, it is not    he but one who controls himself when in a fit of rage.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Anas b. Malik reported that a desert Arab said to Allah&#8217;s    Messenger (may peace be upon him): When would be the Last Hour? Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may    peace be upon him) said: What preparation have you made for that? Thereupon he said: The    love of Allah and of His Messenger (that is my preparation for the Last Hour) (for the Day    of Resurrection).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.064.263"></a>Volume 7, Book 64, Number 263:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Mas&#8217;ud Al-Ansari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;When a Muslim spends something on his family intending to receive Allah&#8217;s reward it is regarded as Sadaqa for him.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 264:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Allah said, &#8216;O son of Adam! Spend, and I shall spend on you.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 265:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The one who looks after a widow or a poor person is like a Mujahid (warrior) who fights for Allah&#8217;s Cause, or like him who performs prayers all the night and fasts all the day.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 266:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet visited me at Mecca while I was ill. I said (to him), &#8220;I have property; May I bequeath all my property in Allah&#8217;s Cause?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Half of it?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; I said, &#8220;One third of it?&#8221; He said, &#8220;One-third (is alright), yet it is still too much, for you&#8217;d better leave your inheritors wealthy than leave them poor, begging of others. Whatever you spend will be considered a Sadaqa for you, even the mouthful of food you put in the mouth of your wife. Anyhow Allah may let you recover, so that some people may benefit by you and others be harmed by you.&#8221;</p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 268:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Prophet said, &#8216;The best alms is that which is given when one is rich, and a giving hand is better than a taking one, and you should start first to support your dependents.&#8217; A wife says, &#8216;You should either provide me with food or divorce me.&#8217; A slave says, &#8216;Give me food and enjoy my service.&#8221; A son says, &#8220;Give me food; to whom do you leave me?&#8221; The people said, &#8220;O Abu Huraira! Did you hear that from Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No, it is from my own self.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 269:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The best alms is that which you give when you are rich, and you should start first to support your dependants.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 270:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to sell the dates of the garden of Bani An-Nadir and store for his family so much food as would cover their needs for a whole year.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 271:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Malik bin Aus bin Al-Hadathan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once I set out to visit &#8216;Umar (bin Al-Khattab). (While I was sitting there with him his gate-keeper, Yarfa, came and said, &#8220;Uthman AbdurRahman (bin &#8216;Auf), Az-Zubair and Sad (bin Abi Waqqas) are seeking permission (to meet you).&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes. So he admitted them and they entered, greeted, and sat down. After a short while Yarfa came again and said to &#8216;Umar &#8216;Shall I admit &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas?&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He admitted them and when they entered, they greeted and sat down. &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;O Chief of the Believers! Judge between me and this (&#8216;Ali).&#8221; The group, &#8216;Uthman and his companions Sad, &#8216;O Chief of the Believers! Judge between them and relieve one from the other.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said. Wait! I beseech you by Allah, by Whose permission both the Heaven and the Earth stand fast ! Do you know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said. &#8216;We (Apostles) do not bequeath anything to our heirs, but whatever we leave is to be given in charity.&#8217; And by that Allah&#8217;s Apostles meant himself?&#8221; The group said, &#8220;He did say so.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then turned towards &#8216;All and &#8216;Abbas and said. &#8220;I beseech you both by Allah, do you know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said that?&#8221; They said, &#8216;Yes &#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Now, let me talk to you about this matter. Allah favored His Apostle with something of this property (war booty) which He did not give to anybody else. And Allah said:&#8211; &#8216;And what Allah has bestowed on His Apostle (as Fai Booty) from them for which you made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry . . . Allah is Able to do all things.&#8217; (59.6) So this property was especially granted to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. But by Allah he neither withheld it from you, nor did he keep it for himself and deprive you of it, but he gave it all to you and distributed it among you till only this remained out of it. And out of this property Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to provide his family with their yearly needs, and whatever remained, he would spend where Allah&#8217;s Property (the revenues of Zakat) used to be spent. Allah&#8217;s Apostle kept on acting like this throughout his lifetime. Now I beseech you by Allah, do you know that?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar said to &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas, &#8220;I beseech you by Allah, do you both know that?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;When Allah had taken His Apostle unto Him, Abu Bakr said, &#8216;I am the successor of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. So he took charge of that property and did with it the same what Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to do, and both of you knew all about it then.&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar turned towards &#8216;Ali and Abbas and said, &#8220;You both claim that Abu- Bakr was so-and-so! But Allah knows that he was honest, sincere, pious and right (in that matter). Then Allah caused Abu Bakr to die, and i said, &#8216;I am the successor of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr.&#8217; So I kept this property in my possession for the first two years of my rule, and I used to do the same with it as Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr used to do. Later both of you (&#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas) came to me with the same claim and the same problem. (O &#8216;Abbas!) You came to me demanding your share from (the inheritance of) the son of your brother, and he (&#8216;Ali) came to me demanding his wives share from (the inheritance of) her father. So I said to you, &#8216;If you wish I will hand over this property to you, on condition that you both promise me before Allah that you will manage it in the same way as Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr did, and as I have done since the beginning of my rule; otherwise you should not speak to me about it.&#8217; So you both said, &#8216;Hand over this property to us on this condition.&#8217; And on this condition I handed it over to you. I beseech you by Allah, did I hand it over to them on that condition?&#8221; The group said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then faced &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas and said, &#8220;I beseech you both by Allah, did I hand it over to you both on that condition?&#8221; They both said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;Do you want me now to give a decision other than that? By Him with Whose permission (order) both the Heaven and the Earth stand fast, I will never give any decision other than that till the Hour is established! But if you are unable to manage it (that property), then return it to me and I will be sufficient for it on your behalf . &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Hind bint &#8216;Utba came and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Abu Sufyan is a miser so is it sinful of me to feed our children from his property?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;No except if you take for your needs what is just and reasonable. &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 274:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ali:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatima went to the Prophet complaining about the bad effect of the stone hand-mill on her hand. She heard that the Prophet had received a few slave girls. But (when she came there) she did not find him, so she mentioned her problem to &#8216;Aisha. When the Prophet came, &#8216;Aisha informed him about that. &#8216;Ali added, &#8220;So the Prophet came to us when we had gone to bed. We wanted to get up (on his arrival) but he said, &#8216;Stay where you are.&#8221; Then he came and sat between me and her and I felt the coldness of his feet on my abdomen. He said, &#8220;Shall I direct you to something better than what you have requested? When you go to bed say &#8216;Subhan Allah&#8217; thirty-three times, &#8216;Alhamdulillah&#8217; thirty three times, and Allahu Akbar&#8217; thirty four times, for that is better for you than a servant.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali bin Abi Talib:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatima came to the Prophet asking for a servant. He said, &#8220;May I inform you of something better than that? When you go to bed, recite &#8220;Subhan Allah&#8217; thirty three times, &#8216;Alhamdulillah&#8217; thirty three times, and &#8216;Allahu Akbar&#8217; thirty four times. &#8216;All added, &#8216;I have never failed to recite it ever since.&#8221; Somebody asked, &#8220;Even on the night of the battle of Siffin?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No, even on the night of the battle of Siffin.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Aswad bin Yazid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked &#8216;Aisha &#8220;What did the Prophet use to do at home?&#8221; She said, &#8220;He used to work for his family, and when he heard the Adhan (call for the prayer), he would go out.&#8221;</p>
<hr />

<p style="text-align:justify;">Hind bint &#8216;Utba said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Abu Sufyan is a miser and he does not give me what is sufficient for me and my children.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My father died and left seven or nine girls and I married a matron. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to me, &#8220;O Jabir! Have you married?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;A virgin or a matron?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;A matron.&#8221; he said, &#8220;Why not a virgin, so that you might play with her and she with you, and you might amuse her and she amuse you.&#8221; I said, &#8221; &#8216;Abdullah (my father) died and left girls, and I dislike to marry a girl like them, so I married a lady (matron) so that she may look after them.&#8221; On that he said, &#8220;May Allah bless you,&#8221; or &#8220;That is good.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 281:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;I am ruined!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Why?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I had sexual intercourse with my wife while fasting (in the month of Ramadan).&#8221; The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Manumit a slave (as expiation).&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I cannot afford that.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Then fast for two successive months.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I cannot.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Then feed sixty poor persons.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have nothing to do that.&#8221; In the meantime a basket full of dates was brought to the Prophet . He said, &#8220;Where is the questioner.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;I am here.&#8221; The Prophet said (to him), &#8220;Give this (basket of dates) in charity (as expiation).&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall I give it to poorer people than us? By Him Who sent you with the Truth, there is no family between Medina&#8217;s two mountains poorer than us.&#8221; The Prophet smiled till his pre-molar teeth became visible. He then said, &#8220;Then take it.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 282:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Um Salama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall I get a reward (in the Hereafter) if I spend on the children of Abu Salama and do not leave them like this and like this (i.e., poor) but treat them like my children?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes, you will be rewarded for that which you will spend on them.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 283:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hind (bint &#8216;Utba) said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Abu Sufyan is a miser. Is there any harm if I take of his property what will cover me and my children&#8217;s needs?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Take (according to your needs) in a reasonable manner.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 284:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A dead man in debt used to be brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle who would ask, &#8220;Has he left anything to re pay his debts?&#8221; If he was informed that he had left something to cover his debts the Prophet would offer the funeral prayer for him; otherwise he would say to the Muslims present there), &#8220;Offer the funeral prayer for your friend:&#8221;but when Allah helped the Prophet to gain victory (on his expeditions), he said, &#8220;I am closer to the Believers than themselves, so. if one of the Believers dies in debt, I will repay it, but if he leaves wealth, it will be for his heirs.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 285:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Um Habiba:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Will you marry my sister, the daughter of Abu Sufyan.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Do you like that?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes, for I am not your only wife, and the person I like most to share the good with me, is my sister.&#8221; He said, &#8220;That is not lawful for me.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We have heard that you want to marry Durra, the daughter of Abu Salama.&#8221; He said, &#8220;You mean the daughter of Um Salama?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Even if she were not my step-daughter, she is unlawful for me, for she is my foster niece. Thuwaiba suckled me and Abu Salama. So you should not present to me your daughters and sisters.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ursa: Thuwaiba had been a slave girl whom Abu Lahab had emancipated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Huqooq Da&#8217;at Ilayhal-Fitrah wa Qarrarthash-Sharee&#8217;ah (pp.11-13)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah Magazine, Issue No.6 &#8211; Dhul-Qa&#8217;dah 1417H / March 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Relatives are those who are related to you through blood and close ties; such as the brother, the uncle, the aunty, or their children. Everyone who has a tie of relation with you has certain rights upon you in accordance with how closely they are related to you. About this, Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And give to the relative his right.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-lsraa 17:26]. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; also said: <b>&#8220;And worship Allaah alone, and do not set-up any partner to Him in worship, and be kind and good to the parents, and to the relatives.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:36].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory upon everyone to treat their relatives in the best possible manner, and to support them in accordance with their needs, and what they seek of help and support. And this is what is necessitated by the <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i> (Prescribed Islaamic Law), the <i>&#8216;aql</i> (sound reasoning) and the <i>fitrah</i> (natural state).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there are many textual evidences encouraging and urging <i>silatur-rahm</i> (joining the ties of relations); such as what Abu Hurayrah <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> relates from the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, that he said: <i>&#8220;Indeed Allaah created the creation, until when He finished doing so, the Rahm (womb/ties of relation) stood-up and said: Is this the place of one who seeks refuge in You from those who severe and cut ties with me. So Allaah said: Yes, Indeed. Would it please you that I keep ties with those who keep ties with You, and cut-off ties with those who cut-off ties with you? So the Rahm said: Yes, indeed! So Allaah said: Then this is for you.&#8221;</i> Then Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <b>&#8220;Recite if you wish: &#8216;Would you then, if you were given the authority, cause corruption in the land, and cut-off ties of relations. They are those upon whom is the curse of Allaah, so that He makes them deaf and blinds them.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Muhammad 47:22-23].&#8221;2 The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> also said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever believes in Allaah and the Last Day let him keep the ties of relations.&#8221;</i>3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unfortunately, many people do not fulfill this <i>haqq</i> (right) and transgress the bounds concerning this. Some of them do not seek to join ties with relatives or show kindness to them; neither through wealth, nor through good behaviour, nor through the giving of occasional gifts and presents nor through rendering help to them in their rimes of need. indeed, many days or months may pass without even seeing or visiting them. And sometimes, rather than seeking to join ties of relations, some people even intend to severe such ties, by seeking to harm their relatives &#8211; either through words, or action, or both. Such people may even keep close ties with those who are not relation, yet cut-off ties with relatives!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people only keep ties of relations with those who maintain ties with them, but cut-off from those who cut-off from them. So such people are not truly the <i>waasils</i> (those who keeps ties of relations), but rather they are those who do so based upon tit for rat. So they will only keep ties with those who keep ties with them whether relatives, or other than them. However, the true <i>waasil</i> (one who keeps ties of relations) is the one who keeps ties of relation for the sake of Allaah &#8211; regardless of whether his relations keep ties with him or not. &#8216;Abdullaah ibn &#8216;Amr <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> relates that the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said:<i> &#8220;The waasil (one who keeps the ties of relations) is not the one who merely does so out of reciprocation. Rather, the waasil is the one who even when the relatives cut-off from him, yet he still maintains ties with them.&#8221;</i> So a man asked: O Messenger of Allaah. I have relatives with whom I maintain ties of relations, yet they cut-off from me. I treat them kindly, yet they treat me in an evil manner. And I am forbearing and patient with them, yet they behave rudely and ignorantly towards me. The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;If the situation is as you say, then it is as if you are filling their mouths with sand. And Allaah will continue to aid and support you as long as you continue doing what you are doing.&#8221;</i>4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If there were no other rewards for keeping ties of relations, except that Allaah keeps ties with the <i>waasil</i> in this world and the Hereafter, and that He extends His Mercy due to it, and makes affairs easier through it, and removes distress and anxieties by it, then that would be more than sufficient. However, along with this, <i>silatur-rahim</i> (joining the ties of relations) brings with it closeness to one&#8217;s family and relatives, as well as love and compassion developing between one another, and their being mutual help, in times of ease and hardship. between one another, and other such joys and delights &#8211; as is experienced and well-known. And when ties of relations are not maintained, then each one of the aforementioned benefits turn to their opposites, and great harm comes to the society.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And of his signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquility in them; and he placed between you affection and mercy. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought.”</span><i> (</i><i>Ar-Room: 21)</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And Allaah has made for you from your homes a place of rest…”</span> (An-Nahl: 80)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i> </i><span style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (Peace be upon him) said: </span><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“He who remembers his Lord and he who does not remember his Lord are like the living and the dead.”</em></span><span style="text-align:justify;"> – Al-Bukhari, cf., Al-Asqalani, Fathul-Bari 11/208; Muslim 1/539 with the wording </span><em style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“The <strong>house</strong> in which Allah is remembered and the <strong>house</strong> in which Allah is not remembered is like the living and the dead.”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“Do not make your <strong>houses</strong> like graveyards; Satan runs away from <strong>houses</strong> in which the chapter of Al-Baqarah is recited.”</em></span> (Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zaid bin Thabit (May Allah be pleased with him)reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, <em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O people! perform your (voluntary) Salat (prayers) in your <strong>homes</strong> because the best Salat of a man is the one he performs at home, except the obligatory Salat.&#8221; </span></em>[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said,<em><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Observe part of the [Nawafil (voluntary)] Salat (prayers) in your <strong>homes</strong>. Do not turn your homes into graves.&#8221;</span></em> [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“May Allaah have mercy upon the man who wakes up to pray during the night and wakes his wife to pray, and if she does not wake up he splashes water on her face. May Allaah have mercy upon the woman who wakes up to pray during the night and wakes her husband to pray, and if he does not wake up she splashes water on his face.” </em></span>(Ahmad, Abu Daawood, Nasaa’i &amp; Ibn Maajah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“All of you are guardians and all of you will be questioned (by Allaah) about your responsibilities …A woman is the guardian of her husband’s <strong>home</strong> and she will be questioned By Allaah) about her responsibilities (i.e., about her children, property, duties etc.)…” </span>(Bukhaari &amp; Muslim).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">There is no doubt that the bliss of the heart, its tranquility and happiness, and the absence of grief and worry from it, is the goal of every individual. It is the means by which a happy,blissful and excellent life is achieved. There are means to achieve this;some of which are religious, some are natural and some are physical.These means are never gathered together except to the believers. The non-believers on the other hand, despite the fact that the earnest endeavours of their philosophers is to lead them to these means, even if they achieve them in certain aspects, they miss the way to them in several other aspects that are more beneficial, more permanent and better in yielding results.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Shaykh Abdur-Rahman bin Nasir As-Sadi `rahimahullah mention in his treatise the ways and means to achieve this lofty goal that is the quest of every individual. He said that some people are successful in following these ways, and therefore live a good and pure life and enjoy their life. Some woefully fail in following any of them, and they live a wretched and miserable life. Others lie between these two extremes;by the level of their following these means, by that level do they live a good life. And it is Allah `azza wa jall that guides to all that is good, and wards off all that is evil, and it is His Help we seek in this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center"><span style="color:#993300;">The Ahadeeth of Tawheed from the Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah of Shaykh Al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">161- The Messenger of Allaah said to ‘Alee bin Abu Talib: ‘Go and bury your father.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said; ‘No, I won’t bury him, because he died as a <em>Mushrik</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger said to him: ‘Go and bury him, and don’t speak to anyone until you come to me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I came to him and I had signs of dirt and dust upon me. He ordered me to wash, so I washed and he supplicated for me with supplications which would not please me to exchange anything for them on the face of this earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>From the benefits of the hadeeth </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- That it is permissible for a Muslim to take the responsibilities of burying his close <em>Mushrik</em> relative. This does not negate his hate far his relative’s <em>Shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do you not see that ‘Alee refused to bury his father the first time. Whereby, he said: ‘he died as a <em>Mushrik</em>‘ thinking that if he buried him then this would enter into being in alliance with his father which is prohibited. Like the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>:</p>
<p align="center">&lt;&lt;Take not as friends the people who incurred the Wrath of Allaah &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Messenger ordered him again to bury his father he hastened to fulfill the Messenger’s order. And he left that which seemed to be correct to him the first time. It is also from obedience, that a person leaves his own opinion for the command of his Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It appears to me that the son burying his <em>Mushrik</em> father or his mother is the last of what the son possesses of good companionship with his <em>Mushrik</em> father in this world. As for after the burial then it is not allowed for him to pray for him, nor seek forgiveness for him, this is due to the clear statement of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p align="center">&lt;&lt;It is not proper for the Prophet and those who believe to ask Allaah’s Forgiveness for the <em>Mushrikeen </em>even though they be of kin&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if this is the case, what is the situation of the one who supplicates for mercy and forgiveness on the pages of newspapers and magazines for some of the <em>Kuffar</em>, announcing their deaths, for a small amount of <em>Dirhams</em>!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who is concerned for his hereafter should fear Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- It is not legislated for him to wash the unbeliever, nor should he shroud him. And nor should he pray upon him even if he is a close relative, since, the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> did not order ‘Alee to do so. If this had been permissible, the Prophet<em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> would have mentioned it, since delaying the explanation of an order when there is a need for it, is not permissible. This is the <em>Madhab</em> of the Hambalees and other than them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- It is not legislated for the relatives of that <em>Mushrik</em> to follow the funeral procession. Because the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> did not do this for his uncle. His uncle was the kindest and the most compassionate of the people to him. Even to the extent that the Prophet supplicated to Allaah for him, whereby his uncle’s punishment will be the least in the Hellfire, as has been previously explained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in all of this there is a lesson for those people who have been deceived by their ancestry, but they do not do any thing for their hereafter with their Lord, and Allaah the Great spoke the truth when He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&lt;&lt; There will be no kinship among them that Day, nor will they ask of one another &gt;&gt;</p>

<p>1 -Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p align="center">وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ أَنْ خَلَقَ لَكُم مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ أَزْوَاجًا لِّتَسْكُنُوا إِلَيْهَا وَجَعَلَ بَيْنَكُم مَّوَدَّةً وَرَحْمَةً</p>
<p align="center">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#993300;">And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquility[1] in them; and <strong>He placed between you affection and mercy</strong></span>[2]. &gt;&gt; [Room: 21]</p>
<p>2 -Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>

<p align="center">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#993300;">and live with them</span><span style="color:#993300;"> <strong>in kindness</strong></span>[3]&gt;&gt;[4] [Nisa: 19]</p>
<p>3 – From Abu Hurairah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211; </em>that Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p align="center"> دينار أنفقته في سبيل الله ، ودينار تصدقت به في رقبة ، ودينار تصدقت به على مسكين ، ودينار أنفقته على أهلك . أعظمها أجرا الذي أنفقته على أهلك</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">‘From the Dinar (money) that you spent in the path of Allaah, the Dinar that you spent in freeing a slave, the Dinar that you gave in charity to a needy person, and the Dinar you spent on your family, the one that is <strong>the greatest in reward is the one that you spent on your family</strong>.’</span>[5]</p>
<p>4 – From Abu Hurairah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211; </em>that Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p align="center">إن أكمل المؤمنين إيماناً أحسنهم خُلقاً، وخياركم خياركم لنسائكم</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">‘The most complete of the Believers in their <em>Eemaan</em> are those who have the best manners[6], <strong>and the best of you</strong>[7] <strong>are those who are best to their women</strong>.</span>’[8]</p>
<p>5 – From ‘Amr bin al-Ahwaas from the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said:</p>
<p align="center">أَلاَ إِنَّ لَكُمْ عَلَى نِسَائِكُمْ حَقًّا وَلِنِسَائِكُمْ عَلَيْكُمْ حَقًّا</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">‘Indeed you have rights upon your women and <strong>they have rights upon you</strong>.</span>’[9]</p>
<p>6 – From Abu Hurairah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211; </em>who said that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p align="center">‫لا يَفْرَكْ مُؤْمِنٌ مُؤْمِنَةً إِنْ كَرِهَ مِنْهَا خُلُقًا رَضِيَ مِنْهَا آخَرَ</p>
<p> <span style="color:#993300;">‘A believing man should not hate a believing woman, if he dislikes a mannerism of hers, he will be pleased with another mannerism.’</span>[10]</p>
<p>7 – From Abdullaah bin Zamah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> that the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said:</p>
<p align="center">يعمد أحدكم فيجلد امرأته جلد العبد فلعله يضاجعها من أخر يومه</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">‘None of you should lash your wife[11] like the lashing of a slave, and then perhaps at night he has intercourse with her.</span>’[12]</p>
<p>8 – From Sa’ad bin Abi Waqqas <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> that the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p align="center">إِنَّكَ لَنْ تُنْفِقَ نَفَقَةً تَبْتَغِي بِهَا وَجْهَ اللَّهِ إِلا أُجِرْتَ عَلَيْهَا ، حَتَّى فِي اللُّقْمَةِ تَرْفَعُهَا إِلَى فِي امْرَأَتِكَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">‘Indeed you do not spend some wealth desiring the Face of Allaah except that you are rewarded for it, even for the food you place in your wife’s mouth.’</span>[13]</p>
<p>9 &#8211;  ‘Aeysha <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anha</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p align="center">ما ضرب صلى الله عليه وسلم بيده خادما قط و لا امرأة</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">‘The <strong>Messenger of Allaah </strong><strong><em>&#8211;</em></strong><strong><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em></strong><strong><em>&#8211;</em></strong><strong> never ever hit</strong>[14] a servant, or <strong>a woman</strong>.</span>’[15]</p>
<p>10 – Ibn Abbas <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">‘Indeed I love to beautify myself for my wife just like I love that she beautifies herself for me.</span>’[16]</p>
<p>11 – From Abdullaah bin ‘Amr <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p align="center">كفى بالمرء إثماً أن يضيع من يقوت</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">‘It is sufficient as a sin upon a man that he does not take responsibility over those he is responsible for.</span>’[17]</p>
<p>12- From Ibn Umar <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> the Messenger of Allaah said:</p>
<p align="center">إن أعظم الذنوب عند الله رجل تزوج امرأة فلما قضى حاجته منها طلقها وذهب بمهرها ، ورجل استعمل رجلا فذهب بأجرته ، وآخر يقتل دابة عبثا</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"> ‘Indeed the greatest of sins to Allaah are that a man marries a woman and when he has satisfied his need from her, he divorces her and goes off with her dowry.  And that a man employs another man and goes off with his salary and that a person kills his riding animal frivolously.</span>’[18]</p>
<p>13- From Mu’aweeyah bin Haydah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said:</p>
<p>‘I asked the Messenger of Allaah what is the right that the wife has upon one of us?</p>
<p>The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p align="center">أن تطعمها إذا طعمت وتكسوها إذا اكتسيت ولا تضرب الوجه ولا تقبح ولا تهجر إلا في البيت</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">‘That you feed her when you eat, and clothe her when you clothe yourself,[19] and do not hit her on her face and do not say may Allaah deface you,[20] and do not keep away from her except in the home</span>[21].’[22]</p>
<p>In another wording from Bahz Hakeem from his father, with the wording: He said: ‘I had said: O Prophet of Allaah, regarding our wives, what should we do and what should we be cautioned from?’</p>
<p>The Messenger said:</p>
<p>حرثك ، إئت حرثك أنى شئت غير أن لا تضرب الوجه ، ولا تقبح ، ولا تهجر إلا في البيت ، وأطعم إذا طعمت ، واكس إذا اكتسيت ، كيف وقد أفضى بعضكم إلى بعض ، ( بما حل عليه)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">‘She is your tilth, come to your tilth as you please, except that you do not strike her face, nor say may Allaah make you ugly, nor keep away from her except in the house, and feed her when you eat, and clothe her when you clothe yourself, and how can you not since you have gone in unto each other, except with what she has been made permissible for you.</span>’[23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13- From al-Miqdam bin Ma’dee Karib al-Kindi that the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> stood amongst the people and praised Allaah and exalted Him and said:</p>
<p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُوصِيكُمْ بِالنِّسَاءِ خَيْرًا، إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُوصِيكُمْ بِالنِّسَاءِ خَيْرًا، فَإِنَّهُنَّ أُمَّهَاتُكُمْ وَبَنَاتُكُمْ وَخَالاتُكُمْ، إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ يَتَزَوَّجُ الْمَرْأَةَ وَمَا تُعَلِّقُ يَدَاهَا الْخَيْطَ، فَمَا يَرْغَبُ وَاحِدٌ مِنْهُمَا عَنْ صَاحِبِهِ حَتَّى يَمُوتَا هَرَمًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">‘Indeed Allaah <strong>advices</strong><strong>[24]</strong> you in the strongest possible terms to be good to women, indeed Allaah advices you in the strongest possible terms to be good to women, advices you in the strongest possible terms with regards to women, indeed they are your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, your paternal aunts (father’s sisters) and your maternal aunts (mother’s sisters).  Indeed a man from the people of the two books (Jews &amp; Christians) marries a woman and does not hit her, each one of them continues to desire his companion until he dies in old age.’</span></p>
<p>Abu Salmah said I narrated this hadeeth to al-Ala bin Sufyaan al-Ghassanee who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">‘Indeed it has reached me that from the evil hidden sins which Allaah has made <em>Haraam</em>, which are not clearly mentioned in the Qur’aan, are that a man marries a woman and when his companion becomes old and she has stayed with him for a long time, and has produced all that her womb can, then he divorces her without any reason to do so.’</span>[25]</p>
<p>14 – Shaykh AbdurRahman bin Nasr as-Sa’adi (d. 1376 A.H.) said:</p>
<p>‘Allaah Ta’ala said regarding dealings:</p>
<p align="center">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#993300;">And do not forget liberality between yourselves.</span> &gt;&gt; [Baqarah: 227]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Which means, make a place for excellence and Ihsaan in your dealings.  <strong>Do not take all your rights, rather make things easy and do not make them difficult</strong>, and be pardoning in buying and selling, in settling a debt and times of need.  And whoever necessitates upon himself this goodness achieves a lot of good and great good. And Allaah Knows best.’</span>[26]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Shaykh Rabee’ ibn Haadee al-Madkhali said: ‘This Ayaah confirmed the blessing of living together in tranquillity since Allaah placed love and mercy between the husband and wife. Verily this blessing of living together in tranquillity cannot be achieved except if it is in an atmosphere which is surrounded and fragranced by love and mercy.’</p>

<p>[2] Shaykh AbdurRahman bin Nasr as-Sa’adi (d. 1376 A.H.) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘From those signs that indicate Allaah’s Mercy and His concern for His slaves, and His great Wisdom and His all-Encompassing knowledge is &lt;&lt; that He created for you from yourselves mates &gt;&gt; whom are suited to you and you are suited for them, and they are similar to you and you are similar to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;that you may find tranquility in them; and He placed between you affection and mercy.&gt;&gt; with what results from marriage is a means that causes love and mercy, so a person receives enjoyment and pleasure from the wife and the benefit of the presence of offspring and educating them, and finds tranquility with them and generally you do not find amongst people the like of the love and mercy found between husband and wife.’</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Shaykh Muhammed bin Salih al-Uthaymeen (d.1421 A.H.) said:</p>

</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>[4] al-Hafidh Emaad ad-Deen Isma’eel Ibn Katheer (d. 774 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em>  said: ‘This means, speak to them in a good way and make your actions and your appearance  good as much as you can, just like you would love that from your partner, then you should deal with her as you would like to be dealt with, as Allaah Ta’ala said: &lt;&lt; And they (women) have rights (over their husbands as regards living expenses, etc.) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect, etc.) to what is reasonable,&gt;&gt; and the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘and the best of you are those who are best to their women.’ And from the Messenger’s mannerisms was that he would live with his wives in a beautiful way, always smiling, being playful with his family and being gentle with them, and spending on them and making his women laugh.’ [Taken from: ‘Tafseer al-Qur’aan al-Atheem’ 1/608]</p>

<p>[6] Shaykh Albaani said: ‘Good manners: sacrificing to do good deeds, preventing harm and having a cheerful face.’</p>
<p>[Riyadh as-Saliheen p. 159]</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>[7]  Shaykh Uthaymeen said: ‘Regarding the saying of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>: ‘The best of you . . .’ This person is the best of the people, he is the best of them to his wife. So if you have any goodness, then make that goodness for the closest of the people to you, and make it so that your wife is the first to benefit from this good.</p>
<p>And this is the opposite of what some people do today, you find that he has bad manners with his wife, and has good behavior with other people, and this is a great mistake.</p>
<p>Your wife has the most right to good behavior, and having the best manners to them, because she is the one who is with you day and night, openly and secretly.  If you are afflicted with something she is afflicted along with you, and if your happy, she is happy along with you, if your sad, she is sad along with you, therefore you should make your dealings with her better than your dealings with strangers, so the best of the people are those who are best of them to their wives.</p>
<p>I ask Allaah to complete my <em>Eemaan</em> and that of the Muslims, and that he makes us the best of the slaves of Allaah to our wives and upon those who have a right upon us. [Taken from: ‘Explanation of Riyadh as-Saliheen’ 3/134]</p>

<p>[8] Albaani said in ‘Silsilah Saheehah’ no. 284, ‘it is from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211; </em>collected by Tirmidhi and Ahmad and the first part of the hadeeth is collected by Abu Dawood, Ibn Abee Shaybah in ‘al-Musannaf’, Abu Na’eem in ‘al-Hileeyah’ and Haakim and he said it is Saheeh upon the conditions of Muslim and Dhahabi agreed with him.’</p>

<p>[11] Shaykh Uthaymeen said: ‘He lashes his wife like he lashes any other person as if there was no relationship between him and his wife, and as if she is a captive slave, helper to him.  This is not befitting because the relationship between a man and his wife is a special relationship, which must be built upon love, compassion, and keeping far away from evil, whether it is in speech or in action.</p>
<p>As for lashing her like lashing a slave, then at night to have intercourse with her, then how is it possible that you have intercourse with her at night with love, and then take pleasure and desire from her and you had lashed her like the lashing of a slave? !</p>
<p>This is a contradiction; this is why the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>rebuked this action. It is not befitting that this occurs from a human being, and the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> spoke the truth, indeed this does not befit an intelligent person more over a believer.’ [Taken from: ‘Sharh Riyadh as-Saliheen’ 3/119]</p>

<p>[14] Shaykh AbdulMuhsin al-Abbad al-Badr said about this hadeeth in his explanation of Sunnan Abi Dawood:</p>
<p>‘The compiler mentions the hadeeth of ‘Aeysha <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anha</em><em>&#8211;</em>:</p>
<p>‘That the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> never ever hit a servant, or a woman.’</p>
<p>That was because of his noble manners, he was forgiving and he <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> would live with his wives in a good way. An incident of hitting a servant, from those servants who used to serve him, never occurred.  He <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> never hit any of his wives, rather he was gentle, merciful, forgiving and he <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> love and gentleness.  This indicates to his <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> perfect mannerisms, even though there perhaps may have occurred transgression and matters by which some servants warranted reprimanding, however the Prophet’s <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> character and his way was gentle, forgiving and pardoning in his matters.’</p>

<p>[19] Shaykh Uthaymeen said: regarding the saying of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em> ‘that you feed her when you eat, and clothe her when you clothe yourself,’ Which means, do not specify clothing yourself without taking a concern in clothing her, nor feeding yourself and not feeding her.  Rather she is your partner, it is obligatory to spend on her as you spend upon yourself, so much so that many of the scholars say: ‘If a man does not spend on his wife, and she requests a divorce from the judge, then it is upon the judge to cancel the marriage, due to the husband being deficient about her right which is obligatory for her.’ [Explanation of Riyad as-Saliheen 3/131]</p>

<p>[20] Shaykh Uthaymeen said: ‘Regarding the saying of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>: ‘do not call her ugly. . .’ It means do not say you are ugly, or say: may Allaah disfigure your face.  What is included in this prohibition of calling her ugly is the prohibition of claiming she is ugly whether it is tangible or (in meaning) intangible. So do not say: ‘You are from a unnoble tribe, or from an evil family etc.’ all of this is from claiming she is ugly which Allaah has prohibited.’ [Explanation of Riyad as-Saliheen 3/132]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Al-Wahshiyyi ibn Harb radiallaahu &#8216;anhu related that some of the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<p>O Messenger of Allaah! We eat, but do not become satisfied.</p>
<p>So he said to them: &#8220;Perhaps you eat separately?&#8221;</p>
<p>So they replied: Yes.</p>
<p>So he said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Eat your food collectively, mention the Name of Allaah upon it, then there will be blessings for you in it</span>.&#8221;[1]</p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Ibn al-&#8216;Uthaymeen</strong> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">This indicates that it is essential to eat collectively from a single plate. So if there are five or ten people, they should eat collectively from a single dish, depending upon the situation. Indeed, doing so is a cause for barakah (blessings) to descend, whilst eating separately is a cause for barakah to depart</span>.&#8221;[2]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">745. `Abdullah bin Busr (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) had a large bowl called Al-Gharra&#8217;, which would be carried by four men. One day, when the Companions finished their Duha (forenoon optional) prayer, Al-Gharra&#8217; was brought full of sopped bread, meat and broth, and they sat down around it. When their number increased, Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) sat down on his knees and rested on the soles of his feet. A bedouin said to him: &#8220;What sort of sitting is that?&#8221; Thereupon Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;Verily, Allah has made me a courteous slave not a fierce tyrant.&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;Eat from the sides of the bowl and leave the central part of it so that your food will be blessed.&#8221; [Abu Dawud].</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><a name="takingphotographsforthewholefamilyandothersfor"></a><strong> First question from Fatwa No.</strong><strong> 2296 </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a name="takingphotographsforthewholefamilyandothersfor"></a><strong> Q 1: What is the ruling on</strong><strong> taking photographs for the whole family and others for </strong>the sake of remembrance and amusement only?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a name="takingphotographsforthewholefamilyandothersfor"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a name="takingphotographsforthewholefamilyandothersfor"></a><strong> A: </strong>Photographing living beings is prohibited and one of the major sins whether a photographer considers it to be their job or not and whether it is a drawing, photograph or sculpture. Keeping these photographs, pictures or sculptures for remembrance or any other purpose will not change its ruling as there are many Hadiths reported in this regard. These Hadiths are general for all kinds of Taswir (drawing, photographing and sculpturing). Nothing is exempted from this ruling except what is necessarily required.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a name="takingphotographsforthewholefamilyandothersfor"></a>May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a name="takingphotosofthebride,thebridegroom,andtheirfamiliesduringweddingceremonies"></a><strong>Fatwa no. (</strong><strong> 4636 </strong>): <a name="takingphotosofthebride,thebridegroom,andtheirfamiliesduringweddingceremonies"></a><strong> Q: I want to describe to you something that people have adopted as a recent custom. Since around 1390 A.H. approximately, people have become accustomed to arranging wedding ceremonies, during which they take the bride and the bridegroom home in a procession and then take many photos of them and their families. These photos are then distributed among the relativesand friends as gifts. Weddings are now seen as incomplete without this custom, except by less than one percent of the population, although it is refuted by sound reason. What is the religious opinion on this? Please advise us &#8211; and may Allah enlighten you &#8211; through broadcasts, in newspapers, or &#8220;Da`wah (calling to Islam) Magazine.&#8221; However, if you answer me through the magazine, please cite irrefutable evidence, whether of its prohibition or permissibility. May Allah protect you. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a name="takingphotosofthebride,thebridegroom,andtheirfamiliesduringweddingceremonies"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a name="takingphotosofthebride,thebridegroom,andtheirfamiliesduringweddingceremonies"></a><strong>A: </strong>What you mentioned regarding taking photos of the bride, the bridegroom, and their families during wedding ceremonies is Haram (prohibited) and is one of the bad wedding customs. This is so, <span style="color:#ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">because taking pictures of beings with a soul is absolutely Haram and a major sin. The basic ruling concerning making pictures of beings with souls, such as human beings and animals, is that it is Haram, whether the pictures are three-dimensional; drawings on paper, material, walls, or anywhere else; or photographs</span></span>, as based on a Sahih (authentic) Hadith related from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). He prohibited it, cursed those who do so and then threatened them with a painful torment. As pictures can be a means to Shirk (associating others in worship with Allah), he did this to safeguard people from standing before them, submitting to them, trying to draw near to them, and extolling them in a manner that befits only Allah (Exalted be He). It was also prevented as it amounts to imitating Allah&#8217;s Creation; and due to the Fitnah (temptation) that some pictures, such as those of actresses, semi-naked women, beauty queens, and the like contain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a name="takingphotosofthebride,thebridegroom,andtheirfamiliesduringweddingceremonies"></a>Among the Hadith that show that taking pictures is prohibited and indicate that it is a major sin is the Hadith reported on the authority of Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both), who said that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said,<img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a name="ThosewhomakethesepictureswillbepunishedontheDayofResurrectionanditwillbesaidtothemGivelifetowhatyoucreated"></a> <span style="color:#ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Those who make these pictures will be punished on the Day of Resurrection and it will be said to them, &#8216;Give life to what you created.&#8217; </span></span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />Recorded by Al-Bukhary and Muslim. There is also the Hadith narrated by `Abdullah ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that he heard the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) say,<img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a name="ThepeoplewhowillreceivetheseverestpunishmentontheDayofResurrectionwillbethosewhomadepictures"></a> The people who will receive the severest punishment on the Day of Resurrection will be those who made pictures. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />Recorded by Al-Bukhary and Muslim. There is also the Hadith reported by Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that he heard the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) saying,<img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a name="AllahmayHebeExaltedsaidWhoisworsethansomeonewhotriestocreateacreationlikeMine?etthemcreateanatomagrainofwheatoragrainofbarley"></a> Allah (may He be Exalted) said: &#8220;Who is worse than someone who tries to create a creation like Mine? Let them create an atom, a grain of wheat, or a grain of barley.&#8221; <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />Reported by Al-Bukhary and Muslim. And the Hadith reported by `A&#8217;ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said,<img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a name="TheMessengerofAllahpeacebeuponhimcametomeafterajourneyandIhadscreenedmyalcovewithacurtainonwhichtherewerepicturesWhentheMessengerofAllahpeacebeuponhimsawitthecolorofhisfacechangedduetoangerand"></a> The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) came to me after a journey, and I had screened my alcove with a curtain on which there were pictures. When the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) saw it, the color of his face changed (due to anger) and he said, &#8216;O `A&#8217;ishah! The people who will receive the severest punishment on the Day of Resurrection will be those who imitate Allah&#8217;s Creation.&#8217; So we tore it up and we made a cushion or two cushions from it. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />Recorded by Al-Bukhary and Muslim. (The alcove that was screened by the curtain was an arched opening in the wall.) There is also a Hadith narrated by Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) who said that he heard the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) saying,<img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a name="AnyonewhomakespicturesinthisworldwillbeassignedtobreatheasoulintothemontheDayofResurrectionbutwillnotbeabletobreathe"></a> Anyone who makes pictures in this world will be assigned to breathe a soul into them on the Day of Resurrection, but will not be able to breathe. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />Recorded by Al-Bukhary and Muslim. There is yet another Hadith reported by him that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said,<img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a name="Everyimage-makerwillbeintheFireEverypicturethattheymadewillbegivenasoulandwilltormenttheminHell"></a> Every image-maker will be in the Fire. Every picture that they made will be given a soul and will torment them in Hell. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) added,<img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a name="Ifyoumustdoitmakepicturesoftreesandthatwhichhasnosoul"></a> If you must do it, make pictures of trees and that which has no soul. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />Recorded by Al-Bukhary and Muslim. And there is another Hadith reported by Abu Juhayfah who said about the Prophet (peace be upon him) that<img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a name="HecursedthosewhoacceptRibausurythosewhogiveitandhecursedtheimage-makers"></a> He cursed those who accept Riba (usury), those who give it, and he cursed the image-makers. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />Recorded by Imam Al-Bukhary in his Sahih [Book of Authentic Hadith]).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The general meaning of these Hadith is that <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>making pictures of anything that has a soul is absolutely prohibited</strong></span>. However, it is permissible to make pictures of objects without a soul, such as trees, the sea, mountains, and the like, as mentioned by Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both), and it is not known that any of the Sahabah (Companions) refuted what he said. This is understood from the following phrase that was mentioned in the Hadith of the threat to<img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a name="Givelifetowhatyoucreated"></a> Give life to what you created. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />And also these words in the Hadith:<img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a name="WillbeassignedtobreatheasoulintothemontheDayofResurrectionbutwillnotbeabletobreathe"></a> Will be assigned to breathe a soul into them on the Day of Resurrection, but will not be able to breathe. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillaah Al-Hamdulillaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[The following represents much of the notes from <strong>Shaykh Saalih as-Sindee</strong>&#8216;s heart-felt nasihah, obtained from salaficast.net]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After praising Allaah, and sending the salaam upon the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam), the sahaba, and those who follow them until the Day of Judgment, the shaykh then greeted the Muslims with &#8220;as-salamu &#8216;alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatu,&#8221; and then welcomed to Madinah a group of Muslims in front of him, and gave glad tidings to them for what they set out for: to visit the haramain, and for packing their bags and travelling to seek knowledge. And he made a du&#8217;aa to Allaah to give them and us jannah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said in surat Ash-Shura: He (Allaah) has ordained for you the same religion (Islam) which He ordained for Nuh (Noah), and that which We have inspired in you (O Muhammad), and that which We ordained for Ibrahim (Abraham), Musa (Moses) and &#8216;Iesa (Jesus) saying you should establish religion and make no divisions in it (religion). &#8230;(Ash-Shura 42:13)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look at this command from Allaah (subhanahu wa taa&#8217;ala). In this ayah is a command that Allaah gave to ulul &#8216;azaam, the five Messengers of great determination, and they are Nuh, Muhammad, Ibrahmn, Musa and &#8216;Iesa. Allaah commanded them with these two things: to establish the religion and not divide. So this ayah requires, ya ikhwan, that we look at this command, and that we open our ears and hearts and minds so we can understand and implement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first affair is Iqqamat u-Deen, establishing the religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Iqqamat u-Deen means we should establish the religion in ourselves first, be upright, then help others to be upright in the Deen. The first issue &#8211; and it is the most important &#8211; is that we establish Islam in ourselves first. This establishing the religion in ourselves requires that one implement the Tawheed of Allaah, and this comes about in three levels: the first is that one implements the base level, which is one leaves shirk and kufr, and moves into Islam. This level itself has three levels: belief in the heart, saying upon tongue the shahadatain [la illaaha il Allaah Muhammad RasulAllaah], and then he should do action that supports his claim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The next level is implementing that which is wajib from Tawheed. The one who implements and completes that which is wajib then also does and fulfills that which he is commanded and leaves off the prohibitted. Thirdly, doing the mustahaabat (recommended) and leaving off the makruhat (disliked) even though it may not be haram, and likewise he leaves off the doubtful matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Talking about these levels is easier said than done. The base level is Tawheed; to remove oneself from kufr (disbelief) is easy for one to do, but to rise to the second level and then the third level is not easy. One must have extreme patience. If one reaches it, then he enters the Jannah (Paradise) &#8211; and will not be taken to account. As you all know by reading Kitab at-Tawheed, you have come across the proofs of the one who implements [completes and applies] Tawheed, then he enters into Jannah without accounting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first affair is that you learn the Deen. It&#8217;s not possible to establish the religion until you learn the religion. How can you establish Islam in yourself if you do not know what Islam is? For that reason, the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said: &#8220;Whoever Allaah wants good for, Allaah gives him understanding of the Deen.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Seeking knowledge has to be done in a certain way. Many of the people love knowledge and love to listen to knowledge, but because they have not done so systematically (correctly), their gains of knowledge is little. So the correct way to seek the knowledge of this religion is to begin with the Mega Principles of that science and then, after mastering these big principles, following the smaller principles, then the branches of knowledge, the more detailed affairs. This is how one gains knowledge. But as it relates to the actual topic of seeking knowledge, this is a long topic and will be dealt with on another day inshaAllaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second thing required to establish Islam in himself is that he nurtures himself, cultivates himself and gets himself used to the obedience of Allaah (subhanahu wa taa&#8217;ala). Break yourself as it relates to obeying Allaah, in following His commands. That&#8217;s because if you don&#8217;t push yourselves to do good, then your nafs will overtake you until you fall little by little into corruption, such as leaving off the wajibat or doing the impremissible, and this is a dangerous stage as this is the stage of the people threatened with the punishment of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is because we are like a baby; if you leave it (a baby) to suckle on his mother, he would love to do this and he willl not be weaned until you force him to be weaned. Likewise, the adults, if you let your nafs do what it wants, it will get used to it. But if you wean it, you will eventually [adapt] fall in line.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For this reason, brothers and sisters, we have to strive against ourselves to be the best we can be, raise ourselves upon the obedience of Allaah and to be upon good character, and strive to be better today than we were yesterday, and tomorrow better than today. The salaf used to say that whoever finds that his two days are the same, then he is maghdum (he has cheated himself), because he wasted a day. If you learn something new, strive to implement it immediately.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You have to get yourself used to worshipping Allaah (subhanahu wa taa&#8217;ala). You should have a portion of the night for praying, a portion of the [week] for fasting, making adhkar in the morning, at night, before going to bed, worshipping Allaah. The issue here is that we implement what we learn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We find that many people enter into the Deen of Allaah and they love to be around knowledge and the students of knowledge, and get themselves used to going here and there [for lessons], but they have not cultivated themselves to eeman. They have not cultivated themselves to the &#8216;ibaada of Allaah. You find that their portion of really having eeman is really small. So you find that when the wind of fitan blows, many of these people fall back on their heels, and some of them even leave Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This life is as Allaah (subhanahu wa taa&#8217;ala) described it in the Qur&#8217;an, mataa&#8217; ghurur &#8211; something one can be fooled by. It is just a short period of time. The Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said: mali wali dunya (&#8220;What do I have to do with this world? My relationship with this world is like that of a traveler&#8230;who seeks shade under a tree&#8230;then moves on.&#8221;) Meaning that shade is just like the dunya.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this life is just a few breaths, then it&#8217;s over. And in the next life, there are only two abodes: Paradise and Hellfire. And what you do in this life will determine your abode in the next life. You have the ability to determine which path you want. The path of the people of the good and bad &#8211; jazza bi makuntu ta&#8217;laamun (as a reward for what you used to do).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is upon every individual to strive against himself and be firm in obedience and leave off disobedience, but it becomes more emphasized in the places where fitan (trials and tribulations) are prevelant. More emphasized in the places. Any time a person lives among the kufaar (disbelievers), where the fitan are many, he has to increase his protection against these fitan. He has to strive harder to pray at night and fast &#8211; he has to. In the land of the kufaar, he must be stronger. He has to make his relationhsip with the Qur&#8217;an stronger in the land of the kufaar. Shaytan there is stronger and more diligent, and this [Muslim] individual has to put a barrier between him and that evil. Get your ammunition together against those things and put up your protective barrier against those things that are going to go to war against your eeman, and put them up against those things that will try to weaken your eeman or try to destroy it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Remain steadfast upon worshipping Allaah when the obedient are few and the disobedient to Allaah are many. The person who does this has a great reward with Allaah, because the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alaihiwasallam) said, &#8220;Worship performed during time of harj is like making hijra to me (the Prophet).&#8221; The one who worships during harj (times when killing, fitna, and fear is widespread, and those who obey Allaah are few, and those who disobey Allaah are many) his reward is like the one who made hijrah to the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alaihiwasallam) &#8211; a reward that only some of the companions (the Muhajjirun) received.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is upon the individual to remain steadfast on the obedience of Allaah. The one who does this and strives to worship Allaah, his reward is greater than the one who everything around him assists him in worshipping Allaah (like here in Madinah, where you hear the adhaan, you stop and pray in the masjid to the end of it). The one who obeys Allaah where the reasons to disobey Allaah are many and the bad places are many, and the bad companions are many. The one who controls himself when everyone else is disobeying Allaah, he reads a mushaf, directs himself to the Qiblah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From those things that assists the individual in establishing Islam in himself in his obedience to Allaah is his home, his family (a spouse, children, proper environment, far from what Allaah dislikes), as the husband should steer his wife in a correct direction, he should want good for her as he wants for himself since she is his wife and the mother of his children. This also helps him. The effect the woman has on her husband is great. If she is saliha (righteous), wants to learn the Deen, give da&#8217;wah, and the likes, then he likewise will do the same; and the opposite is true. Likewise, he has to take extreme concern for the children, especially where you brothers are from [land of the kufaar] &#8211; where the trials and tribulations come from every angle. We have to take extreme and diligent concern for the children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many of the youth have some concern for the da&#8217;wah, and spend much time giving da&#8217;wah, yet they are negligent of those nearest to them, the people of their home.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says: And enjoin As-Salat on your family, and be patient upon that&#8230; (Ta-Ha &#8211; 20:132)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people who have the most right to your knowledge, time, and attempts at rectification are those closest to you &#8211; the people of your home, your wife and children. And you will benefit from this, since they have an effect upon you, as mentioned earlier. This is as it relates to (Iqqamat-a-Deen) establishing the religion within ourselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now we look at establishing the religion with other than ourselves, and this is comprised of two categories: Muslims, and disbelievers (non-Muslims):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; We should establish the religion on the Muslims, whom we should give da&#8217;wah, attempt to direct to the right Path, advise them, command them to good and forbid them from evil in a beautiful manner and a style that is beloved because the purpose is that the da&#8217;wah is accepted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This issue of giving da&#8217;wah to Muslims themselves requires us to advise them. The Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alaihiwasallam) said: &#8220;None of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Especially, in the du&#8217;aat (those who give da&#8217;wah) and students of knowledge, you find that there is a lack in giving advise to one another. You find that they&#8217;ve been close for years upon years, yet not once has one said to the other &#8220;baarakaAllaahu fik, ya akhee; perhaps you should do this this way.&#8221; We should love good for our brother and not want them to fall into [even] one mistake. That would lead to our community being one that is built upon khair (goodness).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alaihiwasallam) said: &#8220;The strongest handhold of eeman is to love for Allaah and hate for Allaah.&#8221; This issue of love for Allaah is not just a statement. It has requirements. From the greatest of those requirements is that two (who claim they love each other for Allaah&#8217;s sake) advise one another, taking one by the hand away from the disobedience of Allaah and advising him, and vice versa. This is the true love. As for the saying of some that they love each other for Allaah&#8217;s sake and they are laughing, talking about (other than the Deen) and not advising each other, this is a weak love. This advise and level of respect should reach a point that if I see my brother fall into something, that not advising that brother who needs it should prevent you from sleeping at night, worrying about him, thinking, &#8220;how can I not have advised my brother.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In a hadeeth Qudsee: Allaah said: &#8220;My love is obligatory for those who love each other for My sake.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; And we should also establish the religion on the non-Muslims:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah revealed this Deen to be general for all of mankind and Jinn. For this reason, you find the first command of the Qur&#8217;an is [you can open your mushaf right now]: Oh mankind (all of mankind), worship the Lord Who created you. (Al-Baqarah 2:21) This is the first command in the Qur&#8217;an, and this is for all of mankind. And the first prohibition is: Then do not set up rivals unto Allaah (in worship) while you know (that He Alone has the right to be worshipped). (Al-Baqarah 2:22) The first command is Tawheed, and the first prohibition is shirk (setting up partners to Allaah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the true meaning of La illaaha il Allaah Muhammad RasulAllaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This call is for all of mankind to worship Allaah alone, and to make that worship sincere for Allaah &#8211; and Allaah alone. Allaah did not say here: Oh you who believe. He said: Oh Mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who has not entered into the fold of Islam, it is his right upon us that we call him to Islam. We must strive to establish the proofs, and have this Deen conveyed to every single individual, and this is from the most important issues.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oh brothers, this kaafir (disbeliever) you see in front of you. Do you know what his abode is? Right now, you see him, eating, drinking, walking, etc&#8230; If his soul was separated from his body, his abode would be the hellfire forever on top of forever on top of forever. Upon him is the curse of Allaah, the angels and all of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are three feelings we should have when seeing a kaafir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- You recognize the fadhl (blessing) upon you that Allaah guided you to Islam. Allaah had (has) the ability to make you be in his position, from among the people in a church worshipping a cross, instead of making you a Muslim in the Prophet&#8217;s Masjid. This has to make you love Allaah. We should also have hope in Allaah. This has to make you have hope in Allaah, that the One who wants good for you in this world that He wants good for you in the akhira. We should also fear Allaah; our hearts are between the fingers of Ar-Rahman. He turns the hearts as He pleases. [The shaikh recited a poem of Ibnul Qayyim (rahimahullaah): make for your heart two eyes, both these eyes make them cry from fear of Allaah. If your Lord had wished, He would have made you like them. And the hearts are between the fingers of Ar-Rahman.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- Also that you hate the kaafir for the sake of Allaah, from that which eeman requires of you, as Allaah commands: Oh you who believe, do not take My enemies and your enemies as helpers in opposition to Allaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- Also have pity on him, because this miskeen (sad individual), if he were to die upon [his state] after having received the message of Islam, then indeed he would be among the inhabitants of the hellfire. For that reason, we have to have in our hearts some type of mercy and pity and concern for those who have gone astray and those who disbelieve.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So for these reasons, it is upon us to be diligent and work hard to get them to enter Islam to (help) save them from the punishment of Allaah, should they die upon what they&#8217;re upon. Some [of the Muslims] are lazy in this regard. They say, &#8220;These people are kufaar, so what about them, forget about them, their hearts are sealed.&#8221; So they don&#8217;t strive to give them da&#8217;wah. This is wrong. Many of the people who have entered into the Deen of Al-Islam, Wallaahi [the shaykh swore by Allaah], we find that there&#8217;s nothing but half-an-hour (30 minutes) between them being a disbeliever and them entering Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Wallaahi [the shaikh again swore by Allaah], it is upon us to seek Allaah&#8217;s assistance in opening the hearts of these people, advising them, calling them to the truth in a way that is better, in a way that is more likely to be accepted by them. It is upon us to have something in our hearts [in the way of] being eager to see the people guided.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (rahimahullaah) said: &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t mind myself be cut up with scissors if it would help the people being guided to the Deen of Allaah.&#8221; He made himself rakhisa. In other words, he would rather see himself cut up if by that, it would help the people be guided to Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I am amazed at people who may have a neighbor who is kaafir, or a colleague at work, or a customer [upon kufr]. I am amazed at those brothers who don&#8217;t have anything in their hearts to help them be guided to Islam. Only a few steps or breaths separate him (the kaafir) and the fire. Ya ikhwan, give this person da&#8217;wah! Maybe, Allaah will guide him at your hands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Right now, we have a great opportunity. The Media left and right is talking about Islam, Islam, Islam. People want to know about Islam from you, and not just from the media, because they see you as a speaker from the inside. We should take this opportunity to teach people about Islam, and use this opportunity. There are people who want to know Islam more than they ever wanted to know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do you know the reward that you get by Allaah (subhanahu wa taa&#8217;ala) guiding one person by your hands?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said, &#8220;By Allaah, for Allaah to guide by your hands one individual is better for you than the red camels.&#8221; The red camels were the most expensive, valuable type of wealth they had [then]. For Allaah to guide one person by your hands is greater for you than the greatest wealth in this world. It is better for you than palaces, cars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Da&#8217;wah is in need of perseverance. You will not find a red carpet, or a path laid out with roses, and the people glorifying you to the end of it. It is a path that requires great patience and perseverance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard about a da&#8217;ee (caller) in Egypt. He freed himself &#8211; free his time up &#8211; to write to people about Islam by way of mail. At one point, this da&#8217;ee corresponded with [this one particular] kaafir for a time period you cannot imagine &#8211; 26 years. And he did not despair. And the result of this: this kaafir announced Islam. &#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Firstly,] everything is related to (Iqqamat-a-Deen) establishing the Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Second affair, do not be divided or separated in that establishment of the religion. From the greatest goals/objectives of this Deen is that its people who attribute themselves to it are together, have a working relationship, and be as upon the heart of one individual. If this affair is required of the Muslims everywhere, then this even a greater requirement in the land of kufaar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is upon us to strive, implement and manifest this principle and goal of being together, of having togetherness, and that we narrow the differences between ourselves, and shut off the path that shaytan would like to use to bring between us differences, hatred and envy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This [part of the] talk right now is for you brothers, the one whom Allaah brought your hearts together upon Tawheed upon the Sunnah of the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) with the correct understanding of the Salaf (may Allaah have mercy on them).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that shaytan is extremely diligent in trying to bring about separation between people who follow the correct manhaj. And for this reason, we hear many times about the differences and the separation amongst the Salafees in the lands of the West, in the lands of the kufaar. This requires that we come together and work together to solve this problem.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the greatest things required from us all, so we can solve this problem, is that we get rid of something we may have in our hearts, and this is evil thoughts (suspicion), or suu-a-dhan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have to have good thoughts about our brothers, and not have evil suspicion. If we see something from our brother that is incorrect or could [go] either way, we should strive to get this thought out of our heads. This is the only way we can kill the fitna that shaytan will want to cause between us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We claim that we follow the way of the Salaf. Then, let us look at the brotherhood they had [and those who followed them], and you can base your conditions upon this example.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At one point, Imam Shafi&#8217;ee (may Allaah have mercy on him) became sick, and one of his students &#8211; his most famous student al-Muzanee &#8211; made du&#8217;aa: &#8220;may Allaah make your weakness stronger.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Shafi&#8217;ee said: &#8220;If my weakness became stronger, I would die.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The student said: Wallaahi, I didn&#8217;t intend anything except good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{Shaikh as-Sindee commented: &#8220;And look how the Imam Ash-Shafi&#8217;ee dealt with his students&#8221;}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Shafi&#8217;ee said: If you had cursed me explicitly, I (still) would have known that you really didn&#8217;t mean it. [Source later supplied by Shaikh as-Sindee: In Shaikh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah&#8217;s refutation upon al-Bakri, and Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) called it &#8220;a well-known story.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is Husn-u-dhan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I would like to close by welcoming you to the city of the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alaihiwasallam), and I ask Allaah to welcome you, and ask Allaah to make our acts righteous, and that they be purely for His Face, and that no one has any portion of our actions (meaning that Allaah is singled out in them). And we ask Allaah to bless this gathering. Allaah knows best. And may the peace and blessings be upon our Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question to Shaikh as-Sindee:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is the reward greater for being used (by Allaah) to guide an astray Muslim to The Straight Path, or a kaafir to Islam?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Shaikh answered</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Without a doubt, guiding a kaafir to Islam &#8211; that they leave from the fold of kufr &#8211; is a greater reward. And the greatest of the levels of this is that Allaah (subhanahu wa taa&#8217;ala) gives you the guidance to guide this one and that one, that Allaah gives you the ability to guide them both (the Muslim and the kaafir).&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">Taken from the Book: The Structure of the Muslim Family by the shaykh al&#8217;Allaamah Muhammad Amaan ibn Ali al-Jaami died: 1416H</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[004:034] <span style="color:#008000;"><em>Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allâh has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse, as you can see, clearly gives the responsibility of leading and governing the family to the man. Additionally, the verse never failed to clarify the reason for this; rather, it explained why.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said, &#8220;because Allâh has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means.&#8221; [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1][TN}: Al-Qurtubi said in his tafseer [5/161] :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;Some of the people of knowledge have understood from the saying of Allah, the Most High, &#8220;because they spend (to support them) from their means.&#8221; That whenever the husband is incapable of supporting his wife then he is not considered to be maintaining her. If he is not maintaining her, then she can seek that the marriage contract be annulled because one of the intents behind the legislation of marriage has been lost.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. That both of them performed and fulfill the rights and obligations that Allah has made compulsory upon them as it pertains to the other partner. The wife should not demand to receive exactly the same rights that belong to the husband, and the husband should not use the authority or leadership that Allah has graced him with as an opportunity to oppress her and beat her unjustly. [ page # 49-50]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. It is essential that the woman obey her husband as much as she can when he commands her. As this is a station that Allah has granted to the men as mentioned in the two previous verses: &#8220;Man are the protectors and maintainer of women&#8221; [An-Nisaa: 34] and &#8220;But men have a degree of responsibility over them&#8221; [Al-Baqarah: 228]  [page # 5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Amaan al-Jaami rahimahullaah advises in &#8220;The Structure of The Muslim Family&#8221; (translated by brother Hasan As-Somali hafithahullaah) pg 31.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It is upon the intelligent Muslim woman to study her religion to allow her to truly grasp the position of Islam towards the woman and the dignified position Islam has given her. Additionally, she should not pay attention to every imbecile that makes unfounded claims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At the same time, she should examine some of the foreign constitutions, like the French constitution, to truly understand the position that these constitutions have towards the women.&#8221;</p>
