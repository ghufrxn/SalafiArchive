<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 54: Point 90D &amp; 90E</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:(90D)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And they called to sectarianism (<em>furqah)</em> and Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, forbade sectarianism. Some of them declared others to be disbelievers. And everyone called to his own opinion and to calling those who disagreed with him disbelievers. So the ignorant people, the rabble and those having no knowledge went astray. They caused the people to become greedy for the things of this life and to fear worldly punishment. So the people followed them upon fear regarding their religion and out of hope for what they possessed from this world</span>.</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/they-called-to-sectarianism-furqah-sunnah-became-a-stranger" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And they called to sectarianism and Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, has forbidden sectarianism.”</span> </strong>Allaah has forbidden sectarianism, splitting; <em>al-furqah</em>. So He said:</p>
<p><strong>وَلَا تَكُونُوا كَالَّذِينَ تَفَرَّقُوا وَاخْتَلَفُوا مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَهُمُ الْبَيِّنَاتُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And do not be like those who split up and differed after the clear signs had come to them.</span> </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah</em> 105)</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا تَفَرَّقَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ إِلَّا مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَتْهُمُ الْبَيِّنَةُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And those who were given the scripture did not differ except after the clear truth had come to them.</strong></span>(Sooratul-Bayyinah (98), <em>aayah</em> 4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they differed and split not upon ignorance but rather upon knowledge; `<em>ilm</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying,<span style="color:#993300;"> <strong>“And some of them declared others to be disbelievers,” </strong></span>The <em>firaq</em> (sects) started declaring each other to be disbelievers. And this is a sign which is manifest upon them. And this is a proof that they are all upon falsehood. As for the people of the truth and the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> then they do not declare each other to be disbelievers. Rather, they are friends and allies to each other, they love each other and they support each other and they advise each other. And likewise, they do not declare the other sects to be disbelievers except for what the Book and the Sunnah proves to be disbelief. Otherwise, it is the case that they (the people of sunnah) are justly balanced with regard to the matter of <em>Takfeer</em>. They do not declare anyone a disbeliever except for those whom the proof is established that he is a disbeliever and they are not hasty with regard to this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and each one called to his own opinion and to declaring those who disagreed with him to be disbelievers.” </strong></span>This is a sign of the people of misguidance. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>فَتَقَطَّعُوا أَمْرَهُم بَيْنَهُمْ زُبُرًا ۖ كُلُّ حِزْبٍ بِمَا لَدَيْهِمْ فَرِحُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So they split into parties and sects, each one following a separate book, every group rejoicing in what it was upon.</strong></span>(Sooratul-Mu·minoon (23), <em>aayah </em>53)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Zuburan</em>; meaning books. They authored books and this occurs. They author books to support their own position and their own party and they rejoice in what they are upon. And if they had just been upon ignorance then it could be hoped that they would return. However, they rejoice in what they are upon from falsehood and they believe it to be the truth. And this is a punishment from Allaah for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“So the ignorant people and the <em>ra`aa`</em> (the common rabble) and those who had no knowledge went astray.”</span> </strong>They led the ignorant people astray and the rubble and those who had no knowledge. But as for the people of the truth and the people of knowledge then they are not affected by these sects and these misguidances because they know that it is falsehood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And they caused the people to become greedy for things of this world and they cause them to fear the punishment of this world.” </strong></span>That is from the means which they utilise in their trial that they give their followers some of the things, which they crave after.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So the creation followed them therefore, upon fear with regard to their religion and upon hope with regard to what they had of this world.” </strong></span>Many of the people have love of this world so therefore, they will follow anyone who will give them anything from wealth even if he is upon falsehood as a result of their craving for wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Point Continues </strong></span></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:(90E)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>So the <em>Sunnah</em> and the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> were suppressed and innovations appeared and became widespread. The people committed disbelief in many ways, which they were not aware of. They applied analogy and considered the ability of the Lord, His signs, His rulings, His commands and His prohibitions according to their own intellects and opinions. So whatever accorded with their intellects, they accepted it and whatever ran contrary to their intellects, they rejected it. So Islaam became a stranger and the <em>Sunnah</em> became a stranger and the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> became strangers within their own homes.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So the <em>Sunnah</em> and the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> became suppressed and innovations appeared and became widespread.” </strong></span>After the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> had been apparent in the <em>quroon al-mufa<u>dd</u>alah</em> (most excellent generations) and the people of evil had been subdued, then the affair became turned around and the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> became suppressed and the people of falsehood became apparent. However, this will not persist. Even if the people of falsehood become apparent at one time then they will decline in the future and they will collapse in the future. And the final outcome will always be for the people of <em>Taqwa</em>; those who are dutiful to their Lord. And Imaam Ibn ul-Qayyim <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said:<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And the truth is aided and tested so do not be surprised for this is the way of the Most Merciful.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And they applied analogy,” </strong></span>Analogy (<em>Qiyaas)</em>, meaning in `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) because `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) has no analogy in it because it is <em>tawqeefeeyah</em> (reliant upon direct text). Action with regard to it is not upon except a proof. And no analogy is made in matters of creed and belief. Analogy can only be in <em>fiqh</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and they considered the ability of the Lord and His signs and His rulings and His commands and His prohibitions in accordance with their intellects and their own opinions.” </strong></span>This is al <em>qiyaasul baa<u>t</u>il</em> (the false and futile analogy) making analogy with regard to Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, the One Who cannot be imagined by their minds and their opinions. So they rebut based upon the analogy of their intellects, the speech of Allaah and the speech of His Messenger.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So whatever conformed with their intellects, they accepted it and whatever was contrary to their intellects, they rejected it.” </strong></span>So they make their intellects and their opinions the judge, so whatever conflicts with it, they reject it, either by <em>ta·weel</em> (interpreting it away) or by <em>raf<u>d</u></em> (directly rejecting it) and not accepting it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying,<span style="color:#993300;"> <strong>“So therefore, Islaam became a stranger and the <em>Sunnah</em> became a stranger and the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> became strangers within their own homes.” </strong></span>Just as he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Islaam began as a stranger and it will return to being a stranger just the same as it began. So give glad tidings of a tree in Paradise to the strangers.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>So then they said, “Who are the strangers O Messenger of Allaah?” So he said, “Those who are upon correctness when the people become corrupted.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And in one narration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Those who correct whatever the people corrupt.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They correct themselves are upon correctness and they correct whatever the people have corrupted. They are the <em>ghurabaa</em> (strangers). Why are they called strangers (<em>ghurabaa)</em>? Because those who contradict them are many and those who criticise them are many, so they are strangers amongst the people of their own lands and the people of their own time.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Translator’s side point: Some of the versions have at the end , <strong>“So the people followed them upon fear regarding their worldly life and out of hope for what they possessed from this world.”</strong> <em>W`Allaahu A`lam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Translator’s side point: Quote being from his famous poem <em>Al-Kaffiyaat ash-Shaafiyah</em> along with the explanation of it, they give a reference there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> mentioned in his explanation, “This seems to be referring to the like of the Jahmiyyah and the Mu`tazilah. They brought this matter of analogy and their intellect into the religion and used it to reject the texts; texts with regard to the attributes of Allaah, the Most High and other than them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> <strong>Shaykh Aal Ash Shaykh</strong> continues with the wordings of the <u>h</u>adeeth but this part of the <u>h</u>adeeth is reported by Muslim (145) of a hadeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> without what follows in the main text here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also reported by Muslim (146) from Ibn `Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhuma</em> from the Prophet that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Islaam began as a stranger and it will return to being a stranger just as it began and it will retreat between the two mosques just as a snake returns to its hole.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5">[5]</a> As for the wording, when the companions asked,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Who are the strangers, O Messenger of Allaah? Then he replied, “They are those who are upon correctness when the people become corrupted.”</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This wording is reported by A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>abaraaniyy in <em>Al-Mu`jam al-Kabeer</em> and <em>Al-Mu`jam al-Awsa<u>t</u></em>, <em>Al-Mu`jam as-Sageer</em> from Sahl ibn Sa`d as-Saai`dee. Al-Haythamee said in <em>Majma` az-Zawaa`id</em>, its narrators are those of the <em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> except for Bakr ibn Sulaym and he was reliable as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a side point, Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy declared this narration authentic in <em>As-<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> under <u>h</u>adeeth no. 1273,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The strangers are those who are upon correctness themselves when the people become corrupted.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the last wording that’s mentioned, <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“They are those who correct whatever the people corrupt,”</strong> </span>that is reported by At-Tirmidhiyy and A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>abaraaniyy in <em>al-Kabeer</em> from a narration of `Amr ibn `Awf that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The religion began as a stranger and it will return to being a stranger. So give glad tidings to the strangers, those who rectify what the people have corrupted after me from my Sunnah.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as a<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>irmidhiyy said, “This <u>h</u>adeeth is <em><u>h</u>asan, <u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (good, authentic).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Shaykh al-Albaaniyy in his checking of <u>T</u>irmidhiyy declared this particular report here as <em><u>d</u>a`eef jiddan</em> (very weak, not authentic).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the footnote also, they mention a further wording reported by Ibn Abee Shaybah and Imaam A<u>h</u>mad and ad-Daarimee and Ibn Maajah and others from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Ibn Mas`ood that contains the wording, it was said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Who are the strangers? And that he said, “An-nuzzaa` minal qabaa-il (they are the scattered ones from amongst the tribes).” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They mention here that Imaam al-Bukhaariyy declared that narration to be <u>h</u>asan, as was reported from him by his student, a<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>irmidhiyy. And Al-Baghawee said in <em>Shar<u>h</u>us Sunnah</em>, the <u>h</u>adeeth is <em>sa<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> <em>gareeb</em> with a singular chain. And again this particular report here was declared <em>da`eef</em> by Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy in the checking of <em>Sunan Ibn Maajah</em>, <em>W`Allaahu A`lam</em>.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 32 : Point 41</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p>ولا يخرج أحد من أهل القبلة من الإسلام حتى يرد آية من كتاب الله عز وجل أو يرد شيئا من آثار رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أو يصلي لغير الله أو يذبح لغير الله وإذا فعل شيئا من ذلك فقد وجب عليك أن تخرجه من الإسلام فإذا لم يفعل شيئا من ذلك فهو مؤمن ومسلم بالاسم لا بالحقيقة</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And no one from the People of the <em>Qiblah</em> leaves Islaam unless he rejects an <em>aayah</em> from the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic or rejects anything from the narrations from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> or praise to other than Allaah or sacrifices for other than Allaah. So, if he does any of that then it is binding upon you to expel him from Islaam and if he does not do anything from that then he is a believer and a Muslim in name, even if not in reality.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/no-muslim-exits-islaam-unless-he-perpetrates-that-which-nullifies-it" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No one from the People of the <em>Qiblah</em> exits from Islaam except through committing one of the well-known <em>nawaaqid</em> (nullifiers of Islaam) along with any valid excuse being removed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>or through his rejecting anything from the narrations of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>”</strong>, if he denies the Qur&#8217;aan or a part of it or the authentic Sunnah or a part of it or he rebuts anything from the Qur&#8217;aan or rebuts anything from the authentic Sunnah then he is judged to be guilty of <em>riddah</em> (apostasy) because he is denying the truth of what has been said by Allaah and his Messenger as long as he is not <em>jaahil</em> (an ignorant person) or <em>muqallid</em> (someone just blindly following somebody else) or <em>muta`awwil</em> (somebody’s who’s misinterpreting), in which case the matter is made clear to him and when it is made clear to him and if he still persists then he is judged to be guilty of apostasy. And what is meant by <em>aathaar</em> (narrations from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) is the <em>ahaadeeth</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, “<strong>or he rejects anything from the narrations of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>”</strong>, meaning he becomes a disbeliever and this is a tremendous principle with the people of the Sunnah and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>. With it they contradict two groups;</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong><em>Khawaarij</em></strong> and the extremists, those who declare people to be disbelievers on account of <em>kabaa`ir</em> (committing major sins), which are less than shirk and,</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong><em>Murji`ah</em></strong>, those who say that sin does not harm if a person has <em>eemaan</em> as long as the person is a believer; has eemaan in his heart then no sins will harm him even if he leaves off all actions and does not do any action then he will be a believer (<em>mu`min) </em>who is complete in his <em>eemaan</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <em>Ahl-ul Sunnah</em> <em>W`al Jamaa`ah</em> (the people of the Sunnah and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>) then it is just as the author said that they are upon a middle and balanced position between the two groups. So they say that the <em>kabaa`ir </em>(major sins) vary. So, if it something from shirk or major <em>kufr</em> then he exits from the religion by consensus. And as for if it is not <em>kufr</em> (disbelief) and if it is not shirk and it is not denying the Book of Allaah nor the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah and it is not abandoning the prayer and it is not calling upon other than Allaah or sacrificing for other than Allaah, rather  it is just a major sin, it is less than that then this does not cause a person to exit from Islaam contrary to the <em>Khawaarij </em>and the <em>Mu`tazilah</em>. However, it does harm the believer and it will reduce his <em>eemaan</em> contrary to the <em>Murji`ah</em>, those who say that sin does not harm along with <em>eemaan</em>. So, this is the middle position, which harmonises between the texts of <em>Wa’eed (which mention a threat of punishment)</em> and the texts of <em>Wa‘ad</em> ( which mentions a promise of reward)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Khawaarij</em> and the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> took hold of the texts of the threat and they abandoned the texts of promise. Whereas, the <em>Murji’ah</em> did the opposite, they took hold of the texts of promise and they abandoned the texts where there is a threat. So, each of the two groups are <em>daal</em> (astray).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>or unless he prays to other than Allaah or he sacrifices for other than Allaah,” </strong>such that he prays towards a grave seeking nearness to it or he makes prostration to an idol or he makes a sacrifice for other than Allaah and does anything from the acts of worship for other than Allaah then this person is a <em>mushrik</em> (a person of shirk), <em>a kaafir (</em>disbeliever) outside the religion and whatever is lesser than that then the people of the Sunnah are upon a middle position with regard to him in between the <em>Murji`ah</em> and the <em>Khawaarij</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>and if he does anything from that then it becomes binding upon you to expel him from Islaam,”</strong> if he does anything from that, meaning if he prays to other than Allaah or sacrifices for other than Allaah or does an act of worship for other than Allaah then it is binding upon you to expel him from the religion and it is binding upon you to believe that he is a disbeliever (<em>kaafir)</em> and you may not say this is not my concern or I don’t know about him. Rather, it is obligatory upon you to declare the disbeliever and the <em>mushrik</em> to be a disbeliever and that you declare the sinner to be a sinner, one who commits a major sin, which is less than shirk. So, the truth about this matter must be made clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>and if he does not do anything from that then he is a believer and a Muslim in name, even if not in reality,” </strong>meaning with regard to what is apparent with us and his hidden condition is left to Allaah.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 31 : Point 40</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p>والصلاة على من مات من أهل القبلة سنة والمرجوم والزاني والزانية والذي يقتل نفسه وغيره من أهل القبلة والسكران وغيرهم الصلاة عليهم سنة</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to pray over whoever dies from the People of the <em>Qiblah </em>is the Sunnah and over the one who has been stoned to death and the male fornicator and the female fornicator and the one who commits suicide and other than him from the People of the <em>Qiblah</em> and the drunkard and other than them, the funeral prayer over them is the Sunnah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F374257166&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/to-pray-over-whoever-dies-from-the-people-of-the-qiblah-is-the-sunnah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is just as has preceded that whoever manifests <em>eemaan</em> and Islaam, we pray funeral prayer over him and he is from the People of the <em>Qiblah</em> and they are those who pray towards the <em>Ka’bah (</em>the direction of prayer of the Muslims), those people we deal with them in accordance with what is apparent so we judge them to be Muslims and we treat them as we treat the Muslims whilst they are alive and when they are dead.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>and likewise the one who has been stoned to death and the male fornicator and the female fornicator and the one who has committed suicide and other than him from the People of the <em>Qiblah</em>”, </strong>the sinful believer who does not exit from Islaam on account of his major sin is treated as a Muslim and supplication is made for him just like the person who commits suicide and just like the one who is stoned for fornication and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> prayed funeral prayer over those who were stoned to death. He prayed over Maa`iz <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and over Al-Ghaamidiyyah; the woman of the Ghaamidiyyah tribe <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhaa</em>.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> would withhold from praying over some people such as the one who committed suicide and such as the person who misappropriated something from the booty in Allaah’s cause in order to discipline the people not because he was a disbeliever and therefore he gave permission to the companions to pray upon him and he did not prevent them from prayer over him because he is still a Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and the drunkard and other than them, the prayer over them is Sunnah”, </strong>the one who drinks alcohol is a <em>faasiq</em> (sinner), the <em><u>h</u>add</em> (prescribed punishment) is established upon him. However, he does not exit from Islaam. So, if he dies then he is prayed over even if he used to drink alcohol because he is still from the People of the <em>Qibla</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, “<strong>it is the Sunnah”, </strong>meaning it is from the Sunnah of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, which it is obligatory to follow.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> This incident of Maa`iz with the long story connected to it; he came and he admitted what he had done and sought that he should be stoned to death is reported in Al-Bukhaariyy (6,820) in the book of <em><u>h</u>udood</em> (prescribed punishments), Chapter 25 ‘Stoning to Death at the Mu<u>s</u>allaa (outdoor place of prayer)’ from the <u>h</u>adeeth of Jaabir.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Side point:</strong> contains the wording there when it mentions his story and that he was stoned to death and then at the end of it occurs that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> prayed over him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Side point:</strong> Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy said with regard to that wording there it is quoted at the end of the narration in a disconnected form and Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy said in <em>Irwa</em>` <em>Al Ghalil</em> Volume 7, page 353 that this narration is actually <em>shaaddah</em> (contrary to what’s authentic) that the fact that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> himself prayed over Maa`iz is contrary to the correct reports. It’s only reported by one narrator Mahmood ibn Gheelaan to the exclusion of all other narrators of this <u>h</u>adeeth and Al-<u>H</u>aafidh ibn <u>H</u>ajar mentions their names in <em>Fathul Baari</em> Volume 12, page 115-116. Likewise, in addition Aboo Daawood reports in his Sunan <u>h</u>adeeth 3,186 from Aboo Burdah Al-Aslami that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> did not pray over Maa`iz ibn Malik and he did not forbid prayer over him.  Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy said this report by Aboo Daawood is hasan, saheeh (good, authentic), Allaahu A’lam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> This <u>h</u>adeeth that she was stoned to death and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> prayed over her, <u>h</u>adeeth being reported by Muslim (1,695) from <u>h</u>adeeth of Buraydah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> <strong>Side point:</strong> Shaykh as-Suhaymee <em><u>h</u></em><em>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The author affirming that the prayer is said over all of them, there is <em>taf<u>s</u>eel</em>  (detail) here  that needs to be mentioned, which is that he is to be prayed over by everyone <strong>except for the <em>Imaam</em> (ruler)</strong> because it is not befitting that the ruler should pray over those people so that the sinful people should not become emboldened to commit those sins and crimes. Rather, what is befitting is that they should be deterred from that. So, the ruler should not pray the funeral prayer over them. Rather, his deputy should pray over him so that the people should know that the ruler not praying over those people who have died, they should recognise it, it will be a deterrent for them and the people should recognise how despicable that action is, which has led the ruler to stay back from praying the funeral prayer over him. As for the rest of the nation then they should pray over those people.”</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 31 : Point 39</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>واعلم بأن الدنيا دار إيمان وإسلام وأمة محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم فيها مؤمنون مسلمون في أحكامهم ومواريثهم وذبائحهم والصلاة عليهم ولا نشهد لأحد بحقيقة الإيمان حتى يأتي بجميع شرائع الإسلام فإن قصر في شيء من ذلك كان ناقص الإيمان حتى يتوب واعلم أن إيمانه إلى الله تعالى تام الإيمان أو ناقص الإيمان إلا ما أظهر لك من تضييع شرائع الإسلام</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that this world is an abode of <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) and Islaam and the nation of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in it are believers and Muslims with regard to rulings, inheritance, slaughtering animals and with regard to praying the funeral prayer over them. And we do not bear witness for any of them that he is a true believer unless he fulfils all of the duties of Islaam. So if he neglects any of that then he will be deficient in <em>eemaan</em> until he repents and you should know that his <em>eemaan</em> is left to Allaah, the Most High, to judge whether he is complete in <em>eemaan</em> or incomplete in <em>eemaan</em> unless he manifests to you neglect of the Islaamic duties.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/this-world-is-an-abode-of-eemaan-and-islaam" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And you should know that this world is an abode of <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) and Islaam”, </strong>meaning Islaam and <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) are in this world; <em>duniya</em>, which is the abode of action. As for the <em>aakhirah</em> (Hereafter) and it is the abode of <em>jazaa </em>(recompense). So Islaam and <em>eemaan</em> are to be found in this world. As for one who dies on other than Islaam and eemaan then he is a kaafir, a disbeliever and it will not benefit him, that on the Day of Resurrection when he witnesses that which he disbelieved in, that he then believes in it or that he wishes to return and seeks from his Lord that he can return in order to believe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>وَلَوْ تَرَىٰ إِذْ وُقِفُوا عَلَى النَّارِ فَقَالُوا يَا لَيْتَنَا نُرَدُّ وَلَا نُكَذِّبَ بِآيَاتِ رَبِّنَا وَنَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if only you could see when they are held in the Fire and they will say, woe to us, would that we could be sent back into the world and then do not deny the signs of our Lord and so that we could be from the believers.  </strong></span>(Sooratul-An’aam (6), <em>aayah</em> 27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is a distinction between Islaam and <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) because the <em>deen</em> (religion) is of three levels:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><em>Islaam</em></li>
<li><em>Al-eemaan</em> (true faith)</li>
<li><em>Al-i<u>h</u>saan</em> (perfection of worship). &#8211; highest level</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth of Jibreel and the broadest and widest of these three levels is the level of Islaam because Islaam is <em>al-Istislaam bid-dhaahir</em> (to surrender outwardly) and he may be a believer inwardly or he may be a hypocrite who is just submitting outwardly but  a disbeliever inwardly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <em>eemaan</em>, it is not applied to the hypocrite; <em>munaafiq</em>, for the believer who is complete in his <em>eemaan</em> enters into it and the believer who is deficient in his <em>eemaan</em> enters into it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when they Islaam and <em>eemaan</em> are mentioned together then in that case Islaam means the outward rulings and what is meant by <em>eemaan</em> are the inner rulings.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth of Jibreel that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“Islaam is that you testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah and that you establish the prayer and that you give the zakaah and that you fast ramadaan and that you perform Hajj to the house.” </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the outward actions; actions of the tongue and the limbs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jibreel said to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Inform me about eemaan (true faith).”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“It is that you truly believe in Allaah and in His angels and in His books and in His Messengers, in the Last Day and that you truly believe in Al-Qadr (predecree), the good of it and the bad of it.</span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the inward actions, in other words, the actions of the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Islaam and <em>eemaan</em> must be combined so if only one of them is mentioned then the other one enters within it. So if <em>eemaan</em> alone is mentioned then Islaam enters within it and if Islaam is mentioned then <em>eemaan</em> enters within it. And therefore, the People of Knowledge say Islaam and <em>eemaan</em> if they come together then they separate in meaning, when they are found separate then they come together, each one of them will have the meaning of both, meaning, in meaning just like the case of <em>faqeer</em> (the poor person) and <em>al-miskeen</em> (the destitute person), if they are mentioned together meaning in a text then the <em>faqeer</em> (the poor person) has a certain meaning and the word <em>al-miskeen</em> (the destitute person) has a separate meaning. When only one of them is mentioned then the other one enters within it.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and the nation of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in it are believers and Muslims with regard to their rulings and with regard to their inheritance and with regard to the animals that they slaughter and with regard to the funeral prayer over them”, </strong>the nation of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> are Muslims and believers (<em>mu`minoon)</em> because whoever is a believer (a <em>mu`min)</em> then he will be a Muslim automatically. Whereas whoever is a Muslim then he may be a believer; a <em>mu`min</em> but he may be a hypocrite (<em>munaafiq)</em>. However, as for correct Islaam then it must have <em>eemaan</em> along with it even if it is a small amount.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">قَالَتِ الْأَعْرَابُ آمَنَّا ۖ قُل لَّمْ تُؤْمِنُوا وَلَٰكِن قُولُوا أَسْلَمْنَا</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The desert Arabs, bedouins said, “we have believed.” Say, “you are not believers but rather you should say <em>aslamnaa</em> (we have submitted).”</span>  </strong>(Sooratul-Hujuraat (49), <em>aayah </em>14)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and the nation of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in it are believers and Muslims with regard to their rulings and with regard to their inheritance”, </strong>the Muslim even if he is only such outwardly then he will have the ruling of the Muslims. They should ally themselves to him and if he dies, they should wash him and shroud him and pray the funeral prayer over him and bury him in the graveyard of the Muslims and whilst he is alive, they should love him and ally themselves with him and they have mercy amongst themselves and they behave as brothers between themselves. This is the nation of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The likeness of the believers with regard to the mutual love and mutual mercy and mutual compassion is the likeness of a single body. If one part of it has a complaint then the rest of the body suffers sleeplessness and feverishness on account of it.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em>`alayhis-salaatu was-salaam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The believer to the believer is just like a solid structure each part of which supports the rest (and he interlaced his fingers).”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the  believers are brothers; <em>ikhwaa</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ِنَّمَا الْمُؤْمِنُونَ إِخْوَةٌ فَأَصْلِحُوا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“The believers are but brothers.” </strong></span>(Sooratul-Hujuraat (49) <em>aayah</em> 10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Brothers with regard to <em>eemaan </em>not in lineage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“nation of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> are believers and Muslims with regard to their slaughtered animals”, </strong>the meat sacrificed by a Muslim is <em>halaal</em> (lawful) even if he is a <em>faasiq</em> (sinner) as long as he has not exited from Islaam then the meat that he has slaughtered is <em>halaal</em> (permissible) and the hypocrite if he slaughters also, then we will eat it based upon his being judged to be a Muslim as long as it does not become clear that he is a hypocrite; <em>munaafiq</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إِلَّا مَا ذَكَّيْتُمْ</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Except for that which you (plural) slaughter. </strong>(</span>Sooratul-Maa`idah(5), <em>aayah </em>3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an address to the Muslims and He made permissible the sacrifices of <em>Ahl ul-Kitaab</em> (People of the Book).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَطَعَامُ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ حِلٌّ لَّكُمْ</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And the meat of those who were given the scripture is lawful for you.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Maa`idah(5), <em>aayah </em>5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning the sacrificed animals because they sacrifice upon the legislated manner in accordance with what they have from the scripture. As for the animals sacrificed by the idol worshippers and the <em>kuffaar</em> (disbelievers) and the atheists and the apostates then we do not eat that because it is a sacrifice of a disbeliever (<em>kaafir</em>) and it is impure because the sacrifice of a disbeliever is dead meat. So it is impure on account of the disbelief since it is affected by the one who sacrifices it so it will be foul because the one who slaughters it is foul and it is affected by him and the fact that Allaah, the Majestic and Most High has permitted for us the slaughtered meat of the People of the Book specifically. This is a proof that the slaughtered meat of other than them is forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and with regard to the funeral prayer over them”, </strong>the prayer is performed over every Muslim even if he was a sinner and a disobedient one or a hypocrite who did not make his hypocrisy apparent as long as he did not exit from Islaam then the prayer is performed for him and supplication is made for him and forgiveness is sought for him and he inherits from his close Muslim relative and his close Muslim relative inherits from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And we do not bear witness for any of them that he is a true believer unless he fulfils all of the duties of Islaam”,</strong> meaning we do not declare anyone pure such that we say so and so is a <em>mu`min</em> (believer) because bearing witness for him that he is a believer (<em>mu`min)</em> is a witness that he may not be deserving of and therefore when  a man said to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Give something to so and so because he is a believer.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Our Muslim (or he is a Muslim).”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the person said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Give to so and so because he is a believer (from the booty).”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Our Muslim (or he is a Muslim).”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> intended by this that the person should not declare someone to be pure and perfect by saying he’s a believer. Rather, he should apply the general term to him and say he is a Muslim and he may be a Muslim who is firm upon Islaam and he may be a Muslim who has sins and acts of disobedience and deficiencies and he may be a hypocrite so you should not bear witness for him with completeness.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“So if he neglects anything from that then he will be deficient in <em>eemaan</em> unless and until he repents”, </strong>the `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) of the <em>Ahl ul-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em> is that sins even if they are major sins (<em>kabaa&#8217;ir</em>) as long as they are less than <em>shirk</em> then they do not cause the Muslim to exit from Islaam or they do not exit him from the domain of <em>eemaan</em>. Rather, he will be a believer (<em>mu`min)</em> in accordance with his <em>eemaan</em>, a sinner in accordance with the level of his major sin or you say &#8220;he is a believer who is deficient in <em>eemaan&#8221;</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and know that his <em>eemaan</em> is left to Allaah, the Most High whether he is complete in <em>eemaan</em> or deficient in <em>eemaan</em>”, </strong>meaning we accept from him what is apparent and we entrust his hidden state to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“unless he manifests to you neglect of the duties of Islaam”, </strong>meaning unless he commits something, which nullifies a person’s Islaam and from them is to neglect or abandon the religious duties of Islaam so then you will judge that he is guilty of apostasy just as if he abandoned the prayer deliberately or if he spoke with a word of disbelief such as abusing Allaah or abusing the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> or abusing the religion of Islaam for then you would judge that he is guilty of <em>riddaa</em> (apostasy) in accordance with what has become apparent. So whoever manifests something, which nullifies Islaam along with removal of any valid excuse and removal of any preventing factors and is he misinterpreting something or is he just blindly following someone else or is he <em>jaahil</em> (one who is totally ignorant), was he angry. For in that case, he will not be judged to be an apostate along with these preventing factors.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Side point: As occurs here in the text, <strong>“this world is a place of eemaan and Islaam”, </strong>when the two are mentioned together they separate in meaning. Islaam means the outward duties of Islaam; the prayers, the <em>zakaat</em> and so on and so forth whereas <em>eemaan</em> in that case refers to the inner actions and beliefs of the heart.</p>

You hope for Allaah’s Mercy for him and you fear for him (because of his sins). You do not know what is destined for him at the point of death with regard to his repenting to Allaah and what Allaah may bring about for him at that time if he dies upon Islaam. You hope for (Allaah’s) Mercy for him and you fear for him because of his sins. And there is no sin except that the servant may repent from it.</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/bearing-witness-of-paradise-or-of-the-fire-for-a-specific-individual-without-a-proof" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And witness (meaning regarding Paradise or the Fire) may not be given against anyone nor for him based upon his having done a good or bad deed.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This matter of bearing witness of Paradise or of the Fire for a specific individual, this is that matter. So witness is not given for a specific individual that he will be in Paradise nor is witness given that he will be in the Fire, except with a proof from the Book and the Sunnah. As for one who there is no proof to state that he is from the people of Paradise, even if he is a righteous person, a believer, we do not do so because we do not know what his concluding action will be. And likewise, a sinful person or a disbeliever, we do not state for certain that the individual that he is from the people of the Fire because he might repent and we do not know. He <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“One of you may perform the actions of the people of Paradise until there is not between him and it except a cubit (forearm); but then what was written overtakes him and he acts with the action of the people of the Fire and therefore he enters it. And one of you may act with the actions of the people of the Fire until there is not between him and it except a forearm (a cubit) and then what was written overtakes him and he acts with the action of the people of Paradise and therefore he enters it.”</span></strong> [05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Actions are in accordance with their conclusions.”</span> </strong>[06 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the concluding actions are not known except to Allaah, the Knower of all hidden things, He, the Perfect and Most High. But as for us, then we have fear for the people of sins and we have hope for the people of acts of obedience but we do not state with certainty. Rather, we have hope for those who are obedient but we do not state with certainty, and we have fear for the sinful ones but we do not state with certainty. This is with regard to specific individuals. As for in general, then we state with certainty that the people of eemaan (true belief) are the people of Paradise and we state with certainty that the disbelievers are the people of the Fire. Allaah, the Most High, said with regard to the Fire:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">It has already been prepared for the disbelievers.</span></strong><br />
(Soorah-Aali `Imraan (3), aayah 131)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said with regard to Paradise:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">It has already been prepared for those who have taqwaa (those who are fearful of Allaah and dutiful to Him).</span> </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), aayah 133)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is with regard to in general. As for specific individuals and specific people, then this is entrusted to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. However, we behave and deal with them on the basis of what is apparent. We deal with the people of obedience in accordance with what appears from them and we deal with the people of sins in accordance to what is apparent from them. We pass judgement in accordance with what is apparent only, not stating the final destination and the final outcome, for that lies in the Hand of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. [07]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[05] Reported by al-Bukhaariyy in his Saheeh (no. 6594) and Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 2643) from the hadeeth of `Abdullaah ibn Mas`ood <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> the famous hadeeth of as-Saadiq al-Masdooq, the fourth hadeeth in an-Nawawiyy’s Forty Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[06] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> the wording of a hadeeth</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[07] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmiyy <em>rahimahullaah</em> dealt with a point, which wasn’t dealt with here directly: <strong><span style="color:#808000;">“And there is no sin except that the servant can repent from it.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmiyy <em>rahimahullaah</em> said in his explanation, “At-Towbah (repentance) is acceptable from every sin with regard to the rulings relating to the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong>Translator’s note:</strong> meaning, in the Hereafter that would be wiped away from him. When `Amr ibn al-`Aas came to accept Islaam and the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> told him to put out his hand to give his pledge &#8211; that’s when he withheld it for a moment. He said, “Because I want to make a condition.” So the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> asked him what condition he wanted to make. He said, “What I did before should be forgiven.” So therefore the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said the hadeeth the shaykh quotes here.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And the Prophet s<em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said to `Amr ibn al-`Aas radiyAllaahu `anhu,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">‘Do you not know that Islaam demolishes what came before it and that performing Hijrah demolishes what came before it and that the Hajj demolishes what came before it.’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Reported by Muslim (121) in the Book of Eemaan)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“And his saying with regard to the man who killed ninety-nine men, ‘And who can come between him and between repentance?’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The hadeeth reported by Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And the ahaadeeth in this regard are very clear. And the disagreement is with regard to a person who spoke with words of abuse against the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> or against the Qur·aan &#8211; is his repentance accepted with regard to this world or is judgement passed that he is to be executed, even if he makes clear his repentance? Then this has been clarified by Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah in his book As-Saarimul-Maslool `alaa Shaatimir-Rasool <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And Allaah is the One who grants success.”</p>

<p><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>[The below is the Text from the Book]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Chapter 14: We do not Call a Muslim an Unbeliever Due to his Sins</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[100] Ahl us-Sunnab believe that if a Believer commits sins, however small or large they may be, he does not become an unbeliever. If he leaves this world without making any repentance from them and he dies upon Tawheed and Ikhlaas, then his affair is entirely up to Allaah, The Most Mighty and The Most Majestic. If He wills, He may forgive him and enter him into Paradise on the Day of judgement, safe and sound without being afflicted by the fire and without being punished for his perpetration of the sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He will be brought on the Day of judgement with his sins and misdeeds. If Allaah wills, He will punish him for a period in the Fire. If He punishes him, he will not however remain in the Fire forever, but he will eventually be freed and taken out from it, to the place of tranquility and content.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[101] Our Shaykh, the Imaam Aboo Tayyeb Sahl ibn Muhammad as- Sa’lookee, raheemahullaah, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The sinning believer, even if he is punished by the fire, he will not be thrown in there the same way as the unbeliever is thrown in the fire. He will not remain there the same way as the unbeliever will remain there nor will he be wretched and miserable the same way the unbeliever is wretched and miserable.”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[102] This means that the unbeliever will be dragged to the Fire on his face, he will be thrown in there chained, and then hung upside down, shackled by having his hands tied to his neck with strong and heavy chains. However, the sinning believer, if he is afflicted by the Fire, he will enter it like a criminal enters a prison in this world on his feet, not upside down nor thrown in. The meaning of his statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8230;he will not, be thrown in there the same way as the unbeliever is thrown in the fire&#8230;,” means that the unbeliever will have all his body burned and every time his skin is roasted through it will be replaced with another, so that he may taste the punishment again, as Allaah informs us in His Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Indeed, those who have disbelieved in our signs, we shall burn them in a fire. We shall change their skins for other skins, so that they may taste the punishment again.&#8221;</span> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4;56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the believers they will not have their faces scorched by the Fire, and their limbs which they used for sujood will not be burned. For Allaah has forbidden the Fire from burning them. “ [113]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[103] His saying: “&#8230;he will not stay in the Fire like the unbeliever would&#8230;”, means that the unbeliever will remain in it forever and never come out of it. Allaah will never leave any sinning believer in the Fire forever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying: “&#8230;he will not be afflicted like the unbeliever”, means that the unbeliever has no hope of the Mercy of Allah and no opportunity for reprieve from the punishment. As for the believer he will never be cut off from the hope of the Mercy of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The final outcome for all the believers is Paradise, as they were created for it and it was created for them, as a Mercy and a Blessing from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">[113] The prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: &#8220;Allaah has forbidden the fire to eat up the traces of Sujood&#8221;. Related by al-Bukhaaree [806] and Muslim [182]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Question</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Some of the Takfeeris make takfeer of themselves (i.e. declare themselves disbelievers). One of the brothers who was in Afghanistan informed me that he sat next to one of them one time while this Takfeeri was busy making takfeer (of people). Then all of a sudden that Takfeeri called him, so he said: What do you want?” So he (the Takfeeri) said: “I have committed kufr (disbelief)!”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Answer</strong></span>: Yes, they make takfeer on themselves and they make takfeer on one another. I would like for my brothers in Islaam to refer to the book: “<strong>Al-Farq bainalFiraq</strong>” and the book “<strong>Al-Milal wan-Nihal</strong>” of ash-Shahrastaanee, as well as “<strong>AlFasl</strong>” of Ibn Hazm. So perhaps four or five of them may sit in one gathering and they will not get up from that meeting except that one of them has made takfeer of another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Question</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">There can be found a group of these Takfeeris in ‘Aden in the central Mosque. They have entered the masjid recently. How should we deal with them?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Answer</strong></span>: It is obligatory to warn the people about them because if you present them with the opportunity, they will shed blood and make lawful that which is prohibited, as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم informed us they would do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Question</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The hadeeth of Umm Salamah (radyAllaahu ‘anhaa) reported by Muslim: “There will come upon you leaders of whom you will approve of (the good they do) but reject (the bad). So whoever rejects (their bad deeds), he is absolved from blame. And whoever hates (their bad deeds), he is (also) saved. However, whoever is pleased with them and follows them (i.e. bad deeds), (then he is destroyed).” They (the Sahaabah) said: “Shall we fight against them?” He said: “No, so long as they establish the prayer amongst you.” Isn’t this hadeeth a refutation against them?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: Yes, I have not mentioned several ayaat and ahaadeeth (during this discussion), such as the hadeeth of ‘Ubaadah bin As-Saamit (radhi Allaahu anhu), who reported that the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Whoever bears witness that there is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah; that ‘Eesaa is the slave and messenger of Allaah, His word, which He placed in Maryam, and a spirit from Him; and that Paradise is true and the Hellfire is true, Allaah will admit him into Paradise, regardless of what actions he has.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth and those similar to it prove that it is not permissible to fight against Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Question</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The lowest level of Islaam is not persisting upon committing sins. So if you persist upon committing a sin, then you are a disbeliever. How would you reply to this claim?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: If someone persists on committing a sin, there is no proof that indicates that he is a disbeliever, unless he is persisting upon committing disbelief. As for him persisting upon continuously committing a sin, then this person is guilty of committing a major sin. And Allaah praises the righteous people, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">وَلَمْ یُصِرُّواْ عَلَى مَا فَعَلُواْ وَهُمْ یَعْلَمُونَ<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">“And they do not persist in what (wrong) they have done, while they know.”</span><br />
[Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 135]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this person is sinning if he persists in his evil. But as for this action taking him to the level of disbelief, then where is the evidence for this??</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Question</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Is it permissible for us to make takfeer of the Jamaa’ah at-Takfeer (i.e. declare them to be disbelievers)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: No, we do not declare them to be disbelievers, for the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: “Whoever says to his brother: ‘O Kaafir’, then it falls back on one of them. If he is as he said he is (then it falls on him), and if not then it returns back to him.” So we do not say that they are disbelievers. ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib said about the Khawaarij: “Flee from kufr (disbelief).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we consider them to be innovators and misguided, more astray that the donkey of their people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Is it permissible to wage war against the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: We should not wage war agsint them unless they inititate it against us and we feel that they will present a danger to Islaam and the Muslims. So in that case, we should do what ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib did. Otherwise, the core foundation with regard to the Muslim is that his blood (i.e. life) is sacred, and it is not permissible to wage war against them, unless they initiate first by fighting against the Muslims or it is feared that they will bring harm to the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Jamaa’at at-Takfeer use as evidence the argument that the proof was established upon mankind with Allaah’s statement:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">وَإِذْ أَخَذَ رَبُّكَ مِن بَنِي آدَمَ مِن ظُهُورِهِمْ ذُرِّیَّتَهُمْ وَأَشْهَدَهُمْ عَلَى أَنفُسِهِمْ أَلَسْتَ بِرَبِّكُمْ</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">قَالُواْ بَلَى شَهِدْنَا أَن تَقُولُواْ یَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ إِنَّا آُنَّا عَنْ هَذَا غَافِلِينَ</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“And remember when your Lord brought forth from the Children of Aadam from their loins, their seed and made them testily as to themselves, saying: ‘Am I not your Lord?’ They said: ‘Yes, we testify’ lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection: ‘Verily we were unaware of this.’” [Surah Al-A’raaf: 172]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And they deem Ibn ‘Abbaas’ interpretation (tafseer) of Allaah’s statement:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">وَمَن لَّمْ یَحْكُم بِمَا أَنزَلَ اللّهُ فَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْكَافِرُونَ</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“And whoever doesn’t rule by what Allaah has revealed, then they are the disbelievers” [5] in which he said: “It is a (minor) disbelief less than (major) disbelief” to be a weak narration.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: As for using this ayah as evidence, it states that Allaah has taken a covenant from the Children of Aadam, however there is no mention in it that there is not left any excuses for them. the proof for this is Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">وَمَا آُنَّا مُعَذِّبِينَ حَتَّى نَبْعَثَ رَسُولاً<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">“And We never punish until We have sent a messenger (to forewarn).”</span> [Surah AlIsraa: 15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another proof is Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">وَمَا آَانَ اللّهُ لِيُضِلَّ قَوْمًا بَعْدَ إِذْ هَدَاهُمْ حَتَّى یُبَيِّنَ لَهُم مَّا یَتَّقُونَ<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">“And Allaah will never lead a people astray after He has guided them until He (first) makes clear to them what they should avoid.”</span> [Surah At-Tawbah: 115]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the Saheeh, from the narration of Hudhaifah radhi Allaahu anhu, the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم informed us that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There was a man who when death approached him asked his children: ‘What kind of a father was I to you?’ They replied: ‘The best father.’ So he said: ‘If I order you to do something, would you do it?’ They said: ‘Yes.’ He said: ‘When I die, burn my body and scatter my ashes (throughout the land and sea), for I swear by Allaah, if Allaah is able to get a hold of me, He will surely punish me with a severe torment, the likes of which no other creature in the universe will face.’ So when he died his children did what he asked. So Allaah commanded the land and the sea to gather his remains, until he brought the man forth and Allaah said to him: ‘What caused you to do what you did?’ He replied: ‘My fear of you.’ So Allaah said to him: “I have indeed forgiven you.’” This is proof that this individual was excused due to his ignorance. He doubted Allaah’s Ability. We don’t say that the word qadira here holds the meaning of: to restrain. So its meaning is not: “If Allaah restrains me.” This is since according to the context of the hadeeth, the appropriate meaning is that it refers to Allaah’s Ability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also the hadeeth of Hudhaifah radhi Allaahu anhu, in which he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It is imminent that a time will come upon the people in which one will not know what fasting or prayer is.” So it was said: “What then will remain with them, O Hudhaifah?” He replied: “The testification that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah.” It was said: “And what benefit will this testification be for them?” He said: “It will take them out from the Hellfire.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there are many proofs in the Qur’aan and the Sunnah that indicate that one is excused due to ignorance. One of these proofs is the hadeeth reported by Abu Hurairah radhi Allaahu anhu and Al-Aswad bin Saree’ in Musnad Ahmad concerning how the people of Fitrah (innate inclination) will be tested:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“On the Day of Judgement, three types of people will present their arguments to Allaah. One of them will say: ‘I was deaf and could not hear.’ Another will say: ‘I was simple-minded and didn’t have any intellect.’ And the third will present his argument. So Allaah will bring forth a strip from the Hellfire and say to them: ‘Enter it.’ So if they enter it, it will be cool and safe on them. And if they do not enter it, He will say to them: ‘Now you have disobeyed Me. And you would have been the most disobedient to My messengers.’”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jamaa’at at-Takfeer is a deviant group of people. So we advise our brothers in AlBaydaa and Ibb and other places to beware of them and to regard them as misguided individuals who are far away from the Religion. And they should consider them as a danger to Islaam and the Muslims. So they serve as an instrument for everyone that wishes to attack the Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, we advise them to repent to Allaah, and to turn back to the people of knowledge. And if they remain upon their misguidance and meet Allaah holding these deviant beliefs, they will regret it, and Allaah is the One who we ask for assistance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Question</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Who is the one who has the ability to make takfeer (declare someone a disbeliever)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The scholars are the ones who are capable of placing rulings upon an individual – i.e. if he is either a Muslim or a disbeliever, unless of course if he is a Christian or a Jew or a Communist. Then in this case it is known to the Muslims that such people are disbelievers. There can be found a group that is called Jamaa’at atTakfeer, which is present in Egypt, Sudan and Yemen. This group declares Muslims to be disbelievers due to sins (they commit). And we have made several refutations against them. They feel restrained and pressed back by Da’wah but not by prison and terrorism. However, by calling to the Book and the Sunnah their misguidance can be exposed. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Whoever says to his brother: ‘O Kaafir’, then it falls back on one of them. If he is as he said he is (then it falls on him), and if not then it returns back to him.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not permissible for a Muslim to declare other Muslims to be disbelievers.[6]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The definition of the people who adhere and ascribe to this methodology:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Suroorees are a group of people or a sect that ascribe themselves to <strong>Muhammad Suroor Zayn-ul-‘Aabideen</strong>. They have some aspects of the Sunnah and some aspects of Bid’ah (innovation) in them. The most important characteristics that can be noted from them are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <strong>They attack the rulers and speak about them in a manner that results in evil, corruption and danger</strong>. It appears that they declare the leaders to be disbelievers, but this can only be understood by way of their circumstances and actions and cannot be picked up from their words. This is since the path they take is the path of the Khawaarij or close to it, knowing that the religious texts state the obligation of hearing and obeying the rulers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And our rulers in this land (of Saudi Arabia) are Muslims – all praise be to Allaah. They use Allaah’s Legislation for judging in their court systems and they establish the prescribed punishments (hudood). So declaring them to be disbelievers or talking about them in a manner that leads to revolting and rebelling against them is considered a great form of causing corruption. Due to this, we must warn against those who adhere to this methodology or rid ourselves from them, especially since they have attacked the scholars of this land by reviling them, making slanderous remarks against them and accusing them of betraying the Deen. This matter indicates what they are behind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. <strong>They call to Jihaad, but they do not intend by it the Jihaad against the disbelievers.</strong> Rather it seems like they intend by it to change the leaders, knowing that we cannot rid the leaders of their errors. And we do not claim that they are infallible however we say: It is obligatory to obey them and to advise them in a private manner because they are Muslims. And the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) forbade us from rebelling against the leader unless the one rebelling sees clear disbelief upon him by which he will have a proof from Allaah in the matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. <strong>They claim that the scholars in this land do not understand the current affairs</strong>. And they can be refuted by the fact that the Muftees and the judges do not issue a fatwa in a single issue nor do they judge in a single matter except after coming to know its state of affairs, which encompasses it, such as the cause, the conditions for the ruling and its effects. So whoever claims that these scholars and judges do not understand the current affairs then he has wronged himself and spoken what is not permissible for him to say. As for knowing the plans and schemes of the enemies and so on, then this falls under the jurisdiction of each country’s army.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen about the Arab rulers (exclusive, detailed Fatwâ)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Scholar</strong>: Imâm Muhammad bin Sâlih bin ´Uthaymîn<br />
<strong>Source:</strong> Liqâ’ al-Bâb al-Maftûh (51 B)<br />
<strong>Reference</strong>: Darulhadith.com<br />
Translation and Video by aFatwa.com (site is down)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">There is a matter it is written much about and it goes by the name “Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamâ’ah” while in fact it is the methodology of Khawârij. We would like to confirm this matter with you. It is namely about the general legislation the rulers are judged by. They argue with your Fatwas in “al-Majmû’ ath-Thamîn” and that this deed is clear disbelief since it is about Tabdîl, replacement. This opinion is also attributed to Shaykh Muhammad bin Ibrâhîm [Âl ash-Shaykh] (rahimahullâh). In order for the answer to be explicit and clear, the question goes as follows; does one take into consideration the factors that hinder from Takfîr or the Iqâmat-ul-Hujjah which Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamâ’ah put as a condition for the one who rules by a general legislation rather than the law of Allâh?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymîn:</strong> A factor that hinders from Takfîr shouldn’t exist when a person performs a disbelieving deed [I.e. if we are to do Takfîr]. It is therefore mentioned in the authentic Hadîth when the prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) was asked if they should fight against the rulers that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Except if you see clear and explicit disbelief of which you have proof from Allâh.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The disbelief has to be clear and known and it shouldn’t be possible to misunderstand it. If one can misunderstand it, then one doesn’t do Takfîr on the person who falls into it (this deed) EVEN IF THE DEED IS DISBELIEF. There is a difference between the speech and the speaker and (between) the deed and the doer. The deed can be a defiant sin without the person (whom performs it) being a defiant sinner because there is an obstacle that hinders him from being it. It can also be disbelief without the person being a disbeliever because there is an obstacle that hinders him from being is (I.e. a disbeliever).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was nothing other than this unsound misinterpretation that made the rebellion of the Khawârij harm the Islâmic Ummah. Khawârij get the idea that the deed is disbelief and (thusly) they revolt, which they said to ‘Alî bin Abî Tâlib. They were together with ‘Alî bin Abî Tâlib against the army of Shâm. After the peace treaty between ‘Alî bin Abî Tâlib and Shâm, Khawârij revolted against him after having been with him. He fought against them and killed them and all praise is due to Allâh. The point lies in the fact that they revolted against him and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“You have judged by something other than the law of Allâh. You have let the human judge.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a result thereof, they revolted against him. Thus, the catastrophe of the Ummah is because of this misinterpretation. A person can mistakenly get the idea that something is clear and explicit disbelief and revolt (due to it). It is possible that the deed really is disbelief without its doer being a disbeliever because of an obstacle (I.e. ignorance, compulsion etc). The rebel believes that this person is free from excuses and (thus) does the likes of these revolts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, a person has to make sure not to be in a hurry with making Takfîr or Tafsîq upon the humans. There is a risk that a person falls into a clear, defiant sin without knowing about it. When he finds out that it is forbidden, he thanks you (Jazâk Allâhu khayr) and leaves it. Does this exist? Yes, beyond the shadow of a doubt [it does]. How can I then judge a person to be a defiant sinner while he hasn’t received the truth?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those you accuse among the Arab and Muslim rulers can be excused. They have perhaps not received the truth. They maybe have received it while at the same time somebody made them misunderstand the matter. Thus, one has to be sensible when it comes to this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let us say that all of the conditions have been met for us to be allowed to revolt in the way that we have seen clear and explicit disbelief of which we have proof from Allâh. It is a condition to have seen it. The disbelief is a condition. That it is clear and explicit is a condition. That we have proof of it from Allâh is a condition. These are four conditions. His (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) words “except if you see…” are there so that one doesn’t fall victim to baseless rumours. It means that one should be convinced. The word “disbelief” (Kufr) is there so that one doesn’t get hung up on a defiant sin. If the ruler is a sinning alcoholic without having fallen into disbelief, then it is not allowed to revolt against him. The words “clear and explicit” mean that it is definite and that it (the Kufr) can’t be misinterpreted. The fourth is “of which you have proof from Allâh”. It should thusly not only be definite according to us. Rather, we should base ourselves on clear and definite evidence. These four conditions are the conditions for it to be allowed to revolt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, there is a fifth condition for the revolt to be obligatory. Is it obligatory for us to revolt against the ruler just because it is allowed? One has to consider the advantage. Are we able to overthrow him? [If yes] then in this case we revolt. If we are unable, then we do not revolt. All religious duties are only [duties] if they are doable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, if we are able to revolt, then there is a risk that the disadvantage is greater and worse than if this leader were to keep his (position as a) leader. If we revolt against him and he wins, we become more humiliated while he becomes even worse in his transgression and disbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These matters require common sense and that it is tethered with the Sharî’ah and that it isn’t led by emotions. We are in need of emotions in order to have enthusiasm and we are in need of the Sharî’ah to curb us. We have to have brakes. A car without brakes will crash and a car without power doesn’t drive.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, and the noble companions and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">If someone makes a statement of kufr or opposition to the Sunnah and he is a practicing Muslim, can we say he is a kafir?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a person commits an action of kufr or says a statement of kufr, then this person in particular can only be called a kafir only after certain criteria are met. These criteria include:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The conditions must be fulfilled that the action and/or statement is kufr and entails kufr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. It is necessary to check if there exist certain impediments that prevent the imputing of kufr on this particular person.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Actions and/or statements of kufr can be declared in general as such, however making them applicable on a specific person requires fulfilling the conditions and removing the impediments pertaining to takfeer. This is such because there may be causes which would prevent from imputing kufr on a particular person.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, it is not left for anyone to indulge in takfeer as this is the right of Allaah, (subhannahu wa ta’ala), and is a very grave matter to the extent that if you impute kufr on a person incorrectly, then the kufr may return on you; this applies to imputing kufr on the common Muslim as well as the rulers. The Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) commanded the Muslim in the authentic hadith: “Say that which is good or stay silent.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this is for general matters, then what about takfeer? Then, by all means, it is necessary to refrain from indulging in this matter and leave it to the grand and reliable scholars of Islaam. They are the ones who can deduce the correct rulings vis-à-vis the kufr of a specific person. Similarly, this is not a matter for even the senior students of knowledge to take part in openly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It seems nowadays that most people have nothing else to do but speak about the hukaam (the leaders) [1] and takfeer, day and night, in dreams and in awakness. If we claim to be on the path of the salaf (the righteous predecessors), then Muslims should not engage themselves in this matter. Regrettably, most common Muslims make analysis of the whole world political affairs and make judgments with ease and little fear of Allaah (subhannahu wa ta’ala). However, none of this is the business of the common Muslim. Their involvement in these matters can only aggravate situations and cause disunity. Some argue that, “Politics is from Islaam; Islaam and politics are the same.” They come through these doors. When you ask them about politics, you will find they read twelve newspapers, watch all the satellite news channels, and sit in countless circles, day and night, analyzing politics and so-called current affairs. This is what they consider as &#8220;politics&#8221;! At the very least, this is counterproductive and not beneficial for the person who will be responsible for every minute of his life, which he is required to fill with what is good and beneficial. The legislative policies in Islaam are the true &#8220;politics.&#8221; And this is not for the common Muslims to deal with, not to mention the &#8220;media&#8221; politics, filled with lies, counter-lies, endless analysis, deceptive statements, emotional speeches, etc. I ask Allaah (subhannahu wa ta’ala) to teach us all that which is beneficial and to save us from all that is evil. Aameen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may Allaah’s salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, and the noble companions and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the Allaah&#8217;s salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, and the noble companions and those who follow their path until the Day of Resurrection. The title <em>fitnah of Takfeer</em>: The Trials and Tribulations associated with imputing kufr (disbelief) on Muslims (rulers or ruled), is one of the most dangerous fitan in our times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This misleading thought has spread amongst many of the youth in the Muslim world, east and west, north and south. Many of these youths are greatly motivated by their emotions and their vigilant care concerning the deen. As such, they took many of that which they received from the followers of desires. These followers of desires have renewed the principles and thoughts of the early <strong>Khawaarij (dissidents)</strong> and have become an extension of them. This has led to declare takfeer on the Islamic societies at large and on all Muslim leaders, without exception. The consequences of this have been very terrible. Blood is being shed.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Definition of Kufr:</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To better understand takfeer, it is necessary to first define kufr. Linguistically, the term kufr means, “<strong>covering and shielding</strong>.” If an object covers something, then that object kafarahu (covered and shielded it). Similarly, it is said that the farmer when he puts the seed in the ground and covers it with soil is a kafir from the linguistic aspect, since he covered the seed with dirt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Islamic meaning, sometimes the word kufr means the major kufr, which takes a person out of the fold of Islaam. Kufr could also refer to the lesser type, which does not take a person from the fold of Islaam, known as al-kufr al-asghar. <span style="color:#993300;">Islamically, the kafir is called a kafir because he covered and shielded the favor of Allaah (subhannahu wa ta’ala).</span> Therefore, the kafir did not recognize the favor of Allaah upon him and did not give thanks to Allaah. Rather, he denied the favor of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahlus-Sunnah (adherents to the Sunnah) is on the medium course, with respect to all fundamental matters in Islaam. They are between the two extremes, the excessive ones who exceeded the limits and the negligent ones. Allaah described this in Noble Qur’an (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;">Thus, we have made you a just nation</span>» Surah al-Baqarah (2:143)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, regarding the matter of takfeer, Ahlus-Sunnah is on a medium course between extremism and negligence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The kafir is of two types. The first type is <strong>al-kafir al-aslee</strong> (the orginal kafir). This includes all of those who are not Muslims including the Christians and the Jews. <span style="color:#ff0000;">Anyone who doubts the kufr of al-kafir al-aslee is himself a kafir</span>. The second type is the <strong>apostate</strong> who was born to two Muslim parents, who in the stage of adulthood rejected Islaam, either by speech or by action.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Views of Ahlus-Sunnah and the Different Sects Regarding Takfeer:</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people are divided into three categories regarding takfeer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first category is <strong>al- Khawaarij</strong>. They impute kufr on the Muslim due to major sins; with some have gone to the extent to impute kufr on the Muslim due to minor sins. Similarly, they impute kufr on any Muslim who does not believe the same as them. As such, they have made the blood and wealth of most Muslims permissible. This group has an extension in our time and exists in many parts of the Muslim world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second group is <strong>al-Murji’ah</strong>. They claim that eeman (faith) is not affected by any sinful act, even if the Muslim commits a major sin. They say all Muslims are believers, and nothing affects faith. Although the beliefs of al-Murji’ah comprise different positions, this is an overall summary of their views.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ahlus-Sunnah</strong> are on a medium course between the two extremes. They don’t rush to impute kufr on the Muslim while not refraining from imputing kufr on him if the person commits that which Allaah and/or His Messenger declared to be kufr. However, they note, “<span style="color:#993300;"><em>The Muslim who may say or do that which is considered kufr should not have kufr imputed on him specifically until the evidence is established on him, with all the conditions of imputing kufr fulfilled and all the impediments removed.”</em></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Important Matters Regarding Takfeer</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>, before takfeer can be established, <span style="color:#993300;">all conditions must be fulfilled and all impediments removed.</span> From the conditions of making takfeer are: knowledge, choice, intent, deliberate action or saying of kufr, and its acceptance. This implies determining whether the person knows his action is kufr, and he has chosen it, without being compelled. Moreover, it must be shown that the person was deliberate in his action and is content with it. From the impediments of takfeer are: affirmation of an error, ignorance, compulsion, and misinterpretation. Ahlus-Sunnah checks into both the impediments and conditions before imputing kufr on a specific person.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <strong>second</strong> important matter is that imputing kufr on someone is an extremely dangerous matter. <span style="color:#993300;">No one should indulge in takfeer, except those who are firmly established in knowledge and fulfill certain criterion</span>. This arises from the fact that takfeer is the right of Allaah and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم:sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam). Therefore, it can only be established by those who are the inheritors of the Prophets, the ulama (scholars) who make clear the ruling of Allaah and His Messenger; they are the only ones qualified. Anyone else who involves himself in takfeer is on a dark path of transgression and claims for himself a special right with Allaah. Hence, it is not permissible to make takfeer on anyone expect the one whom Allaah and His Messenger declared to be as such. Due to the seriousness of takfeer and its limits as established by Allaah and His Messenger, Shaykhul Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah, rahimahullah, stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;That is why the people of knowledge and Sunnah did not resort to making takfeer on those who opposed them, even if the opponent makes takfeer on them. This is because the matter of kufr is a legal right established by shariah, and therefore, the person can not punish by the like, just like if someone who belies you and makes lies against you, you can not spread lies about him, or if someone fornicates with members of your family, you can not fornicate with members of his family. This is because fornication and lying are haraam (unlawful) being <strong>Allaah&#8217;s right</strong>. Similarly, takfeer is a right that belongs to Allaah. Hence we do not impute kufr except on whom Allaah and His Messenger declared as such.&#8221;</span> [Ar-Rad &#8216;Alal Bakari, v. 3, p. 381].</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The danger involved with takfeer is not limited to the transgression against the right of Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’ala). The person who imputes kufr on the others also risks falling into that which he accused his brother with. This is in line with the hadith of the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallaam),</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Any person who calls his brother, ‘Ya Kafir (Oh Unbeliever), has in fact done an act through which this unbelief would return to one of them. If it were so as he asserted, then the kufr of the man was confirmed, but if it was untrue, it returns to him (the one who labeled it on his Muslim brother).&#8221;</span> [Reported by Muslim and At- Tirmithi.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, in another narration, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;If somebody accuses another of Fusuq (by calling him &#8216;Fasiq&#8217; i.e. a wicked person) or accuses him of Kufr, such an accusation will revert to him (i.e. the accuser) if his companion (the accused) is innocent.&#8221;</span> [Bukhari].</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <strong>third</strong> important matter is that <span style="color:#993300;">takfeer causes hate amongst people</span>, especially amongst those who are referred to as kafir since no one likes to be labeled as a kafir. In fact, this can lead to fights and bloodshed, which will inflict evil on the individuals involved and the society at large.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah, rahimahullah, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;And it is not the right of anyone to impute kufr on anyone of the Muslims even if he errs and does wrong until evidence is established upon him and the matter is made clear to him. And the one whose Islaam is affirmed with certainty then it ceases not to exist with him due to doubt. Rather his (state) of Islaam comes to an end only after the establishment of the proof and the elimination of the unclarity.&#8221;</span> [Majmoo&#8217; al-Fataawa, v. 12, p. 501]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Takfeer Practiced in Our Times:</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>, a type of takfeer practiced in our time is the <span style="color:#ff0000;">unrestricted takfeer on the Muslim rulers</span> who do not rule by the rule of Allaah. This generalization, without details, has led many of the young Muslims to conclude that it is permissible to rebel against these rulers by force. Consequently confrontations, bloodshed and other problems arising from this are still growing. Moreover, it is bringing chaos and instability to the Muslim world as it is evident to everyone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, this thought did not stop at the rulers but has been extended to the government employees, security forces, and others. It has also reached many imams of masajid (mosques), muadhineen (those who give adhan), and scholars. This arises from the pretext that these are all collaborators with the government.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This pretext has even been extended to the Muslim society at large. Those who do not hold to the belief of these groups are considered kafir. This is not an issue in a vacuum; this is real. As such, one is not surprised as to why they kill Muslims or bomb places where there are many Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has reached the extent that these groups have called for the complete disassociation from their societies, thinking that all of the society is kafir so they can not stay with them. They even abandon their wives if they do not adhere to the same belief as the person holding the takfeer principle; similarly, if a wife holds this takfeer principle, they say it is incumbent upon her to leave her husband if he does not agree with that. Furthermore, they tell their followers not to make the congregation prayers in the mosques claiming these are not real mosques, and that the imams of these mosques are not Muslims since they were assigned by the government. This is happening in some Muslim countries.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Solution:</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The solution to this problem is to <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>spread the knowledge of the righteous predecessors, alilm ash-shari’ saheeh (the correct knowledge of Islaam)</strong></span>. This comes from the knowledge taught by the reliable scholars and the books of the salaf. The young should return to the ulama to seek their advice instead of following these so-called thinkers and their takfeeri books. All of those who write advocating this methodology are not even known for being from the true ulama holding to the path of the salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, Muslim societies and governments should take the <strong>corrective approach</strong> of adhering to the shar&#8217;eeah. Once this is done for the sake of Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’ala), then the promise of Allaah to bestow strength and steadfastness upon the ummah will surely be manifested.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, there should always be a <strong>hand extended to our youth who may have influenced by takfeer</strong>. There should be useful discussions in this matter and a refuting of the views held by them based on evidences and proofs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If there is anything we need to emphasize every now and then, whether regarding this matter or the understanding of Islaam as a whole, it is that people should be very serious about knowing Islaam from its two sources, the Qur’an and the way of the Rasool Allaah (Messenger of Allaah) in accordance with the understanding of the companions. This is the criteria of safety; this is the path that every Muslim should give his utmost effort to learn; this is the true safeguard mechanism for the individual and thus for the family and the society at large.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">And Advice to the Youth:</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally, we all know that emotions are real, and care for Islaam is a strong motivation to its adherents. The motivation by care, sincerity, and emotion if not guided by the following of the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) in accordance with the way of the salaf, then it can turn into a blazing fire of destruction. Hence, a sincere advice is stressed again for all of our youth: seek knowledge from its reliable sources and from the ulama who are on the path of the companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah the most High guide us and our Muslim youth to be on the path of righteousness and wisdom, and may Allaah, the Most High, safe guide this ummah from the fitnah of takfeer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The slave of Allaah, Saleh As-Saleh.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Rebelling with the Sword and Performing <em>Takfeer</em>Due to Major Sins<br />
Taken from ‘Al-Kabair’ The Major Sins<br />
By Imaam ad-Dhahabi<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p><strong>The Major Sin – Forty-Nine</strong></p>
<p>Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> said:</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;<strong>… but transgress not the limits. Truly, Allaah does not like the transgressors.</strong> &gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah: 190]</p>
<p>Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> said:</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; <strong>And whoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger, he has indeed strayed in clear misguidance.</strong> &gt;&gt; [Ahzaab: 36]</p>
<p><strong>316-</strong> The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: “Whoever says to his Muslim brother, O <em>Kafir</em> (disbeliever)!’ Then verily it returns to one of them.”[1]</p>
<p>There are many narrations which describe the Khawarij, and the people differed in performing <em>Takfeer</em> (taking people out of the fold of Islaam) upon them, since the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said about them:  “they will go out from (leave) their religion as an arrow goes out of the game. So, where-ever you find them, kill them.“[2]</p>
<p><strong>318 &#8211;</strong> The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said about them: “They are the most evil of those killed under the sky, and the best person killed is the one who is killed by them.”[3]</p>
<p>So the Khawarij are the people of <em>Bida’</em>, they make it <em>Halaal</em> to take the blood of people, and they perform <em>Takfeer</em>. They performed<em>Takfeer</em> upon ‘Uthmaan and ‘Alee and of a group from the pre-eminent Companions- may Allaah be pleased with all of them.</p>
<p><strong>319</strong>&#8211; Ishaaq al-Azzraq, on the authority of al-‘Amash, on the authority of Ibn Abu ‘Awfaa <em>&#8211; radiAllaah anhu-</em> who said:</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> say: The Khawaarij are the dogs of the Hell-fire.[4]</p>
<p><strong>320-</strong> Hashraj bin Nubaatata, said Sa’eed bin Jumhaan narrated to me that he said: I entered upon Ibn Abu ‘Awfaa and he was blind, and he said: who are you?</p>
<p>I said: Sa’eed bin Jumhaan.</p>
<p>He said: What happened to your father?</p>
<p>I said: The al-Azzariqa (who are a sect from the Khawarij) killed him.</p>
<p>He said: May Allaah kill the al-Azzariqa! Then he said: The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> narrated to us that they are the dogs of the hell fire.</p>
<p>I asked: only the al-Azzariqa?</p>
<p>He said: All the Khawarij.[5]</p>
<p><strong>321-</strong> Hammad bin Salama said: Abu Hafs narrated to us, that he heard Abdullah bin Abu ‘Awfaa say while they were fighting the Khawarij: I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> say: “<em>Tooba </em>(a tree in paradise) for the one who kills them and is killed by them.”[6]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Imaam Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi&#8217;ee<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of the small treatise titled <b><i>“Hiwaar ma’a Jamaa’at at-Takfeer”</i></b> (A Debate with the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer) by Imaam Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi’ee, may Allaah have mercy on him. The source used for this e-book was the treatise that is found within Imaam Muqbil’s book Fadaa’ih wa Nasaa’ih (pg. 168-186) [Dar-ul-Haramain: 1st Edition; 1999]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this treatise, Imaam Muqbil refutes the false concepts of the Takfeeri Jamaa’at, a group that was founded in Egypt by a man named Shukree Mustafaa, and which later spread to other Muslim countries. Their beliefs revolve around declaring Muslims to be disbelievers, hence the name Jamaa’at at-Takfeer, declaring the leaders infidels and actively calling the people to revolt against the Muslim governments and anyone that supports them. Even though Mustafaa was executed in 1978, the false concepts of his group have still managed to creep into the hearts of many Muslims today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This treatise is especially important, since it deals with the beliefs of those who in recent times call to rebellion, revolution, terrorism and those who seek to spread instability in the Muslim lands as well as throughout the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The best remedy for them is to seek knowledge. As for one of them remaining ignorant and not knowing anything about the Arabic language, and then he says: ‘We are men and the Companions are (also) men’, then yes, you are men and the Companions, too, are men. However, the difference between you and the Companions is like the difference between the heavens and the earth.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Who is it that the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer preys on? They prey on those individuals who have enthusiasm and zeal for their Religion based on ignorance. The founder of the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer, which has appeared during these recent times, was Shukree Mustafaa Al-Misree, who used to be part of the Bankrupt Brotherhood (Ikhwaan-ul-Muslimeen). Then he experienced great trials in prison and was hardened along with a group of individuals. The governments (at that time) strove hard to disunite the Muslims. So this group would call themselves the Jamaa’at-ul-Hijrah (The Party of Withdrawal). This Shukree Mustafaa used to have some knowledge and he would challenge the faculty of the Azhar University to debate with him, but the Azharees would be afraid due to two reasons: <b>First:</b> All that many of them had to offer was a scanty portion of knowledge of Hadeeth and knowledge of the Book and the Sunnah. So they were either only strong in their knowledge of Grammar or their knowledge of Fiqh. <b>Second:</b> They feared that if they beat him, he and his group (Jamaa’at) would come to them at night and kill them. As a result of this, the group grew and spread. So it originated in the Jamaal ‘Abdun-Naasir Prison and then spread to Sudan and to the lands of the Sacred Precincts (Makkah and Madeenah), inconspicuously, and to Yemen, openly. Jamaa’at Ansaar-us-Sunnah rose against them in Sudan after we said that there were some individuals from the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer amongst them. So they feared that people would hear this speech and therefore not support them anymore.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So the one who these Takfeeris prey on is the individual who has lots of zeal for the Religion based on ignorance. I challenge all of them – the Egyptians, Sudanese, Yemenis, Kuwaitis and Algerians among them to bring forth one scholar from amongst them. And they claim that they strive hard to have a scholar amongst their ranks! We seek refuge in Allaah from any scholar agreeing with your Da’wah, for he would then be one of the dogs of the Hellfire on the Day of Judgement, and he would shoot out from the Religion just as an arrow shoots out from the hunted game.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is how Ahlus-Sunnah is, may Allaah preserve them – they are the ones who confront the people of falsehood, such as the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer. Don’t think that I am condoning the other groups, for I consider them to be the product of ignorance and calamities caused by the enemies of Islaam in order to split up the ranks of the Muslims. So I say to the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer: You must repent to Allaah and ask the people of knowledge (when you are unaware of matters), as Allaah says in His Noble Book: <b>‘So ask the People of the Reminder if you don’t know.’</b> [Surah An-Nahl: 43] This is since if you were to ask one of them what’s your proof on raising the hands in prayer, you would find him saying: ‘I don’t know.’ Or if you were to ask him what’s your proof for prostrating on the seven limbs, he would reply: ‘I don’t know.’ But yet after all that, he puts himself in charge of declaring Muslims to be disbelievers! So take things easy, you small ignoramus! How can you put yourself in charge of declaring Muslims to be disbelievers?? By doing this, you would be assisting the Communists, the Ba’athees, the Naasirees and the governments, rather, the enemies of Islaam, in splitting up the ranks of the Muslims. Then you would just dwindle away (and be forgotten) like Shabeeb, Naafi’ bin al-Araq, ‘Imraan bin Hattaan and other heads of the Khawaarij. So the ignorant ones melt way, but the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger remains and continues.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Foreword by the translator</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, Lord of all the worlds, May His prayers and blessings be upon the final Prophet Muhammad, his Family, his Companions and all those who follow his way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From amongst the greatest blessings of Allaah Ta&#8217;aala upon this Ummah is that He has placed wisdom in the hearts of the people of knowledge. Just as one of the Salaf said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever has many Aathaar (narrations), then he speaks with wisdom.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from amongst the people of knowledge of our time was the great Muhadith, Faqih, Allaama ash-Shaykh Muhammad Nasir ud-Deen al-Albaani – May Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This book is an amended transcript of one of the many, many sittings with the illustrious Shaykh, where he was asked about the issue of Takfeer. The sitting took place in Jordan. The transcript was amended by the Shaykh to make it suitable for print.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask our Lord Azza wa Jal to make this work a beacon of light, illuminating the path for those who have lost the way. We also ask Him to reward our noble Shaykh al-Albaani and place him in the hereafter among the ranks of the Prophets, the truthful, the martyrs, and the righteous, and they are the best of companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Abbas Abu Yahya</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To Proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed all Praise belongs to Allaah, we praise Him, we seek His aid, and we seek His forgiveness. We seek refuge in Him from the evil of our selves, and the evil of our actions. Whom ever Allaah guides, there is none to misguide him, and who ever Allaah leaves astray then there is none that can guide him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah Azza wa Jal, Alone without any partner, and I testify that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the issue of Takfeer generally, is not only for the rulers, but it is also for the ruled. It is an old and extensive fitnah that was germinated by a sect from the Islaamic sects of old who were known as the khawaarij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is with great sadness that – some of the callers to the Deen or those who are too enthusiastic &#8211; have fallen outside the realm of the Book and the Sunnah! But in the name of the Book and the Sunnah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason for this goes back to two points:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first reason is them being shallow in knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second reason is &#8211; and this point is very important &#8211; that they never understood the regulations of the Sharia&#8217;. The Sharia&#8217; is the foundation of the Authentic Islaamic Dawah. All those who are outside the Authentic Islaamic Dawah are regarded as being from the deviated sects away from the Jamaa’aah which the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; praised in more than one hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding this Jamaa’aah which even our Lord Azza wa Jal mentioned, and explained that whomsoever went outside this Jamaa’aah has indeed broken away from Allaah and His Messenger. That is the saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And whosoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been clearly shown to him and follows other than the path of the believers. We shall keep him in the path he has chosen and burn him in Hell – what an evil destination.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So indeed Allaah Ta’ala, in a matter, that has a very clear command according to the people of knowledge – did not summarize His statement by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And whosoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been clearly shown to him . . . We shall keep him in the path&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The clearest evidence here is that Allaah associated contradicting and opposing the Messenger with following a way other than the believers&#8217; path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And whosoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been clearly shown to him and follows other than the path of the believers. We shall keep him in the path he has chosen and burn him in Hell – what an evil destination.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Principle of Understanding the Book &amp; the Sunnah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, following or not following the path of the Believers is a very important matter in relation to complying or denying that path. So whosoever follows the path of the Believers, then he is successful with the Lord of the worlds and whosoever differs from the path of the Believers, then Hell is sufficient for him – and what an evil destination.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this point, numerous groups, old and new deviated because they never sufficed themselves to adhering to the path of the Believers. Instead, they rode on their own intelligence. Instead, they followed their own desires in trying to understand the Book and the Sunnah. Then they built upon their desires, their very dangerous results, and with that they left what the Salaf-As-Saalih – may Allaah be pleased with all of them- were upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; emphasized this section of the noble Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;follows other than the path of the believers&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; emphasized it by using an eloquent emphasis, in more than just one authentic prophetic ahadeeth. These ahadeeth, which I will indicate to and mention some of, are known amongst the general Muslims, let alone the scholars of the Muslims. But what is unknown about these ahadeeth, is that they direct one towards the obligation and necessity of adhering to the path of the Believers in their understanding of the Book and Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This point has been forgotten – and its importance and its necessity have been forgotten by many of the specific people, not to speak of those who have become known – in these modern times &#8211; as &#8216;Jama’at Al- Takfeer &#8216;! Or by some of those kinds of groups who ascribe themselves to Jihaad, whereas in reality they are the scattered, defeated remnants of Takfeer! !</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From amongst these types of people, there may be some who may very well in the depths of their hearts be righteous and sincere people. However, this alone is not sufficient for its possessor to be successful and for one to prosper with Allaah Azza wa Jal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this it is necessary for the Muslim to combine two points:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">•Having truthful sincerity in ones intention, with Allaah Azza wa Jal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">•Following correctly what the Prophet &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; was upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not only sufficient for a Muslim to be sincere and serious in respect to acting with the Book and the Sunnah and calling towards it. But, in addition to this, his methodology should be correct, good and upright; and his methodology cannot be complete in itself except by following what the righteous Salaf of this Ummah were upon – may Allaah be pleased with them all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From these well known and established ahadeeth &#8211; that build a foundation for what I have said – as I indicated previously it is the hadeeth of the 73 sects, and it is none other than the saying of the Messenger &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Jews had split up in to 71 sects and the Christians had split up into 72 sects, and my nation will split up into 73 sects all of whom will be in the fire except one. The Companions asked, ‘Which one O Messenger of Allaah?’ He replied: The Jamaa’aah.” In another narration: “What I am upon and my Companions are upon.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we find the Prophet&#8217;s answer, agreeing perfectly with the previous Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Follows other than the path of the Believers&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, those who primarily enter into the generality of this Ayah are: the Companions of the Messenger &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, since the Messenger &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; was not content in this hadeeth with just saying: “What I am upon…..”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps this would actually be sufficient for the Muslim who truly understands the Book and the Sunnah. But he &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – adapted practically Allaah’s saying, when Allaah characterized His Prophet that he was:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;For the Believers he is full of pity, kindness, and mercy&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is from his &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – perfect kindness and his complete mercy for his Companions and his followers, that he &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – clearly illustrated for them the distinction of the saved sect. Which implies that the are people and companions of the saved sect are upon what the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – was also upon, and what his Companions were upon after him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is not allowed – for the Muslims generally and the callers to Islaam specifically &#8211; to be content with just understanding the Book and Sunnah using the means of understanding which are well known. Such as knowledge of the Arabic language, the knowledge of abrogated and abrogative texts and other such rules. But it is necessary, primarily to return in all of this back to what the Companions of the Prophet &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -were upon, because they were – which is clear from their traditions and their biographies – the most sincere to Allaah Azza wa Jal in worship. They had more of an understanding of the Book and the Sunnah than us, and many other praise worthy characteristics with which they were shaped, and cultivated with its exquisite manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What resembles this hadeeth perfectly – in respect to its fruits and benefits &#8211; is the hadeeth of the Rightly Guided Khulafaah, which is narrated in the books of as-Sunnan from the narration of al-Irbaad bin Saireeyah &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with him. He said that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -gave us an admonition which caused hearts to tremble, and eyes to shed tears.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we said, “It is as if this is a farewell speech, so advise us O Messenger of Allaah!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: “I advise you to hear and obey, even if an African slave rules over you, and indeed whomsoever from you lives will see many differences, so hold on to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Khulafaah after me, bite on to it with your molar teeth……………….” To the end of the hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof from this hadeeth is also the same evidence from the answer of the Messenger &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -about the previous question (about the 73 sects). In as much as he compelled his nation to follow the characteristics of his Companions due to their adherence to his Sunnah, and he did not limit it to just that, but rather he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“……And the Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Khulafaah after me.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is necessary for us – and this being our situation &#8211; to constantly repeat always and forever this fundamental principle. If we intend to understand our Aqeedah, understand our worship, and understand our manners and behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is necessary for us to return to our Salaf-us-Saalih to understand all these matters, which are necessary for a Muslim, so that he can actualize in himself &#8211; with sincerity – that he is from the Saved Sect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this point many of the sects of old and new have deviated, when they did not pay heed to the evidence in the previous Ayah, and to the significance of the hadeeth of the Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Khulafaah, and likewise the hadeeth of the splitting of the Ummah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it was completely natural that they deviated like those who deviated previously from the Book of Allaah, and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; and the manhaj of the Salaf-us-Saalih.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From those who deviated were the Khawaarij of old and of recent times!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the foundation of the fitnah of Takfeer in this era &#8211; rather, since a long time &#8211; is surrounding the Ayah, which they themselves always keep mentioning, which is none other than His Ta&#8217;alaa saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And whosoever does not judge with what Allaah has revealed are the kuffaar&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they take this Ayah without a deep understanding, and they present it without detailed knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We know that this noble Ayah has been repeated and ends with three different wordings:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;so they are kuffaar&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;so they are oppressors&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;so they are transgressors/sinners&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is from complete ignorance that those who reason with just this Ayah with its first wording which is : &#8220;so they are kuffaar&#8221; that they have not become acquainted with – at the very least &#8211; with some of the other texts of the Sharia&#8217;, whether from the Qur&#8217;aan or the Sunnah, in which the word (al-kufr ) is mentioned. Instead they have taken it – without any understanding to mean exiting from the Deen, and that there is no difference between the one who fell into kufr, and between those mushrikeen from the Jews and the Christians and followers of the other faiths outside the faith of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whereas the word al-kufr in the language of the Book and the Sunnah does not – always &#8211; carry this meaning, which they constantly repeat, and attempt to impose their wrong and erroneous understanding.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The matter of this word (al-kufr ) whereas it does not direct to one meaning, is also the matter of the other two words &#8220;the oppressors&#8221; and &#8220;the transgressors/sinners&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just like the one who is characterized as an oppressor or sinner does not necessarily mean that he is someone who has apostated from the Deen, so the same goes for the one characterized that he is a kaafir, that it does not necessarily mean that he is someone who has apostated from the Deen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This diversity in the meaning of one word, that is indicated by the language, and the Sharia&#8217; came with the Arabic language; the language of the Noble Qur’aan. Due to this, it is obligatory on those who want to issue judgment on the Muslims; &#8211; regardless if it is the ruler or the ruled &#8211; that they be upon knowledge of the Book and Sunnah and in the light of the Salaf Saalih.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not possible to understand the Book and the Sunnah – and also what is contained within it- except with the path of the Arabic language and its literature, knowing it specifically and precisely. If the student of knowledge has a deficiency in the understanding of the language, what will help him in rectifying this deficiency is returning to the understanding of the scholars before him. Especially if they are the people from the first three generations that have been certified with goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A Kufr less than Kufr</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now we return to this Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;and whosoever does not judge with what Allaah has revealed so they are the kaafiroon.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is the intent of the word (al-kufr ) here? Does it take one outside of the Muslim Ummah or does it mean something else?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: It is necessary to have precision in understanding this Ayah. The Ayah could mean the kufr of action and that is leaving off some of the actions from the rulings of Islaam. In addition, what helps us in this understanding is the scholar of the Ummah and the interpreter of the Qur’aan, Abdullah bin Abbas -may Allaah be pleased with him. He was from the Companions that all Muslims are in agreement – except those who are from the deviant sects – that he is an Imaam in tafseer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is as if he heard in those days, the likes of what we hear today exactly, that there are people who understand the Aayaat on its apparent meaning without its explanation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abbas &#8211; may Allaah be please with him &#8211; said: “It is not the kufr which you understand to mean, indeed it is not the kufr which takes you outside the fold of the Ummah, it is a kufr less than kufr.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps he means the khawaarij &#8211; who rebelled against, the Ameer ul-Mumineen Ali &#8211; may Allaah be please with him – and as a result of that they spilled the blood of the Believers, and they did to the Believers what is not done even by the Mushrikeen. Ibn Abbas said: “The matter is not like what they have said or what they presume but indeed it is a kufr less than kufr.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the clear, precise answer from the explainer of the Qur’aan. The explanation of the Ayah, from which it is not possible to have an understanding other than this (i.e. kufr less than kufr) from the texts of the Qur’aan and the Sunnah, this is what we indicated towards previously in the beginning of this speech.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the word al-kufr, which is mentioned in many Quraanic texts and ahadeeth, is not possible to explain – regarding all these texts &#8211; that the meaning is equal to exiting outside of the Ummah. Like this is the example of the well-known hadeeth which is in the two authentic books of hadeeth (Saheeh Bukhari and Saheeh Muslim) on the authority of Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ood -may Allaah be pleased with him &#8211; said that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Cursing a Muslim is fassooq (sinful) and killing him is kufr.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the kufr mentioned here is sinning and it is disobedience, and the Messenger &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – who is regarded as the most eloquent in expression &#8211; was intense in expressing rebuke, and he said: “…….. and killing him is kufr.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From another angle we can question, is it possible for us to understand from the first section of this hadeeth – “Cursing a Muslim is fassooq…………” with the same word fisq (sin) which is mentioned in the previous Ayah with the third wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whosoever does not judge with what Allaah has revealed so those are the fasiqoon&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer is; it could mean that the word fisq also corresponds in its meaning to the word kufr which means going out of the Ummah. It could be that the word fisq also corresponds in meaning to the word kufr which does not mean going out of the Ummah, but indeed it means just what the explainer of the Qur’aan said: It is the kufr lesser than kufr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth emphasizes that the kufr here could be with this meaning; because Allaah Azza wa Jaal mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And if two parties among the believers fall into fighting, then make peace between them both, but if one of them rebels against the other, then fight against the one that which rebels till it complies with the command of Allaah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed here our Lord has mentioned the rebel sect which fights the truthful believing sect, and along with this Allaah did not judge upon the rebel sect that they were kuffar, even though the hadeeth says: “. . . killing him is kufr.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore killing him is a kufr lesser than kufr, exactly like Ibn Abbas said in the explanation of the previous Ayah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Muslim killing a Muslim is oppression and aggression against him, and evil and kufr, but this meaning of kufr, could be kufr of action, and perhaps could be kufr of belief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From here comes the precise detailed exposition whose explanation and commentary was given by the Imaam in truth, the Shaykh of Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him &#8211; and then after him his devoted student Ibn Qayeem al-Jawzeeyah who took on this responsibility.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since they were blessed in making aware and explaining the division of kufr into these two divisions, whose banner was raised by the explainer of the Qur’aan with those concise and complete words. Ibn Taymeeyah &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him- and his student and companion Ibn al-Qayeem always repeatedly mentioned the necessity of distinguishing between the kufr of action and kufr of belief. Otherwise the Muslim would fall into, without knowing, the fitnah of rebelling against the community of Muslims, into which fell the khawaarij of old and some of their adherents of today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The summary of this is: indeed his &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; saying, “… killing him is kufr” does not mean, &#8211; in absolute terms &#8211; going out of the Ummah. There are many hadeeth regarding this. All these hadeeeth are irrefutable evidence upon those who only hold their own deficient understanding of this previous Ayah, and cling to the explanation that this is kufr of belief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For now, this hadeeth is sufficient for us, because it is a definitive proof that a Muslim killing his brother Muslim is kufr with the meaning: kufr of action and it is not the kufr of belief!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now, if we return to the &#8216;Jamaat al- Takfeer &#8216; – or to those who branched off from them &#8211; and their accusation of the rulers and of those who live under their custody, and those who live under their leadership and those appointed by them, of kufr and apostasy!! Then this is built upon their evil view, which is they say: that these people have perpetrated a sin, so they have become kuffar because of that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Relationship between Takfeer &amp; Rebellion</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the general matters which are beneficial to mention and narrate: I met some of those who used to be from Jamaaat al- Takfeer then Allaah Azza wa Jaal guided them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to them: here you call some of the rulers kuffar, so what do you think, for example of making the imams of masaajid kuffar, and those who give the khutbah, and those who give the adhaan in the masaajid, and those who render service to the masaajid?! What do you think about making Takfeer of the teachers of the knowledge of the Sharia&#8217; in schools, and other places, for example?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: they are kuffar because they are pleased with the rule of the rulers who judge without what Allaah has revealed!!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to them: If this &#8216;being pleased&#8217; was in agreement with the heart (i.e. belief), judging without what Allaah has revealed, then the kufr of action is altered to the kufr of belief. So, any ruler, who rules without what Allaah has revealed, and sees and believes that this ruling, is the appropriate ruling to be applied in this time! And that the ruling of the Sharia&#8217; from the text of the Book and Sunnah is not appropriate to be applied, then there is no doubt that this kufr of this ruler is the kufr of belief and is not the kufr of action alone, and whoever is pleased with this, and believes it, then he also falls into the same group.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I said to them: Firstly, it is not possible for you to make a judgment upon every ruler who rules with the western kufr laws or with even some of them, and that if they were questioned about judging with other than what Allaah has revealed?! They would answer; that ruling with these rules is the truth and correct in this time! And it is not allowed to rule with the rules of Islaam!! Otherwise, if they say this, they would – truly- become kuffar without doubt or suspicion!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, if we came down to the people who are ruled, and from amongst them there are the scholars, amongst them are the righteous people etc. So how can you judge upon them with kufr just because you see them living under the rule, which includes them just as it includes you exactly! But you declare them to be kuffar, and apostates and that ruling with what Allaah has revealed is obligatory! Then you make an excuse for yourselves and contradict yourselves: that differing with the judgments of the Sharia&#8217; with mere actions does not deem necessarily the ruling on the one who differs with the Sharia&#8217; that he is an apostate from his Deen!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is exactly what the people other than you are saying, whether you accuse them – wrongly – with the ruling of Takfeer and apostasy!!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from amongst the general discussions which show their mistakes and uncover their deviation, is saying to them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When is a judgment given upon a Muslim that he has apostated from his Deen? A Muslim who testifies that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah, and perhaps he prays.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it sufficient just one time? Or is it obligatory to be announced that he has apostated from the Deen?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They would not know the answer! They will not be guided to the truth!! So we are forced to give them the following example; we say to them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A judge, judges with the Sharia&#8217;; this is his usual practice and this is his system, but in one judgment he misjudged, and gave a judgment against the Sharia&#8217;, i.e. he gave the right to the oppressor and prohibited it from the oppressed, so this is – most certainly &#8211; judging without what Allaah has revealed! So do you say that his kufr is the kufr of apostasy?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They will say: No, because this happened to him one time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We say: What if the same judgment was issued from him a second time or a different judgment in which he also differed with the Sharia&#8217;, so has he committed kufr?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then we repeat this to them: he does this &#8216;three times!&#8217; or &#8216;Four times!&#8217; when do you say that he has committed kufr? It is not possible for them to place a limit on the number of his judgments in which he has gone against the Sharia&#8217;, by which he can be declared a kaafir!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The opposite of this is completely possible if it is known from him that he, in his first judgment deemed it correct to judge without what Allaah has revealed, &#8211; believing it is permissible to do so &#8211; and disapproved of judging with the Sharia&#8217;, then it would be correct to judge him with apostasy, even for this first judgment!<br />
Contrary to this, if we saw several judgments from him in a number of decisions in which he went against the Sharia&#8217;, and if we were to ask him why did you judge without what Allaah has revealed?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would reply saying: I was frightened and afraid for myself! Or I was bribed for example and that is worse than the first example, but along with this, it is not possible to say he is a kaafir until he declares what is in his heart, that he does hold the view of judging without what Allaah Azza wa Jaal has revealed, and only then is it possible to say that he is a kaafir, the kufr of apostasy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A summary of the speech: it is necessary to know that kufr, like fisq(sinning) and oppression is divided into two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Kufr and fisq and oppression which places one outside the Ummah, and all of these return to making it permissible by the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-The other does not place one outside of the Ummah; and all of these return to making it permissible by actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Making Takfeer of Sinners is not Allowed</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So every type of sin and specifically what is widespread in this time from what is regarded as permissible actions, such as interest, illegal sexual relations, drinking alcohol amongst them, all of these are kufr of action. So it is not allowed for us to make Takfeer of the sinners- who have been deceived by some of these sins &#8211; just because they have perpetrated a sin and regarded it as permissible actions for themselves! Except if it becomes apparent to us – with certainty – and it is unveiled with what is in the depths of their ownselves that from their Aqeedah they do not prohibit what Allaah and His Messenger have prohibited. So, if we know they have fallen into this opposition with their hearts, then we can judge that they have committed kufr, the kufr of apostasy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if we don’t know this, then there is no way for us to judge them with kufr, because we fear we will fall into the threat of the saying of his &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; : “If a man says to his brother: ‘Oh kaffir! Indeed it returns to one of them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many ahadeeth mentioned with this meaning. I will mention a hadeeth, which is a great evidence. It is in the story of that Companion who killed one of the mushrikeen .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the mushrik saw that he was about to come under the blow of the sword of the Muslim Companion, he said, “I testify that none is worthy of worship except Allaah!!” The Companion took no interest in that and killed him!! When the news reached the Prophet &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; he disapproved of it severely. The Companion mentioned an excuse that he did not say what he said except from the fear of being killed, but the answer of the Messenger &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; was:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Did you open up his heart?!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore the kufr of belief does not have a fundamental connection with just actions, but it has a connection with the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is not possible for us to know what is in the heart of the faasiq (sinner) or the adulterer or the thief or the one who is a fornicator nor the one who takes interest, etc. Except if he confesses with his tongue what is in his heart. As far as his action is concerned then it is notification that he has opposed the Sharia&#8217;, with a differing of action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, we say: without doubt you have opposed the Sharee&#8217;ah! and indeed you have committed fisq(a sin)! and adulterated! But we do not say: &#8216;Indeed you have become a kaafir and apostated from your Deen&#8217;, until there manifests from him something which will be an excuse for us with Allaah Azza wa Jaal in judging him regarding apostasy and following that comes the well know ruling in Islaam which is none other than the saying of the Messenger &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -:“Whoever changes his Deen then kill him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I said and I continue to say to those who constantly make Takfeer of the Muslim rulers: let’s suppose the kufr of these rulers is the kufr of apostasy! And suppose there was a ruler who was above them, then it would be obligatory – in this situation &#8211; on that higher ruler to implement the Islaamic punishment on them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, how do you benefit yourselves practically if we agree for the sake of argument that all of these rulers are kuffar, and their kufr is the kufr of apostasy?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What can you possibly do and establish?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the Takfeer is say: for the sake of &#8216;al Walaa wa al Baraa&#8217;, loyalty to the believers and disassociation from the kuffar!! Then we reply to them: loyalty and disassociation are connected to friendship and hate – by the heart and by actions -, and it is dependent on capability, therefore it is not conditional that you proclaim Takfeer, and declare apostacy, just because &#8216;al Walaa wa al Baraa&#8217; are present. Rather, friendship and hate could both take place in an innovator, sinner, or an oppressor!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I say to these people, here we have the kuffar, and they have occupied the many lands of Islaam! We are with sadness being trialed with the occupation of Palestine by the Jews. What is possible for us and for you to do about it? Is it important to stand – alone – against those rulers whom you think and claim are kuffar?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If only you had left this issue alone, and started laying down the foundation for the structure, on which the foundations of an Islaamic government stands, which is following the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -, this is how he educated his Companions, and they built from this source its system and its foundation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We mention this a lot, and we emphasize it a lot: that it is necessary for all Muslim organizations to work in truth, in order to bring back the rule of Islaam. Not only in the Islaamic lands, but on the whole earth, and that is the fulfillment of His Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;aala saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It is He who has sent His Messenger with the guidance the Deen of Truth, to make it superior over all other religions even though the Mushrikeen hate it&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What has been mentioned by prophecies in some of the prophetic hadeeth is that this Ayaat will be realized at a later time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For it to be possible for the Muslims to implement this Qur’aanic text and this divine promise, it is necessary to follow an evident path and a clear way. Will this evident path be by announcing a revolution against these rulers of whom it is thought that their kufr is the kufr of apostasy?! Then along with their suspicion, which is wrong and a suspicion which is mistaken, they cannot do anything!!<br />
So what is the methodology? What is the path?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No doubt that the correct path, which is an exemplary path, is what the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; used to constantly talk about and remind his companions about in every khutbah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammed &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam .&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is upon all the Muslims without exception and specifically those who busy themselves with the return of Islaamic rule, that they begin from where the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – began. We have labeled this in two concise words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Purification and Education</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because we know the firmly established reality, which is being neglected or more accurately purposely neglected, by those extremists who do not have anything except that they proclaim Takfeer of the rulers, and then nothing else!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they continue to proclaim Takfeer of the rulers then nothing stems from them, or about them, except discord and strife!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The calamities in these past few years which have been by the hands of these people, beginning from the discord (fitnah) of the Haraam of Makkah to the dissension in Egypt and the killing of Sadaat. Finally, in Syria and now in Egypt and Algeria- a sight that everyone can see; the shedding of the blood of many of the innocent Muslims because of these fitn, tribulations, and the occurrence of many trials and calamities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this because they opposed many of the texts from the Book and the Sunnah and the most important of which is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a good example to follow, for him who hopes in the meeting with Allaah and the Last Day and remembers Allaah much.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we really want to establish the rule of Allaah on the earth – in reality not just in a claim &#8211; then do we start with making Takfeer of the rulers while it is not possible for us to confront them – let alone fighting them &#8211; or do we start – with the obligation &#8211; the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; started with?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that the answer is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a good example to follow……&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But what did the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -begin with?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is known – with certainty &#8211; to anyone who has smelt the fragrance of knowledge that he began with the Daw’ah between individuals whom he thought were ready to accept the truth. Then whoever was ready to respond to him, from the individuals of the noble Companions responded to him &#8211; as it is well known in the prophetic biography. Then the punishment and the severity befell these Muslims in Makkah. After that came the command for the first migration and the second until Allaah Azza wa Jal consolidated Islaam in al-Madeena al-Munnawara. From there began the skirmishes and the opposition. Also, the fighting between the Muslims and the kuffaar on one side and the Jews from the other.……etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore it is necessary for us to begin by teaching the people the true Islaam; like the Messenger &#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; had begun. Now we cannot just confine ourselves to teaching alone, because things have entered into Islaam which are not from it, and has no association with Islaam, from the bida&#8217; and innovations which were the reason for the clear downfall of the lofty status of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of this it is obligatory upon those inviting to Islaam to begin with purification of Islaam from what has entered into it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first principle – “Purification”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second principle – “Education”<br />
The education that is associated with this purification is the education of the young active Muslims on this pure Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we study the reality of the Islaamic groups which have existed, for nearly a generation, and their ideas and the practice of these ideas. We would find that many of them have not benefited themselves, nor have they benefited others with anything that can be remembered! Despite their outcry and noise, that they want an Islaamic government!! Which was a reason of spilling blood of the innocent with this baseless argument!! Without them having realised anything from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We continue to hear from their beliefs which are opposed to the Book and Sunnah and actions which are negated by the Book and Sunnah, let alone them trying, again and again with futile attempts which oppose the Sharia&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally I say: there is a statement which one of the propagators of Islaam said, which I used to hope that his followers would adhere to it and fulfill it, which is: &#8216;Establish the Islaamic state in your heart it will be established for you on the earth.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because If a Muslim corrects his Aqeedah built upon the Book and Sunnah, then there is no doubt that from this he will correct his worship, correct his behavior and his manners etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But, with regret, these fine words have not been acted upon by these people, they persist with an outcry to establish the Islaamic state but without any benefit! and it is said about them – and I swear by Allaah to this &#8211; what the poet said is true:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You hope for success and you do not follow its path<br />
Indeed a ship does not sail on dry land.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps in this what I have mentioned is persuasive enough for every just person, and a termination for every oppressor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We seek Allaah&#8217;s help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tafseer Ibn kathir</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Surah 4: Ayah 94.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O you who believe! When you go (to fight) in the cause of Allah, verify (the truth), and say not to anyone who greets you: &#8220;You are not a believer;&#8221; seeking the perishable goods of the worldly life. There is much more benefit with Allah. Even as he is now, so were you yourselves before, till Allah conferred on you His Favors, therefore, be cautious in discrimination. Allah is Ever Well-Aware of what you do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that `Ikrimah said that Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;A man from Bani Sulaym, who was tending a flock of sheep, passed by some of the Companions of the Prophet and said Salam to them. They said (to each other), `He only said Salam to protect himself from us.&#8217; Then they attacked him and killed him. They brought his sheep to the Prophet , and this Ayah was revealed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O you who believe!), until the end of the Ayah.&#8221; At-Tirmidhi recorded this in his (chapter on) Tafsir, and said, &#8220;This Hadith is Hasan, and it is also reported from Usamah bin Zayd.&#8221; Al-Hakim also recorded it and said, &#8220;Its chain is Sahih, but they did not collect it.&#8221; Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas commented;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and say not to anyone who greets you: &#8220;You are not a believer;&#8221;), &#8220;A man was tending his sheep and the Muslims caught up with him. He said, `As-Salamu `Alaykum.&#8217; However, they killed him and took his sheep. Allah revealed the Ayah;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And say not to anyone who greets you: &#8220;You are not a believer; seeking the perishable goods of the worldly life).&#8221; Ibn `Abbas said; &#8220;The goods of this world were those sheep.&#8221; And he recited,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Peace) Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-Qa`qa` bin Abdullah bin Abi Hadrad narrated that his father `Abdullah bin Abi Hadrad said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah sent us to (the area of) Idam. I rode out with a group of Muslims that included Abu Qatadah, Al-Harith bin Rab`i and Muhallam bin Juthamah bin Qays. We continued on until we reached the area of Idam, where `Amr bin Al-Adbat Al-Ashja`i passed by us on his camel. When he passed by us he said Salam to us, and we did not attack him. Because of some previous problems with him, Muhallam bin Juthamah killed him and took his camel. When we went back to the Messenger of Allah and told him what had happened, a part of the Qur&#8217;an was revealed about us,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O you who believe! When you go (to fight) in the cause of Allah), until,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Well-Aware).&#8221; Only Ahmad recorded this Hadith. Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that the Messenger of Allah said to Al-Miqdad,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(You killed a believing man who hid his faith with disbelieving people, after he had announced his faith to you. Remember that you used to hide your faith in Makkah before.) Al-Bukhari recorded this shorter version without a complete chain of narrators. However a longer version with a connected chain of narrators has also been recorded. Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Bazzar recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah sent a military expedition under the authority of Al-Miqdad bin Al-Aswad and when they reached the designated area, they found the people had dispersed. However, a man with a lot of wealth did not leave and said, `I bear witness that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah.&#8217; Yet, Al-Miqdad killed him, and a man said to him, `You killed a man after he proclaimed: &#8220;There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah. By Allah I will mention what you did to the Prophet .&#8217; When they went back to the Messenger of Allah, they said, `O Messenger of Allah! Al-Miqdad killed a man who testified that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah.&#8217; He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Summon Al-Miqdad before me. O Miqdad! Did you kill a man who proclaimed, &#8220;There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah&#8221; What would you do when you face, &#8220;There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah tomorrow&#8221;) Allah then revealed;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O you who believe! When you go (to fight) in the cause of Allah, verify (the truth), and say not to anyone who greets you: &#8220;You are not a believer;&#8221; seeking the perishable goods of the worldly life. There are much more profits and booties with Allah. Even as he is now, so were you yourselves before till Allah conferred on you His Favors, therefore, be cautious in discrimination). The Messenger of Allah said to Al-Miqdad,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He was a believing man who hid his faith among disbelieving people, and he announced his faith to you, but you killed him, although you used to hide your faith before, in Makkah.)&#8221; Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(There is much more benefit with Allah.) means, better than what you desired of worldly possessions which made you kill the one who greeted you with the Salam and pronounced his faith to you. Yet, you ignored all this and accused him of hypocrisy, to acquire the gains of this life. However, the pure wealth with Allah is far better than what you acquired. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(so were you yourselves before, till Allah conferred on you His Favors.) means, beforehand, you used to be in the same situation like this person who hid his faith from his people. We mentioned the relevant Hadiths above. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And remember when you were few and were reckoned weak in the land). `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Sa`id bin Jubayr commented about Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(so were you yourselves before), &#8220;You used to hide your faith, just as this shepherd hid his faith.&#8221; Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(therefore, be cautious in discrimination), then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah is Ever Well-Aware of what you do.) and this part of the Ayah contains a threat and a warning, as Sa`id bin Jubayr stated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">Shaikhul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said: &#8216;A certain saying may be kufr (disbelief) and so it is declared, unrestrictedly, that the doer is a kafir (disbeliever) and it is said: &#8216;He who says this, then he is a kafir.&#8217; But a particular person who says that is not judged to be a kafir until the proof &#8211; whose denier is a kafir &#8211; is established against him; and this is like the textual threat since Allah says: #&#8221;Verily, those who unjustly eat up the property of orphans, they eat up only fire into their bellies, and they will be burnt in the blazing Fire!&#8221;# [Sura An-Nisa&#8217; 4 :10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this and its like from the textual threats are true, but we do not bear witness that a specific individual will receive that which has been threatened. Therefore, we do not bear witness that any person in particular from the people of the Qiblah will enter the Fire, because that threat may not be carried out on him due to the absence of one of its conditions or the presence of something to prevent it. Perhaps its forbiddance never reached him, and perhaps he will repent from it, or perhaps he has great good deeds sufficient to wipe it out, or perhaps trials befall him which expiate it, or perhaps an acceptable intercessor will intercede on his behalf (on the Day of Resurrection).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, for that who makes the utterances of kufr, it could be possible that the texts which convey the truth did not reach him, or maybe they did, but he did not regard them as authentic or did not understand them. It is also a possibility that he had a doubt for which Allah will excuse him. So if a believer strives to arrive at the truth but makes a mistake, then Allah forgives his mistake whether in matters of belief or action. This is the position of the Companions of the Messenger (sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam) and the great majority of scholars of Islam. [Majmoo` ul-Fatawa (3/345)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Qasimi says, quoting Shaikhul-Islam: &#8216;What is meant is that the position of the scholars is built upon the distinction between the position of action (i.e. it being an action of kufr) and the person in particular (who does the action). Indeed there is no difference reported about this issue from Imam Ahmad or the rest of the scholars of Islam such as: Malik, Abu Hanifah and ash-Shafi`e, that they do not declare the Murji`ah as disbelievers &#8211; those who say that eman (faith) is saying without action, and their texts are replete with the fact that the Khawarij and Qadariyyah and others are not declared to be kafirun (disbelievers).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;When Imam ash-Shafi`e spoke with Hafs al-Fard, one of the heads of the Mu`attilah (deniers of Allah&#8217;s attributes), with regard to the question of the creation or otherwise of the Qur&#8217;an, he (ash-Shafi`e) said to him: &#8216;You have disbelieved in Allah, the Most Great.&#8217; &#8211; declaring him to have done kufr, but he did not judge him to be an apostate because of that. Had he regarded him as an apostate and kafir, he would have hastened to ask for his execution.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;However, a fatwa (religious verdict) was given that the callers to innovation such as Ghulatul-Qadariyya (deniers of pre-destination), al-Ja`d ibn Dirham and Jahm ibn Safwan, the leader of the Jahmiyyah (deniers of Allah&#8217;s names and attributes), and others were to be executed, but people prayed over them and they were buried with Muslims. So their execution was like that of the brigand. This was done in order to put an end to the harm they caused, not due to apostasy, and if they were disbelievers, the Muslims would have treated them as such.&#8217; [Mahasinut-Ta&#8217;wel 5/1313-1314]</p>

<p id="eow-description" style="text-align:center;">Scholar: ´Allâmah ´Abdul-Karîm bin ´Abdillâh al-Khudhayr<br />
Source: khudheir.com/audio/2596, Reference: Darulhadith.com, aFatwa.com</p>
<div id="watch-description-text">
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Question</strong></span>:<strong> Does the one who says that the Qur&#8217;ân is created apostate?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Shaykh al-Khudhayr</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Salaf did Takfîr upon the one who says that the speech of Allâh is created. This however, is Takfîr upon a kind and not upon an individual. It is for example not said that az-Zamakhsharî was a disbeliever because of him being a Mu&#8217;tazilî and Mu&#8217;tazilah say that the Qur&#8217;ân is created. The opinion [that it is created] is nevertheless disbelief. There is a difference between Takfîr upon a kind and attribute and [the Takfîr] upon an individual. To make Takfîr upon an individual, it is required that the conditions are met while the obstacles are removed.</p>
