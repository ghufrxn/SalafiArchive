										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Leaving the Masjid after the Adhan is announced</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second question of Fatwa no. 5133</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the ruling on leaving the Masjid (mosque) after the Adhan (call to Prayer)? Moreover, does the same ruling apply to a person who may be in a room, not used for Salah, within the precincts of the Masjid but when leaving, he passes through the courtyard of the Masjid?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is not permissible to leave the Masjid after hearing the Adhan except to perform Wudu&#8217;, answering the call of nature, or any other necessity. It is reported that Abu Hurayrah  saw a person leaving the Masjid after the Adhan. Upon this he remarked,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>&#8220;This (man) disobeyed Abu Al-Qasim (peace be upon him).&#8221;</strong> </span>Related by Muslim in his Sahih. The same ruling applies for a person who is in a room inside the precincts of the Masjid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[Q] What is the ruling regarding leaving the Masjid after the Adhan has been called?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A] Abu Hurayrah saw a man leave (the Masjid) after the Adhan (had been called) and said (about him):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">As for this (one), then he has gone against (the teachings of) Abul-Qasim (Muhammad, peace be upon him</span>)</strong></span>.(Sahih Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And to go against (the teachings) principally is prohibited. Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any option in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, he has indeed strayed in a plain error.</strong></span> (Quran, 33:36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, because of this, the people having Islamic knowledge have said: <span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Indeed it is not permissible for a person to leave the Masjid after the Adhan (has been called) except for an (Islamically justifiable) reason, such as leaving to make Wudhu or if he wanted to go to answer the call of nature, then he is permitted to leave, even if he misses the prayer</strong></span> as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">There is no prayer if food has been served or for him who needs to answer the call of nature</span></strong>. (Sahih Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if we say that someone is waiting for the prayer and then felt the need to go and answer the call of nature or even to pass wind, since some people (may be in) need of passing wind, then there is no harm if he left and relieved himself (and) then returned. And if he was able to (catch and) join the congregation, then it is a blessing, and if he was unable to do so, then there is no harm in this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth question of Fatwa no. 16874</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q4: <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Is raising the hands upward when supplicating to Allah after the end of Adhan (call to Prayer) an act of Bid`ah (innovation in religion)?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: After repeating Adhan and invoking Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings upon Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), it is recommended to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>O Allah! Lord of this perfect call and of the regular prayer which is going to be established, bestow upon Muhammad Al-Wasilah (the highest position in Paradise) and Al-Fadilah (extra degree of honor) and raise him to Al Maqam Al Mahmud (the best and the highest place in Paradise), which You have promised him</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This statement is authentically reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) on the authority of Jabir ibn `Abdullah Al-Ansary (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) in Sahih Al-Bukhari (may Allah be merciful to him). <strong>However, raising the hands has no mention in the report, so it is an act of Bid`ah.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Source</strong>: Fatwas of the Permanent Committee (<a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaSubjects.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;HajjEntryID=0&amp;HajjEntryName=&amp;RamadanEntryID=0&amp;RamadanEntryName=&amp;NodeID=472&amp;PageID=11801&amp;SectionID=7&amp;SubjectPageTitlesID=12285&amp;MarkIndex=1&amp;0#Raisingthehandsupwardwhensupplicating">alifta.net</a>) &gt; Acts of worship &gt; Salah (Prayer) &gt; Conditions for the validity of Salah &gt; Knowing that the time of a given Salah has commenced as a condition for the validity of Salah &gt; Adhan (call to Prayer) &gt; Saying Du`a&#8217;, Dhikr and performing Nafilah Prayer between Adhan and Iqamah &gt;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following has been taken from Imam Ibn Baz&#8217;s Fatwas of Nur `Ala Al-Darb</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>171- What is the ruling on raising one&#8217;s hands in Du`a&#8217; after Iqamah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: I have noticed that some Muslims, who are about to perform Salah (Prayer), raise their hands and supplicate immediately after the Mu&#8217;adhin (caller to Prayer) finishes the announcement of the Adhan (call to Prayer). This takes place before Takbirat-ul-Ihram (saying: &#8220;Allahu Akbar [Allah is the Greatest]&#8221; upon starting Prayer. Is this practice reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This action has no basis in Shari`ah (Islamic law). Nothing has been reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to supplicate between Iqamah (call to start the Prayer) and the start of Prayer. <strong>He was never reported as having raised his hands at this time</strong>. This should not be done because it is contrary to the Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: What is the proper manner of announcing Adhan (call to Prayer)?<br />
What is your opinion concerning the additions people use after the Adhan?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The proper manner of announcing the Adhan is the way taught by the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) to his followers. Bilal (رضي الله عنه) used to announce the Adhan in the presence of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) till the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) died. He used to announce the Adhan during the Makkan period and at Al-Madinah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Adhan that we announce today which consists of fifteen phrases:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>ٱللهُ أَكْبَر ٱللهُ أَكْبَر<br />
Allah-u-Akbar, Allah-u-Akbar,<br />
Allah-u-Akbar, Allah-u-Akbar</strong><br />
(Allah is the Greatest. Allah is the Greatest.<br />
Allah is the Greatest. Allah is the Greatest);</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا ٱلله, أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا ٱلله<br />
Ashhadu An La Ilaha Illa Allah,<br />
Ashhadu An La Ilaha Illa Allah</strong><br />
(I bear witness that there is no god but Allah.<br />
I bear witness that there is no god but Allah);</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>أَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَسُولُ ٱلله, أَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَسُولُ ٱلله<br />
Ashhadu Anna Muhammad-an Rasul-ul-llah,<br />
Ashhadu Anna Muhammad-an Rasul-ul-llah</strong><br />
(I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.<br />
I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah);</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>حَيَّ عَلَى ٱلصَّلَوَة, حَيَّ عَلَى ٱلصَّلَوَة<br />
Hayy `Ala as-Salah, Hayy `Ala as-Salah</strong><br />
(Come to Prayer. Come to Prayer);</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>حَيَّ عَلَى ٱلْفَلَاح, حَيَّ عَلَى ٱلْفَلَاح<br />
Hayy `Ala al-Falah, Hayy `Ala al-Falah</strong><br />
(Come to success. Come to success);</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>ٱللهُ أَكْبَر, ٱللهُ أَكْبَر<br />
Allah-u-Akbar, Allah-u-Akbar</strong><br />
(Allah is the Greatest. Allah is the Greatest);</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا ٱلله<br />
La ilaha illa Allah</strong><br />
(There is none worthy of worship but Allah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Adhan that Bilal used to announce in the presence of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) till he died.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But in Fajr (Dawn) Prayer, he added:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">ٱلصَّلَوةُ خَيْرٌ مِن النَّوم<br />
<strong>As-Salatu Khayr-un Mina an-Nawm</strong><br />
(Salah is better than sleeping),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">twice after his saying: Hayy `Ala al-Falah (Come to success), and before saying: Allah-u-Akbar (Allah is the Greatest).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for what some people used to add as:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">حَيَّ عَلَى خَيْرٌ الْعَمَل<br />
Hayy `Ala Khayr al-`Amal<br />
(Come to best of deed),</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">or</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">أَشْهَدُ أَنَّ عَلِيًّا وَلِي ٱلله<br />
Ashhadu Anna `Aly-an Waliy-ul-llah<br />
(I bear witness that `Aly is the Waliy of Allah),</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">is an <span style="color:#ff0000;">evil deed and Bid`ah (innovation in religion) introduced by Shi`ah (Shi&#8217;ites)</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible, neither, to offer peace and blessings upon the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) audibly directly after the Adhan. This is a Bid`ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is commendable for a Muslim, after announcing the Adhan, to ask Allah to bestow peace and blessings upon the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). Then say:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">اللَّهُمَّ رَبَّ هَذِهِ الدَّعْوَةِ التَّامَّةِ، وَالصَّلَاةِ الْقَائِمَةِ، آتِ مُحَمَّداً الْوَسِيلَةَ وَالْفَضِيلَةَ، وَابْعَثْهُ مَقَاماً مَحْمُوداً الَّذِي وَعَدْتَهُ</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;O Allah! Lord of this perfect call (perfect by not ascribing partners to You) and of the prayer which is going to be established, give Muhammad the right of intercession and illustriousness, and raise him to the best and the highest place in Paradise which You promised. Surely, You do not renege Your promise.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Doing so is commendable for every Muslim whether male or female after the Adhan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is commendable also for the Mu&#8217;adhin (caller to Prayer), as any other person, to offer peace and blessings upon the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) after announcing Adhan. He should also recite: &#8220;O Allah! Lord of this perfect call and of the regular prayer which is going to be established, give Muhammad the right of intercession and illustriousness, and raise him to the best and the highest place in Paradise that You promised.&#8221; <span style="color:#ff0000;">But he should not say these words in a loud voice like the Adhan</span>. This is because the Adhan ends with saying: La ilaha illa Allah (There is no god but Allah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible for the Mu&#8217;adhin to raise his voice in order to let others to hear and follow him. It was authentically reported that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;When you hear the Mu&#8217;adhin, repeat what he says, then invoke blessings on me, for everyone who invokes blessings on me will receive them tenfold from Allah; then beg from Allah Al-Wasilah for me, which is a rank in Paradise fitting for only one of Allah&#8217;s servants, and I hope that I will be that one. If anyone who asks that I be given the Al-Wasilah, he will be assured of my intercession.&#8221;<strong>  </strong></span>[#01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is was stated by the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). (Related by Muslim in his Sahih book of Hadith on the authority of `Abdullah ibn `Amr ibn Al-`As (رضي الله عنه)).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a Sunnah for both Mu&#8217;adhin and listener, whether male or female, everywhere after announcing the Adhan. All are to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8220;<strong>O Allah, bestow peace and blessings upon Muhammad</strong>!&#8221; or</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8220;<strong>O Allah, bestow peace and blessings upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and Companions</strong>!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">in a tone that differs from the Adhan&#8217;s and in a lower voice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should say: &#8220;O Allah! Lord of this perfect call and of the Prayer which is going to be established, grant Muhammad Al-Wasilah and illustriousness, and raise him to the best and the highest place (in Paradise) that You promised.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was recorded in Al-Bukhari&#8217;s Sahih book of Hadith on the authority of Jabir ibn Abdullah Al-Ansary that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;Whoever says upon hearing the Adhan: &#8216;O Allah, Lord of this perfect call and of the established Prayer (Salah), grant Muhammad the Al-Wasilah and superiority, and raise him up to the praiseworthy position which You have promised&#8217;, <strong>it becomes incumbent upon me to intercede for him on the Day of Resurrection</strong>.&#8221;  </span>[#02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the Hadith reported from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). Al-Bayhaqy reported this addition:  &#8220;You do not break Your promise.&#8221;  with a Hasan chain of narrators. This is what is legally permitted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">As for increasing the Adhan by saying: &#8220;Come to the best deed&#8221;, &#8220;I bear witness that `Aly is the Waliy of Allah&#8221; or any other phrases is an evil deed and Bid`ah (innovation in Islam) that has no basis in Islam as mentioned earlier. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) stated:  &#8220;<span style="color:#808000;">Whoever performs any act for which there is no sanction from our behalf, it is to be rejected</span>.&#8221; [#03] (Related by Muslim in his Sahih book of Hadith on the authority of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her)).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was reported also by Muslim in his Sahih on the authority of Jabir (رضي الله عنه) that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)  used to say during the Friday sermon: &#8220;<span style="color:#808000;">The best speech is embodied in the Book of Allah, and the best of guidance is the guidance given by Muhammad. And the most evil affairs are their innovations and every innovation is misguidance</span>.&#8221; [#04]  There are many Hadiths in this regard. Allah is the One Who grants success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From <a href="http://alifta.net/Fatawa/MoftyDetails.aspx?languagename=en&amp;Type=Mofty&amp;section=tafseer&amp;ID=2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">`Abdul-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz</a> to the honorable brother H. M. Th., may Allah grant him safety! May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you. In respect of your request for Fatwa registered in the Department of the Scholarly Research and Ifta’ (no. 1513), dated (21/4/1407 A.H.), it contains three questions. Here are the answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"> Q3: What is the wisdom behind saying, <span class="f"> </span><strong>لا حَوْلَ وَلا قُوَّةَ إِلا بِالله</strong> &#8220;<strong>La Hawla Wala Quwwata Illla Billah</strong>&#8221;  (There is no might nor power except with Allah) when the Mu`adh-dhin says, <strong> حي على الصلاة</strong> &#8220;<strong>Hayya `Ala Al-Salah</strong> (Come to Salah)&#8221; and  <strong>حي على الفلاح &#8220;Hayya `Ala Al-Falah</strong> (Come to Success)&#8221; taking into consideration that they imply a call to Salah? Is there a Hadith that refers to that?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The wisdom behind that saying is that man is weak by nature. He has no ability to move from a condition to another except with the help of Allah. Even his going to Salah in congregation needs the help and power of Allah. A servant of Allah has no might or power except with Allah. He realizes that he is weak, powerless, and unable to answer this call unless Allah helps him Alone. Therefore, upon hearing that call, he says: &#8220;La Hawla Wala Quwwata Illa Billah&#8221;.</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is authentically reported from `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) as related by Muslim in his Sahih. May Allah grant us all success! May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Mattlab said: I heard a man ask Abdullaah bin ‘Amr did you hear the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> mention them?

The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> came quickly and his breathing had become rapid and his knees had become uncovered and he said: ‘Have glad tidings; your Lord has opened a door from the doors of Heaven, for which the Angels compete with you.Then Allaah says: Look at My slaves, they have just completed the obligatory prayer and they are waiting for the next one.’</p>

Indeed Allaah – <em>Azza wa Jal</em> – has said to you: Verily I have made five prayers obligatory upon your Ummah; whoever fulfils them with its Wudu, its timing and Sujood (prostration) then he has made with it a contract with Me that I will enter him into Paradise due to it. Whoever meets Me and some of it is deficient &#8211; or a word similar to it – then he does not have a contract with Me, if I want I will punish him and if I want I will have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 842</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5- 481 – On the authority of Abu ‘Amama who said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>deliver a sermon in his farewell Hajj saying: ‘Fear Allaah your Lord, pray your five prayers, fast your month, pay the Zakah of your family and obey those in authority over you; you will enter the Paradise of your Lord.’</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 3955</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7- 485 – On the authority of ‘Aeysha on the authority of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said: ‘Make a portion of your prayer in your homes, do not make your homes as graves just as the Jews and the Christians made their homes as graves.Indeed the house in which the Qur’aan is recited will be made apparent to the people of the Heaven justas the stars are made apparent to the people of the earth.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 3112</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8- 488 – On the authority of Samurah bin Jundub, that the Prophet of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Come to the remembrance (prayer) and come close to the Imaam, since a person will continue to be pushed back so much that he will be held back in Paradise even if he does enter it.’</p>

We informed him that in our country we had a temple for worship and we requested from the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> the water which remained and fell from him after performing Wudu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet called for some water, made Wudu and gargled then poured it into the vessel and commanded us saying: ‘Go now, when you reach your country break your temple and sprinkle this water in its place and take it as a place of prayer (Masjid).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: Indeed the place is far away, the weather is severely hot and the water will dry up.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: Pour some of this water into other water as it will not increase it except in goodness.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As we were going, we argued as to who would carry the water container. So, the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> deputed between us, that every man from amongst us would carry it for a day and night. When we reached our country we broke our temple then sprinkled the water in its place, we took it as a Masjid and then called the Adhaan in that place. There was a monk who was a man from a place called Tee’ and when he heard the Adhaan he said: ‘This is a truthful call.’ Then he faced a streamfrom amongst our streams which ran from the top of the valley and we never saw him again.’</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">12- 498 – On the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘If the recitor says Ameen, then say Ameen, since the Angels say Ameen.

<p style="text-align:justify;">13- 503 – On the authority of Abu Huraira who said: the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘If a Muslim goes out to the Masjid, then with every step Allaah writes a good deed for him and He removes a bad deed from him due to that until he comes to his place.’</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Baghawee said: &#8220;&#8221;Abdullaah ibn Saalih, the scribe of al-Layth, was &#8220;sadooq&#8221;, except that some things deserving criticism occurred in his narrations of hadeeth”, therefore al-Boosayree said in &#8220;az-Zawaa·id&#8221; (q. 48/2): &#8220;Its isnaad is weak because of the weakness of `Abdullaah ibn Saalih.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the hadeeth has another weakness, and it is the &#8220;`an`anah&#8221; of Ibn Juraij, and al-Bayhaqee said after it: &#8220;And Yahyaa ibn al-Mutawakkil reported it from Ibn Juraij: from someone who narrated to him from Naafi`. al-Bukhaaree said: And this is more correct.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: So it becomes clear that this chain of narration does not establish proof. However al-Haakim mentioned a witness for it, by way of Ibn Wahb: Ibn Lahee`ah related to me: from `Ubaydullaah ibn Abee Ja`far: from Naafi` &#8211; with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is a &#8220;<em>Saheeh</em>&#8221; <em>isnaad</em>: all its narrators are reliable; and even though there is speech concerning the memory of Ibn Lahee`ah, then this is only the case when the narrator from him is other than one of the `Abdullaahs &#8211; and Ibn Wahb is one of them &#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore the hadeeth becomes &#8220;<em>Saheeh</em>&#8220;, and all praise is for Allaah for His granting the successful attainment of correctness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this hadeeth becomes a clear virtue for the mu·adhdhin who is constant upon his adhaan for the aforementioned period, and it will not be hidden that this has the condition that the person gives the adhaan purely and sincerely seeking the Face of Allaah &#8211; the Most High, not seeking by means of it provision, nor doing it for show or repute, because of the many established proofs in the Book and the Sunnah which show that Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; will not accept actions unless they are done purely and sincerely for Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Refer to the book of &#8220;<em>ar-Riyaa</em>.&#8221; (performing deeds for show) at the beginning of &#8220;<em>at-Targheeb watTarheeb</em>&#8221; of al-Mundhiree.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is established that a man came to Ibn &#8220;Umar and said: &#8220;I love you for Allaah&#8221;s sake.&#8221; He said: &#8220;&#8221;Then bear witness that I hate you for Allaah&#8221;s sake!&#8221;&#8221; He said: &#8220;Why?&#8221; He said: &#8220;&#8221;<strong>Because you sing in your adhaan and you take payment for it!!</strong>&#8220;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; at-Tabaraanee reported it in &#8220;al-Mu&#8221;jamul-Kabeer&#8221; (12/264/13059) and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is truly a cause of sorrow is that this tremendous act of worship, and this visible sign of Islaam, has been turned away from by most scholars of the Muslims in our lands. So you will hardly see a single one of them giving adhaan in a mosque, except as Allaah wishes. Indeed they perhaps shy-away from performing it, whereas you may see them rushing for the position of imaam, indeed disputing over it!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is to Allaah that we raise our complaint about the strangeness of this time.&#8221;&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Read the article Below:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, and the noble companions and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Is the adhan an obligation, and should we face the qiblah when performing it?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The legal meaning of adhan is I&#8217;laam (announcement). The Islamic meaning of it is to worship Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) through a specific announcement, which involves specific remembrances at the time when salaah is due.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The adhan is a collective duty (fard kifaayah); this means that if it is done by someone, then this lifts the duty off the rest due to the hadeeth of Malik ibn al- Huwayrith who narrated that the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;…And when it is time for the prayer then one of you should pronounce the Adhaan (call) for the prayer…&#8221;</strong></span> [see Bukhari vol. 9. no. 352]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The evidence for its obligation upon men is the command of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) to perform it in several ahaadeeth and that he (صلى الله عليه وسلم) continued to do it while traveling as well as in residence. Therefore, the adhaan is a collective duty for those in residence, as well as the traveler.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The adhaan is not an obligation upon women. There is a difference of opinion whether it is permissible for women to perform it. One opinion is that is a Sunnah for them to do the iqamah when they gather for the congregation, without the adhaan, and that there may be a merit in it. This is the saying of our shaykh, Muhammad ibn Saalih al-Uthaimeen (rahimahullaah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the scholars of the past went with the opinion that women performing the adhaan is allowed and recommended, as in one narration from Imam Ahmad (rahimahullaah). In another report, he said: The iqamah is recommended without the adhan. It is also reported that Imam Ahmad disliked women doing them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the etiquettes of the adhaan is to face the qiblah because of the action of Bilal himself (radiya Allaahu &#8216;anhu) when he performed the adhaan. The report was declared hasan by Shaykh al-Albani due to supporting evidences in Irwaa&#8217;ul Ghaleel.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, the Most High, knows best.<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Umdat al-Ahkaam – Hadeeth No.63</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the <em>salaah</em> and <em>salaam</em> be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions, and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abi Sa’eed al-Khudri (<em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu</em>) reported that the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">إِذَا سَمِعْتُمُ النِّدَاءَ فَقُولُوا مِثْلَ ما يَقُولُ الْمُؤَذِّنُ ‏</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">“<span style="color:#008000;">Whenever you hear the adhaan, say what the Mu&#8217;adhdhin is saying</span>.” [01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Benefit: Ruling Concerning Following the Statements of the <em>Mu’adhdhin</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>mu’adhdhin</em> (caller) makes the <em>adhaan</em> for the five prescribed prayers and also on the day of <em>jumu’ah</em>; when he calls, he does so aloud making it inevitable that one must hear his voice in order to respond.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this hadeeth, the instruction of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) “<strong>say what the <em>Mu&#8217;adhdhin</em> is saying</strong>” implies that every statement made by the <em>mu’adhdhin</em> should be repeated verbatim by those that hear it. This covers the entire <em>adhaan</em> excluding two statements, specifically the <em>hayyalatan</em> (i.e. “<em>hayya ‘ala’-salaah</em>” – come for salaah and “<em>hayya ‘ala’-falaah</em>” – come for success), for which the responder says “<em>Laa hawla wa laa quwwata illa billaah</em>” (There is no power or strength except with Allaah); this is the instruction of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) as recorded by Muslim in his Saheeh.[02] Therefore, for all other statements made by the <em>mu’adhdhin</em>, the responder repeats them exactly word for word.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, the responder must make all statements following the <em>mu’adhdhin</em> with his tongue; doing so with one’s heart is insufficient since the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) directed the responder to “<strong>say</strong>”, which in general entails utterance by the tongue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Benefit: Types of Saying</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Saying” is of four types.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) <strong>In the heart</strong> – There are no rulings from <em>sharee’ah</em> that depends on this. That is why there is no effect legally if someone recites the Qur’aan with his heart since it is not a saying. Similarly, if someone says in his heart that his wife is divorced, then this statement is not implemented as it has no effect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, if someone makes an oath not to speak to a specific person and says in his heart “<em>In shaa Allaah</em>”, then this exception is of no benefit to him, and if he talks to that person in the future, then he breaks his oath, which makes the expiation binding upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) <strong>To utter by one’s tongue and moving the lips</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3) <strong>To make one’s self hear</strong> &#8211; There is a difference between the second and the third types of saying since a person may move his tongue without making himself hear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4) <strong>To make others hear him</strong> – This is known as <em>al-jahr</em> (loudness)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a person makes <em>salaah</em> without moving his lips, then this <em>salaah</em> is invalid since he did not actually “say” <em>takbeeratul-ihraam</em>, al-Fatiha, and the rest of the Qur’aan that he recites. However, it is not a condition that he makes himself hear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Benefit: Following the <em>Mu’adhdhin</em> if you can See but not Hear Him</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you see the <em>mu’adhdhin</em> but you are unable to hear him, then you do not repeat after him as the condition is hearing him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Benefit: General Principles When Following the Mu’adhdin</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth indicates that you follow the <em>mu’adhdhin</em> even if there is more than one caller. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said, “<strong>Whenever you hear the <em>adhaan</em></strong>.” Thus, if you hear multiple callers, then you follow them as this is remembrance. The scholars said that this is applicable as long as the person is not in <em>salaah</em> since the praying individual is not called. Similarly, if the person has already prayed, then the generality of the hadeeth implies that it is still applicable to him, making it appropriate that he responds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Benefit: Wisdom of Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a person is responding to the <em>adhaan</em>, he is getting a share of the reward; therefore, Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) gives him a reward even if he is not establishing the worship. Therefore, Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) has enabled the believer to share in rewards through related matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) Although a person may not be making hajj, he is still able to attain specific rewards during that prescribed period. When the hujjaj (pilgrims) make the sacrifice, a person who is not performing hajj may also make a sacrifice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) It is known that during hajj, the pilgrims stay away from certain prohibited things while in ihraam. Likewise, it is prescribed that those who are not doing hajj but still intend to make a sacrifice not cut their hair, nails, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3) In addition, it is legislated that those not performing hajj pray salaat al-‘Eid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Benefit: Accompanying the Adhaan</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The response must be said in a manner accompanying the adhaan</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Benefit: Prerecorded Adhaan</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A recording is simply relating and copying a voice. There is no legal effect to it so no response is required. However, if someone hears the adhaan being broadcast live, then he may follow it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Example: A recording of qur’aan is played from a tape or over the radio, and the reciter comes to a point where sujood at-tilaawah is legislated. The listener does not make sujood as he is not sharing with the reciter in time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Benefit: <em>Mu’adhdhin</em> Following Another <em>Mu’adhdhin</em></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a caller completes the <em>adhaan</em> and hears other <em>mu’adhdhineen</em> (pl. of <em>mu’adhdhin</em>) making <em>adhaan</em>, then he may follow them because he falls under the general wording of the hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Benefit: Following Multiple Callers</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">If someone hears a number of callers, then he follows whoever it is possible to follow, hear, and understand.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">If multiple <em>mu’adhdhineen</em> are the same in this rank, then he follows the one ahead of the others.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">If multiple <em>mu’adhdineen</em> are of the same rank and none is first, then he follows the caller at the masjid he intends to make <em>salaah</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Benefit: Person in Salaah Following the Mu’adhdhin</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The famous saying regarding this is that repeating after the caller can distract the musallee (i.e. person in salaah). The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily, the mind is occupied and busy with more important matters during the salaah.&#8221;</span> [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah</strong> (rahimahullaah) held another opinion; he maintained that the person in <em>salaah</em> may respond because this response is remembrance whose cause existed in <em>salaah</em>. Similarly, he said it is permissible to say “al-hamdullillaah” if you sneeze or return the salaam because the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) responded to that while in <em>salaah</em>. However, when it comes to following the <em>mu’adhdhin</em>, consideration is required because the response to the <em>adhaan</em> is prolonged and is far longer than returning the salaam, which is simply responded to with the hand, finger, or head. Thus, it is precautionary not to respond.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Benefit: Responding While Answering the Call of Nature</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Excluded from responding is the one that it is answering the call of nature. This is based on the hadeeth of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">I do not like to remember Allaah except in a state of purity</span>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Benefit: Mu’adhdhin Responding to Himself</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the mu’adhdhin repeating after himself, there are two opinions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) He responds to himself in order to combine the reward of adhaan with the reward of responding.<br />
2) What is apparent in the hadeeth is that there must be a hearer and someone else that is heard. As such, the mu’adhdhin would not respond to himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Benefit: Following the Iqaamah</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is apparent in this hadeeth is the following of the adhaan only. However, another opinion holds that the iqaamah is also referred to as an adhaan as in the hadeeth that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">Between the adhaanayn (i.e. two adhaan), there is salaah</span>” [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some scholars have contended that since the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) referred to the iqaamah as adhaan, it is permissible to repeat after the muqeem (the one that performs the iqaamah). In addition, they took as evidence the hadeeth in Sunan Abu Dawood that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) commanded the people to also follow the iqaamah, but this hadeeth has weakness. However, following the muqeem could cause the person to delay making takbeeratul-ihraam and entering the salaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Benefit: Volume of the Response</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The response in this hadeeth is in principle. There are no indications of a link between the essence of the remembrance and the description of the sound (loud or silent). Moreover, there is no benefit in being loud in the response.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Benefit: Missing Following Mu’adhdhin Due to a Legal Excuse</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When someone has a legal excuse for being unable to follow the <em>mu’adhdhin</em> (e.g. answering the call of nature), then he may make up what he missed. Similarly, if someone first hears the <em>mu’adhdhin</em> during the middle of the <em>adhaan</em>, then he starts following from the beginning and completes the following with the <em>mu’adhdhin</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Example: Someone first hears the <em>mu’adhdhin</em> at “<em>hayya ‘ala’-salaah</em>.” The person should start from the beginning at “<em>Allaahu Akbar</em>” until he catches up with the <em>mu’adhdhin</em> and then continue to follow him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Benefit: Adhaan of a Child</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With respect to the child that has reached the age of distinction, Shaykh al-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) held the opinion that the adhaan which is collective duty is permissible from him but not the adhaan which is in individual duty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah to make this a benefit for myself and for all those that read it and/or convey it. All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>

Chapter 186<br />
The Excellence of Adhan</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1033.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Were people to know the blessing of pronouncing Adhan and the standing in the first row, they would even draw lots to secure these privileges. And were they to realize the reward of performing Salat early, they would race for it; and were they to know the merits of Salat after nightfall (`Isha&#8217;) and the dawn (Fajr) Salat, they would come to them even if they had to crawl</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1034.</b> Mu`awiyah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The Mu&#8217;adhdhinun (callers to prayer) will have the longest necks on the Day of Resurrection</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1035.</b> `Abdullah bin `Abdur-Rahman reported: Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) said to me: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">I see that you like living among your sheep in wilderness. So whenever you are with your sheep or in wilderness and you want to call Adhan, you should raise your voice because whoever hears the Adhan, whether a human or jinn or any other creature, will testify for you on the Day of Resurrection</span>.&#8221; Abu Sa`id added: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">I heard this from the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1036.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">When Adhan for Salat is pronounced, the devil takes to his heels and breaks wind with noise so as not to hear the call. When the Adhan is finished, he returns. When the Iqamah is announced, he turns his back, and after it is finished, he returns again to distract the attention of one and makes him remember things which he does not recall in his mind before the Salat, and says `Remember this, and this,&#8217; and thus causes one to forget how many Rak`at he performed</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1037.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">When you hear the Adhan, repeat what the Mu&#8217;adhdhin says. Then ask Allah to exalt my mention because everyone who does so will receive in return ten rewards from Allah. Then beseech Allah to grant me Al-Wasilah, which is a high rank in Jannah, fitting for only one of Allah&#8217;s slaves; and I hope that I will be that man. If any one asks Al-Wasilah for me, it becomes incumbent upon me to intercede for him</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1038.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">When you hear the Mu&#8217;adhdhin (pronouncing the call to Salat), repeat after him what he says</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1039.</b> Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who says upon hearing the Adhan: `Allahumma Rabba hadhihid-da`wati-ttammati, was-salatil-qa&#8217;imati, ati Muhammadanil-wasilata wal-fadhilata, wab`athu maqaman mahmuda nilladhi wa `adtahu [O Allah, Rubb of this perfect call (Da`wah) and of the established prayer (As-Salat), grant Muhammad the Wasilah and superiority, and raise him up to a praiseworthy position which You have promised him]&#8217;, it becomes incumbent upon me to intercede for him on the Day of Resurrection</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1040.</b> Sa`d bin Abu Waqqas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who says after the Adhan: `Ash-hadu an la ilaha illallah Wah-dahu la sharika Lahu</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">;</span><span style="color:#0000ff;"> wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan `abduhu wa Rasuluhu, radhitu Billahi Rabban, wa bi Muhammadin Rasulan, wa bil Islami Dinan [I testify that there is no true god except Allah Alone; He has no partners and that Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) is His slave and Messenger; I am content with Allah as my Rubb, with Muhammad as my Messenger and with Islam as my Deen],&#8217; his sins will be forgiven.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1041.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The supplication made between the Adhan and the Iqamah is never rejected</span>.&#8221;<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Book 11:</p>
<h3 align="center">Call to Prayers (Adhaan)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.011.577"></a>Volume 1, Book 11, Number 577:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people mentioned the <strong>fire</strong> and the <strong>bell</strong> (they suggested those as signals to indicate the starting of prayers), and by that they mentioned the Jews and the Christians. Then Bilal was ordered to pronounce Adhan for the prayer by saying its wordings twice, and for the Iqama (the call for the actual standing for the prayers in rows) by saying its wordings once. (Iqama is pronounced when the people are ready for the prayer).</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 11, Number 578:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Muslims arrived at Medina, they used to assemble for the prayer, and used to guess the time for it. During those days, the practice of Adhan for the prayers had not been introduced yet. Once they discussed this problem regarding the call for prayer. Some people suggested the use of a <strong>bell like the Christians</strong>, others proposed a <strong>trumpet like the horn used by the Jews</strong>, but &#8216;Umar was the first to suggest that a man should call (the people) for the prayer; so Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered Bilal to get up and pronounce the Adhan for prayers.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 11, Number 579:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bilal was ordered to repeat the wording of the Adhan for prayers twice, and to pronounce the wording of the Iqamas once except &#8220;Qad-qamat-is-Salat&#8221;.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 11, Number 580:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the number of Muslims increased they discussed the question as to how to know the time for the prayer by some familiar means. Some suggested that a fire be lit (at the time of the prayer) and others put forward the proposal to ring the bell. Bilal was ordered to pronounce the wording of Adhan twice and of the Iqama once only.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 11, Number 581:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Qilaba:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas said, &#8220;Bilal was ordered to <strong>pronounce the wording of Adhan twice and of Iqama once only</strong>.&#8221; The sub narrator Isma&#8217;li said, &#8220;I mentioned that to Aiyub and he added (to that), &#8220;Except Iqama (i.e. Qad-Qamatis-Salat which should be said twice).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 11, Number 582:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, <strong>&#8220;When the Adhan is pronounced Satan takes to his heels and passes wind with noise during his flight in order not to hear the Adhan. When the Adhan is completed he comes back and again takes to his heels when the Iqama is pronounced and after its completion he returns again till he whispers into the heart of the person (to divert his attention from his prayer) and makes him remember things which he does not recall to his mind before the prayer and that causes him to forget how much he has prayed.&#8221;</strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 11, Number 583:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdul Rahman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri told my father, &#8220;I see you liking sheep and the wilderness. So whenever you are with your sheep or in the wilderness and you want to pronounce Adhan for the prayer raise your voice in doing so, <strong>for whoever hears the Adhan, whether a human being, a jinn or any other creature, will be a witness for you on the Day of Resurrection</strong>.&#8221; Abu Said added, &#8220;I heard it (this narration) from Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 11, Number 584:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Humaid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas bin Malik said, <strong>&#8220;Whenever the Prophet went out with us to fight (in Allah&#8217;s cause) against any nation, he never allowed us to attack till morning and he would wait and see: if he heard Adhan he would postpone the attack and if he did not hear Adhan he would attack them.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas added, &#8220;We reached Khaibar at night and in the morning when he did not hear the Adhan for the prayer, he (the Prophet ) rode and I rode behind Abi Talha and my foot was touching that of the Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The inhabitants of Khaibar came out with their baskets and spades and when they saw the Prophet they shouted &#8216;Muhammad! By Allah, Muhammad and his army.&#8217; When Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw them, he said, &#8220;Allahu-Akbar! Allahu-Akbar! Khaibar is ruined. Whenever we approach a (hostile) nation (to fight), then evil will be the morning of those who have been warned.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 11, Number 585:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;<strong>Whenever you hear the Adhan, say what the Mu&#8217;adhdhin is saying</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 11, Number 586:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Isa bin Talha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that he had heard Muawiya repeating the words of Adhan up to &#8220;Wa ash-hadu Anna Muhammadan Rasulul-lah (and I testify that Muhammad is Allah&#8217;s Apostle.)&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 11, Number 587:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Yahya as above (586) and added:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Some of my companions told me that Hisham had said, &#8220;When the Mu&#8217;adhdhin said, &#8220;Haiya alas-sala(t) (come for the prayer).&#8221; Muawiya said, &#8220;La hawla wala quwata illa billah (There is neither might nor any power except with Allah)&#8221; and added, &#8220;We heard your Prophet saying the same.&#8221;</p>
<hr />

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The Adhan pronounced by Bilal should not stop you from taking Suhur, for he pronounces the Adhan at night, so that the one offering the late night prayer (Tahajjud) from among you might hurry up and the sleeping from among you might wake up. It does not mean that dawn or morning has started.&#8221; Then he (the Prophet) pointed with his fingers and raised them up (towards the sky) and then lowered them (towards the earth) like this (Ibn Mas&#8217;ud imitated the gesture of the Prophet). Az-Zuhri gestured with his two index fingers which he put on each other and then stretched them to the right and left. These gestures illustrate the way real dawn appears. It spreads left and right horizontally. The dawn that appears in the high sky and lowers down is not the real dawn) .</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Aswad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;We were with &#8216;Aisha discussing the regularity of offering the prayer and dignifying it. She said, &#8216;When Allah&#8217;s Apostle fell sick with the fatal illness and when the time of prayer became due and Adhan was pronounced, he said, &#8216;Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer.&#8217; He was told that Abu Bakr was a soft-hearted man and would not be able to lead the prayer in his place. The Prophet gave the same order again but he was given the same reply. He gave the order for the third time and said, &#8216;You (women) are the companions of Joseph. Tell Abu Bakr to lead the prayer.&#8217; So Abu Bakr came out to lead the prayer. In the meantime the condition of the Prophet improved a bit and he came out with the help of two men one on each side. As if I was observing his legs dragging on the ground owing to the disease. Abu Bakr wanted to retreat but the Prophet beckoned him to remain at his place and the Prophet was brought till he sat beside Abu Bakr.&#8221; Al-A&#8217;mash was asked, &#8220;Was the Prophet praying and Abu Bakr following him, and were the people following Abu Bakr in that prayer?&#8221; Al-A&#8217;mash replied in the affirmative with a nod of his head. Abu Muawiya said, &#8220;The Prophet was sitting on the left side of Abu Bakr who was praying while standing.&#8221;</p>

He (repeated the same order and) on the third or the fourth time he said, &#8220;You are the companions of Joseph.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: “Does a woman raise her voice when saying ‘<i>aameen</i>’ during prayer, and does she also give the <i>adhaan</i> and <i>iqaamah</i>?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>“</i>If she is praying with women, then yes she raises her voice when saying ‘<i>aameen</i>,’ but if she is praying with men who are not her <i>mahram</i>, then no. Because <strong>I do not say that the voice of a woman is `<i>awrah</i></strong>, as many say, since the Mothers of the believers and the wives of the Companions from the early times used to speak and discuss with men. And oftentimes the woman would come to the Prophet ﷺ and ask him something in front of the men, and he ﷺ would answer her question.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>But</strong> (here), it is not from the etiquette of a woman to raise her voice when reciting the Qur&#8217;aan. We are often asked if it is permissible for a woman – when she is learning the recitation from a Shaikh, a <em>Muqri</em> – to repeat the recitation to him so that he may correct her. The answer is no. Although she learns, her learning is restricted to listening only, like the women of all the Companions learned from the Messenger of Allaah ﷺ by listening to his recitation during prayer or outside of prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a woman prays with women while she is the <i>imaam</i>, she raises her voice and the women behind her also raise their voices. That is due to his ﷺ statement: ‘<em>Indeed women are the counterparts of men</em>’<a>[1]</a> i.e. every ruling in which the men are being addressed, the women are also included in this address, except that which is made an exception. For example, it is best for a woman, in other than the <i>taraaweeh</i> prayer – please pay attention – in other than the <i>taraaweeh</i> prayer, to pray in her house, whereas it is obligatory upon a man to pray the five prayers in the <i>masjid</i> with the congregation. So here, the woman is not like the man. But the fundamental principle is as he ﷺ said: ‘Indeed women are the counterparts of men.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <strong>if a woman leads women in prayer as an <i>imaam</i>, she does just as a man would do as an<i> imaam</i></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: she raises her voice when reciting and when saying ‘<i>aameen</i>,’ and the women behind her also raise their voices when saying ‘<i>aameen</i>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: not only does the woman lead women in prayer as an <i>imaam</i>, indeed she gives the <i>adhaan</i> and<i> iqaamah </i>too. Why? Because of the previous <i>hadeeth</i>: ‘Indeed women are the counterparts of men.’ Moreover, Aa.ishah – the Mother of the believers and the foremost of the Mothers of the believers in <i>fiqh</i>, knowledge and <i>da`wah</i>, may Allaah bless her and her father – used to give the<i>adhaan</i> and <i>iqaamah</i> when she led women in prayer as an <i>imaam</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And here I would like to draw your attention to something that wasn’t asked about: <strong>the woman here is also different from the man</strong> as she does not step up before the women’s row, but rather she stands in the middle as if she is one of those in the row. She does not step up before them. There is text regarding this also, and thus a woman in this case is not included in the generality of his ﷺ statement: ‘Indeed women are the counterparts of men.’”</p>
