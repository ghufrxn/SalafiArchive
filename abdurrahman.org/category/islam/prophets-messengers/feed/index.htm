<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The <em>Dawah</em> of Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The noblest of all the Prophets and the last of them, Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdullaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم). The one sent with the greatest, most complete and most comprehensive message. The one whom Allaah sent as a mercy for the worlds, and as a bringer of good tidings and a warner, and as a Caller to Allaah with His permission, and a shining light. He did not leave anything good except that he guided his <em>ummah</em> to it and pointed it out to them, nor anything evil except that he warned them against it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">So which of the fundamentals of Islaam did this exalted Prophet begin with? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">What was the starting point for his <em>da’wah</em>? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) began with what all the Prophets began with, and started where they started in their <em>da’wah</em>: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>calling to the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of <em>tawheed</em>, and calling for all worship to be made purely and sincerely for Allaah alone</strong></span>. He began with the testification, “None has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah,” (<em>Laa ilaaha illallaah Muhammadur Rasoolullaah</em>). Can it be imagined that he or any of the other Prophets would begin with anything but this great principle, the foundation of all the divine Messages?! Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) began with this fundamental principle, so the first thing which the people heard was, &#8216;Witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah.&#8217; So the proud and haughty said.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَجَعَلَ الْآلِهَةَ إِلَٰهًا وَاحِدًا ۖ إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَشَيْءٌ عُجَابٌ  &#8211; وَانطَلَقَ الْمَلَأُ مِنْهُمْ أَنِ امْشُوا وَاصْبِرُوا عَلَىٰ آلِهَتِكُمْ ۖ إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَشَيْءٌ يُرَادُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“The unbelievers said, ‘Has he made all that is to be worshipped a single God, who alone is to be called upon and hears all invocations. This is a very curious thing which we have not heard of.’ So the leaders amongst them went off saying to one another, ‘Continue in what you are upon and persist in worshipping your idols. He only says this to gain ascendancy over us.’”  </strong></span>[Soorah Saad (38):5-6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continued calling to this lofty principle and highest goal throughout the Meccan period of his Messengership, for thirteen years. He did not become weary or languid. He patiently bore all types of harm to propagate this principle, since no religious duties or pillars of Islaam were obligated upon him, except for the Prayer which was obligated in the tenth year of Prophethood, and apart from the excellent manners of keeping ties of relationship, truthfulness and chastity which he commanded his people with. However the core of his <em>da’wah</em> and the cause of dispute and opposition to him was that great fundamental principle. So Allaah charged this noble Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) with the particular duty of establishing this great principle. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّا أَنزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ الْكِتَابَ بِالْحَقِّ فَاعْبُدِ اللَّهَ مُخْلِصًا لَّهُ الدِّينَ  &#8211; أَلَا لِلَّهِ الدِّينُ الْخَالِصُ ۚ وَالَّذِينَ اتَّخَذُوا مِن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَاءَ مَا نَعْبُدُهُمْ إِلَّا لِيُقَرِّبُونَا إِلَى اللَّهِ زُلْفَىٰ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَهُمْ فِي مَا هُمْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Indeed We have sent down the Book to you, O Muhammad, with the truth, so worship Allaah alone making all religion purely and sincerely for Him. Indeed the religion that is free of all taint of <em>shirk</em> is alone what is acceptable to Allaah. As for those who take and invoke helpers and protectors besides Allaah, then they say, ‘We only worship them so that they should intercede for us and bring us nearer to Allaah.’ Indeed Allaah will establish judgement between them regarding the matters of religion about which they dispute.”</span>  [</strong>Soorah az-Zumar (39):2-3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ إِنِّي أُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَعْبُدَ اللَّهَ مُخْلِصًا لَّهُ الدِّينَ  &#8211; وَأُمِرْتُ لِأَنْ أَكُونَ أَوَّلَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ &#8211;  قُلْ إِنِّي أَخَافُ إِنْ عَصَيْتُ رَبِّي عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ &#8211; قُلِ اللَّهَ أَعْبُدُ مُخْلِصًا لَّهُ دِينِي</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Say, O Muhammad </strong>(صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, ‘Allaah has commanded that I should worship Him alone, purely and sincerely, not associating anything with Him, and I am commanded to be the first of this nation who submits to Him as a Muslim, making all worship purely for Him.’ Say, O Muhammad, ‘I fear should I disobey my Lord in this, the torment of a great Day.’ Say, ‘It is Allaah alone that I worship, making all of my worship purely and sincerely for Him, and not worshipping anything else besides Him.’”</span></strong>[Soorah az-Zumar (39):11-14]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ إِنَّ صَلَاتِي وَنُسُكِي وَمَحْيَايَ وَمَمَاتِي لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ &#8211; لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ ۖ وَبِذَٰلِكَ أُمِرْتُ وَأَنَا أَوَّلُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Say, O Muhammad </strong>(صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, ‘Indeed my Prayer, my sacrifice, my living and my dying are all purely and solely for Allaah, Lord of all the Worlds. There is no share of any of that for other than Him. That is what My Lord ordered me, and I am the first of this nation to submit to Allaah as a Muslim.’”</span></strong>[Soorah al-An’aam (6):162-163]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also commanded him to call all of the people to fulfil and implement this principle, and to proceed upon it. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اعْبُدُوا رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ وَالَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ &#8211; الَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الْأَرْضَ فِرَاشًا وَالسَّمَاءَ بِنَاءً وَأَنزَلَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَاءً فَأَخْرَجَ بِهِ مِنَ الثَّمَرَاتِ رِزْقًا لَّكُمْ ۖ فَلَا تَجْعَلُوا لِلَّهِ أَندَادًا وَأَنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“O Mankind, single out your Lord with worship; He who created you and all those who came before you so that you may be of those who seek to avoid Allaah’s punishment and anger; those whom Allaah is pleased with. He Who has made the earth a resting place for you and has made the sky a canopy, and sent down rain from the sky, and brought out with it crops and fruits from the earth as provision for you. So do not set up rivals with Allaah in your worship whilst you know that you have no Lord besides Him.”</span>  </strong>[Soorah al-Baqarah (2):21-22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِلَٰهُكُمْ إِلَٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ ۖ لَّا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الرَّحْمَٰنُ الرَّحِيمُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“The God Who alone has the right to be worshipped is a Single God. So do not worship anything besides Him, nor associate anything in worship with Him, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.”</span>  </strong>[Soorah al-Baqarah (2):163]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنِّي رَسُولُ اللَّهِ إِلَيْكُمْ جَمِيعًا الَّذِي لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۖ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ يُحْيِي وَيُمِيتُ ۖ فَآمِنُوا بِاللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ النَّبِيِّ الْأُمِّيِّ الَّذِي يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَكَلِمَاتِهِ وَاتَّبِعُوهُ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Say, O Muhammad </strong>(صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)<strong>, to all of the people, ‘I am the Messenger of Allaah to you all. Allaah, to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and everything therein. None has the right to be worshipped but Him. He Who alone gives life and death. So affirm true faith in Allaah and in His sole right to worship, and believe in His Messenger, the Unlettered Prophet </strong>(Muhammad صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> who believes in Allaah and His Words, and follow him, so that you may be rightly guided.’”</span></strong>[Soorah al-A’raaf (7):158]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Aayaat </em>in this regard are very many, and what we have quoted is an example showing the methodology of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   in calling to <em>tawheed</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then with regard to the<em> Sunnah</em>, there are many things clearly showing that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) began his <em>da’wah</em> with <em>tawheed</em> and completed it with it, and continued calling to it from the beginning to the end, throughout his (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) ’Amr ibn ’Abasah as-Sulamee, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“During the times of Ignorance I used hold that the people were upon error and futility, and they used to worship the idols, then I heard of a man in Makkah who received revelation. So I set out upon my riding beast and came to him. At that time he was in hiding due to oppression of his people. So I behaved in a way that enabled me to gain access to him in Makkah, which I did. So I said to him, ‘What are you?’ He replied, ‘I am a Prophet.’ So I said, ‘And what is a Prophet?’ He said, ‘Allaah has sent me as a Messenger.’ So I said, ‘And what is it that He has sent you with?’ He said, ‘I have been sent to order the joining of ties of relationship, to break the idols, so that Allaah is worshipped alone and nothing at all is associated in worship along with Him.’ So I said, ‘And who is with you upon this?’ He said, ‘A free man and a slave.’ He said, ‘And at that time Aboo Bakr and Bilaal were with him from those who believed in him&#8230;’“ </em></p>
<p>[Reported by Muslim (Eng. trans. 2/395 no.1812) and Ahmad in <em>al-Musand</em> (4/112)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) When ’Amr ibn al-’Aas and ’Abdullaah ibn Rabee’ah al-Makhzoomee went to an-Najaashee, the ruler of Abyssinia, to speak to him in order to incite him against the Muslims who had emigrated to Abyssinia, they said, ‘O king, some of our foolish youths have abandoned their religion and come to your land. They have split away from their own people and have not entered your religion. Rather they have come up with an innovated religion which is not known either to us or to you&#8230;’ So the Najaashee asked the Muslims, ‘What is this religion which you have split from your people and not entered my religion or the religion of any of these nations?!’ So Ja’far ibn Abee Taalib was the one who replied, and he said to him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O king, we were a people from the people of ignorance who worshipped idols, and we ate unslaughtered meat and committed foul acts, and we cut off ties of relationship, treated our neighbours in an evil manner and the strong amongst us used to devour the weak. So we were upon that until Allaah sent a Messenger to us from amongst us. We knew his lineage, his truthfulness, his trustworthiness and his chastity. <strong>So he called us to Allaah, that we should single Him out and worship Him alone and renounce everything which we and our fathers used to worship besides Him, all stones and idols</strong>; he commanded us to speak the truth and to fulfil trusts; to join ties of relationship; to live in a good manner with our neighbours; to avoid forbidden acts and shedding blood; and he forbade us from foul acts and from falsehood; and he forbade us from unlawfully devouring the wealth of orphans and falsely accusing chaste women. <strong>He ordered us to worship Allaah alone and not to worship anything along with Him&#8230;</strong>’ He said, ‘So he told him the affairs of Islaam,’ &#8216;So we attested to his truthfulness and believed him and followed him in that which he came with. So we worshipped Allaah alone, and did not worship anything else besides Him, and we made forbidden that which He forbade us, and declared lawful that which He allowed for us. So our people became enemies to us and tortured us and tormented us to turn back from our religion to the worship of idols, and so that we should allow the filthy actions which we used to allow. So when they oppressed us, treated us cruelly and made it unbearable for us, and came between us and our religion, then we left and came to your land, and we preferred you to others and wished to live in your company, and we hoped that we would not be oppressed while with you&#8230;’” [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) Also amongst the questions which Hirqal (Heraclius) asked Aboo Sufyaan, at the time of the peace of Hudaybiyyah, about Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) was that he asked Aboo Sufyaan, “What does he command you?” So Aboo Sufyaan replied, “He says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Worship Allaah alone and do not worship anything else along with Him, and abandon what your fathers say. And he orders Prayer, charity, chastity and the joining of ties of relationship.</strong>’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Reported by al-Bukhaaree (Eng. trans. 1/7/no. 6) and it is a long <em>hadeeth]</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these <em>ahaadeeth</em> clearly show us what the <em>da’wah</em> of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  was in both the Makkan and Madinan periods.</p>

Ahmad said, “Ya’qoob (meaning Ibraaheem ibn Sa&#8217;d az-Zuhree) narrated to us (reliable): My father narrated to us, from Muhammad ibn Ishaaq: Muhammad ibn Muslim ibn ’Ubaydillaah ibn Shihaab narrated to me: from Aboo Bakr ibn ’Abdir-Rahmaan ibn al-Haarith ibn Hishaam al-Makhzoomee:from Umm Salamah bint Abee Umayyah (meaning the Mother of the Believers, <em>radiyallaahu ’anha</em>).” It is a chain of narration that is fully <em>saheeh</em>, except for Muhammad ibn Ishaaq, but he clearly states that he heard it directly and so his narration is <em>hasan</em> (good and acceptable).</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Belief in the Messengers</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah sent all of the messengers as bringers of good tidings and as warners, and the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">رُّسُلًا مُّبَشِّرِينَ وَمُنذِرِينَ لِئَلَّا يَكُونَ لِلنَّاسِ عَلَى اللَّهِ حُجَّةٌ بَعْدَ الرُّسُلِ ۚ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ عَزِيزًا حَكِيمًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Messengers were sent as bringers of glad tidings and as warners so that the people should have no excuse with Allaah after the sending of the messengers. And Allaah is ever All Mighty, All Wise.</span> </strong>[4:165] <sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">74</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">74</span>]:<strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Eemaan</em> in the Messengers is one of the six pillars of <em>eemaan</em>; he <em>sallallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> said:<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“</strong><strong><em>Eemaan</em></strong><strong> is that you truly believe in Allaah and in His Angels and in His Books and in His Messengers&#8230;”</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Hadeeth reported by al Bukhaaree (50) and Muslim (8,9 &amp; 10) from the hadeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>i Allaahu‘ anhu</em>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So having eemaan in the Messengers is one of the pillars of eemaan; so it is essential to have eemaan in all of the messengers, from the first of them to the last of them. So whoever denies a single messenger, then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) in all of them, just as He, the Most High, said:<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَكْفُرُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَيُرِيدُونَ أَن يُفَرِّقُوا بَيْنَ اللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَيَقُولُونَ نُؤْمِنُ بِبَعْضٍ وَنَكْفُرُ بِبَعْضٍ وَيُرِيدُونَ أَن يَتَّخِذُوا بَيْنَ ذَٰلِكَ سَبِيلًا &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">أُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْكَافِرُونَ حَقًّا ۚ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لِلْكَافِرِينَ عَذَابًا مُّهِينًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Those who disbelieve in Allaah and in His Messengers want to make a distinction between believing in Allaah and in His Messengers and they say, “We believe in some of them and we disbelieve in some.”</strong></span><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they wish to take a path in between that. They are the disbelievers in truth and We have prepared a humiliating punishment for the disbelievers. </strong></span>[4:150-151]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there must be <em>eemaan</em> in all of the Messengers from the first of them to the last of them, those whom Allaah has named from them in His Book, and those He has not named. For the Messengers are many; and therefore there occurs in the hadeeth that they number:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“One hundred and twenty four thousand (prophets) and the messengers from them were three hundred and fifteen all together.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[Hadeeth reported by Ahmad in his <em>Musnad</em> from the hadeeth of Aboo Umaamah al Baahilee <em>ra<u>d</u>i Allaahu ‘anhu</em> and declared to be <em>saheeh</em> by al Albaanee in as Saheehah (2668)]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there were many messengers; from them were those whom Allaah named in His Book and from them were those He did not name. So it is obligatory upon us to have eemaan in all of them, from the first of them to the last of them.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">: وأولُهُمْ نوحٌ عليهِ السلامُ، وآخِرُهُم محمدٌ صلى الله عليه وسلم وهو خاتِمُ النَّبيينَ والدليلُ على أنَّ أوَّلُهُم نوح قوله تعالى</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And the first of them was Nooh, ‘<em>alaihissalaam</em>, and the last of them was Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>; and the proof that the first of them was Nooh, ‘<em>alaihissalaam</em>, is His saying, He the Most High:</span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّا أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ كَمَا أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَىٰ نُوحٍ وَالنَّبِيِّينَ مِن بَعْدِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We have sent you </strong>(O Muhammad), <strong>with Revelation, just as We sent Revelation to Nooh and to the prophets who came after him </strong></span>[4:163] <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>75</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">75</span>]:<strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof that the first of them was Nooh is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; إِنَّا أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We sent revelation to you…</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was an address to the Prophet <em>sallallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> كَمَا أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَىٰ نُوحٍ وَالنَّبِيِّينَ مِن بَعْدِهِ ۚ وَأَوْحَيْنَا إِلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَالْأَسْبَاطِ وَعِيسَىٰ وَأَيُّوبَ وَيُونُسَ وَهَارُونَ وَسُلَيْمَانَ ۚ وَآتَيْنَا دَاوُودَ زَبُورًا </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>… just as We sent revelation to Nooh and the prophets who came after him; and We sent revelation to Ibraaheem and Isma’eel and Is-haaq and Ya’qoob and to the tribes </strong>(of Banu Israeel)<strong> and to ‘Eesaa and Ayyoob and Yoonus and Haaroon and Sulaymaan; and We gave the Zaboor to Daawud. </strong></span>[4:163]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah mentioned a number of their names together in this aayah, just as He mentioned a number of their names together in the aayah from Soorah al An’aam:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِهِ دَاوُودَ وَسُلَيْمَانَ وَأَيُّوبَ وَيُوسُفَ وَمُوسَىٰ وَهَارُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And from his descendants were Daawood and Sulaymaan and Ayyoob and Yoosuf and Moosaa and Haaroon…</span> </strong>[6:84]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">to the end of the aayaat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the first of them was Nooh  &#8211; <em>‘alaihissalaatu wassalaam</em> – as proven by His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> .. وَالنَّبِيِّينَ مِن بَعْدِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the prophets who came after him…</strong></span> [4:163]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah sent him (Nooh) to his people when they went beyond the limits (<em>ghuloo</em>) concerning the righteous people after the people had been upon the religion of <em>Tawheed</em> from the time of Aadam <em>‘alaihissalaam</em> for ten generations and they were upon <em>Tawheed</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when the people of Nooh came, there were amongst (those people) righteous men. Then when those righteous men died, the people grieved severely for them. So Satan seized the opportunity and said to them, “<em>Make images of those righteous people and set them up in the places where you sit in order that when you see these images, you will remember their condition and you will gain enthusiasm upon worship</em>.” So therefore they made images of those dead people and they set them up in the sitting places but they (these images) were not worshipped to begin with because of the presence of scholars who used to explain <em>Tawheed</em> to the people and used to criticize shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then when the people of knowledge died and the first generation passed away, a later generation came &#8211; and the scholars had died – Satan came and said to them, “<em>Your forefathers only erected these images in order to worship them and they used to seek rain near them (these images)</em>.” So he made worship of them seem to be good, so they worshipped them besides Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in this way, shirk came about upon the Earth; so Allaah therefore sent His Prophet Nooh  &#8211; <em>‘alaihissalaatu wassalaam</em> – calling them to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and seeking to return them to <em>Tawheed</em>, which was the religion of their forefather Aadam – ‘alaihissalaam.  However they (Nooh’s people) were obstinate and haughty:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَالُوا لَا تَذَرُنَّ آلِهَتَكُمْ وَلَا تَذَرُنَّ وَدًّا وَلَا سُوَاعًا وَلَا يَغُوثَ وَيَعُوقَ وَنَسْرًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they said, “Do not forsake those objects that you worship! Do not forsake Wadd nor Suwaa’ nor Yaghooth nor Ya’ooq nor Nasr.</span> </strong>[71:23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Abbaas said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« هذه أسماء رجال صالحين ، صوروا صورهم ونصبوها على مجالسهم فآل ﺑﻬم الأمر إلى أن عبدوها من دون الله »</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“These were the names of righteous men; they made images of them and they set them up in their sitting places, and this eventually led them to worshipping them besides Allaah.”</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Hadith Reported by al Bukhaaree as narration 4920]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when Nooh – <em>‘alaihissalaatu wassalaam</em> &#8211; came to them and forbade them from worshipping them and he commanded them to worship Allaah, they said, “<em>Do not abandon those objects that you worship; do not obey Nooh but rather continue upon your kufr and transgression and obstinacy!</em>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the first shirk that occurred upon the Earth and its cause was the images. And therefore the Prophet <em>sallallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« إن أشد الناس عذابا عند الله يوم القيامة المصورون »</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The people who will receive the severest punishment on the Day of Resurrection will be those who make images.”</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Hadith Reported by al Bukhaaree (5950) and Muslim (2109) from hadeeth of ‘Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood <em>ra<u>d</u>i Allaahu ‘anhu</em>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« إن الذين يصنعون هذه الصور يعذبون يوم القيامة ، يقال لهم : أحيوا ما خلقتم »</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Those people who make these images will be punished on the Day of Resurrection. It will be said to them, “Give life to that which you have created.”</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Hadith Reported by al Bukhaaree (5951) and Muslim  (2108) from hadeeth of ‘Abdullaah ibn ‘Umar  <em>ra<u>d</u>i Allaahu‘ anhumaa </em>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They will be commanded to breathe the spirit of life into these images; and this will be a case of <em>ta’jeez</em> (giving them a command to show their inability) and as a punishment for them, and Allaah’s refuge is sought. This is because making images is a route from the routes which lead to shirk, just as happened with the people of Nooh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the first of the Messengers was Nooh. And as for the seal of the Messengers and the last of them, then he was Muhammad <em>sallallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَّا كَانَ مُحَمَّدٌ أَبَا أَحَدٍ مِّن رِّجَالِكُمْ وَلَٰكِن رَّسُولَ اللَّهِ وَخَاتَمَ النَّبِيِّينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Muhammad is not the father of any of your men but rather he is the Messenger of Allaah and the final one of the prophets</span>. </strong>[33:40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« وأنا خاتم النبيين لا نبي بعدي »</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>I am the seal of the Prophets; there will be no prophet after me.</strong><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[Hadith Reported by Aboo Daawud (4252) and at Tirmidhee from hadeeth of Thawbaan <em>ra<u>d</u>i Allaahu ‘anhu</em> and declared <u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> by al Albaanee]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So through him, the Heavenly Messages were concluded. So no prophet will be raised and sent after him until the Hour is established. However his <em>Sharee’ah</em> (Revealed Law) will remain until the Hour is established and his religion will remain until the Hour is established, as has preceded.  So whoever claims Prophethood after Muhammad <em>sallallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> then he is a disbeliever; and whoever believes (this false claimant to Prophethood) then he (too) is a disbeliever in Allaah, because there will be no prophet after him <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And many people have claimed Prophethood after him; and Allaah has exposed them and has made their falsehood apparent. And from the last of them – in what we know – was al Qaadiyaanee, Ghulaam Ahmad al Qaadiyaanee, the Indian; the one who in the beginning claimed to be upon knowledge and worship, then he claimed that he was ‘Eesaa ibn Maryam, then he claimed Prophethood. And he now has followers who call themselves the Qaadiyaanees. And the Muslims have declared them to be disbelievers and they have shunned them and counted them as being a disbelieving sect  outside of Islaam. And they are a people who are shunned and banished – and all praise is for Allaah – from the lands of the Muslims. And they (the Qaadiyaanees) are active (in dawah). However their activities end in failure.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, in summary, there will be no prophet after the Messenger of Allaah <em>sallallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>. Whoever claims prophet hood after him, then he is a great liar, just as he <em>sallallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« لا تقوم الساعة حتى يبعث دجالون كذابون ، قريبا من ثلاثين كلهم يزعم أنه رسول الله »</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The Hour will not be established until <em>dajjaals</em> (great tricksters), great liars are sent, close to thirty, each one of them claiming that he is a messenger of Allaah.”</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Hadith Reported by al Bukhaaree (3609) and Muslim after the narration 2923 in the Book of Trials and Tribulations from the hadeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>i Allaahu ‘anhu</em>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who claim falsely to be prophets are many but Allaah exposes their affair and uncovers them and shows how debased they are to the people. And whoever believes them, then he is a disbeliever because he is denying the Truth of what has been said by Allaah and His Messenger <em>sallallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and the consensus of the Muslims upon the fact that Prophethood was concluded with Muhammad <em>sallallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And Allaah sent a Messenger to every nation, from Nooh until Muhammad, commanding them to worship Allaah alone, and forbidding them from the worship of <em>at-taaghoot</em> and the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِي كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولًا أَنِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُوا الطَّاغُوتَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We certainly sent a messenger to every nation ordering them that they should worship Allaah </strong>(alone)<strong> and they should shun the</strong> <strong><em>Taaghoot</em></strong> </span>[16:36] <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>76</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">76</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying: “<strong>Allaah sent a messenger to every nation</strong>…”, Meaning: Allaah sent a messenger to every nation of mankind in order to establish the proof upon them so that they would not be able to say, “<em>No bringer of good tidings nor any warner came to us!</em>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And because of His saying, He the Most High:<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَا كُنَّا مُعَذِّبِينَ حَتَّىٰ نَبْعَثَ رَسُولًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We do not punish until We have sent a messenger. </strong></span>[17:15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah sent a messenger to every nation from the previous nations, just as He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِن مِّنْ أُمَّةٍ إِلَّا خَلَا فِيهَا نَذِيرٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There was not a previous nation except that Allaah sent a warner to them.</strong></span> [35:24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However it is obligatory that we are aware of what was the call of the Messengers? The call of all the messengers, from the first of them to the last of them, was the call to tawheed as per His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِي كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولًا أَنِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُوا الطَّاغُوتَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We certainly sent a messenger to every nation ordering them that they should worship Allaah </strong>(alone)<strong> and they should shun the <em>taaghoot</em>.</strong> </span>[16:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So everything that is worshipped besides Allaah is <em>Taaghoot</em>, as will follow with regards to the types of the <em>Taaghoots</em> – that from their types is that which is worshipped besides Allaah whilst he is pleased with that, as will follow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the meaning of His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> .. وَاجْتَنِبُوا الطَّاغُوتَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And shun the Taaghoot…</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">means to keep away from worshipping the false objects of worship and the idols and the graves and the tombs; these are <em>taaghoots</em>. So the noble <em>aayah</em> proves that the call of the Messengers, all of them, was concentrated upon <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em> from the first of them to the last of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as He, the Perfect and Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلَّا نُوحِي إِلَيْهِ أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا أَنَا فَاعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We did not send any messenger before you except that We revealed to him that none has the right to be worshipped except Me so worship Me alone.</strong></span> [21:25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يُنَزِّلُ الْمَلَائِكَةَ بِالرُّوحِ مِنْ أَمْرِهِ عَلَىٰ مَن يَشَاءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ أَنْ أَنذِرُوا أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا أَنَا فَاتَّقُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He (Allaah) sends down the angels with the Revelation from His Command to whomever He wishes from His servants ordering them, “Warn the people that none has the right to be worshipped except Me, so therefore fear and be dutiful to Me.” </strong></span>[16:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the call of the Messengers, all of them, was to <em>tawheed</em> and to singling out Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, with worship and to forbidding shirk. This was the call of the Messengers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then after <em>tawheed</em> comes the Revealed Laws with regards to the <em>halaal</em> (permissible) and the <em>haraam</em> (forbidden). And the details of the Revealed Laws varied in accordance with the variation between the nations and the needs of the nations. And Allaah abrogated from them whatever He wished, and then all of them were abrogated through the Revealed Law of Islaam &#8211; the <em>halaal</em> and the <em>haraam</em>, the rulings and the acts of worship and the commands and the prohibitions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the foundation (of the Revealed Laws) then it was <em>tawheed</em>; then this did not vary and it was not abrogated. This was a single religion; the religion of all the Messengers from the first of them to the last of them was one religion (in this respect) – just as He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لِكُلٍّ جَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ شِرْعَةً وَمِنْهَاجًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And for each people We laid down a prescribed law and a detailed way to follow.</span> </strong>[5:48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the religion of <em>tawheed</em> is the worship of Allaah with that which He legislated at each time in accordance with its particular circumstances. So if a Revealed Law was abrogated then the people moved onto the new abrogating Law.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever insists and remains upon that which has been abrogated, and avoids that which is abrogating, then he will be a disbeliever in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic because the religion which has been abrogated will not be a religion after its being abrogated. Rather it will only be religion before it was abrogated. So when it has been abrogated, then it will not be religion. The religion will be that which comes later (abrogates). Therefore the Revealed Law of Islaam abrogated whatever came before it from the Revealed religious laws.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever remains upon Judaism or Christianity after the sending of Muhammad <em>sallallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) because he is acting upon a religion which has been abrogated, whose time has come to an end.</p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Proof for the testification that &#8216;Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah&#8217; is His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَقَدْ جَاءَكُمْ رَسُولٌ مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ عَزِيزٌ عَلَيْهِ مَا عَنِتُّمْ حَرِيصٌ عَلَيْكُم بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ رَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There has indeed come to you a Messenger from Allaah from amongst yourselves; it grieves him that you undergo suffering. He is eager and anxious for your guidance and he is full of compassion and mercy for the believers. </strong></span>[9:128]<strong> </strong><span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>37</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">37</span>] : <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first pillar of the pillars of Islaam is composed of two matters:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first:</strong> The testification <em>Laa ilaaha illaAllaah</em> (none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah).</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second: </strong>The testification &#8216;<em>Mu<u>h</u>ammadan rasoolullaah</em>&#8216; (Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah).</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these two are a single pillar. The first part means making ones worship purely and sincerely. And the second part means following the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof for the testification that &#8216;Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah&#8217; is His saying: <em> </em></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَقَدْ جَاءَكُمْ رَسُولٌ مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ عَزِيزٌ عَلَيْهِ مَا عَنِتُّمْ حَرِيصٌ عَلَيْكُم بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ رَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There has indeed come to you a Messenger from Allaah from amongst yourselves; it grieves him that you undergo suffering. He is eager and anxious for your guidance and he is full of compassion and mercy for the believers. </strong></span>[9:128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proofs for the testification that &#8216;Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah&#8217; are many in the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, as well as the amazing miracles which prove his <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>&#8216;s Messenger-ship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the Book is this <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَقَدْ جَاءَكُمْ رَسُولٌ مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ عَزِيزٌ عَلَيْهِ مَا عَنِتُّمْ حَرِيصٌ عَلَيْكُم بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ رَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There has indeed come to you a Messenger from Allaah from amongst yourselves; it grieves him that you undergo suffering. He is eager and anxious for your guidance and he is full of compassion and mercy for the believers. </strong></span>[9:128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a witness from Allaah for this Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>, for his Messenger-ship and it is an description of his characteristics.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَقَدْ جَاءَكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There has indeed come to you.</span> </strong>[9:128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>&#8216;Laam&#8217;</em> is a <em>Laam</em> to indicate an oath. So therefore, it carries along with it an oath which is understood (in the meaning) and is taken to be <em>wallaahi</em> (by Allaah) &#8216;there has certainly come to you.&#8217;</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قَدْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">is a particle for confirmation and emphasis.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">جَاءَكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He has come to you.</strong></span> [9:128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Mankind! This is an address to the whole of mankind, because his <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>&#8216;s Messenger-ship was general to all of the <em>thaqalayn</em> (two species), mankind and <em>jinn</em>.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">رَسُولٌ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">A Messenger</span>. </strong>[9:128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was one who had a revealed law sent to him by revelation and he was commanded to convey it. He was called a Messenger because he was <em>mursal</em> (sent) with a Message by Allaah the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>From your own selves. </strong></span>[9:128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From your own species and your own type, from human-kind. He was not an angel from the angels. And this was the Way of Allaah the Perfect and Most High &#8211; that He would send to mankind, Messengers from them, in order to make their affair clear and in order for them to speak with them and because they would know them. If He had sent, as a Messenger to them, an angel, they would have not been able to speak with him because he would have not been from their type of being. Also, they would have not be able to see the angel, because he would have not been from their type of being. So from His Mercy, He the Perfect and Most High, is that He sent as a Messenger to mankind a Messenger from their own type. Indeed he was from the Arabs, and from the most noble of the houses of the Arabs in lineage, from the tribe of Baanee Haashim, who are the most honorable in lineage of Quraysh, and Quraysh are the most honorable of the Arabs in lineage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, he was the specially chosen from the best of people. They knew him and they knew of his personality, his lineage, tribe, and his town. If they had not known him, then how could they attest to his truthfulness? And if he came with other than their language, then how could they understand his speech?</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">عَزِيزٌ عَلَيْهِ مَا عَنِتُّمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">It grieves him greatly that you should suffer</span>. </strong>[9:128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">عَزِيزٌ عَلَيْهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: It troubled him <em><u>s</u>allallaahu‘alaihiwasallam</em>.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَا عَنِتُّمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Whatever troubles you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Inconvenience and hardship. The Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu‘alaihiwasallam</em> was troubled by whatever caused trouble to his nation. He had not used to want hardship for them. Rather, he wanted ease and easiness. And therefore, his revealed law <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>came as something easy and easy-going.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>, said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">بعثت بالحنيفية السمحة</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>I was sent with the Straight and true religion; the religion of ease.</strong>[<span style="color:#999999;">1] [2]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[1] Ahmad (5/266). </span><span style="color:#999999;">[2] Reported by Ahmad 23/623 (22291) from the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of Abu Umaamah Al-Baahilee, <em>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>. [Shaikh Al-Albaanee declared this <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> as strong in <em>As-Sa<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah </em>no. 2924]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا جَعَلَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِي الدِّينِ مِنْ حَرَجٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And He did not place upon you any hardship in the religion</span>. </strong>[22:78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَا يُرِيدُ اللَّهُ لِيَجْعَلَ عَلَيْكُم مِّنْ حَرَجٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah does not wish to place any hardship upon you</span>. </strong>[5:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His revealed Way is easy, it goes along with the capability of the people and with what those given duties, are able to do, and it does not burden them with things they are not capable of. Therefore, the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> used to love to make things easy for them. He was never given a choice between two matters except that he chose the easiest one of the two as long as it was not sinful. He used to love to perform an action but he would leave it out of compassion for his Nation. He would leave the action even though he loved it, from the righteous deeds in order that he should not put difficulty upon his nation. These were from his characteristics, that whatever caused difficulty for his nation was a difficulty he felt himself, and he would become pleased with whatever was pleasing to them, and he would be joyful with whatever caused them to be joyful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever has these as his characteristics, then there is no doubt that he will not bring except that which is <em>khayr</em> (good) and <em>Ra<u>h</u>mah</em> (mercy), <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">حَرِيصٌ عَلَيْكُم</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">He is eager and anxious for you</span>. </strong>[9:128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: For your guidance and that you are taken out from the darkness into the light. Therefore, he himself bore difficulty in calling the people, seeking that they should be guided, and seeking to take them out from darkness into light to such an extent that Allaah said to him:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَعَلَّكَ بَاخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ أَلَّا يَكُونُوا مُؤْمِنِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Perhaps you will destroy yourself with grief that they are not believing. </strong></span>[26:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Perhaps you would bring about your own destruction that they do not believe, because of grief. So do not grieve for them. And this was from the completeness of his sincerity, <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em>.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">He was compassionate and merciful towards the believers.</span> </strong>[9:128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: <em>ra’oof </em>is from<em> ra&#8217;fah</em> (compassion), and it means tenderness and kindness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: He described him with <em>Ra<u>h</u>mah</em> (mercy), so he was not harsh.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَبِمَا رَحْمَةٍ مِّنَ اللَّهِ لِنتَ لَهُمْ ۖ وَلَوْ كُنتَ فَظًّا غَلِيظَ الْقَلْبِ لَانفَضُّوا مِنْ حَوْلِكَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So by mercy from Allaah you were gentle with them, and if you had been severe and hard-hearted, they would have dispersed from around you</span>. </strong>[3:159]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He  <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em> was humble and gentle with the believers, he would lower his wing in gentleness, and he would meet them with a smiling face, and love, affection, and fine treatment. These were from his  <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em> characteristics.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah mentioned five attributes for this Messenger  <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: He was from amongst you.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: He was troubled by whatever troubled you.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: He was eager and anxious for you.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth</strong>: He was compassionate towards the believers.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifth</strong>: He was merciful.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Five characteristics from the characteristics of this Prophet  <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em>. And compassion and mercy were mentioned specifically for the believers since he  <em><u>s</u>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em><em> </em>was stern upon the people of <em>shirk</em> and the obstinate and willful rejecters of the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would become angry for that which angered Allaah the Perfect and Most High, just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ جَاهِدِ الْكُفَّارَ وَالْمُنَافِقِينَ وَاغْلُظْ عَلَيْهِمْ ۚ وَمَأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ ۖ وَبِئْسَ الْمَصِيرُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O Prophet! Strive against the unbelievers and the hypocrites, and be stern against them. And their dwelling place will be the Hell-Fire, what an evil destination! </strong></span>[9:73]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The mercy and compassion was specific for the believers. Likewise the believers are to be the same with each other.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مُّحَمَّدٌ رَّسُولُ اللَّهِ ۚ وَالَّذِينَ مَعَهُ أَشِدَّاءُ عَلَى الْكُفَّارِ رُحَمَاءُ بَيْنَهُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah and those who are with him are stern against the unbelievers, merciful amongst themselves</span>. </strong>[48:29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These were his <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em> characteristics.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">المَسْأَلَةُ الثَّانِيَةُ: <span style="color:#000000;"><sup> </sup>أَنَّ اللهَ لاَ يَرْضَى أَنْ يُشْرَكَ مَعَهُ أَحَدٌ غَيرُهُ فِي عِبَادَتِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second matter: that <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2018/04/11/allaah-is-not-pleased-that-anyone-else-should-be-associated-with-him-in-worship-of-him/">Allaah is not pleased that anyone else should be associated with Him in worship of Him</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>[In this Audio]</strong></span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لاَ مَلَكٌ مُقَرَّبٌ وَلاَ نَبِيٌّ مُرْسَلٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Neither any angel brought near, nor any Messenger sent</span>.</strong><sup>8</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>Neither any angel brought near, nor any Messenger sent</strong>”: the angel brought near – this is the most excellent ones from the angels such as Jibreel <em>‘alaihissalaam</em>, and the bearers of the Throne, and those around it, and the angels drawn close to Allaah the Perfect and Most High. So despite the closeness of their place to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and their drawing close to Him with worship and their status with Allaah, if anyone were to associate them along with Allaah in worship then Allaah will not be pleased that an angel drawn close is associated with Him, nor any Prophet sent, such as Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam, </em>and ‘Eesaa and Noo<u>h</u> and Ibraaheem, those Messengers who are firmest in resolve. <span style="color:#ff0000;">He is not pleased that anyone should be associated with Him even if it be one of the most excellent of the angels, even if it be one of the most excellent of mankind.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He is not pleased that anyone should be associated along with Him from the angels nor from the Messengers. So how about other than them from the beloved servants of Allaah and righteous people, so other than the angels and the Messengers it will be even more the case that Allaah is not pleased that they be associated with Him in worship. And this is a refutation of those people who claim that they take the righteous people and the beloved servants of Allaah as intercessors with Allaah in order to draw them closer to Allaah, just as the people of the days of ignorance used to say:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَا نَعْبُدُهُمْ إِلَّا لِيُقَرِّبُونَا إِلَى اللَّهِ زُلْفَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">We do not worship them except so that they should draw us closer to Allaah </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(by interceding for us with Allaah)</span> [39:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Otherwise they believed that those ones whom they took, they do not create and they do not give provision and they do not possess power over death nor life nor resurrection. Rather their intention was just to take them as intermediaries with Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and therefore they directed some worship towards them to draw them closer to them, so they made sacrifices for the graves, and they made vows for the graves and they supplicated for aid and called upon the dead.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَمَنْ أَطَاعَهُ دَخَلَ الجَنَّةَ وَمَنْ عَصَاهُ دَخَلَ النَّارَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>So whoever obeys him will enter paradise, and whoever disobeys him will enter the fire.<sup>5</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih Al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>Whoever obeys him</strong>”: meaning in that which he commands, then he will enter paradise. And his saying, “<strong>And whoever disobeys him</strong>”: in that which he forbade, then he will enter the fire. This is something for which there is a great deal of confirmation in the Qur’aan. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَّن يُطِعِ الرَّسُولَ فَقَدْ أَطَاعَ اللَّهَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Whoever obeys the Messenger, then he has indeed obeyed Allaah. </strong></span>[4:80]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا أَرْسَلْنَا مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلَّا لِيُطَاعَ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We did not send any Messenger except that he should be obeyed by the permission of Allaah. </strong></span>[4:64]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِن تُطِيعُوهُ تَهْتَدُوا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And if you obey him </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the Prophet </span><span style="color:#008000;"><em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em></span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> you will be rightly guided</span>. </strong>[24:54]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> وَأَطِيعُوا الرَّسُولَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And obey the Messenger that you may be shown mercy. </strong></span>[24:56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever obeys him is guided, and will enter paradise, and whoever disobeys him will be astray and will enter the fire. He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">كلكم يدخل الجنة إلا من أبى ، قالوا : يا رسول الله ومن يأبى ؟ قال : من أطاعني دخل الجنة ومن عصاني فقد أبى</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“All of you will enter paradise except for those who refuse.” They said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, and who will refuse?’ He said, “Whoever obeys me enters paradise and whoever disobeys me has refused.”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong>So his <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> saying, “<strong>He has refused</strong>”: means he will have refused to enter paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لا يسمع بي يهودي ولا نصراني ثم لا يؤمن بالذي جئت به إلا دخل النار</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“No-one will hear of me, no Jew nor any Christian, and then not believe in that which I came with except that he will enter the fire.”<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever obeys him will enter paradise and whoever disobeys him will enter the fire, and this is the distinguishing factor between the true believer and between the disbeliever.</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّا أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَيْكُمْ رَسُولًا شَاهِدًا عَلَيْكُمْ كَمَا أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ رَسُولًا</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَعَصَىٰ فِرْعَوْنُ الرَّسُولَ فَأَخَذْنَاهُ أَخْذًا وَبِيلًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We sent a Messenger to you as a witness for or against you, just as we sent a Messenger to the Pharaoh. But the Pharaoh disobeyed the Messenger so we seized him with a severe punishment. </strong></span>[73:15-16] <span style="color:#993300;"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And the proof</strong>”: meaning for the sending of the Messenger is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">We sent a Messenger to you as a witness for or against you, just as we sent a Messenger to the Pharaoh. But the Pharaoh disobeyed the Messenger so we seized him with a severe punishment</span>. </strong>[73:15-16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High, “<em>Innaa</em>”, the pronoun here (meaning ‘We’) refers to Allaah the Perfect and Most High and this is a pronoun of one declaring his own greatness, because He is indeed Tremendous, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“We sent”, likewise this pronoun is to show greatness, and the meaning of, <em>“arsalnaa</em>”, is We sent him and sent revelation to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word, “<em>ilaykum</em>”, (to you people), meaning O two weighty species (mankind and the <em>jinn</em>). It is an address to the whole of mankind, because the <em>risaalah</em> (messengership) of this Messenger is universal to all of mankind until the Hour is established.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<em>Rasoolan</em>”, (a Messenger), he is Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam.</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the phrase:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> شَاهِدًا عَلَيْكُمْ كَمَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>As a witness upon you </strong></span>[73:15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: with Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, on the Day of Resurrection, a witness that he conveyed to you the message of Allaah, and that he established the proof upon you, just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">رُّسُلًا مُّبَشِّرِينَ وَمُنذِرِينَ لِئَلَّا يَكُونَ لِلنَّاسِ عَلَى اللَّهِ حُجَّةٌ بَعْدَ الرُّسُلِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah sent Messengers as bringers of glad tidings for the obedient ones, and as warners for the disobedient ones, so that no plea should remain with the people with Allaah, after the sending of the Messengers. </strong></span>[4:165]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So no-one on the Day of Resurrection will be able to say, “I did not know that I was created for worship, I did not know what was obligatory upon me, I did not know what was forbidden for me”. It will not be possible for someone to say this, because the Messengers <em>‘alaihimu<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> conveyed the message to them, and this nation of Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam, </em>it will bear witness against them. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَكَذَٰلِكَ جَعَلْنَاكُمْ أُمَّةً وَسَطًا لِّتَكُونُوا شُهَدَاءَ عَلَى النَّاسِ وَيَكُونَ الرَّسُولُ عَلَيْكُمْ شَهِيدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And likewise We made you the best and a justly balanced nation so that you should be witnesses against mankind, and the Messenger should be a witness upon you. </strong></span>[2:143]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this nation will bear witness against the previous nations on the Day of Resurrection that their Messengers conveyed the messages of Allaah to them, based upon what they find in the Book of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, because Allaah has narrated to us the news of the previous nations and of the Messengers and of what they said to their nations. All of this we know from the Book of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, which is not approached by falsehood from in front nor from behind, which is revelation sent down by the One who is All-Wise, the One Deserving of All Praise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the Messenger he will be … </strong></span>[2:143]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam, </em>he will be upon you, O nation of Mu<u>h</u>ammad, a witness, he will witness upon you with Allaah that he indeed established the proof upon you and that he conveyed the message to you and that he sincerely advised you for Allaah’s sake. So no proof will remain on the Day of Resurrection for a person to say, “Nothing reached me. No warner came to me”. Even the unbelievers, they will confess when they are thrown into the fire. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">كُلَّمَا أُلْقِيَ فِيهَا فَوْجٌ سَأَلَهُمْ خَزَنَتُهَا أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ نَذِيرٌ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قَالُوا بَلَىٰ قَدْ جَاءَنَا نَذِيرٌ فَكَذَّبْنَا وَقُلْنَا مَا نَزَّلَ اللَّهُ مِن شَيْءٍ إِنْ أَنتُمْ إِلَّا فِي ضَلَالٍ كَبِيرٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Whenever a crowd of them are thrown into the fire its keepers will ask them, “Did not a warner come to you?” They will say, “Yes indeed a warner came to us, but we denied, and we said Allaah did not send down anything, you are upon great misguidance.” </strong></span>[67:8-9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said to the Messengers, “You are upon misguidance.” So they denied the Messengers and they declared them to be upon misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the wisdom in the sending of the Messengers – to establish the proof upon the people, and to guide whomever Allaah wished to guide. The Messengers, Allaah guides through them whoever He wishes, and He establishes the proof upon those who obstinately refuse and deny and disbelieve.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">كَمَا أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ رَسُولًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Just as we sent a Messenger to Pharaoh</strong></span> [73:15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger here is Moosaa <em>‘alaihissalaatu wassalaam </em>and the Pharaoh, he was the tyrannical king in Egypt the one who claimed lordship for himself, and the Pharaoh was the title of every king of Egypt – he was called a Pharaoh. And what is meant by it here is the Pharaoh who claimed <em>ruboobiyyah</em> (lordship) for himself.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَقَالَ أَنَا رَبُّكُمُ الْأَعْلَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">That he said: “I am you highest lord.”</span> </strong>[79:24]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَعَصَىٰ فِرْعَوْنُ الرَّسُولَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So the Pharaoh disobeyed the Messenger </strong></span>[73:16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was Moosaa, Pharaoh disbelieved in him just as Allaah has narrated in His Book, narrating what occurred between Moosaa and the Pharaoh, and how the affair of the Pharaoh and his people ended up.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> فَأَخَذْنَاهُ أَخْذًا وَبِيلًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So we seized him with punishment</span> </strong>[73:16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: We seized Pharaoh with punishement and it was that Allaah drowned him, him and his people, in the ocean. Then he entered him into the fire.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مِّمَّا خَطِيئَاتِهِمْ أُغْرِقُوا فَأُدْخِلُوا نَارًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Because of their sins they were drowned, and they were entered into fire</span>. </strong>[71:25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he is in the fire in the <em>Barzakh</em> (the intermediate life after death and before the Day of Resurrection). He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">النَّارُ يُعْرَضُونَ عَلَيْهَا غُدُوًّا وَعَشِيًّا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The fire, they are exposed to it morning and evening </strong></span>[40:46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is in the <em>Barzakh</em> before the hereafter, they are exposed to the fire morning and evening, until the Hour is established, and this is a proof for <em>‘Adhaab-ul-Qabr</em> (punishment of the grave), and Allaah’s refuge is sought.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَيَوْمَ تَقُومُ السَّاعَةُ أَدْخِلُوا آلَ فِرْعَوْنَ أَشَدَّ الْعَذَابِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And on the Day when the Hour is established it will be said, “Enter the people of Pharaoh into the severest torment.</strong></span> [40:46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is three punishments:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: that Allaah drowned them and wiped them out, all of them in a simgle moment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: that they are being punished in the <em>Barzakh </em>until the hour is established.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly</strong>: that when they are raised up on the Day of Resurrection they will enter the severest torment, and Allaah’s refuge is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise will be the case with those who disobey Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam, </em>for his outcome will be more severe than the outcome of the people of Pharaoh, because Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the most excellent one of the Messengers. So whoever disobeys him, his punishment will be worse.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> أَخْذًا وَبِيلًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>With severe punishment </strong></span>[73:16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It means severe and strong with no leniency.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَكَذَٰلِكَ أَخْذُ رَبِّكَ إِذَا أَخَذَ الْقُرَىٰ وَهِيَ ظَالِمَةٌ ۚ إِنَّ أَخْذَهُ أَلِيمٌ شَدِيدٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And thus is the punishment of your Lord when He punishes the towns for their wrongdoing. His punishment is painful and severe</span>.</strong> [11:102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this <em>aayah</em> is a proof for Allaah’s bestowing favour upon us by the sending of the Messenger Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu‘alaihiwasallam </em>to us, and that the purpose behind his being sent is that he should make clear to us the way to worship. So whoever obeys him will enter paradise, and whoever disobeys him will enter the fire, just as the people of Pharoah entered the fire when the disobeyed their messenger Moosaa <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam.</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise the enemies of the Messengers, all of them, this is their way and their path.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Moosaa, the one to whom Allaah spoke directly, the strong and trustworthy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We see that his call was directed to <em>tawheed</em> and carried the lights of guidance and wisdom. Moosaa was brought up and was raised in the palaces of the greatest tyrant who claimed divinity. He knew the various types of corruption, unbelief, tyranny, injustice and despotism from what he witnessed in the palaces. He saw things which it is difficult to imagine or think possible. He also saw the enslavement of his people, the Children of <em>Israa’eel</em>, and their humiliation, and their women taken as slaves, and the killing of their children, to such an extent that it surpassed any oppression known to mankind. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Pharaoh exalted himself haughtily in the land, and divided its people into castes. He enslaved a group of them (i.e., the Children of <em>Israa’eel</em>), killing their sons and letting their women live. He was indeed one of the corrupt evil-doers.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of Pharaoh were also people of <em>shirk</em> and idol-worship without a doubt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">So how did Moosaa begin? Was his call directed to correction of the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of this idolatrous nation? Or did it begin with a demand for the restoration of the rights of the Children of <em>Israa’eel</em>, and a struggle to gain rulership and authority from the hands of the tyrant, and at the head of them Pharaoh, who claimed divinity for himself?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The call of Moosaa was just like the call of his forefathers and brothers from the earlier Prophets. His Lord instructed him and inspired him with the principle of <em>tawheed</em>, and chose him to carry his revelation, and to establish worship of Him. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Has not the story of Moosaa come to you? When he saw a fire and said to his family, ‘Remain where you are for I have seen a fire. Perhaps I can bring a fire-brand from it or find someone who can show us the way.’ So when Moosaa came to the fire his Lord called him, ‘O Moosaa, I am your Lord. Remove your shoes, indeed you are in the purified valley of <em>Tuwaa</em>. I have chosen you as My Messenger, so listen to and heed what I reveal to you. Indeed I am Allaah. None has the right to be worshipped but Me. So worship Me and do not worship anything else besides Me, and establish Prayer for My remembrance. Indeed the Final Hour is certainly coming, which I keep hidden from all except Myself, in order to reward each soul according to its good or bad deeds.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this was the beginning of his Messengership; he was inspired and ordered with the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of <em>tawheed</em>. He was ordered to establish it in himself and to represent it in his life. Then he was entrusted with the duty of calling to this sublime principle and was sent by Allaah to the Pharaoh. Allaah furthermore explained to him the correct manner of giving <em>da’wah</em> and the wise way in which he was to face the Pharaoh. Allaah, the Most High, said:<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Go to Pharaoh who has transgressed all bounds in his haughtiness, pride, unbelief, and say, ‘Will you not purify yourself from the sin of unbelief and be obedient to your Lord? And that I guide you to the worship of your Lord, so that you may submit fearfully to Him and obey Him.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also supported him with his brother Haaroon in order for the proof to be established to the utmost, and He taught them to use gentleness and mildness in <em>da’wah</em> since that is the best way to attain the guidance of those whom Allaah wishes to guide:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Go both of you to Pharaoh, indeed he has transgressed beyond all bounds, and speak mildly with him that he might accept admonition and fear and be obedient to his Lord.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they carried out the order of their Lord and called him to Allaah, hoping for him to be guided and purified, so that he should be one of those who fear Allaah and fear and beware of the evil consequences of <em>shirk</em> and oppression. But he did not respond to this wise and composed call. So Moosaa manifested the great signs and clear proofs of his Prophethood and the truthfulness of his Messengership. But the despotic tyrant Pharaoh merely increased in his transgression and rejection of the truth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“But Pharaoh denied the signs which Moosaa came with and disobeyed his order for him to fear and obey his Lord. Then he turned away from what he ordered him (i.e., obedience to his Lord) and instead worked evil and corruption, and he gathered his people and his followers and said, ‘I am your lord, the most high.’ So Allaah seized him with punishment for his latter and his earlier saying.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Escalation of the Tyranny of the Pharaoh and how Moosaa and his People Faced it with Patient Perseverance and Forbearance</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“The chiefs of Pharaoh’s people said, ‘Will you leave Moosaa and his people to cause mischief in the land when they have abandoned worship of you and worship of your gods?’ He said, ‘We will kill their sons and let their women live, and will have full power over them.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what was the sin of Moosaa and his people in the view of these criminals? No crime except that they called to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and to remain firm upon it, and to disbelieve in Pharaoh and his idols. Then what was the response of Moosaa with respect to these disgraceful and outrageous transgressions which exceeded all bounds in its barbarity and ferocity?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His response was to remain firm upon correct belief, and to have patience and forbearance, and to seek the aid of Allaah in facing these calamities. Then he awaited the good outcome, and victory as a consequence and a good fruit of this remaining firm and this patient perseverance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Moosaa said to his people, ‘Seeks Allaah’s help and be patient, the earth is Allaah’s, He gives it as a heritage to whom He pleases from His servants. The final outcome is in favour of those who fear Allaah by avoiding disobedience of Him and doing what He orders.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then when no hope that the Pharaoh and his people would believe remained, and the suffering which the Children of <em>Israa’eel</em> were subjected to increased in severity, the sole request which Moosaa made to the Pharaoh was that he should allow the Children of <em>Israa’eel</em> the freedom to leave the land of Egypt and emigrate to wherever Allaah willed that they should go, in order to save them from the torment inflicted upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“So go to the Pharaoh, saying, ‘We are the Messengers sent by your Lord, to order you to free the Children of <em>Israa’eel</em>. So release them and cease tormenting them. Indeed we bring you a clear sign from your Lord, and peace and safety from Allaah’s punishment are for those who follow the guidance.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was a sublime call to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah containing light and wisdom. It was also accompanied by an eager desire for the guidance of those who were being called, and that they should be purified. It also contained a clear example of the utmost patience and forbearance in enduring great harm, and in facing tyranny and haughty oppression. It also shows the way to face the most difficult situations with wisdom and forbearance, whilst having the strongest hope in Allaah, that He will assist and grant victory to the Believers and destroy the unbelieving oppressors. Including clear lessons for those who make their call purely seeking the Face of Allaah and desire to rectify mankind and to turn to their Lord, and for them to be guided to His Straight Path.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Importance of <em>Tawheedul-Uloohiyyah<br />
</em>(Singling out Allaah with all Worship)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I will discuss <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah with regard to worship (<em>Tawheedul-Uloohiyyah) </em>and its importance because of two reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Firstly</span></strong>, that it is the most important part of the call of the Messengers presented to us in the Qur’aan, and because it was the reason for the continual struggle between them and their enemies, the proud and haughty, and the obstinate, in every nation. It has continued as the reason for conflict until this day, and perhaps it will continue as such until the Day of Resurrection, as a trial and test for the inheritors of the Messengers, and in order to raise their station.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Secondly</span></strong>, the most severe and dangerous deviation afflicting the Muslims in the east and the west is with regard to it, and this affects the majority of the ignorant amongst the Muslims and many of those who are educated and those who associate themselves with knowledge. So we will begin by presenting the calls of the Prophets in general, and then present the call of some of them in particular.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“We sent a Messenger to every nation ordering them that they should worship Allaah alone, obey Him and make their worship purely for Him, and that they should avoid everything worshipped besides Allaah. So from them there were those whom Allaah guided to His religion, and there were those who were unbelievers for whom misguidance was ordained. So travel through the land and see the destruction that befell those who denied the Messengers and disbelieved.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“We did not send any Messenger before you, O Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  , except that We revealed to him that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, so make all of your worship purely for Him.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, says after mentioning a number of stories of the Prophets, <em>alayhimus-salaatu was-salaam:</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“This religion of yours is a single religion, and I am your Lord, so worship Me alone.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“O Messengers, eat from the food which Allaah has made lawful, and do correct and righteous deeds. Indeed, I am fully aware of whatever you do. Indeed this religion of yours is a single religion, and I am your Lord so keep yourselves safe from My punishment by obeying Me.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Katheer said, “Mujaahid, Sa’eed ibn Jubayr, Qataadah and Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Zayd ibn Aslam said about the saying of Allaah, the Most High,  which means, <strong>‘Your religion is one.’</strong>”<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> Then the meaning of these two <em>Aayaat </em>occurs in the <em>Sunnah</em> in his (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   saying, <strong><em>“I am the closest of the people to &#8216;Eesaa ibn Maryam in this world and the Hereafter. The Prophets are brothers, their mothers are different, but their religion is one.”</em></strong><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also Allaah, the Most High, says about the Messengers who were firmest in determination (<em>oolul-&#8216;adham</em>), <em>alayhimus-salaatu was -salaam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Your Lord prescribed for you O people, the same religion which He prescribed for Nooh, and that which We revealed to you O Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> ), and which He prescribed for Ibraaheem, and Moosaa, and ’Eesaa, that you should establish the religion, acting upon what is prescribed, and not split into sects with regard to it. It is intolerable to the polytheists that you call them to sincerely worship Allaah alone and reject worship of all else besides Him. But Allaah chooses for His religion whomever He pleases and He guides those who turn to Him in repentance and obedience, to act in obedience to Him, and to follow the guidance with which He sent His Messenger.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the call of all the Prophets, and at the head of them the Messengers who were firmest in determination. So the Prophets who numbered <strong>one hundred and twenty four thousand</strong> <a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> followed a single methodology in their call, and began from a single starting point which is <em>tawheed</em>, the greatest issue and most important principle which they conveyed to all mankind, throughout the ages and despite their varying societies, lands and times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a proof that this is the single way which must be followed in calling the people to Allaah, and it is something laid down by Allaah to be followed by all of His Prophets and their true and sincere followers. It is not permissible to change or replace it, nor to turn away from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Examples From the Calls of Some of the Messengers</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, has informed us about some of the individuals from the greater Prophets, and how they faced their people. We see that all of them proceeded upon the universal way laid down for them by Allaah and they followed the methodology established for all of them by Allaah. Not a single one of them is at variance with it. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And We sent Nooh to his people saying, ‘I am a clear warner sent to you, that you should worship none besides Allaah. Indeed, if you do not make all your worship purely for Him I fear for you the torment of a painful Day.’ The chiefs of the disbelievers amongst his people said, ‘We see that you are but a man like ourselves and we do not see you followed except by the lowest of the people, in what is apparent to us. Nor do we see that you have any excellence over us, rather we think that you are a liar.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong style="color:#008000;">“And to ’Aad We sent Hood, saying, ‘O my people worship Allaah, making all of your worship purely for Him, since there is none besides Him having the right to be worshipped by you. Will you not fear your Lord?’ The leaders of those who disbelieved amongst his people said, ‘We see you upon error </strong><span style="color:#008000;">(due to your abandonment of our religion and worship of our gods)</span><strong style="color:#008000;"> and we think that you are a liar </strong><span style="color:#008000;">(in claiming to be a Messenger from the Lord of the Worlds).</span><strong style="color:#008000;">’ He said, ‘O my People, I am not upon error, I am indeed a Messenger sent by the Lord of the Worlds. I convey to you the Message of my Lord and am sincere in my advice and faithful to my trust. Do you wonder that Allaah should send admonition for you through a man from amongst you, warning you of Allaah’s punishment and to fear Him? And remember the blessings of Allaah upon you in that He made you successors to the people of Nooh </strong><span style="color:#008000;">(after drowning them for their unbelief and denial of their Messenger)</span><b style="color:#008000;">, and He increased you in height and size. So remember the </b><span style="color:#008000;"><b>favours</b></span><b style="color:#008000;"> bestowed upon you by Allaah, so that you may be successful.’ They said, ‘Do you come to us warning us of punishment from Allaah for that which we practise as religion, so that we should instead worship Allaah alone and forsake what our fathers used to worship? We will not do that, so bring us the punishment which you threaten us with if you are truthful.’ He said, ‘Allaah’s punishment and wrath have become unavoidable for you. Do you dispute with me about mere idols which you and your fathers have given names to, things which can neither bring harm nor benefit, and Allaah has given no proof or excuse for their worship? Then wait for Allaah’s judgement between us, I too shall wait.’ So We saved Hood and those with him through Our Mercy </b><span style="color:#008000;">(due to their eemaan and their worship of Allaah alone)</span><b style="color:#008000;">, and we annihilated those who rejected Our signs and were not Believers.”</b><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the call of the Messengers, all of them followed this methodology in their <em>da’wah</em> to Allaah: they called first to the <em>tawheed </em>of Allaah, and that He alone must be singled out with all worship. Then their people opposed them because of this, except those whom Allaah guided, facing them with mockery, charging them with being liars and seeking to ridicule them. As Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Many Prophets were sent to the earlier peoples, and no Prophet came to them except that the people met him with mockery.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing more severe and hurtful to lofty believing souls than accusations of falsehood, ridicule and mockery. These things are more hurtful to them than being struck with swords and imprisonment and punishment. This fact is mentioned by the Arab poet who said, “<strong>Being harmed by close relatives is more painful to the soul than being struck with a sharpened sword</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">’Aa’ishah, <em>radiyallaahu ’anhaa, </em>asked the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , <em>“Has there been a day more severe upon you than the Day of Uhud?” So he said, “Your tribe has troubled me greatly, and the most troublesome thing which I experienced from them was on the day of ’Aqabah when I presented myself to ’Abd Yaaleel ibn ’Abd Kulaal and he didn&#8217;t respond as I had hoped. So I returned overwhelmed with sorrow and did not recover until I reached Qarnuth-Tha’aalib.</em><a style="color:#333399;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a><em> I raised my head and saw a cloud shading me, then I looked and saw Jibreel in it, and he called me saying, ‘Allaah has heard what your people said to you and their reply, and Allaah has sent the Angel of the mountains to you, for you to order him to do whatever you wish.’ So the Angel of the mountains called me and greeted me with salaam and then said, ‘O Muhammad, Allaah has heard what your people said to you, and I am the Angel of the mountains, and my Lord has sent me to you for you to order me as you wish. So what do you wish?’ So Allaah’s Messenger (</em><em>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</em><em> )   said, “No, rather I hope that from their offspring will come those who will worship Allaah alone and not worship anything else besides Him.”</em></span><a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>hadeeth</em> clearly shows the <em>da’wah</em> of Allaah’s Messenger (ﷺ) and his perseverance in that, and his mildness with his people. See how he was patient with them and asked for them to be spared from destruction which would have wiped them out. He instead hoped for good from Allaah, and hoped that from their offspring would come those who worshipped Allaah alone, not worshipping anything besides Him. Indeed what a noble and lofty goal, which is not realized except by those who taste the blessing of <em>tawheed</em> and know its station.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The books of <em>Seerah</em><a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a> detail some of the answers given by those who mocked him and their scornful stance when he invited them to Islaam. They mention that he went to a number of the nobles and leaders of the tribe of Thaqeef, and they were three brothers, ’Abd Yaleel, Mas&#8217;ood and Habeeb&#8230; and he sat with them and called them to Allaah and asked them to support Islaam and stand with him against those of his people who opposed him. So one of them said, “If it is actually true that Allaah has sent you, then He is tearing down the covering of the Ka’bah.” The second said, “Could Allaah not find anyone to send but you?” The third said, “By Allaah, I will never speak with you. If you are truly a Messenger from Allaah as you claim, then you are more serious than to have me reply to your words, and if you are lying against Allaah then it is not proper that I should ever speak to you.” So Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   left having despaired of good from Thaqeef.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What we see from the <em>hadeeth</em> and the stroy is that mockery and scorn and harm caused by the foolish idolaters was more severe to the Prophets than any other trouble, even more so than the fierce battles in which lives are spent and the blood of their pure companions is shed. Indeed on the Day of Uhud more than seventy Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   were martyred.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a> Amongst them: Mus’ab ibn ’Umayr,<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a> and Hamzah ibn ’Abdil- Muttalib<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a> the paternal uncle of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , and Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   was injured in the face and his incisor was broken.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a> He also suffered along with his Companions at the hands of the hypocrites, and suffered great harm and hardship before that in Makkah, and at Badr and other battles. Yet despite all of this, the severest trouble which he faced was on the Day of Taa’if because of the mockery and contempt which he faced to such a degree that it is unbearable for pure souls. Furthermore Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   said, <em>“<strong>Those who suffered the severest trials are the Prophets, then those who are most like them, then those who are most like them after that.</strong>”</em><a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So those who are most like them, and then those who are next closest are those who proceed upon their methodology in calling to Allaah, and called to what they called to, i.e. to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and that He is to be singled out with all worship, and to rejection of all <em>shirk</em> (attribution of any form or part of worship to anyone besides Allaah). Such people will suffer similar harm and trials as suffered by the Prophets who are their example. It is because of this fact that you see many of the callers departing away from this difficult methodology, and this rugged path, since the caller who follows it will have to face opposition from his mother, his father, his brother, his friends and those whom he loves. He will be opposed by the society which will treat him as an enemy and seek to mock and harm him. So many callers divert their attention to other aspects of Islaam which do have their place, and are not denied by anyone who truly believes in Allaah, except that those aspects do not involve that difficulty and hardship and do not bring about mockery and harm particularly in Islamic societies. This is because the majority of the people of the <em>ummah</em> of Islaam are willing to gather around these type of callers, and they throw praise and honour upon them instead of mockery and harm, unless they pose a threat to the rulers and are a danger to their positions, in which case they suppress them brutally. For example political parties which oppose the rulers and threaten to dethrone them. In such a case the rulers will show no love to relatives or friends, Muslims or disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then in any case we say to those callers: no matter how much noise they make, and no matter how high they raise their voices in the name of Islaam, restrain yourselves because you have left the way prescribed by Allaah and His Straight Path, upon which the Prophets and their followers proceeded in calling to <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and to making the religion purely for Him. So no matter how much you speak and raise your voices in the name of Islaam, you are still deviating from the methodology of the Prophets which was laid down by Allaah. No matter how much effort you expend, and how much you manage to extend your <em>da’wah</em> and your own methodology, you are still preoccupying yourselves with the means to the exclusion of the goal. Then what use are the means<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a> if they merely harm the goal, and they themselves grow at its expense.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed woe to those callers who obstinately persist upon the methodologies which they themselves have innovated, those who fight against the methodology of the Prophets in calling to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah, beneath dazzling banners and slogans which captivate the simple minded and those ignorant of the methodology and way of the Prophets.</p>

Then there were some of us who died not having taken anything from his reward. From them was Mus’ab ibn ’Umayr who was killed on the day of Uhud and did not leave anything behind except a small striped sheet. When we covered his head with it his feet were uncovered, and when we covered his feet with it his head was uncovered. So the Prophet said, ‘Cover his head with it, and place idhkhir (a sweet smelling rush) upon his feet.’”</strong> (Reported by al- Bukhaaree (Eng. trans.5/281/no. 408), Muslim (Eng. trans. 2/446/no. 2050 ), Ahmad and an- Nasaa’ee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref18" name="_ftn18">[18]</a> The story of his martyrdom is to be found in <em>Saheeh al-Bukhaaree</em> (Eng. trans. 5/74-277/no. 399 ) and the <em>Musnad</em> of Imaam Ahmad (3/500-501).</p>

But Tirmidhee’s declaration of its direct authenticity is debatable, and it as if he took into account other witnesses for it, since there are other supporting narrations for it:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) From Aboo Sa’eed al-Khudree, reported by Ibn Maajah (no. 4024), and its chain of narration is declared <em>saheeh</em> in <em>az-Zawaa’id</em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 19 : Point 20</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have eemaan in the Prophets and in the Angels.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F365836907&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/eemaan-in-the-prophets-and-in-the-angels" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From that fundamentals of eemaan and the pillars of eemaan is to have eemaan in the malaa·ikah (Angels) and in the anbiyaa (Prophets). And this is as occurs in the hadeeth of Jibreel <em>`alayhis-salaam</em>, when he said to the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, “Inform me about eemaan (true faith). So he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“(It) is that you truly believe in Allaah and His Angels and in His Books and in His Messengers and in the Last Day and that you truly believe in pre decree, the good of it and the bad of it.”</span></strong> [01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in the Qur&#8217;aan,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Righteousness is not that you turn your faces either to the east or to the west. But rather righteousness is the righteousness of the one who truly believes in Allaah and in the Last Day and in the Angels and in the Book and in the Prophets.</strong></span> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 177)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The Messenger believes in that which was sent down to him from his Lord and also the believers. All of them believe truly in Allaah and in His Angels and in His Books and in His Messengers. They say, we do not make any distinction in believing between any of His Messengers. And they say we hear and we obey.</strong> </span>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 285)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, we truly believe in Allaah and in what was send down to us and in what was send down to Ibraaheem and Ismaa`eel and Is&#8217;haaq and Ya`qoob and to the Tribes and what Moosaa and `Eesaa were given and what the Prophets were given from their Lord. We do not make any distinction </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(with regard to believing)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> between any of them. And we submit as Muslims to Him.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 136)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory to have <em>eemaan</em> in the Angels, all of them. Those whom Allaah has named from them and those whom He has not named. And the <em>malaa&#8217;ikah</em> (the Angels) is the plural of <em>malak</em>. And they are species of being from the world of the hidden and the unseen. Allaah created them from light. Then as for the Jinn, then Allaah created them from fire. And as for mankind then Allaah created them from teen (clay) and then from a feeble fluid, just as Allaah the Perfect and Most High mentioned. So a person must have <em>eemaan</em> in the Angels all of them, those whom Allaah has named from them and those He has not named. We believe in all of them. As for one who believes in some of them and disbelieves in others, then he is a disbeliever in all of them (a <em>kaafir</em>). He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say, whoever is an enemy to Jibreel, then he </strong>(Jibreel)<strong> brought it (the Qur&#8217;aan) down to your heart by the permission of Allaah, confirming that which came before it and a guidance and glad tidings for the believers. Whoever is an enemy to Allaah and to his Angels and to His Messengers and to Jibreel and to Meekaal then Allaah is an enemy to the disbelievers.</strong></span> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayahs 97 &#8211; 98)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the person who disbelieves in a single Angel from the Angels, he is a disbeliever in all of the Angels. Such as the Jews, those who say, &#8220;<em>Jibreel is an enemy to us. If the one who came down to Muhammad had been other than Jibreel, we would have obeyed him. However Jibreel came down to him and he is our enemy. So we will not believe in him.”</em> [02] So therefore Allaah sent down this aayah. [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, whoever is an enemy to Jibreel, then he brought it down to your heart by the permission of Allaah</span></strong> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 97)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it (the Revelation) is not from Jibreel. Rather it is from Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. And Jibreel was only a messenger from Allaah entrusted with bringing the Revelation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And amongst the deviant sects who ascribe themselves to Islaam are those who say that Jibreel betrayed his trust, because Messengership should have gone to `Alee. However, (they say) Jibreel betrayed his trust and gave it instead to Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. Their poet said, “The trustworthy one was treacherous (Jibreel) and he withheld it from Haydar,” meaning from `Alee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author said, <strong>“That we have eemaan in the Messengers (rusul) and in the Prophets (anbiyaa·).”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Prophet (<em>nabeey</em>) is one who had a Revealed Way sent to him, but he was not commanded to convey it to others. Whereas a Messenger (<em>rasool</em>) was one who had a Revealed Way sent to him by Revelation and he was commanded to convey it.[04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Whoever is an enemy to Jibreel, then he brought it down to your heart by the permission of Allaah</strong></span> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 97)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the difference between <em>an-nabeey</em> (Prophet) and <em>ar-rasool</em> (Messenger) is that a Messenger (<em>rasool</em>) is sent with a Revealed Way, sent down to him. Contrary to a Prophet (<em>nabeey</em>), for he is sent with a Revealed Way sent down to Messengers who came before him, like the Prophets of the Banoo Israa·eel (Children of Israa&#8217;eel); because they were sent with the message of Moosaa <em>`alayhis-salaam</em>, with the Towraat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">We sent down the Towraat which contained Guidance and Light by which the Prophets, those who submitted to Allaah, judged for the Jews and the rabbis and also the priests</span></strong> (Sooratul-Maa·ida (5), aayah 44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they judged by the Towraat which had been sent down to Moosaa `alayhis-salaam and they did not come with an independent Legislation. Contrary to a Messenger (rasool), for he comes with an independent Legislation and he is commanded to convey it. But as for a Prophet (nabeey), he is commanded to convey the Message from someone before him, and Revelation might be sent to him with regard to a specific matter. This is the difference.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Muhammad Amaan al-Jaami`</strong> rahimahullaah said in his explanation of the Three Principles, <em>“They disagree with regard to the difference between a Prophet (nabeey) and a Messenger (rasool). So some of them define it and say: a Prophet is one who is sent with a Message to act upon it, but he was not given the duty of calling to it. However the second definition is that a Prophet (nabeey) is one who was sent with a Message of someone who was before him and he does not have his own independent Message, as was the case with many Prophets from the Banoo Israa·eel. And the second definition is more befitting whereas the first one is what is famous.”</em> (He goes on to mention that it is not befitting to say a nabeey is one who has Revelation but he does not have to convey it to anyone).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whoever disbelieves in a single Prophet, then he is a disbeliever in all of them. He is a disbeliever even in the Prophet who he claims that he believes in, because the Prophets were all brothers. He <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008080;"><strong>The Prophets were brothers with different mothers.</strong> </span>[05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They were a single chain. Their way was one. So whoever denies a single one of them, then he is denying all of them, because what this one had, the other one had. All of them were Messengers from Allaah. So the person who claims that he believes in Moosaa, such as the Jews, but then disbelieves in `Eesaa and in Muhammad <em>`alayhimus-salaatu was-salaam</em> then those people are disbelievers (<em>kaafiroon</em>) in all of the Prophets, even in the Prophet who they claim they are believing in. And he was Moosaa <em>`alayhis-salaam</em>. Because the book which Moosaa came with contained a mention of Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The one (the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) whom they find written down with them in the Towraat and in the Injeel. He commands them with the good and he forbids them from the evil. And he declares lawful for them the good and pure things. And he forbids the filthy and evil things for them. And he releases them from the burdens and the fetters that were upon them. So those who believe in him and honour him and aid him and who follow the Light which came down with him, then they will be the successful ones.</span></strong> (Sooratul-A`raaf (7), aayah 157)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Those to whom we gave the Scripture they know him (the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) just as they recognize their own sons.</strong> </span>(Sooratul- Baqarah (2), aayah 146)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However envy (<em>hasad</em>) led them to disbelieve in Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> because they wanted that Prophethood should not depart from the Banoo Israa&#8217;eel. So therefore they sought to monopolize the bounty of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Or do they envy the people for that which Allaah gave to them from His bounty.</strong></span> (Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), aayah 54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what led them do this was <em>al-hasad</em> (envy) and transgression. Otherwise they knew that he was indeed the Messenger of Allaah because they found him written in the Towraat and in the Injeel. Likewise `Eesaa <em>`alayhis-salaam</em> he foretold of the good news of the coming of Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And remember when `Eesaa ibn Maryam said, O Children of Israa·eel, I am Allaah’s Messenger to you, confirming what came before me from the Towraat and giving news of the coming of a Messenger who will come after me whose name will be Ahmad.</span></strong> (Sooratus-Saff (61), aayah 6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And who is this Messenger who came after `Eesaa? No Messenger came after `Eesaa, except for Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his name was Ahmad and his name was Muhammad. He had many names. So the person who disbelieves in `Eesaa he is a disbeliever in all of them. And the one who disbelieves in Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is a disbeliever in all of them. And therefore He, the Majestic and Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The people of Nooh denied the Messengers</span></strong><br />
(Sooratush-Shu`araa· (26), aayah 105)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though the first of the Messengers was Nooh and they denied Nooh. However He said that they denied the Messengers, meaning those who came after him, because whoever denies one Messenger then he has denied all of the Messengers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The people of `Aad denied the Messengers</span></strong><br />
(Sooratush-Shu`araa· (26), aayah 123)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Thamood denied the Messengers</span> </strong><br />
(Sooratush-Shu`araa· (26), aayah 141)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The people of al-Aykah (people of Madyan) denied the Messengers</strong> </span>(Sooratush-Shu`araa· (26), aayah 176)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a person who disbelieves in one, he is a disbeliever in all of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Those who disbelieve in Allaah and in His Messengers and they wish to make a difference between believing in Allaah and in His Messengers and they say, we will believe in some and disbelieve in others. They want to take a way in between. They are the disbelievers in truth.</strong> </span>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), aayahs 150 – 151)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though they believed in some of them, however believing in some is not sufficient. There must be <em>eemaan</em> in all of them, because they are all Messengers from Allaah. All of them came from Allaah the Perfect and Most High. The earlier ones of them foretold the later ones. And the later ones of them believed in the first ones <em>`alayhimus-salaatu was-salaam</em>. This is the position of the Muslims and of the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] Reported by Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 8) as hadeeth of Umar ibnul-Khattaab radiyAllaahu`anh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] The like of this story was reported by Imaam Ahmad in his Musnad, volume 1 page 274.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] Reported by al-Bukhaaree as a hadeeth of `Abdullaah ibn Salaam that he said about Jibreel, <strong>“That is the enemy to the Jews from the Angels.”</strong> So therefore he <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> recited this aayah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04]<strong> Translator’s side point:</strong> Some of the other scholars mention a slightly different definition, amongst them Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymeeyah in his book an-Nuboowaat, where he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em> “A Prophet (nabeey) is one whom Allaah the Most High has sent with a Revealed Way (Legislation) which Allaah commands him to convey to his own followers, but not to the opponents. Whereas a Messenger is one whom Allaah the Most High sent with Revelation (a Revealed Way) to call all of the people in his time to, whether they are opponents or those who agree with him, whether it is a new Revealed Way or one from before.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[05] Reported by al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh (no. 3443) and reported by Muslim (no. 2365) as a hadeeth of Aboo Hurayrah radiyAllaahu`anh. And the wording of al-Bukhaaree is: <strong>“The Prophets are </strong>[lit. paternal] <strong>brothers, their mothers are different, but their Religion is one.”</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Yoosuf (عليه السلام)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The noble one, son of the noble one, son of the noble one.[1] About whom Allaah sent down a long <em>Soorah</em> relating his noble life to us, and its stages, from his childhood to his death, and how his circumstances changed, and the difficulties that he faced, and how he faced everything with the Strength of Prophethood and his patient perseverance, wisdom and mildness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yoosuf, <em>’alayhis-salaam, </em>saw the corrupt outlook of the Pharaohs in Egypt and their oppression, and he knew the beliefs of the nation amongst whom he lived. He knew the corruption of their beliefs and their idolatry, which led them to take idols and cattle as gods to worship besides Allaah. The stroy of this noble Prophet, <em>‘alayhis-salaam, </em>is long, and from it, we will examine the story of his imprisonment and his <em>da’wah</em> at that time. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And two young men entered the prison along with him. One of them said, ‘I saw in a dream that I was pressing grapes,’ and the other one said, ‘I saw in a dream that I was carrying bread upon my head and birds were eating from it.’ ‘Inform us of the interpretation of this for indeed we see that you are one of the doers of good.’ He said, ‘No food will come to you to eat except that I will inform you about it fully before it comes to you. This is from the knowledge which my Lord has taught me as I have remained free of the religion of a people who do not believe in the oneness of Allaah and who are disbelievers in the Hereafter. Rather I follow the religion of my fathers, Ibraaheem, Ishaaq and Ya&#8217;qoob. It is not fitting that we should worship anything else along with Allaah. This is from Allaah’s favour upon us and upon the people, yet most of the people do not give thanks for Allaah’s favours. O my two companions in the prison, is it better that you worship many different lords, or that you worship only Allaah, the One, Who subdues and has full power over everything? You do not worship besides Allaah except idols which you call gods, which you and your forefathers give names to, for which Allaah has sent down no authority. Authority is for Allaah alone. He ordered that you worship none but Him, that is the Straight and true religion, yet most of the people do not know (and are people of <em>shirk)</em>.’”</strong>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This noble Prophet, <em>’alayhis-salaam, </em>lived in their palaces and was therefore well aware of the corruption of their administration and their rulers. He experienced at first hand their plots, their oppression, their unjust persecution and imprisonment by them. Furthermore he lived amongst an idolatrous nation who worshipped idols, cattle and stars. So where was correction to begin? What was the starting point?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff9900;">Did he begin calling to Allaah, whilst he was wrongfully imprisoned along with others who were oppressed like him, by inciting them and rousing them against the despotic and tyrant rulers? This would be without a doubt a political response, and was an opportunity open to him. Or did he begin his call from the starting point adopted by his noble forefathers, and at the head of them Ibraaheem, the chosen and beloved Friend of Allaah and the <em>Imaam</em> of the call to <em>tawheed</em>; which was the starting point for all the Messengers of Allaah? There is no doubt that the single way of correction and rectification in every time and place is the way of calling to correct <em>‘aqeedah</em> and <em>tawheed</em> and that all worship should be made purely and sincerely for Allaah alone.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore Yoosuf began from this starting point, following his noble fathers, proud of their <em>‘aqeedah</em>, and deriding and exposing the foolishness of the idolaters and their practice of taking idols, cattle and stars as lords to be worshipped besides Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So after clearly explaining this, and openly calling to <em>tawheed</em> and to rejection of <em>shirk</em>, he emphasised his call and his argument by his saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Authority and command is for Allaah alone.”</strong>[3], [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he explained this authority and command to mean the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah, and that He alone is to be worshipped:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“&#8230;That is the Straight and true reigion, yet most of the people do not know (and are people of <em>shirk)</em>.”</strong>[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also Yoosuf, <em>’alayhis-salaam, </em>attained the highest position in this state[6] whilst calling to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and establishing the clear proofs for his call and his Prophethood. Allaah, the Most High, says, in explanation of this,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The king of Egypt said, ‘Bring him to me, I will make him my personal servant.’ So when he spoke to Yoosuf, he said, ‘Verily, this day you have with us a position of rank and full trust.’ He said, ‘Place me in charge of the storehouses and wealth of the land, indeed I will guard them faithfully and with full knowledge.’”</strong>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said, giving thanks to his Lord and Protector,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O my Lord, You have bestowed upon me something of dominion and have taught me the interpretation of dreams. O Originator and Creator of the heavens and the earth, You are my Lord and Protector in this world and the Hereafter. Cause me to die as a Muslim and join me with the righteous.”</strong>[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore Allaah says in explanation of his <em>da’wah</em>, upon the tongue of the Believer from the family of the Pharaoh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And Yoosuf came to you previously (before Moosaa) with clear signs yet you have not ceased doubting about what he came to you with. Until when he died you said, ‘Allaah will not send any Messenger after him.’ This is the state of those whom Allaah leads astray, those who are disbelievers in Him and doubt the truthfulness of the Messengers.”</strong>[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from the knowledge to be learned from the life-story of Yoosuf, <em>’alayhis-salaam, </em>which is presented to us in those noble <em>Aayaat</em> is that the call to <em>tawheed</em> is something very essential. Furthermore there is to be no leniency or relaxation in fighting against <em>shirk</em>, it is not permissible to keep silent about it, whatever the circumstances of the caller to Allaah; rather it is not permissible for any Muslim to ever accept it or be relaxed about it. So this shows the high station of <em>‘aqeedah</em>, and its importance with Allaah, and with His Prophets and His Messenger. It also shows the very great difference and the distance between it and the details of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible for the Muslim, particularly the caller, to take up any position which violates his <em>‘aqeedah</em> or is contrary to it, or that he is a fortune-teller, those who are <em>Mushriks</em>, or that he is a custodian of their idols. If he does any of this then he is one of the misguided <em>Mushriks.</em> With regard to the legislative aspect, if the Islamic state is established, it must apply the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> of Allaah, otherwise:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed then they are the ones guilty of unbelief.”</strong>[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The unbelief (<em>kufr</em>) here is explained in detail by the scholars of Islaam, from the Companions and others, that it may be major <em>Kufr</em>, when the person disdains the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> of Allaah and declares it lawful to judge by something else, and it may be lesser <em>Kufr</em> (i.e., that which does not take a person out of Islaam) when he does not declare it lawful to judge by other than it, but gives in to his desires and because of that judges by other than what Allaah sent down.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However when the Islamic state has not been established, then Allaah does not a burden a soul with more than it is capable of. So the Muslim may take up a position in a non-Muslim state with the condition that he establishes justice, and that he does not obey them ina matter which involves disobedience to Allaah, and does not judge by other than what Allaah sent down. This was what the Prophet of Allaah, Yoosuf, did. He took up a position as a deputy for a unbelieving king, and he did not judge according to his laws:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“He could not have taken and kept his brother according to the king’s law.”</strong>[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, he established justice between the subjects and called them to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah. So this contains a decisive reply to those who give little importance to the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of <em>Tahweed</em>. Those who gloss over and accomodate when it comes to the <em>shirk</em> which has filled the world, and they regard the callers to <em>tawheed</em> and the enemies of <em>shirk</em> with contempt and scorn. They turn up their noses and are too proud to ‘lower’ themselves to the level of the callers to <em>tawheed</em>, and they are very wily and astute concerning political affairs, but nothing is more burdensome and disagreeable to their hearing and their hearts than listening to or saying a word regarding <em>tawheed</em> or <em>shirk.</em> These types of callers have caused themselves to fall into a deep abyss, whilst they think that they have reached the highest peaks. Can a people ever prosper whose stance with regard to the call of the Prophets is like this, unless they sincerely repent to Allaah from what they are upon?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] As indicated in the <em>hadeeth</em> of Ibn ’Umar, <em>radiyallaahu ’anhumaa, </em>from the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) that he said, “<strong>The noble one, son of the noble one, son of the noble one: Yoosuf the son of Ya’qoob, the son of Ishaaq, the son of Ibraaheem, </strong><em><strong>’alayhis-salaam.</strong>” </em>Reported by al-Bukhaaree (Eng. trans. 4/390/596), and Ahmad in <em>al-Musnad</em> (2/96), and also the <em>hadeeth</em> of Aboo Hurairah, <em>radiyallaahu ’anhu, </em>that Allaah’s Messenger (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) was asked about the noblest of the people, so he said, <em>“Those most pious and obedient to Allaah.” They said, “It is not this that we are asking about.” He said, “Then the noblest of the people is Yoosuf, the Prophet of Allaah, son of the Prophet of Allaah, son of the Prophet of Allaah, son of the chosen and beloved Friend of Allaah.” They said, “It is not this that we are asking about.” He said, “Then is it about the origins of the Arabs that you ask? Then the people are of various origins. The best of them in the times of ignorance are the best of them in Islaam when they attain knowledge and understanding in the religion.”</em> Reported by al-Bukhaaree (Eng. trans. 4/390/597).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Soorah Yoosuf (12):36-40.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Soorah Yoosuf (12):40.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] This <em>Aayah</em> is one of the basic principles from the principles of <em>tawheed</em>, as Allaah has explained upon the tongue of Yoosuf, <em>’alayhis-salaam. </em>What is most unfortunate is that you see that many of the political reformers have explained it in a way that is far removed from its primary meaning, that all worship is to be made purely and sincerely for Allaah alone, and have instead explained it to have a political meaning, which is establishment of the state which they claim will establish Allaah’s <em>Sharee’ah</em> upon the earth as His deputies/vicegerents. Then they go beyond bounds in this direction till they cause the people to forget the principal meaning of the <em>Aayah</em>, and they understand nothing from it except this new meaning, and there is no action and no ability except by the will of Allaah. They do the same with all or most of the <em>Aayaat</em> of <em>tawheed</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Soorah Yoosuf (12):40.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah, <em>rahimahullaah, </em>said in <em>al-Hisbah</em> (p.7), “Likewise Yoosuf the truthful and honest, was a minister for the Pharaoh of Egypt, and he and his people were <em>mushriks</em>. So Yoosuf performed whatever justice and good he was able to and called them as far as possible to correct <em>eemaan</em>.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibraaheem</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Father of the Prophets and the Leader of those who worship Allaah alone, upon the true religion, Ibraaheem, the Chosen and Beloved Friend of Allaah (<em>Khaleelullaah</em>), who was such that Allaah ordered the best of the Messengers and the final Prophet, and his <em>ummah</em>, to emulate him, to take his call as an example, and to follow his way and methodolgy.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And remember when Ibraaheem said to his father Aazar, ‘Will you take idols for worship? Indeed I see that you and those who worship idols along with you are upon clear error.’ Likewise We showed Ibraaheem the heavens and the earth (and how they are a proof that the Creator alone should be worshipped), so that he should be one of those who have Faith with certainty. So when the night covered him with darkness he saw a star and said, (as an argument to show his people the error of worshipping anything besides Allaah), ‘This is (what you claim to be) my Lord?!’ Then when it set, he said, ‘I do not love that which passes away.’ Then when he saw the moon rising up he said, ‘This is (what you claim to be) my Lord?!’ Then when it set he said, ‘If my Lord did not keep me firm upon the guidance then I would surely be one of the misguided.’ Then when he saw the sun, he said, ‘This is (what you claim to be) my Lord?! This is greater than the others.’ Then when it set he said, ‘O my people, I am free from all that you associate as partners in worship with Allaah. Indeed I have turned my face in worship to Him who has created the heavens and the earth, making all worship purely for Him, and I am not from those who worship anything besides Allaah.’”</strong>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this was a fervent, vigorous and incessant call to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah, and to make all of religion purely for Him, and to the elimination and rejection of <em>shirk</em>. It begins with the family and extends to the nations, waging war upon <em>shirk</em> and the idols and shaking the very foundations of attribution of any worship to the stars. So the chosen and beloved Friend of Allaah proceeded upon the soundest way in debating and arguing in order to establish Allaah’s Proof and to refute <em>shirk</em> and to show its fallacy and reject the doubts used to support it. So his use of the word ‘idols’ shows contempt for their phoney and supposed gods, and an exposure of their foolishness. He observed the aforementioned celestial bodies one after the other, each one succeeded the previous one which set and became absent, in order to use their condition as a clear proof of the fallacy of their having any divinty or right to worship as his people claimed. Who was it who protected and guarded them and controlled their affairs and the affairs of the creation when they passed and set?! Therefore they must reject the false divinity and right to worship which they claimed for them and disbelieve in that. It was upon them to wash their hands of them and turn instead to their true God, He Who created and brought into existence the heavens and the earth. He Who does not pass away or depart. He Who knows all about their condition and is fully aware of all their movements and periods of rest. He Who protects and preserves them and controls their affairs. They were strong proofs extracted from the situation they experienced and the visible creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And recite to your people from the Book (the Qur’aan), O Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  , about Ibraaheem. He was one who was fully truthful and one sent as a Prophet by Allaah. When he said to his father, ‘Why do you worship that which cannot hear, nor see, nor benefit you, nor remove any harm from you at all?! O my father, Allaah has given me knowledge which has not come to you, so accept the sincere advice I give you, and I will show you the Straight Way, upon which you will not go astray. O my father, do not worship Satan (by obeying him in his call for you to worship the idols) &#8211; indeed Satan is one disobedient to the Most Merciful (Allaah). O my father, I fear for you, knowing that if you die upon attribution of partners to Allaah in worship, and upon worship of Satan, that Allaah’s punishment and torment will be upon you, and that you will merely be a companion of Satan in the Hell-fire.’ He replied, ‘Do you reject my gods, O Ibraaheem? If you do not cease abusing and reviling them I will certainly revile you. Go away from me if you wish to remain safe from me.’ Ibraaheem said, ‘But you are safe from me harming you, I will rather ask my Lord to guide you and forgive your sins. He has always been most Gracious and Kind to me. I shall keep away from you and all that you worship besides Allaah, and I will worship and invoke my Lord, making all of worship purely for Him. I hope that I shall not be one unblest in my worship and supplications.’ So when he separated himself from them and all that they worshipped besides Allaah, We gave him a family who were better than them, Ishaaq and Ya&#8217;qoob, and we made all of them Prophets, and we bestowed our mercy upon them all, and granted them renown and praise upon the tongues of the people.”</strong>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this was a fervent call to <em>tawheed</em>, established firmly upon knowledge, reason and intellect, and upon good and sound manners. Guiding the misguided to the Straight Path. It was opposed by blind bigotry and partisanship, based upon desires, ignorance, stubborness and obsinate pride: otherwise how could anyone worship and humble themselves to those who cannot hear, nor see, nor help them in any way?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the knowledge of <em>tawheed</em>, O reader, is that knowledge which all the Prophets were honoured with, and with it they assaulted falsehood, ignorance and shirk. So ignorance of this knowledge, the knowledge carried by the Prophets, which guides to the truth and saves from misguidance and shirk, ignorance of this is fatal and is a deadly poison which kills the intellect and the ability to think.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O my Father, Allaah has given me knowledge which has not come to you, accept the sincere advice which I give to you, and I will show you the Straight Way, upon which you will not go astray.”</strong>[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then after these robust efforts in <em>da’wah</em> expended by Ibraaheem in calling to Allaah, calling the family and the nation, establishing the irrefutable proofs upon his father and his people, after this he took this great call and confronted that haughty and tyrannical ruler who claimed divinity, he faced him with the full strength and bravery. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Do you not consider the one (Namrood) who, because Allaah had granted him an extended kingdom disputed with Ibraaheem about his Lord. Ibraaheem said to him, ‘It is my Lord (Allaah) Who gives life and death.’ He said, ‘I give life and cause death.’ Ibraaheem said, ‘Allaah causes the sun to rise from the east, so if you are truthful then cause it to rise from the west.’ So the unbeliever was confounded, and Allaah does not guide the unbelievers to find proof against the people of truth.”</strong>[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Ibraaheem called this tyrant and claimant to divinity to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah, and to <em>eemaan</em> in His Lordship. But he exceeded all bounds in his arrogance and haughtily refused to accept the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and to give up on his claims to Lordship. So Ibraaheem debated with him in this brilliant manner whose proof was clear. Ibraaheem said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“It is my Lord (Allaah) Who gives life and death.”</strong>[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the stupid tyrant replied that he too could give life and death &#8211; meaning that he killed whom he pleased and spared whom he pleased. This answer of his was merely a pretence and a means of fooling the ignorant, and was a way of avoiding the question, since what Ibraaheem referred to was the fact that his Lord created mankind, animals and plants and gave them life, and brought them into existence from nothing. Then He causes them to die with His Power, and that He gives the humans and animals death at the end of their appointed life-spans, due to visible causes which He shows and without visible causes. So when Ibraaheem saw that he tried to create a pretence to evade the issue, which might fool some of the ignorant and common folk, he then said, as a means of showing the futility of what his saying entailed, that if you are as you claim, then,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“‘Allaah causes the sun to rise from the east, so if you are truthful then cause it to rise from the west.’ So the unbeliever was confounded.”</strong>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the unbeliever was left confounded and at a loss for words. His argument was overthrown, he was silenced, struck dumb and falsehood was rendered futile as is always the case. So this contains a lesson for those who listen attentively and witness it, that the call to <em>tawheed</em> represents the peak of sincerity, wisdom and intelligence; it proceeds in the due and correct manner, and as Allaah has willed, not merely struggling for kingship, nor seeking to fight for leadership.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the goal of Ibraaheem had been to attain rulership and authority he would have taken a different methodology to this, and he would have found people who gathered around him and supported him. But Allaah refuses, and His Prophets and the pious callers from the true followers of the Prophets in every time and place, they all refuse except to follow the way of guidance and truth, and to clearly proclaim the truth and to establish the proof against the proud and obstinate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Ibraaheem established this great obligation in the best and most complete manner. He established the proof upon his father and his people, upon those who governed them and upon all of his nation. Then when he saw that they were persisting in their <em>shirk</em> and their unbelief and were established upon falsehood and misguidance, he resorted to censure and correction by means of the hand and use of strength. So where did his change and correction begin, and what was the correct and rightly guided means for correction of the dire situation which had beset his nation? Did he seek to overthrow the state because it was the root of all the evils and corruption and the source of <em>shirk</em> and misguidance?! How can that be denied when the ruler claimed lordship for himself and persisted in that claim? So why did Ibraaheem not consider a revolution against this unbelieving government, and at the head of it a tyrant who claimed divinity, and by so doing wipe out all the forms of corruption and <em>shirk</em>, and establish in its place the divinely-guided state headed by Ibraaheem, ’<em>alayhis-salaatu was-salaam</em>?! The answer is the Prophets were far removed from following any such way or even considering it, since this is the way of the oppressors, the ignorant and the foolish, those who seek after this world and strive for authority in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather the Prophets were callers to <em>tawheed</em> and pioneers guiding to the truth, and seeking to save the people from falsehood and <em>shirk</em>. So when they applied themselves to correction and changing the state of affairs, and they were the most knowledgeable and intelligent of the people, then they necessarily began with striking at the true sources of <em>shirk</em> and misguidance. This is what Ibraaheem, the mild, wise and rightly guided, the heroic and brave, did. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“We guided Ibraaheem to the truth at a young age before the time of Moosaa and Haaroon, and We knew that he was fitting for that and was a person of true and certain <em>eemaan</em> who would worship Allaah alone and not associate any partner with Him. When he said to his father and his people, ‘What are these idols which you worship and are devoted to?!’ They said, ‘We found our fathers worshipping them and have followed them in that.’ He said, ‘Both you and they in worshipping the idols are in clear error.’ They said, ‘Are you serious in your saying that you have come with the truth, or are you merely being frivolous?’ He said, ‘Rather, I bring you the truth. Your Lord, other than Whom none has the right to be worshipped, is the sole Lord and Creator of the heavens and the earth, He Who created you all, not any of the idols to which you are devoted. I am a witness to the fact that none but Him is deserving of your worship.’ Ibraaheem said in secret (but was overheard by a single man from his people), ‘By Allaah, I intend to destroy their idols when they go off to their festival.’ So he broke them to pieces except for the largest of them (upon which he tied the axe with which he had broken the others), so that they might take heed and abandon worship of their idols after witnessing their weakness and futility. The people said, ‘Who has done this to our gods?! Whoever has done it is certainly a criminal.’ Those who had heard the saying of Ibraaheem said, ‘We heard a youth speaking, he is called Ibraaheem.’ They said, ‘Bring him before the eyes of the people, that they may testify against him.’ They said, ‘Is it you who did this to our gods, O Ibraaheem?’ He said, ‘Rather this one, the largest of them did it. Ask the idols who had it done to them, if it is that they can speak.’ So they turned to themsleves and said, ‘You know that they are unable to speak.’ He said, ‘Then will you worship besides Allaah that which cannot benefit you at all, nor harm you. Woe to you and the idols which you worship besides Allaah. Have you no sense to see the futility of your worship of the idols?’ They said, ‘Burn him and aid your gods, if you do indeed wish to aid them and continue to worship them.’ We said, ‘O fire, be cool and safe for Ibraaheem.’ They wished to cause harm to him, but it was they whom We caused to be the losers.”</strong>[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah guided Ibraaheem to the truth knowing that he was fitting for that. This wise and rightly-guided Prophet faced corruptions in beliefs (<em>’aqeedah</em>) and corruption in rule and authority. A nation whose thinking was degenerate, people whose minds were astray, so that they worshipped idols in the form of pieces of wood, rocks and stars. They were also ruled by a corrupt and evil government lead by a tyrant who claimed divinity, yet the people submitted to his leadership. So where was Ibraaheem to begin his correction? Should he have begun by attacking the ruler, since for certain he had ruled by other than the revelaed Law of Allaah and ruled by the laws of ignorance. There is no doubt about that. He also openly claimed Lordship and the right to make and lay down the law. Or should he have begun with correction of beliefs (<em>‘aqeedah</em>). Correcting the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of the nation and the <em>‘aqeedah </em>of the government of ignorance?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur’aan informs us that this rightly-guided Prophet, the <em>Imaam</em> of the Prophets, began with correction of <em>‘aqeedah</em>, that is the call to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah, and to make all worship purely and sincerely for Him alone, and fighting and wiping out <em>shirk</em>, and demolishing its causes, and tearing it out from the roots. So that is what he did: he called them to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah, and to renounce the worship of everything besides Him. He argued with them about this matter and they argued with him. But he refuted them with powerful arguments and clear proofs, and he stripped them of everything they sought to use as a proof until they admitted their wrongdoing, misguidance, and their blind-following and stubborn and fatal acceptance of the ways of their forefathers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“They said, ‘We found our fathers worshipping them and have followed them in that.’”</strong>[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when Ibraaheem saw obstinate following of desires and intellects as hard as rock, he made a wise and brave plan to destroy their idols. He carried out this plan with full vigour, bravery and courage. Then this heroic act[10] incited the government and the nation against him, and they called him for judgement in public and laid down the charge before him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Is it you who did this to our gods, O Ibraaheem?”</strong>[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he responded to them in a mocking and sarcastic manner,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Rather this one, the largest of them did it. Ask the idols who had it done to them, if it is that they can speak.”</strong>[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this mocking reply was like a thunder-bolt striking their imbecilic minds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Then they relapsed and said, ‘You know that they are unable to speak.’”</strong>[13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when he had divested them of the weapon of argument, they resorted to using force, the weapon used by everyone lacking proof in every time and place,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“They said, ‘Burn him and aid your gods, if you do indeed wish to aid them and continue to worship them.’”</strong>[14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But Allaah saved His chosen and beloved friend, Ibraaheem, and He threw back the plot of the unbelievers upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“We said, ‘O fire, be cool and safe for Ibraaheem.’ They wished to cause harm to him, but it was they whom we caused to be the losers.”</strong>[15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the fact that Ibraaheem was saved from harm in that huge fire, which Allaah caused to become cool and safe for Ibraaheem, was a very great sign, indeed one of the greatest of Allaah’s signs proving his Prophet hood, his truthfulness, and the correctness of what he came with, i.e., <em>tawheed</em> and the declaration of the fultility of the <em>shirk</em> and misguidance which his people were upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah rewarded Ibraaheem, <em>’alayhis-salaam, </em>for this wise <em>da’wah</em>, and this outstanding <em>jihaad</em> and sacrifice,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“We saved Ibraaheem and Loot from their enemies and took them to the land which We have blessed for all the worlds. And We bestowed upon him Ishaaq (his son) and Ya&#8217;qoob (his grandson) as an extra favour upon him. And We made all of them those who acted in obedience to Allaah and avoided what He forbade. And We made them leaders to be followed, guiding the people according to Our orders and calling them to worship and obey Allaah. And We inspired in them the doing of those deeds which are good, and establishment of the Prayer, and payment of the <em>Zakaat</em>. And they were worshippers of Us alone.”</strong>[16]</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] As indicated by the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Then We revealed to you, O Muhammad (*), that you should follow the religion of Ibraaheem who was a Muslim upon the true religion and was not one of those who worshipped idols and associated partners with Allaah.”</strong> [Soorah an-Nahl (16):123].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Say, O Muhammad (*): Allaah has indeed spoken the Truth, so follow the religion of Ibraaheem who was upright, upon the religion of Islaam, and he did not make any share of his worship for any created being.”</strong> [Soorah Aal-’Imraan (3):95].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Soorah al-An’aam (6):74-79.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Soorah Maryam (19):41-50.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] Soorah al-Ambiyaa (21):53.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] The great heroic action and the wise call to <em>tawheed</em> and to the elimination of <em>shirk</em>, is counted by many of the callers to correction these days as being an example of preoccupying onesself with minor and insignificant matters. And there is no action nor power except by the will of Allaah. Indeed it is not the eyes that are blind, but rather the hearts. They think that <em>da’wah</em> must begin with a call to the correction and rectification of rulership and government, not correction of <em>’aqeedah</em>. In this view Ibraaheem and all the other Prophets were in error with regard to the correct methodology of <em>da’wah</em>. (al-Fawzaan).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Nooh (عليه السلام)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nooh was the second father of all mankind, and the first of the Messengers (<em>Rusul</em>) to the people of the Earth. This great Prophet lived a very long life: he called his people for nine hundred and fifty years to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and to making all worship purely for Him. He did not become weary of this, nor lose interest. He called them night and day, in private and in the open. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Indeed We sent Nooh as a Messenger to his people ordering him to warn his people before a painful punishment should come to them. He said, ‘O my People, I am a plain and clear warner to you, that you should worship Allaah alone, avoid disobedience to Him and obey me. If you do so He will forgive you your sins and grant you respite until an appointed term. Indeed when the term decreed by Allaah comes it cannot be delayed, and if you knew you would submit to and obey your Lord.’ Nooh said, ‘O my Lord, I have called my people day and night to worship You alone and warned them of Your punishment but my calling them to the truth only results in them turning away from it.</strong>[1]<strong> Whenever I call them to worship You alone and to obey You, and to disassociate themselves from the worship of everything but You, so that You may forgive them, they thrust their fingers in their ears and cover themselves up with their garments, so as not to hear. Then they persist in their disbelief and arrogantly and obstinately refuse to follow and submit to the truth. Then I called them loudly and openly, and I called them individually and privately. I said to them, ‘Ask your Lord to forgive your sins and repent to your Lord from your unbelief and association of others in worship with Him, and make your worship sincerely and purely for Him, then He will forgive you, indeed He greatly forgives those who turn to Him in repentance and seek His forgiveness. He will then send you rain in abundance, and grant you increase in wealth and children, and provide you with gardens and rivers. What is wrong with you that you do not have awe and fear of Allaah, when it is He that created you in successive stages? Do you not see how Allaah has created the seven heavens one above the other, and has placed the moon therein as a light and has made the sun a lamp? Allaah it is who created you and brought you from the earth, and He it is who will return you to it, and then resurrect you from it. Allaah &#8211; it is Who spread out the earth for you, so that you may travel about upon wide roads.’’ Nooh said, ‘O my Lord, they have rejected my call and opposed it, and have instead followed the call of those whose wealth and children only increase them in error and take them further away from their Lord. Furthermore the leaders have plotted a mighty plot, and they have said, “Do not abandon your gods. Do not abandon <em>Wadd</em>, nor <em>Suwaa</em>, nor <em>Yaghooth</em>, nor <em>Ya&#8217;ooq</em>, nor <em>Nasr</em>.” Indeed many have gone astray due to the idols. O Allaah, grant no increase to the transgressors except in error.</strong>[2]<strong> Due to their sins they were drowned in the Flood and entered into the Fire, and they could find no one to save them from Allaah’s punishment.”</strong>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what did the <em>da’wah</em> of this noble Messenger comprise of, and Allaah has told us the summary of his noble <em>da’wah</em> which continued for nine hundred and fifty years?! Indeed it was an earnest and painstaking call to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and to make all worship purely for Him. It was a tireless effort and he used every possible means available to him to convince them of his call. He called them privately and individually, and he called them openly. He encouraged them and warned them, informing them of the promise of good for the obedient, and evil for the disobedient. He gave them practical and intellectual proofs, from themselves and their lives, and what they saw before them with regards to the heavens and the earth, and the clear signs and lessons contained in them. All of this failed to benefit them and did not cause them to accept. Rather they persisted in their disbelief and error, and they rejected all this obstinately and arrogantly. They persisted in their adherence to the idols and false and futile objects of worship. So the result of this persistence and obstinancy was destruction and annihilation in this world, and everlasting torment in the Hell-fire in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At this point we may ask: why did this great Prophet continue for such an extremely long period of time, expending huge efforts, untiringly and without languidness, calling to the starting point of <em>tawheed</em>?! Why did Allaah praise him so highly, and cause him to be remembered, and make him one of those Messengers who were the firmest of all in their determination (<em>oolul-&#8216;adhm</em>)? Does the call to <em>tawheed</em> deserve all this esteem? Is this methodology an establishment of this procedure for this noble Prophet in opposition to logic, wisdom and intellect? Or is it pure and certain wisdom, and what is demanded by correct logic and sound and perceptive intellect? Why did Allaah approve of following this methodology in <em>da’wah</em> for 950 years, and commend him, and cause his name and his story to endure, and impose it as a duty upon the greatest of the Messengers and the one having the greatest intellect of all the people, that he should take him as an example to follow in his <em>da’wah</em> and his perseverance?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The just answer, established upon intellect and wisdom, and upon understanding the status and position of Prophet hood, and having the greatest trust in it and giving it its due respect, is that the call to <em>tawheed</em> and striving to wipe out <em>shirk</em> and to purify the earth from it, does indeed deserve all of this. It is indeed wisdom itself and is demanded by natural inclination and intellect. It is furthermore, a binding obligation upon every caller to Allaah that they understand this methodology, this great and divinely inspired <em>da’wah</em> and great goal, and that they devote all their effort and energy to its attainment and its being propagated throughout all of Allaah’s earth. Furthermore that they work together, cooperate and unite, and sincerely attest to each others’ truthfulness. Just as the Messengers, the callers to <em>tawheed</em>, were: the earlier ones telling of the coming of the later ones and the later ones attesting to the truthfulness of the previous ones and promoting their call, and following the same way. It is also binding upon us to believe that if there was any other methodology better and more correct than this methodology, that Allaah would have chosen that for His Messengers and would have favoured them with it. So is it fitting for any Believer to turn away from it and choose a different methodology for himself, and to arrogantly seek to attack this divinely laid down methodology and its callers?!</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[1] At-Tabaree reports from Qataadah, “It has reached us that a man would take his son to Nooh and say to his son, ‘Beware of this man, don&#8217;t let him lead you astray, for I remember when I was your age, my father brought me to him and warned me against him just as I am warning you.’”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[2] This supplication of Nooh against them came after he was informed by Allaah that they were not going to be Believers, as explained by al-Baghawee.</span></p>

<p><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/allaah-took-ibraaheem-as-khaleel-and-that-allaah-spoke-directly-to-moosaa-dawud-burbank" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>]</strong><br />
—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [121]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) of the Muslims, is that the Messengers (<em>Rusul</em>) are the most excellent of the creation and that the Messengers (<em>Rusul</em>) vary in levels of excellence. So they hold as their creed and belief, that Allaah took Ibraaheem as a <em><u>Kh</u>aleel</em> (an especially beloved one) just as Allaah, the Most High, said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;..and Allaah took Ibraaheem as a <u>Kh</u>aleel (an especially beloved)&#8221; </span> (Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), <em>aayah </em>125)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this word <em>‘al-<u>kh</u>ullah’</em> (الخلة), it means: the highest of the levels of love. So Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, has love for His believing servants and for the <em>muttaqeen</em> ( المتقين &#8211; the people of <em>taqwaa</em> – those are dutiful to Him) and He has love for the <em>mu<u>h</u>sineen</em> (المحسنين &#8211; the doers of good) and He loves those who frequently repent (التوابين &#8211; <em>at-tawwaabeen</em>) and He loves <em>al-mutta<u>t</u>ahhireen</em> (المتطهرين – those people who purify themselves). However, <em>al-<u>kh</u>ullah</em> is a special degree which has not been attained except by two of the creation: Ibraaheem and Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em>`alayhima<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>. Just as he <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Allaah took me as an especially beloved one (<u>Kh</u>aleel) just as He took Ibraaheem as an especially beloved one (<u>Kh</u>aleel).”</span> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And Allaah spoke directly to Moosaa&#8221; </span> (Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), <em>aayah </em>164)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, He (Allaah) gave excellence to some of the Prophets over others, even though all of them were upon a very high level. However, Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, gave excellence to some over others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Those are the Messengers; We gave excellence to some of them over others. From them are those to whom Allaah spoke directly and He raised some in degrees of excellence.&#8221;</span> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>253)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, every Prophet was given by Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, a degree of excellence particular to him. So he gave to Ibraaheem and Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em>`alayhima<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam, al-<u>kh</u>ullah</em> (that He made them His specially beloved). And He gave to Moosaa the excellence that He spoke to him directly, without an angel in-between. And Moosaa heard His Speech; so He the Perfect called to him (ناداه &#8211; <em>naadaahu</em>) and spoke privately to him (ناجاه &#8211; <em>naajaahu</em>). And the term <em>‘al-munaadaat’</em> (المنادات) means ‘a raised voice’ and <em>‘al-munaajaat’</em> (المناجات) is ‘speaking with a low voice’. Both of these occurred for Moosaa <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> and this was a virtue not attained by anyone besides him. And He said at the end of the <em>aayah, “takleemaa</em> (تكليما – with Speech)” for emphasis so that no one could say that this was something metaphorical. So when He has emphasized it with this verbal noun, this proves that it is true and real Speech from Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. So this contains affirmation of <em>al-Kalaam</em> (الكلام – Speech) for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. And it contains affirmation of the virtue of Moosaa <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> over other Prophets with regard to this characteristic. <strong>And the fact that a Prophet had a particular quality special to him does not necessitate that he is better than the others unrestrictedly. Rather, it means that he was more excellent than other Prophets with regard to this particular quality.</strong></p>

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> The Explanation – Point [42]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are from his attributes <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>خاتم الأنبياء </strong>– <strong>“The last (or seal) of the Prophets.”</strong>  The meaning of “<em><u>kh</u>aatam</em>” (خاتم &#8211; seal) is the one whom no Prophet will come after.  And the <em><u>kh</u>itaam</em> (ختام – seal) of anything is that which is placed upon it as a seal upon it so that nothing can be added to that thing and nothing can be taken away from it.  So Allaah sealed the Messengership with Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.  He the Majestic, in His Highness, said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And Mu<u>h</u>ammad is not the father of any of your men; but rather, he is the Messenger of Allaah and the seal (last) of the Prophets.</span></em> (Sooratul-A<u>h</u>zaab (33), <em>aayah </em>40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there is no need for the coming of any Prophet after him because the Qur.aan is present and the Prophetic Sunnah is present and the <em>`ulamaa. ar-rabbaaniyoon</em> (wise scholars who cultivate the people upon the correct way) are present – calling the people to Allaah and giving clarity to the people.  So therefore, the religion of Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> will remain until the establishment of the Last Hour.  It will not be changed, and it will not be abrogated, and it will not be altered because Allaah, the One free from all imperfections, has made it suitable and fitting for every time and every place.  And as for the revealed laws of the previous Prophets, then they were temporary for their nations in particular times and then Allaah abrogated those legislated laws from before, with other legislated laws suitable for other nations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">For every people from you, we made a set of revealed laws and a clear way to proceed upon.</span></em> (Sooratul-Maa.idah (5), <em>aayah </em>48)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>For every revealed Book there is a set time period</em></span> (Sooratur-Ra`d (13), <em>aayah </em>38)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, each Book (from the previous Books) has a set time period.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the religion of Islaam is complete.  It does not need any Messenger after Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.  And the scholars are the inheritors of the Prophets.  So whoever holds the belief that there will come after Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> any Prophet, then he is a disbeliever in Allaah, outside the fold of the religion.  And the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed that there were going to come liars, falsely claiming Prophethood after him.  He <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">سيأتي بعدي كذابون ثلاثون، كلهم يدعي أنه نبي، وأنا خاتم الأنبياء لا نبي بعدي</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“There will come after me thirty great liars, each one of them claiming that he is a prophet and I am the last of the Prophets; there is no Prophet after me.”</span></em> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever claims Prophethood, or has Prophethood claimed on his behalf, or whoever follows them, then all of them are unbelievers (<em>kuffaar</em>).  And the Muslims have fought against them and have declared them to be unbelievers.  And the last of those whose followers claimed that he was a Prophet in this present time was that <em>Qaadiyaanee</em>.  And these people (the <em>Qaadiyaanee</em>) are called the <em>A<u>h</u>madees</em> as an ascription to his name because his name was A<u>h</u>mad <em>Al-Qaadiyaanee</em> (أحمد القادياني) and the scholars declared him to be an unbeliever (<em>kaafir</em>) and they repelled him from the lands of Islaam and the declared his followers to be unbelievers since this is a denial of Allaah and of His Messenger.  And their being unbelievers is by consensus of the Muslims; no one disagrees about this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is essential that the Muslim believes that he <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> is the last of the Prophets and Messengers and he is the leader of those having <em>taqwaa</em> (those dutiful to Allaah); meaning, that he is the single example to be followed for those who are obedient and dutiful to Allaah, the Mighty and  Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">There is indeed a fine example for you in Allaah’s Messenger for whoever has hope in Allaah and in the Last Day</span></em>. (Sooratul-A<u>h</u>zaab (33), <em>aayah </em>21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for others besides the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, he is only to be followed if he himself is following the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.  And as for a person who contradicts the Messenger <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> then it is not permissible to follow him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “If you truly love Allaah then follow me, then Allaah will love you and forgive you your sins.” </span></em>(Soorah Aal-`Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there is no way towards Allaah except by following the Messenger <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> and proceeding upon his way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the term: <strong>وسيد المرسلين</strong> – <strong>“And he is the noblest of the Messengers;” </strong>that is him, <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>; he is the noblest of the sons of Aadam just as he <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> said about himself,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏أنا سيد ولد آدم ولا فخر</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“I am the noblest of the sons of Aadam, and that is not boasting.”</span></em> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By the statement, <strong><em>“I am the noblest of the sons of Aadam, and this is not a boast,”</em></strong> he informed his nation of that as part of giving thanks to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and also so that the <em>Ummah</em> (Nation) should give thanks to their Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, for this favour – that He made its Messenger the noblest of the Messengers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the word “<em>sayyid</em>” (سيد – the noblest) means <em>al-muqaddim</em> (المقدم – the foremost one) and <em>al-imaam</em> (الإمام – the leader).  So he is the best of the Messengers `<em>alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> and he is their <em>imaam</em> (leader) and he is at the head of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the term: <strong>حبيب رب العالمين</strong> – <strong>“the beloved one of the Lord of the whole of creation,”</strong> the term ‘<em><u>h</u>abeeb’</em> (حبيب) is a term which has a point of criticism against it because it is not sufficient to say (that the Messenger `<em>alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> is) ‘<em><u>h</u>abeeb’</em> (the beloved one).  Rather, he is the ‘<em><u>kh</u>aleel</em>’ – the ‘especially close beloved one’ of the Lord of the creation (خليل رب العالمين).  And <em><u>kh</u>ullah</em> (خلة) is more excellent than just <em>ma<u>h</u>abbah</em> (محبة &#8211; love) because <em>al-ma<u>h</u>abbah</em> (love) is of levels and the highest of its levels is <em>al-<u>kh</u>ullah</em> which is the purest love. And no one attained this level except for two men from the creation: Ibraaheem `<em>alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam,</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And Allaah took Ibraaheem as a <u>kh</u>aleel (especially close beloved one)</span></em> (Sooratun-Nisaa.  (4), <em>aayah </em>125)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, our Prophet `<em>alayhi<u>s</u> <u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>, because he himself informed about that saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إن الله اتخذني خليلًا كما اتخذ إبراهيم خليلًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“Allaah took me as an especially close beloved one just as He took Ibraaheem as a <u>kh</u>aleel (an especially close beloved one).” </em></span>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it should not be said about him that he is <em><u>H</u>abeebullaah</em> – a beloved one of Allaah, because this term is suitable for every believer and there is nothing special for the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in it.  But as for being <em><u>kh</u>ullah</em> (an especially beloved one), then no one (from this Ummah) shares with him in that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [42][4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[43] وكل دعوى النبوة بعده فغي وهوى‏.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[43]     Every claim to Prophethood after him is erroneous and baseless desires.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [43]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This has preceded in the meaning of his being ‘the seal and last of the Prophets’.  So therefore, every claim to Prophethood after him is futile and is unbelief since there will not come any Prophet after our Prophet `<em>alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>.  And as for `Eesaa `<em>alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>, when he descends at the end of time, then it will not be upon the basis that he is a Prophet and a Messenger, nor upon the basis that he is coming with a new revealed Law.  Rather, he will come upon the basis that he is a <em>Mujaddid</em> (مجدد – Reviver) for the religion of the Messenger of Allaah <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, </em>on the basis that he is one following the Messenger of Allaah <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and he will judge with the Islaamic <em><u>Sh</u>aree</em>`<em>ah</em> (Laws).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] This is a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of  <u>Th</u>awbaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em> and the basis of the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> is in <em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> Muslim but this full wording is reported by Aboo Daawood and At-Tirmi<u>dh</u>ee; declared <em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (Authentic) by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee that <u>Th</u>awbaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh </em>said, “Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">لا تقوم الساعة حتى تلحق قبائل من أمتي بالمشركين وحتى يعبدوا الأوثان وإنه سيكون في أمتي ثلاثون كذابون كلهم يزعم أنه نبي وأنا خاتم النبيين لا نبي بعدي</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>‘The last hour will not be established until some tribes of my nation join with the mu<u>sh</u>riks and until they worship the idols and there will be in my nation thirty great liars, each one claiming that he is a prophet and I am the seal of the Prophets; there is no Prophet after me’.</em>”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] <em><u>H</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u> </em>reported by At-Tirmi<u>dh</u>ee and is a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Aboo Sa`eed Al-<u>Kh</u>udree <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em>; declared <em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (Authentic) by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] The <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u> </em>is reported by Muslim and is a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Abdillaah ibn Mas`ood <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em>, that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏لو كنت متخذًا من أهل الأرض خليلًا لاتخذت ابن أبي قحافة خليلًا، ولكن صاحبكم خليل الله</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“If I were to take a specially beloved friend from the people of the earth, I would have taken Ibn Abee Qu<u>h</u>aafah (Aboo Bakr) as an especially close beloved friend; however, your companion (meaning himself) is the <u>Kh</u>aleel of Allaah.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Translator’s Side Point: There is a narration that <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee points out is weak in his notes to A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>a<u>h</u>aawiyyah.  It is a <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u> </em>of Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em> and in it is quoted that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> himself said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ألا وأنا حبيب الله ولا فخر</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“I am the <u>H</u>abeeb (beloved one) of Allaah and that’s not boasting.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> mentions that this narration is <em><u>d</u>a`eef</em> (weak), not authentic.  It is weak because it has the narrator Zam`ah ibn <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> and also the narrator Salamah ibn Wahraam.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah , says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Oh, you People of the Book! Commit not excesses in your religion, nor say of Allah anything but the truth. The Messiah, `Eisa, the son of Maryam is no more than a Messenger of Allah, and His Word, which He bestowed upon Maryam, and a Spirit proceeding from Him: So believe in Allah and His Messengers. Say not &#8220;Three&#8221;-desist: It will be better for you: For Allah is one God, glory be to Him [Far exalted is He] above having a son. To him belong all things in the heavens and on earth. And enough is Allah as a Disposer of affairs&#8221;</span> </strong>(Qur&#8217;an 4:171)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported on the authority of `Umar (ra) that the Messenger of Allah <img src="https://i0.wp.com/web.archive.org/web/20081202232709im_/http%3A//abdurrahman.org/tawheed/KTwahab/images/saws.gif" alt="(may Peace Be Upon Him)" width="14" height="13" border="0" /> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Do not extoll me as the Christians extolled the son of Maryam (as ); I am no more than a slave (of Allah) and so (instead), say: Allah&#8217;s Slave and His Messenger.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhari.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah <img src="https://i0.wp.com/web.archive.org/web/20081202232709im_/http%3A//abdurrahman.org/tawheed/KTwahab/images/saws.gif" alt="(may Peace Be Upon Him)" width="14" height="13" border="0" /> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Beware of exaggerated praise, for it was only this which led those before you to destruction.&#8221; </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Ahmad, An-Nassa&#8217;I and Ibn Majah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari and Muslim report that `Aa`ishah said: &#8220;When the Messenger of Allah <img src="https://i0.wp.com/web.archive.org/web/20081202232047im_/http%3A//abdurrahman.org/tawheed/KTwahab/images/saws.gif" alt="(may Peace Be Upon Him)" width="14" height="13" border="0" /> was close to death, he covered his face with a cloth, and then when it became difficult for him to breathe, he uncovered his face and said:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;May Allah curse the Jews and Christians who took the graves of their Prophets as places of worship &#8211; do not imitate them.&#8221;</strong></span></p></blockquote>

<p><strong><span style="color:#752722;" class="has-inline-color">The Transcribed Text from the audio:</span></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم </p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In the name of Allah, The Most Beneficent, The Most Merciful. I testify that there is no true God worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is Allah&#8217;s true slave and messenger. May Allah&#8217;s salah and salaam be upon the noble prophet, the believers of his family and the noble companions and those who follow on their path until the Day of resurrection. I ask Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ‎) to make us from those who follow their path until the Day we meet Him (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ‎) while pleased with us.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">We continue with the discussion on correct creed. What we are going to cover now is correct creed with the respect to karaamaat and the miracles.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">It is from the creed of Ahlul sunnah and from the basic foundations of their creed is to believe in the karaamaat. Karamaat means charisma that occur by the Auliya&#8217;, those righteous who are close to Allah.This forms part of the principles of the creed of Ahlul sunaah.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Who is the Walee? The walee is defined in the Qur&#8217;an: ٱلَّذِینَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَكَانُوا۟ یَتَّقُونَ  These are the auliya&#8217;, those who believe and are pious, complying with the commands of Allah and  are abstaining from his prohibitions, these are Auliya, the friends of Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ‎). These are the righteous who are close to Allah.  This is defined clearly in Surah Yunus in chapter 10 verse 62 and 63. </p>



<p>Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ) says</p>



<p>أَلَاۤ إِنَّ أَوۡلِیَاۤءَ ٱللَّهِ لَا خَوۡفٌ عَلَیۡهِمۡ وَلَا هُمۡ یَحۡزَنُونَ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>&#8220;No doubt verily the Auliya&#8217; no fear shall come upon them&#8221;</strong></p>



<p>Who are they? </p>



<p>Then comes the definition:    </p>



<p><strong>ٱلَّذِینَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَكَانُوا۟ یَتَّقُونَ</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>&#8220;Those who believe in Tawheed and feared Allah much (by abstaining from evil deeds and sins and by doing righteous deeds).&#8221;</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And the karamaah is a matter that transcends the conceivable or customary or natural, Allah makes occur on the hands of one of His auliya&#8217; as He chooses as a help on some religious matter or a worldly matter.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And the karamaah does not reach the level of the miracles, which is to the prophets and the messengers.So all those ordinary occurrences and habits which Allah manifests through the Auliya&#8217; in terms of various knowledges, spiritual experiences, powers, influences, and those that are mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an like in surah al kahf the people of the cave and also regarding former communities and about the initial period of the sahaabah and the successors of this ummah and also those that all exist in this ummah till today and will continue to remain till the Day of Judgement. Allah makes them manifest on the hands of the friends of Allah. The happenings of the karaamaat, the charisma through the followers guidance of Allah&#8217;s messenger is true and these karaamaat as we said is an unusual event which Allah manifests through one of His auliya&#8217; for supporting a mundane or a spiritual matter.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And the difference between karaamaat and miracles, miracles mean mujizat implies that miracles is the claim of prophethood and messengership but karaamaat does not imply this.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And there are a number of points of wisdom and aims in the manifestation of karaamaat and the important among these are as follows:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>(1)</strong> They are like miracles which prove the perfection of the power of Allah and the dominance of His will. They are like miracles in the sense that whatever Allah wills, He is the Greatest performer of it. Allah has an addition to this methods and known causes other methods also which are beyond the access of the human knowledge nor can the human sense organs their reason.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>The story of the people of the cave</strong> (ashabul kahf) is one of such evidences, including that sleep that Allah imposed upon them for a long time along with protecting their bodies from being disintegrated.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Another of these is the <strong>provision being given to Maryam</strong> (alaihassalam), the daughter of &#8216;Imran, in the arches on which zakariya had left astonished and said &#8220;where do you get it from these provisions?&#8221; She said &#8220;from Allah.&#8221;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And likewise the fact Maryam becoming pregnant and the <strong>birth of Jesus alayhis salaam without a father</strong>.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And<strong> talking by Jesus while still in cradle </strong>and this did not occur only with Jesus, meaning there are those who spoke in the cradle other than Jesus as authentically reported in Bukhari and Muslim from the hadith of Abu Huraira (radhiyallaahu anhu) from the prophet (ﷺ) who said that three ones are only who spoke in the cradle, three only, Jesus is one of them.<br /><br />The second one: There was a man amongst the children of Israeel, his name was <strong>Jurayj</strong>, this man was praying one time and his mother came and called upon him, she needed something from him. So he talked to himself “shall I respond or shall I continue the prayers?” So she invoked and said “O Allah! don&#8217;t make him die until he sees the faces of the woman who solicits sex. And while he was in his place of worship a woman came and she talked to him into illegal sexual intercourse and he refused. So she went to a shepherd and asked him for the same thing and she seduced him into that.  She gave birth to a child and she went to say that this is the  child of Jurayj, so the people came to him and broke the door of his place of worship and brought him down, insulted him. So he went to make ablution and prayed to Allah concerning this child from this prostitute.  So He came to the child and talked to the child and said “Who is your father?” The child spoke in the cradle and said “the shepherd”. So everyone was amazed and astonished and they came apologised and said &#8220;we will build your place of worship from gold&#8221; He said &#8220;no, just build it from mud.&#8221;<br /><br />And the third one: one woman was suckling her child and this took place <strong>a woman from children of Israeel</strong>, a man who was on his mount passed by.  So she liked that man and said “O Allah! make my son like him this”, the child left her breast and directed himself towards the rider and said “O Allah! don&#8217;t make me like him” and then he came back to suckle. And Abu Huraira said: while the prophet was reciting the hadeeth to them as if I remember looking at the prophet ﷺ suckling his finger. Then a slave-girl passed by the woman and then she said “O Allah! don&#8217;t make my son like her” he left her breast and said “O Allah! make me like her”  So she talked to her child “why?” and he said that rider was a tyrant from the tyrants and this girl they say that she was a thief, stole certain things and that she committed adultery while she was innocent.<br /><br />So this hadeeth tells us of some of these karaamaat and from this we know that three spoke in the cradle Eesa (alayhis salaam), the child who spoke to Jurayj and this child of this woman from the children of Israeel.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Also from this is the story of the man in surah Al Baqarah whom Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ‎) made him die for a hundred years then resurrected him.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And the story of the three who from the children of Israeel who went to a cave and a huge rock came and blocked the entrance of the cave and they invoked Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ‎) each by his own righteous deed and Allah made the rock move until they had a clearance to leave and save them.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And there are many other instances and that the karaamaat exist in this ummah until Day of resurrection because of it is belief and righteousness.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Now if anyone comes up with an extraordinary matter, transcends the norm this can not be a purification for this person that he is a friend of Allah until his actions refer to the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah and it becomes evident that he is a follower of the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah openly and outwardly manifesting his Worship of Allah in accordance to the Sunnah.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The friends of Allah are true and existing and they have merits as in the hadeeth of Sahih Bukhari: Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ‎) says “<strong>whoever stand in enmity towards any of the auliya&#8217; then he is at war with Him (glorious and exalted be He)</strong>.”</p>



<p>The karaamaat of the auliya&#8217; are in fact the miracles of the prophets, for the auliya&#8217; receive these karaamaat by following the guidance of their prophets and acting accordingly.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The karaamaat of the auliya&#8217;, and now we know the definition of auliya&#8217;, it is that glad tidings in which Allah has given them in the world itself. The Bushra which is called tidings means every such thing which proves their being protectors, supporters, friends and having good end in here and hereafter.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">As we said earlier the karaamaat still exists in the ummah and will be found until the Day of resurrection and observation is the best argument to prove it.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The philosophers have denied the karaamaat of the friends of Allah even as they have denied the miracles of the prophets.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The Mu&#8217;tazila sect and some of Ash&#8217;ari sects have also denied the occurrence of the karaamaat claiming these are like miracles but this is a false claim as we have mentioned that it does not imply a claim of Prophethood in no way.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">One must remain vigilant from the <strong>Dajjal</strong>, the false liars of these innovators and the deeds of the misguided people and satanic show of  extraordinary occurrences who call themselves <strong>sufi</strong>, such as entering into the fire, striking one&#8217;s body with weapons, catching hold of snakes and foretelling about the unseen and so forth.These are not karaamaat. The karaamaat are performed by the auliya&#8217; of Allah and these are not the auliya&#8217; of Allah but these are shayateen in the form of men.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">We ask Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ‎) to protect us from all false Creed and all innovations and to guide the ummah to follow the path of the prophet ﷺ and the righteous predecessors.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left"><strong>Karamat-ul-Awliya’</strong><br />The fourth question of Fatwa no. <span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">9027 </span><br />The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta&#8217;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><b></b><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Q 4:</b><b> Do the Awliya&#8217; (pious people) perform Karamahs (extraordinary events caused by Allah for or through a pious person)? </b>Can they change anything in the heavens or on earth? Do they intercede with Allah for others while they are in Barzakh (period between death and the Resurrection) or not?</span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span class="HarfBody"><b>A: </b><b>Karamah </b>is an extraordinary event which Allah (Exalted be He) bestows on a pious person as an honor to protect him against harm, benefit him, or help him defend people&#8217;s rights. </span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span class="HarfBody">But a pious person cannot perform these events whenever he wishes just as the prophet could not perform miracles by himself whenever he wished. It is Allah Alone Who helps them to do all these things. </span></p>



<p><span class="HarfBody">Allah (Exalted be He) says:</span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:#000000;" title="Surah Al-`Ankabut, 29: 50" target="_blank" name="Andtheysay:Whyarenotsigns"></a>And they say: &#8220;Why are not signs sent down to him from his Lord? Say: &#8220;The signs are only with Allâh, and I am only a plain warner.&#8221;</span></strong></span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span class="HarfBody">Also pious people are not empowered with any superiority to change things in the heavens or on earth except for what Allah enables them just like all other humans. They can make changes in things like farming, building, trading, and such works which ordinary humans do&nbsp;</span><span class="HarfBody">with Allah&#8217;s Will. In Barzakh, pious people cannot intercede for anyone whether alive or dead, as Allah (Exalted be He) says: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Say: “To Allâh belongs all intercession.&#8221;</span></strong></span></p>



<p><span class="HarfBody">Allah also says: </span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span class="HarfBody"><strong><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Zukhruf, 43: 86" target="_blank" name="Andthosewhomtheyinvokeinstead"></a><span style="color:#000000;">And those whom they invoke instead of Him have no power of intercession &#8211; except for those who bear witness to the truth knowingly (i.e. believed in the Oneness of Allâh, and obeyed His Orders), and they know (the facts about the Oneness of Allâh).</span></strong></span></p>



<p><span class="HarfBody">Moreover, He says: </span></p>



<p><span class="HarfBody"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His Permission</span></strong></span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span class="HarfBody">Whoever believes that pious people govern the universe or that they know the Ghayb (Unseen), is a Kafir (disbeliever), as Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody">To Allâh belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is therein, and He is Able to do all things.</span></strong></span></p>



<p><span class="HarfBody">Also Allah (Glorified be He) says:</span></p>



<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:#000000;" title="Surah Al-Naml, 27: 65" target="_blank" name="Say:Noneintheheavensandthe"></a>Say: “None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghaib (Unseen) except Allâh”</span></strong></span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span class="HarfBody">Allah (Glorified be He) removes all ambiguity whatsoever and declares the truth in a clear-cut manner when addressing the Prophet (peace be upon him):&nbsp;</span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong><span class="HarfBody"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-A`raf, 7: 188" target="_blank" name="Say(OMuhammad%D8%B5%D9%84%D9%89%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%87%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%85):"></a><span style="color:#000000;">Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8220;I possess no power over benefit or harm to myself except as Allâh wills. If I had the knowledge of the Ghaib (Unseen), I should have secured for myself an abundance of wealth, and no evil should have touched me. I am but a warner, and a bringer of glad tidings unto people who believe.&#8221;</span></span></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">Is there any difference between a Messenger and a Prophet?</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yes, the scholars say that a Prophet is one who receives Revelation from Allaah of a law, but he is not commanded to propagate it, only to practice it himself, without being called upon to disseminate it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Messenger is one who receives Revelation from Allaah of a law and he is called upon to propagate it and to act upon it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every Messenger is a Prophet, but not every Prophet is a Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophets are more in number than the Messengers, and Allaah has related the stories of some of the Messengers in the Quran and others He has not related. Allaah, the Most High says: <span style="color:#008000;">And indeed We have sent Messengers before you (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam)): Of some of them We have related to you their story, and some of them we have not related to you their story. And it was not given to any Messenger that he should bring a Sign except by the leave of Allaah.</span> [1] Based upon this Verse, it is plain that every Prophet mentioned in the Quran is a Messenger.</p>
<p>[1] Ghafir 40:78</p>
<p>Shaykh Muhammad bin Saalih al-`Uthaymeen<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">قُل لَّا يَعۡلَمُ مَن فِى ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٲتِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضِ ٱلۡغَيۡبَ إِلَّا ٱللَّهُ‌ۚ وَمَا يَشۡعُرُونَ أَيَّانَ يُبۡعَثُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Say: &#8220;None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghaib (unseen) except Allâh, nor can they perceive when they shall be resurrected.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Naml 27:65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَعِندَهُ ۥ مَفَاتِحُ ٱلۡغَيۡبِ لَا يَعۡلَمُهَآ إِلَّا هُوَ‌ۚ وَيَعۡلَمُ مَا فِى ٱلۡبَرِّ وَٱلۡبَحۡرِ‌ۚ وَمَا تَسۡقُطُ مِن وَرَقَةٍ إِلَّا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;And with Him are the keys of the Ghaib (all that is hidden), none knows them but He. And He knows whatever there is in the land and in the sea; not a leaf falls, but he knows it. There is not a grain in the darkness of the earth nor anything fresh or dry, but is written in a Clear Record.&#8221;</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Those Messengers! We preferred some to others;</strong> to some of them Allah spoke (directly); others He raised to degrees (of honour); and to &#8216;Iesa (Jesus), the son of Maryam (Mary), We gave clear proofs and evidences, and supported him with Ruh-ul-Qudus [Jibrael (Gabriel)]</span> (Surah Baqarah 2:253)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Say (O Muslims), &#8220;We believe in Allah and that which has been sent down to us and that which has been sent down to Ibrahim (Abraham), Isma&#8217;il (Ishmael), Ishaque (Isaac), Ya&#8217;qub (Jacob), and to Al-Asbat [the twelve sons of Ya&#8217;qub (Jacob)], and that which has been given to Musa (Moses) and &#8216;Iesa (Jesus), and that which has been given to the Prophets from their Lord. <strong>We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we have submitted (in Islam).</strong>&#8220;</span> (Surah Baqarah 2:136)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer is based upon the clarification from Shaykh Uthaymeen rahimahullaah</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah created Adam, making him 60  cubits tall. When He created him, He said to him, &#8220;Go and greet that group of angels,  and listen to their reply, for it will be your greeting (salutation) and the greeting  (salutations of your offspring.&#8221; So, Adam said (to the angels), As-Salamu Alaikum  (i.e. Peace be upon you). The angels said, &#8220;As-salamu Alaika wa Rahmatu-l-lahi&#8221;  (i.e. Peace and Allah&#8217;s Mercy be upon you). Thus the angels added to Adam&#8217;s salutation the  expression, &#8216;Wa Rahmatu-l-lahi,&#8217; Any person who will enter Paradise will resemble Adam (in  appearance and figure). People have been decreasing in stature since Adam&#8217;s creation. </font></p>

They will not urinate, relieve  nature, spit, or have any nasal secretions. Their combs will be of gold, and their sweat  will smell like musk. The aloes-wood will be used in their centers. Their wives will be  houris. All of them will look alike and will resemble their father Adam (in statute),  sixty cubits tall.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam heard the arrival of the Prophet  at Medina, he came to him and said, &#8220;I am going to ask you about three things which  nobody knows except a prophet: What is the first portent of the Hour? What will be the  first meal taken by the people of Paradise? Why does a child resemble its father, and why  does it resemble its maternal uncle&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Gabriel has just now  told me of their answers.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah said, &#8220;He (i.e. Gabriel), from amongst all  the angels, is the enemy of the Jews.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The first portent  of the Hour will be a fire that will bring together the people from the east to the west;  the first meal of the people of Paradise will be Extra-lobe (caudate lobe) of fish-liver.  As for the resemblance of the child to its parents: If a man has sexual intercourse with  his wife and gets discharge first, the child will resemble the father, and if the woman  gets discharge first, the child will resemble her.&#8221; On that &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam said,  &#8220;I testify that you are the Apostle of Allah.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam further said,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The Jews are liars, and if they should come to know about my  conversion to Islam before you ask them (about me), they would tell a lie about me.&#8221;  The Jews came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and &#8216;Abdullah went inside the house. Allah&#8217;s Apostle  asked (the Jews), &#8220;What kind of man is &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam amongst you?&#8221; They  replied, &#8220;He is the most learned person amongst us, and the best amongst us, and the  son of the best amongst us.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;What do you think if he  embraces Islam (will you do as he does)?&#8221; The Jews said, &#8220;May Allah save him  from it.&#8221; Then &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam came out in front of them saying, &#8220;I testify  that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is the Apostle of  Allah.&#8221; Thereupon they said, &#8220;He is the evilest among us, and the son of the  evilest amongst us,&#8221; and continued talking badly of him. </font></p>

Then Allah sends an angel to write four words: He  writes his deeds, time of his death, means of his livelihood, and whether he will be  wretched or blessed (in religion). Then the soul is breathed into his body. So a man may  do deeds characteristic of the people of the (Hell) Fire, so much so that there is only  the distance of a cubit between him and it, and then what has been written (by the angel)  surpasses, and so he starts doing deeds characteristic of the people of Paradise and  enters Paradise. Similarly, a person may do deeds characteristic of the people of  Paradise, so much so that there is only the distance of a cubit between him and it, and  then what has been written (by the angel) surpasses, and he starts doing deeds of the  people of the (Hell) Fire and enters the (Hell) Fire.&#8221; </font></p>

Myself! Go to somebody else; go to Noah.&#8217; They will go to Noah and say; &#8216;O Noah!

So the  Quraish and the Ansar became angry and said, &#8220;He (i.e. the Prophet, ) gives the chief  of Najd and does not give us.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I give them) so as to attract  their hearts (to Islam).&#8221; Then a man with sunken eyes, prominent checks, a raised  forehead, a thick beard and a shaven head, came (in front of the Prophet ) and said,  &#8220;Be afraid of Allah, O Muhammad!&#8221; The Prophet &#8216; said &#8220;Who would obey Allah  if I disobeyed Him? (Is it fair that) Allah has trusted all the people of the earth to me  while, you do not trust me?&#8221; Somebody who, I think was Khalid bin Al-Walid, requested  the Prophet to let him chop that man&#8217;s head off, but he prevented him. When the man left,  the Prophet said, &#8220;Among the off-spring of this man will be some who will recite the  Qur&#8217;an but the Qur&#8217;an will not reach beyond their throats (i.e. they will recite like  parrots and will not understand it nor act on it), and they will renegade from the  religion as an arrow goes through the game&#8217;s body. They will kill the Muslims but will not  disturb the idolaters. If I should live up to their time&#8217; I will kill them as the people  of &#8216;Ad were killed (i.e. I will kill all of them).&#8221; </font></p>

Look! What is  underneath your feet?&#8217; He will look and there he will see a Dhabh (an animal,)  blood-stained, which will be caught by the legs and thrown in the (Hell) Fire.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet entered the Ka&#8217;ba and found in it the pictures  of (Prophet) Abraham and Mary. On that he said&#8217; &#8220;What is the matter with them ( i.e.  Quraish)? They have already heard that angels do not enter a house in which there are  pictures; yet this is the picture of Abraham.

Twice  for the Sake of Allah when he said, &#8220;I am sick,&#8221; and he said, &#8220;(I have not  done this but) the big idol has done it.&#8221; The (third was) that while Abraham and  Sarah (his wife) were going (on a journey) they passed by (the territory of) a tyrant.  Someone said to the tyrant, &#8220;This man (i.e. Abraham) is accompanied by a very  charming lady.&#8221; So, he sent for Abraham and asked him about Sarah saying, &#8220;Who  is this lady?&#8221; Abraham said, &#8220;She is my sister.&#8221; Abraham went to Sarah and  said, &#8220;O Sarah! There are no believers on the surface of the earth except you and I.  This man asked me about you and I have told him that you are my sister, so don&#8217;t  contradict my statement.&#8221; The tyrant then called Sarah and when she went to him, he  tried to take hold of her with his hand, but (his hand got stiff and) he was confounded.  He asked Sarah. &#8220;Pray to Allah for me, and I shall not harm you.&#8221; So Sarah asked  Allah to cure him and he got cured. He tried to take hold of her for the second time, but  (his hand got as stiff as or stiffer than before and) was more confounded. He again  requested Sarah, &#8220;Pray to Allah for me, and I will not harm you.&#8221; Sarah asked  Allah again and he became alright. He then called one of his guards (who had brought her)  and said, &#8220;You have not brought me a human being but have brought me a devil.&#8221;  The tyrant then gave Hajar as a girl-servant to Sarah. Sarah came back (to Abraham) while  he was praying. Abraham, gesturing with his hand, asked, &#8220;What has happened?&#8221;  She replied, &#8220;Allah has spoiled the evil plot of the infidel (or immoral person) and  gave me Hajar for service.&#8221; (Abu Huraira then addressed his listeners saying,  &#8220;That (Hajar) was your mother, O Bani Ma-is-Sama (i.e. the Arabs, the descendants of  Ishmael, Hajar&#8217;s son).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;May Allah bestow His Mercy on the  mother of Ishmael! Had she not hastened (to fill her water-skin with water from the  Zam-zam well). Zam-zam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.&#8221;  Ibn &#8216;Abbas further added, &#8220;(The Prophet) Abraham brought Ishmael and his mother (to  Mecca) and she was suckling Ishmael and she had a water-skin with her.&#8217; </font></p>

<p></a><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.055.583"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 55, Number 583: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The first lady to use a girdle was the mother of Ishmael.  She used a girdle so that she might hide her tracks from Sarah. Abraham brought her and  her son Ishmael while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka&#8217;ba under a tree on the  spot of Zam-zam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in  Mecca, nor was there any water So he made them sit over there and placed near them a  leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set  out homeward. Ishmael&#8217;s mother followed him saying, &#8220;O Abraham! Where are you going,  leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is  there anything (to enjoy)?&#8221; She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look  back at her Then she asked him, &#8220;Has Allah ordered you to do so?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Then He will not neglect us,&#8221; and returned while  Abraham proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniya where they could not see him, he  faced the Ka&#8217;ba, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayers: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in a  valley without cultivation, by Your Sacred House (Kaba at Mecca) in order, O our Lord,  that they may offer prayer perfectly. So fill some hearts among men with love towards  them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks.&#8217; (14.37)  Ishmael&#8217;s mother went on suckling Ishmael and drinking from the water (she had). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she  became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him (i.e.  Ishmael) tossing in agony; She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and  found that the mountain of Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on  it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could  not see anybody. Then she descended from Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked  up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed  the valley and reached the Marwa mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting  to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between Safa  and Marwa) seven times.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;This is the source of the tradition  of the walking of people between them (i.e. Safa and Marwa). When she reached the Marwa  (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened  attentively. She heard the voice again and said, &#8216;O, (whoever you may be)! You have made  me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?&#8221; And behold! She saw an angel  at the place of Zam-zam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed  from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in  this way, and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was  flowing out after she had scooped some of it.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet added, &#8220;May Allah bestow Mercy on  Ishmael&#8217;s mother! Had she let the Zam-zam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she  not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zam-zam would have been a stream  flowing on the surface of the earth.&#8221; The Prophet further added, &#8220;Then she drank  (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, &#8216;Don&#8217;t be afraid of being neglected,  for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah  never neglects His people.&#8217; The House (i.e. Kaba) at that time was on a high place  resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived  in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by  her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kada&#8217;.  They landed in the lower part of Mecca where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying  around water and not leaving it. They said, &#8216;This bird must be flying around water, though  we know that there is no water in this valley.&#8217; They sent one or two messengers who  discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all  came (towards the water).&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;Ishmael&#8217;s mother was sitting near  the water. They asked her, &#8216;Do you allow us to stay with you?&#8221; She replied, &#8216;Yes, but  you will have no right to possess the water.&#8217; They agreed to that.&#8221; The Prophet  further said, &#8220;Ishmael&#8217;s mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to  love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent  for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent  residents there. The child (i.e. Ishmael) grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his  virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of  puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>After Ishmael&#8217;s mother had died, Abraham came after  Ishmael&#8217;s marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find  Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmael&#8217;s wife about him, she replied, &#8216;He has gone in search  of our livelihood.&#8217; Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and  she replied, &#8216;We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution,&#8217;  complaining to him. He said, &#8216;When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and  tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house).&#8217; When Ishmael came, he seemed  to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, &#8216;Has anyone visited you?&#8217; She  replied, &#8216;Yes, an old man of so-and-so description came and asked me about you and I  informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were living  in a hardship and poverty.&#8217; On that Ishmael said, &#8216;Did he advise you anything?&#8217; She  replied, &#8216;Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the  threshold of your gate.&#8217; Ishmael said, &#8216;It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce  you. Go back to your family.&#8217; So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from  amongst them (i.e. Jurhum). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as  Allah wished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmael&#8217;s  wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, &#8216;He has gone in search of our livelihood.&#8217;  Abraham asked her, &#8216;How are you getting on?&#8217; asking her about their sustenance and living.  She replied, &#8216;We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance).&#8217; Then  she thanked Allah&#8217; Abraham said, &#8216;What kind of food do you eat?&#8217; She said. &#8216;Meat.&#8217; He  said, &#8216;What do you drink?&#8217; She said, &#8216;Water.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Allah! Bless their  meat and water.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;At that time they did not have grain, and  if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.&#8221; The Prophet added,  &#8220;If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition  will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca.&#8221; The Prophet added,&#8221; Then  Abraham said Ishmael&#8217;s wife, &#8220;When your husband comes, give my regards to him and  tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate.&#8217; When Ishmael came back, he  asked his wife, &#8216;Did anyone call on you?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;Yes, a good-looking old man came  to me,&#8217; so she praised him and added. &#8216;He asked about you, and I informed him, and he  asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in a good condition.&#8217; Ishmael asked  her, &#8216;Did he give you any piece of advice?&#8217; She said, &#8216;Yes, he told me to give his regards  to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate.&#8217; On that Ishmael  said, &#8216;It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to  keep you with me.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as  Allah wished, and called on them afterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zamzam,  sharpening his arrows. When he saw Abraham, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted  each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father). Abraham said, &#8216;O  Ishmael! Allah has given me an order.&#8217; Ishmael said, &#8216;Do what your Lord has ordered you to  do.&#8217; Abraham asked, &#8216;Will you help me?&#8217; Ishmael said, &#8216;I will help you.&#8217; Abraham said,  Allah has ordered me to build a house here,&#8217; pointing to a hillock higher than the land  surrounding it.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;Then they raised the foundations of the  House (i.e. the Ka&#8217;ba). Ishmael brought the stones and Abraham was building, and when the  walls became high, Ishmael brought this stone and put it for Abraham who stood over it and  carried on building, while Ishmael was handing him the stones, and both of them were  saying, &#8216;O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the  All-Knowing.&#8217; The Prophet added, &#8220;Then both of them went on building and going round  the Ka&#8217;ba saying: O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the  All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.&#8221; (2.127) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 55, Number 584: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Abraham had differences with his wife), (because of  her jealousy of Hajar, Ishmael&#8217;s mother), he took Ishmael and his mother and went away.  They had a water-skin with them containing some water, Ishmael&#8217;s mother used to drink  water from the water-skin so that her milk would increase for her child. When Abraham  reached Mecca, he made her sit under a tree and afterwards returned home. Ishmael&#8217;s mother  followed him, and when they reached Kada&#8217;, she called him from behind, &#8216;O Abraham! To whom  are you leaving us?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;(I am leaving you) to Allah&#8217;s (Care).&#8217; She said, &#8216;I am  satisfied to be with Allah.&#8217; She returned to her place and started drinking water from the  water-skin, and her milk increased for her child. When the water had all been used up, she  said to herself, &#8216;I&#8217;d better go and look so that I may see somebody.&#8217; She ascended the  Safa mountain and looked, hoping to see somebody, but in vain. When she came down to the  valley, she ran till she reached the Marwa mountain. She ran to and fro (between the two  mountains) many times. They she said to herself, &#8216;i&#8217;d better go and see the state of the  child,&#8217; she went and found it in a state of one on the point of dying. She could not  endure to watch it dying and said (to herself), &#8216;If I go and look, I may find somebody.&#8217;  She went and ascended the Safa mountain and looked for a long while but could not find  anybody. Thus she completed seven rounds (of running) between Safa and Marwa. Again she  said (to herself), &#8216;I&#8217;d better go back and see the state of the child.&#8217; But suddenly she  heard a voice, and she said to that strange voice, &#8216;Help us if you can offer any help.&#8217;  Lo! It was Gabriel (who had made the voice). Gabriel hit the earth with his heel like this  (Ibn &#8216;Abbas hit the earth with his heel to Illustrate it), and so the water gushed out.  Ishmael&#8217;s mother was astonished and started digging. (Abu Al-Qasim) (i.e. the Prophet)  said, &#8220;If she had left the water, (flow naturally without her intervention), it would  have been flowing on the surface of the earth.&#8221;) Ishmael&#8217;s mother started drinking  from the water and her milk increased for her child . Afterwards some people of the tribe  of Jurhum, while passing through the bottom of the valley, saw some birds, and that  astonished them, and they said, &#8216;Birds can only be found at a place where there is water.&#8217;  They sent a messenger who searched the place and found the water, and returned to inform  them about it. Then they all went to her and said, &#8216;O ishmael&#8217;s mother! Will you allow us  to be with you (or dwell with you)?&#8217; (And thus they stayed there.) Later on her boy  reached the age of puberty and married a lady from them. Then an idea occurred to Abraham  which he disclosed to his wife (Sarah), &#8216;I want to call on my dependents I left (at  Mecca).&#8217; When he went there, he greeted (Ishmael&#8217;s wife) and said, &#8216;Where is Ishmael?&#8217; She  replied, &#8216;He has gone out hunting.&#8217; Abraham said (to her), &#8216;When he comes, tell him to  change the threshold of his gate.&#8217; When he came, she told him the same whereupon Ishmael  said to her, &#8216;You are the threshold, so go to your family (i.e. you are divorced).&#8217; Again  Abraham thought of visiting his dependents whom he had left (at Mecca), and he told his  wife (Sarah) of his intentions. Abraham came to Ishmael&#8217;s house and asked. &#8220;Where is  Ishmael?&#8221; Ishmael&#8217;s wife replied, &#8220;He has gone out hunting,&#8221; and added,  &#8220;Will you stay (for some time) and have something to eat and drink?&#8217; Abraham asked,  &#8216;What is your food and what is your drink?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;Our food is meat and our drink  is water.&#8217; He said, &#8216;O Allah! Bless their meals and their drink.&#8221; Abu Al-Qa-sim (i.e.  Prophet) said, &#8220;Because of Abraham&#8217;s invocation there are blessings (in Mecca).&#8221;  Once more Abraham thought of visiting his family he had left (at Mecca), so he told his  wife (Sarah) of his decision. He went and found Ishmael behind the Zam-zam well, mending  his arrows. He said, &#8220;O Ishmael, Your Lord has ordered me to build a house for  Him.&#8221; Ishmael said, &#8220;Obey (the order of) your Lord.&#8221; Abraham said,  &#8220;Allah has also ordered me that you should help me therein.&#8221; Ishmael said,  &#8220;Then I will do.&#8221; So, both of them rose and Abraham started building (the Ka&#8217;ba)  while Ishmael went on handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, &#8220;O our  Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the  All-Knowing.&#8221; (2.127). When the building became high and the old man (i.e. Abraham)  could no longer lift the stones (to such a high position), he stood over the stone of  Al-Maqam and Ishmael carried on handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, &#8216;O  our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily You are All-Hearing, All-Knowing.&#8221;  (2.127) </font></p>

Against that which you  assert, it is Allah (Alone) Whose Help can be sought.&#8217; (12.18) The Prophet left and then  Allah revealed the Verses (concerning the matter), and on that &#8216;Aisha said, &#8216;Thanks to  Allah (only) and not to anybody else.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked &#8216;Aisha the wife of the Prophet about the meaning of  the following Verse: &#8212; &#8220;(Respite will be granted) &#8216;Until when the apostles give up  hope (of their people) and thought that they were denied (by their  people)&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;(12.110) &#8216;Aisha replied, &#8220;Really, their nations did not  believe them.&#8221; I said, &#8220;By Allah! They were definite that their nations treated  them as liars and it was not a matter of suspecting.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;O &#8216;Uraiya  (i.e. &#8216;Urwa)! No doubt, they were quite sure about it.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I said, &#8220;May the Verse be read in such a way as to  mean that the apostles thought that Allah did not help them?&#8221; Aisha said, &#8220;Allah  forbid! (Impossible) The Apostles did not suspect their Lord of such a thing. But this  Verse is concerned with the Apostles&#8217; followers who had faith in their Lord and believed  in their apostles and their period of trials was long and Allah&#8217;s Help was delayed till  the apostles gave up hope for the conversion of the disbelievers amongst their nation and  suspected that even their followers were shaken in their belief, Allah&#8217;s Help then came to  them.&#8221; Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: The Prophet said, &#8220;The honorable, the son of the  honorable, the son of the honorable, (was) Joseph, the son of Jacob! the son of Isaac, the  son of Abraham.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That he differed with Al-Hur bin Qais Al-Fazari regarding  the companion of Moses. Ibn &#8216;Abbas said that he was Al-Khadir. Meanwhile Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b  passed by them and Ibn &#8216;Abbas called him saying, &#8220;My friend and I have differed  regarding Moses&#8217; companion whom Moses asked the way to meet. Have you heard Allah&#8217;s  Apostle mentioning something about him?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle  saying, &#8216;While Moses was sitting in the company of some Israelites, a man came and asked  (him), &#8216;Do you know anyone who is more learned than you?&#8217; Moses replied, &#8216;No.&#8217; So, Allah  sent the Divine Inspiration to Moses: &#8216;Yes, Our slave, Khadir (is more learned than you).&#8217;  Moses asked how to meet him (i.e. Khadir). So, the fish, was made, as a sign for him, and  he was told that when the fish was lost, he should return and there he would meet him. So,  Moses went on looking for the sign of the fish in the sea. The servant boy of Moses said  to him, &#8216;Do you know that when we were sitting by the side of the rock, I forgot the fish,  and t was only Satan who made me forget to tell (you) about it.&#8217; Moses said, That was what  we were seeking after,&#8217; and both of them returned, following their footmarks and found  Khadir; and what happened further to them, is mentioned in Allah&#8217;s Book.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Said bin Jubair: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I said to Ibn Abbas, &#8220;Nauf Al-Bukah claims that Moses,  the companion of Al-Khadir was not Moses (the prophet) of the children of Israel, but some  other Moses.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s enemy (i.e. Nauf) has told a lie. Ubai  bin Ka&#8217;b told us that the Prophet said, &#8216;Once Moses stood up and addressed Bani Israel. He  was asked who was the most learned man amongst the people. He said, &#8216;I.&#8217; Allah admonished  him as he did not attribute absolute knowledge to Him (Allah). So, Allah said to him,  &#8216;Yes, at the junction of the two seas there is a Slave of Mine who is more learned than  you.&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;O my Lord! How can I meet him?&#8217; Allah said, &#8216;Take a fish and put it in  a large basket and you will find him at the place where you will lose the fish.&#8217; Moses  took a fish and put it in a basket and proceeded along with his (servant) boy, Yusha &#8216;bin  Nun, till they reached the rock where they laid their heads (i.e. lay down). Moses slept,  and the fish, moving out of the basket, fell into the sea. It took its way into the sea  (straight) as in a tunnel. Allah stopped the flow of water over the fish and it became  like an arch (the Prophet pointed out this arch with his hands). They travelled the rest  of the night, and the next day Moses said to his boy (servant), &#8216;Give us our food, for  indeed, we have suffered much fatigue in this journey of ours.&#8217; Moses did not feel tired  till he crossed that place which Allah had ordered him to seek after. His boy (servant)  said to him, &#8216;Do you know that when we were sitting near that rock, I forgot the fish, and  none but Satan caused me to forget to tell (you) about it, and it took its course into the  sea in an amazing way?.&#8217; So there was a path for the fish and that astonished them. Moses  said, &#8216;That was what we were seeking after.&#8217; So, both of them retraced their footsteps  till they reached the rock. There they saw a man Lying covered with a garment. Moses  greeted him and he replied saying, &#8216;How do people greet each other in your land?&#8217; Moses  said, &#8216;I am Moses.&#8217; The man asked, &#8216;Moses of Bani Israel?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;Yes, I have come  to you so that you may teach me from those things which Allah has taught you.&#8217; He said, &#8216;O  Moses! I have some of the Knowledge of Allah which Allah has taught me, and which you do  not know, while you have some of the Knowledge of Allah which Allah has taught you and  which I do not know.&#8217; Moses asked, &#8216;May I follow you?&#8217; He said, &#8216;But you will not be able  to remain patient with me for how can you be patient about things which you will not be  able to understand?&#8217; (Moses said, &#8216;You will find me, if Allah so will, truly patient, and  I will not disobey you in aught.&#8217;) So, both of them set out walking along the sea-shore, a  boat passed by them and they asked the crew of the boat to take them on board. The crew  recognized Al-Khadir and so they took them on board without fare. When they were on board  the boat, a sparrow came and stood on the edge of the boat and dipped its beak once or  twice into the sea. Al-Khadir said to Moses, &#8216;O Moses! My knowledge and your knowledge  have not decreased Allah&#8217;s Knowledge except as much as this sparrow has decreased the  water of the sea with its beak.&#8217; Then suddenly Al-Khadir took an adze and plucked a plank,  and Moses did not notice it till he had plucked a plank with the adze. Moses said to him,  &#8216;What have you done? They took us on board charging us nothing; yet you I have  intentionally made a hole in their boat so as to drown its passengers. Verily, you have  done a dreadful thing.&#8217; Al-Khadir replied, &#8216;Did I not tell you that you would not be able  to remain patient with me?&#8217; Moses replied, &#8216;Do not blame me for what I have forgotten, and  do not be hard upon me for my fault.&#8217; So the first excuse of Moses was that he had  forgotten. When they had left the sea, they passed by a boy playing with other boys. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Al-Khadir took hold of the boys head and plucked it with  his hand like this. (Sufyan, the sub narrator pointed with his fingertips as if he was  plucking some fruit.) Moses said to him, &#8220;Have you killed an innocent person who has  not killed any person? You have really done a horrible thing.&#8221; Al-Khadir said,  &#8220;Did I not tell you that you could not remain patient with me?&#8217; Moses said &#8220;If I  ask you about anything after this, don&#8217;t accompany me. You have received an excuse from  me.&#8217; Then both of them went on till they came to some people of a village, and they asked  its inhabitant for wood but they refused to entertain them as guests. Then they saw  therein a wall which was just going to collapse (and Al Khadir repaired it just by  touching it with his hands). (Sufyan, the sub-narrator, pointed with his hands,  illustrating how Al-Khadir passed his hands over the wall upwards.) Moses said,  &#8220;These are the people whom we have called on, but they neither gave us food, nor  entertained us as guests, yet you have repaired their wall. If you had wished, you could  have taken wages for it.&#8221; Al-Khadir said, &#8220;This is the parting between you and  me, and I shall tell you the explanation of those things on which you could not remain  patient.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;We wished that Moses could have remained patient  by virtue of which Allah might have told us more about their story. (Sufyan the  sub-narrator said that the Prophet said, &#8220;May Allah bestow His Mercy on Moses! If he  had remained patient, we would have been told further about their case.&#8221;) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;(The Prophet) Moses was a shy  person and used to cover his body completely because of his extensive shyness. One of the  children of Israel hurt him by saying, &#8216;He covers his body in this way only because of  some defect in his skin, either leprosy or scrotal hernia, or he has some other defect.&#8217;  Allah wished to clear Moses of what they said about him, so one day while Moses was in  seclusion, he took off his clothes and put them on a stone and started taking a bath. When  he had finished the bath, he moved towards his clothes so as to take them, but the stone  took his clothes and fled; Moses picked up his stick and ran after the stone saying, &#8216;O  stone! Give me my garment!&#8217; Till he reached a group of Bani Israel who saw him naked then,  and found him the best of what Allah had created, and Allah cleared him of what they had  accused him of. The stone stopped there and Moses took and put his garment on and started  hitting the stone with his stick. By Allah, the stone still has some traces of the  hitting, three, four or five marks. This was what Allah refers to in His Saying:&#8211; &#8220;O  you who believe! Be you not like those Who annoyed Moses, But Allah proved his innocence  of that which they alleged, And he was honorable In Allah&#8217;s Sight.&#8221; (33.69) </font></p>

So fast (sometimes) and do not fast (sometimes). Pray and  sleep. Fast for three days a month, for the reward of a good deed is multiplied by ten  time, and so the fasting of three days a month equals the fasting of a year.&#8221; I said,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I can do (fast) more than this.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Fast on  every third day.

So fast three days a month, for this will be the fasting of a whole year, or equal  to the fasting of a whole year.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I find myself able to fast more.&#8221;  He said, &#8220;Then fast like the fasting of (the Prophet) David who used to fast on  alternate days and would not flee on facing the enemy.&#8221; </font></p>

How excellent (a) slave he was ever  oft-returning in repentance (to us) (38.30) And His Statement:&#8211; He said: My Lord Forgive  me and grant me a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me.&#8217; (38.35) And His  Statement:&#8211; &#8216;And they followed what the Devils gave out (falsely), of magic in the  life-time of Solomon.&#8217; (2.102) </font></p>

Which mosque was built  first?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Al-Masjid-ul-Haram.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;Which (was built)  next?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Al-Masjid-ul-Aqs-a (i.e. Jerusalem).&#8221; I asked,  &#8220;What was the period in between them?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Forty (years).&#8221; He  then added, &#8220;Wherever the time for the prayer comes upon you, perform the prayer, for  all the earth is a place of worshipping for you.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;My example and the example o  the people is like that of a person who lit a fire and let the moths, butterflies and  these insects fall in it.&#8221; He also said, &#8220;There were two women, each of whom had  a child with her. A wolf came and took away the child of one of them, whereupon the other  said, &#8216;It has taken your child.&#8217; The first said, &#8216;But it has taken your child.&#8217; So they  both carried the case before David who judged that the living child be given to the elder  lady. So both of them went to Solomon bin David and informed him (of the case). He said,  &#8216;Bring me a knife so as to cut the child into two pieces and distribute it between them.&#8217;  The younger lady said, &#8216;May Allah be merciful to you! Don&#8217;t do that, for it is her (i.e.  the other lady&#8217;s) child.&#8217; So he gave the child to the younger lady.&#8221; </font></p>

Who amongst us does not do wrong to himself?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;The  Verse does not mean this. But that (wrong) means to associate others in worship to Allah:  Don&#8217;t you listen to what Luqman said to his son when he was advising him,&#8221; O my son!  Join not others in worship with Allah. Verily joining others in worship with Allah is a  great wrong indeed.&#8221; (31.13) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;None spoke in cradle but three:  (The first was) Jesus, (the second was), there a man from Bani Israel called Juraij. While  he was offering his prayers, his mother came and called him. He said (to himself), &#8216;Shall  I answer her or keep on praying?&#8221; (He went on praying) and did not answer her, his  mother said, &#8220;O Allah! Do not let him die till he sees the faces of  prostitutes.&#8221; So while he was in his hermitage, a lady came and sought to seduce him,  but he refused. So she went to a shepherd and presented herself to him to commit illegal  sexual intercourse with her and then later she gave birth to a child and claimed that it  belonged to Juraij. The people, therefore, came to him and dismantled his hermitage and  expelled him out of it and abused him. Juraij performed the ablution and offered prayer,  and then came to the child and said, &#8216;O child! Who is your father?&#8217; The child replied,  &#8216;The shepherd.&#8217; (After hearing this) the people said, &#8216;We shall rebuild your hermitage of  gold,&#8217; but he said, &#8216;No, of nothing but mud.'(The third was the hero of the following  story) A lady from Bani Israel was nursing her child at her breast when a handsome rider  passed by her. She said, &#8216;O Allah ! Make my child like him.&#8217; On that the child left her  breast, and facing the rider said, &#8216;O Allah! Do not make me like him.&#8217; The child then  started to suck her breast again. (Abu Huraira further said, &#8220;As if I were now  looking at the Prophet sucking his finger (in way of demonstration.&#8221;) After a while  the people passed by, with a lady slave and she (i.e. the child&#8217;s mother) said, &#8216;O Allah!  Do not make my child like this (slave girl)!, On that the child left her breast and said,  &#8216;O Allah! Make me like her.&#8217; When she asked why, the child replied, &#8216;The rider is one of  the tyrants while this slave girl is falsely accused of theft and illegal sexual  intercourse.&#8221; </font></p>

I was asked to take either of them which I liked, and I took the milk and drank it.  On that it was said to me, &#8216;You have taken the right path (religion).

While sleeping near the Ka&#8217;ba last night, I  saw in my dream a man of brown color the best one can see amongst brown color and his hair  was long that it fell between his shoulders. His hair was lank and water was dribbling  from his head and he was placing his hands on the shoulders of two men while  circumambulating the Kaba.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">It was authentically reported from Amir Al-Mu’minin (Commander of the Believers)</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> `Umar ibn Al-Khattab </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be pleased with him) that he <strong>condemned pursuing the monuments of prophets</strong> and ordered that the tree under which the Bay`ah of</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Hudaybiyah </span><span style="color:#000000;">took place be cut, when he learned that some people began going there. This was meant to protect Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah) and eliminate the means leading to Shirk, Bid`ah and superstitions related to Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic time of ignorance).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Below is some of what was mentioned by some scholars in this regard, so that you will be well informed about this matter.</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imam Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Al-Walid Al-Tartushy</strong> </span><span style="color:#000000;">said in his book &#8216;<strong>Al-Hawadith wal-Bida</strong>`&#8217;, a chapter entitled &#8216;A Chapter on Forms of Bid`ah&#8217;, p. 135,</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> &#8220;Al-Ma`rur ibn Suwayd </span><span style="color:#000000;">said, &#8216;When we went to perform Hajj with</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> `Umar ibn Al-Khattab </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be pleased with him), we saw a Masjid (mosque) on the way, so people began offering Salah (Prayer) in it.&#8217;</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> `Umar </span><span style="color:#000000;">said, &#8220;O, people! Those who were before you perished because of honoring such sites, until they took them as places of worship. If one arrives there at the time of Salah, one should offer Salah there; otherwise they should leave.'&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#000000;">On p. 141, he said on the authority of</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Muhammad ibn Waddah </span><span style="color:#000000;">that</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> `Umar ibn Al-Khattab </span><span style="color:#000000;">ordered that the tree under which the Prophet (peace be upon him) was given the Bay`ah be cut, because people began to visit it and</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> `Umar </span><span style="color:#000000;">feared that they might be misled.</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Ibn Waddah</span><span style="color:#000000;">said:</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> &#8220;Malik </span><span style="color:#000000;">and other scholars of</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Madinah </span><span style="color:#000000;">hated going to the Masjids and Islamic monuments in Al-Madinah except</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Quba&#8217; </span><span style="color:#000000;">and</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Uhud. </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Sufyan </span><span style="color:#000000;">entered</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Aqsa Mosque </span><span style="color:#000000;">and offered Salah there, but he did not inquire about those monuments or offer Salah there; and others who imitated him did the same.&#8221;</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Ibn Waddah </span><span style="color:#000000;">then said: &#8220;How many matters are now considered acceptable by many people that were once considered Munkar. People try to get closer to Allah through means that drive them further from Allah.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Shaykh-ul-Islam</span></strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"><strong> Ibn Taymiyyah</strong> </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be merciful to him) said in his book &#8216;<strong>Majmu` Al-Fatawa</strong>&#8216;, Vol. 26, P. 133:</span><a style="color:#000000;" name="AsforclimbingMountAl-Rahmah"></a></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;">&#8220;As for climbing Mount Al-Rahmah (at<span id="ContentParagraph"> `Arafah) </span>it is neither an act of Sunnah (supererogatory act of worship following the example of the Prophet) nor Mustahab (desirable).</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;">Nor is it Mustahab to enter the dome above it, called the Dome of Adam, to offer Salah there, or circumambulate it, as this is one of the major sins.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;">It is neither Mustahab to enter the Masjids at the place of Jamarat (stone pillars at which pebbles are thrown during Hajj) or offer Salah there. Circumambulation around them, the Stone, the room of the Prophet (peace be upon him) or anything other than the Ka`bah is a grave Bid`ah.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">He also said on p. 144 of the same section, </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;As for visiting the Masjids that were built in</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Makkah </span><span style="color:#000000;">other than</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Masjid Al-Haram </span><span style="color:#000000;">(the Sacred Mosque in Makkah), such as the one by the foot of</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Safa, </span><span style="color:#000000;">the one by the</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> foot of Abu Qubays,</span><span style="color:#000000;">and such Masjids that were built at the sites of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his Sahabah, such as Masjid Al-Mawlid (the Prophet&#8217;s birthday) and others, it is neither a Sunnah to visit these places, nor was it preferable by any of the Imams. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#000000;">It is only permissible to visit</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Masjid Al-Haram </span><span style="color:#000000;">in particular, and the sacred ritual places, such as</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> `Arafah, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Muzdalifah, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Mina, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Al-Safa and Al-Marwah. </span><span style="color:#000000;">However, visiting the mountains and areas around</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Makkah </span><span style="color:#000000;">other than</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> `Arafah, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Muzdalifah </span><span style="color:#000000;">and</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Mina, </span><span style="color:#000000;">such as</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Hira&#8217; Mountain, </span><span style="color:#000000;">the mountain at</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Mina </span><span style="color:#000000;">where it is claimed that there was the sacrifice dome and such places. It is not a Sunnah related to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), but rather a Bid`ah. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#000000;">The same applies to the Masjids built at the sites said to be monuments. The Prophet (peace be upon him) did not permit visiting any of these.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">In vol. 27, p. 134, of the same book, he also said:</span><a style="color:#000000;" name="Somepeoplemightaskwhetherit"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#333300;">&#8220;Some people might ask whether it is permissible to glorify a place where there is worn-out things and saffron as the Prophet (peace be upon him) was seen there. Glorification of such places and turning them into Masjids is an imitation of the People of the Book whom we are prohibited to imitate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#333300;">It was authentically reported that<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Umar ibn Al-Khattab </span>(may Allah be pleased with him) was traveling when he saw a group of people hurrying to a place. He asked, &#8216;What is this?&#8217; People replied, &#8216;It is a place where the Prophet (peace be upon him) offered Salah.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Do you want to turn the sites of your prophet into Masjids? If the time of Salah comes while a person is there, they can offer Salah there; otherwise they should leave.&#8217;<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Umar </span>said this in the presence of a number of Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them). It is known that the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to offer Salah in many places while traveling, and the people would see him in their sleep in different places. However, the Salaf did not turn any of these into Masjids or tourist sites. If this door is opened, many of the Muslim lands will be turned into Masjids and tourist sites, as people still dream that the Prophet (peace be upon him) visits them at home. Establishing such tourist sites is a loathed Bid`ah. Allah has not ordered that the places of prophets be turned into a Musalla (a place for Prayer) except Maqam Ibrahim (the Station of Ibrahim) in His statement: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 125" target="_blank" name="And(remember)whenWemadethe"></a>And take you (people) the Maqâm (place) of Ibrâhîm (Abraham) [or the stone on which Ibrâhîm (Abraham) عليه السلام stood while he was building the Ka‘bah] as a place of prayer (for some of your prayers, e.g. Two Rak‘at after the Tawâf of the Ka‘bahat Makkah)<img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#000000;">He has neither ordered that a stone be touched and kissed except Al-Hajar Al-Aswad (the Black Stone in a corner of the Ka`bah), or Salah be directed to a building other than</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Bayt-ul-Haram </span><span style="color:#000000;">(the Sacred House, another name for the Ka`bah). According to the Ijma` (consensus) of the Muslims, it is impermissible to make analogies in this matter. It is tantamount to asking the people to perform Hajj to a place other than</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Bayt-ul-`Atiq </span><span style="color:#000000;">or observe Sawm (fasting) in a month other than Ramadan, and so on.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">He then said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;The rest of the issues have been definitely answered. If a person offers Salah or recites Du`a&#8217; (supplication) intentionally at the place of a prophet&#8217;s footprints or site; the grave of a Sahaby (Companion of the Prophet), a sheikh, or one of Ahl-ul-Bayt (members of the Prophet&#8217;s extended Muslim family), a tower or a cave, this is a rejected Bid`ah in Islam, as neither the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) nor the early generation of Muslims or those who followed them in righteousness did so. Not one of the Muslim Imams preferred it; rather, it is a means leading to Shirk.&#8221; There is elaboration on this elsewhere. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">He then said on p. 500 in the same section,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#000000;"> &#8220;After Islam, none of the Sahabah used to go to Hira&#8217; Cave on purpose. It is impermissible for us to seek the caves of mountains or sit in seclusion there&#8230;As for sitting in seclusion in caves and traveling for a mountain to seek blessings, such as</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Tur Mountain, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Mount Hira&#8217;, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Mount Thawr </span><span style="color:#000000;">and others, it is impermissible for us. The Prophet (peace be upon him) stated: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;" name="Donotsetoutonajourneyexcept"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="18171" class="tip"></span>Do not set out on a journey except to three Masjids: Al-Masjid Al-Haram, this mosque of mine (the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque), and Al-Aqsa Mosque (in Jerusalem).</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">End of quote.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ibn Al-Qayyim</strong> </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be merciful to him) wrote on p. 204 of his book <strong>Ighathat Al-Lahfan min Masa&#8217;id Al-Shaytan</strong>, after warning against visiting graves to seek blessings in them and recite Du`a&#8217; there:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><a style="color:#000000;" name="TheSahabahdisapprovedofthings"></a><span style="color:#333300;">&#8220;The Sahabah disapproved of things much more trivial than this. Many people narrated from<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Ma&#8217;rur ibn Suwayd </span>that he offered Fajr (Dawn) Prayer with<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Umar ibn Al-Khattab </span>(may Allah be pleased with him) on the way to<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Makkah, </span>and then people began spreading everywhere. He asked, &#8216;Where are these people going?&#8217; It was said, &#8216;O Amir Al-Mu&#8217;minin, they go to offer Salah in a Masjid where the Prophet (peace be upon him) offered Salah.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Those who were before you perished because of this; they used to follow the traces of their prophets and turn them into places of `Ibadah. If the time of Salah comes while you are in such places, offer Salah there; otherwise you should leave, and do not go there intentionally.&#8217;<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Umar </span>(may Allah be pleased with him) also uprooted the tree under which the Sahabah made the Bay`ah to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him).&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">End of quote.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Scholars stated much about this issue. We hope that what we have already mentioned is enough and convincing for those who seek the truth. Having known the previously mentioned pieces of evidence from Shari`ah and the opinions of scholars on this issue, you would know that the call of the writer for glorifying Islamic monuments, such as</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Thawr Cave, </span><span style="color:#000000;">the place where Al-Rudwan Bay`ah took place and others; reconstructing what was demolished of them; paving roads leading to them; making elevators or cable cars for high places such as the two mentioned caves; turning them into tourist sites; erecting signs to them; and appointing tourist guides for the visitors is all contrary to Islamic Shari`ah, which provides for achieving and boosting interests, and preventing and curbing evil, as well as blocking the means leading to Shirk and Bid`ah. You would also know that we should prevent Bid`ah and the means leading to Shirk, even if those who call for them have good intentions, as they lead to great evil, change the rites of Islam, and create new places and forms of `Ibadah that were not prescribed by Allah or His Messenger (peace be upon him). Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5: 3" target="_blank" name="Forbiddentoyou(forfood)are:"></a><span style="color:#008000;">This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islâm as your religion.</span></span><span style="color:#008000;"><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Anything that was not prescribed in the era of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) cannot be made permissible later. If this door is opened, Islam will be misrepresented and innovated ideas will enter it. Muslims will thus become like</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> the Jews </span><span style="color:#000000;">and</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> the Christians </span><span style="color:#000000;">in their manipulating their faiths and changing them according to their whims and desires. That is why Imam</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Malik ibn Anas, </span><span style="color:#000000;">the Imam of Madinah (may Allah be merciful to him), made a great statement that all the scholars agreed upon, saying: &#8220;The last generations of this Ummah (nation) will not succeeded except when they resort to what made the former followers succeed.&#8221; He meant that what brought success to the first generation was adherence to the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), following their rules and avoiding what contradicts them. The last generations of this Ummah will not succeed unless they resort to what made the former generations succeed. He (may Allah be merciful to him) has spoken the truth. When people corrupted their faith, created Bid`ah and founded new ways, they divided into different sects, became confused with every sect rejoicing in what they had. Their enemies attacked them, taking advantage of discrepancy among them, weakness of faith, difference in intentions, and fanaticism of every sect to their misleading ways and Bid`ah, until the conditions of the Muslims have reached the current weakness and many nations have attacked them. All Muslims should return to their correct faith adhering to its just rules, learning from the original sources of the Qur&#8217;an and the authentic Sunnah, and advising each other accordingly. We must cooperate to achieve this in all fields, whether legislative, economic, political, social or others; and avoid anything that contradicts it or leads to ambiguity. In this manner Muslims will restore their lost dignity and their previous glory, and Allah will make them triumph over their enemies and rule the world</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Ruling on restoration of monuments</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">All praise be to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah, his family and Companions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Some newspapers have published articles on reviving and paying attention to monuments, written by some authors, including Professor<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Salih Muhammad Jamal. </span>These articles have been responded to by His Eminence, Shaykh<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Abdullah ibn Muhammad ibn Humayd. </span>He efficiently and instructively answered to the claims included therein, may Allah reward him. However, Professor<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Anwar Abul-Jadayil, </span>may Allah guide and inspire him with what is right, was not satisfied with that reply or had not seen it. Therefore, he wrote an article on the subject, published by the &#8216;Madinah&#8217; newspaper, issue number 5448, dated 22/4/1402 A.H. In this article, which is entitled &#8220;The Way of the Two Hijrahs&#8221;, he stated: &#8220;This is a review of the word published in the &#8216;Madinah&#8217; newspaper, issue 5433, on 7/4/1402 A.H., by Professor<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Abdul-Quddus Al-Ansary, </span>as a commentary on the investigation done by the researcher and man of letters, Professor<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Abdul-`Aziz Al-Rifa`y, </span>of the sites which the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) passed through on his Hijrah (emigration) from<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Makkah </span>to<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah. </span>It urges us to stimulate officials to set signs indicating such posts such as, for example, two tents as close as possible to the two tents of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Um Ma`bad </span>with whatever else is suitable for the rest of posts, after taking the necessary precautions to prevent any transgression that could impart to them the tinge of sanctity or glory, and any deviation from the requirements of Shari`ah (Islamic law). For, the aim is to inform students, researchers and tourists who want to know about this path and these posts, to perceive the difficulties that the Messenger (peace be upon him) went through during this secret and covert trip.This is meant only to give lesson and example and inure people to hardships in Da`wah (calling people to Allah), following the example of the Prophet (peace be upon him).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">However, side roads should be built and paved, off the main roads, with rest houses for the tourists, making it easier for people to enter the places where the Prophet (peace be upon him) passed, starting with<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Hira&#8217; Cave, </span>then<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Thawr, </span>and the place where the Prophet (peace be upon him) was pursued by<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Suraqah ibn Malik, </span>until we reach<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Quba&#8217;. </span>This should also include the preceding sites in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Makkah Al-Mukarramah, </span>such as Dar<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Arqam ibn Abul-Arqam, </span>the pass where he and his family were boycotted, the pathway he assumed during the Conquest of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Makkah, </span>and then the places he stopped at in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Abtah, </span>and also in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Hudaybiyah, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Hunayn, </span>and<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Badr. </span>This also applies to sites he stopped at in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah, </span>the battlefields of the conquests, and his places of presence in their rural areas, then his path to<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Khaybar </span>and to<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Tabuk. </span>This is thus meant to provide people with more information about his unique efforts in spreading the Da`wah, and to teach them to follow the Prophet&#8217;s example in that regard.<strong> [End of quote]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Likewise, Dr.<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Faruq Akhdar </span>recommended in his article, published in Al-Jazirah newspaper, issue number 3354, dated 13/1/1402 A.H., the development of archaeological sites in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia by the Muslims on a continuing basis, to ensure income; as he alleged that petrol reserves would run out. Maintaining his viewpoint, he stated<em> &#8220;that Christian religious tourism in the Vatican is one of the main sources of income in Italian economy. Israel sold empty bottles to the Jews in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> America, </span>under the claim that such bottles were full of holy air from Al Quds.&#8221;</em> He also pointed out that among the benefits this will bring about is that it will<em> &#8220;Engrave knowledge about Islam in the minds of Muslim children&#8230;&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Due to the <strong>bad effects that reviving religious monuments have on the `Aqidah (creed)</strong>, I wanted to clarify the truth and corroborate the writings of scholars on this issue, cooperate with those scholars in righteousness and Taqwa (fear or wariness of offending Allah), advise people for the Sake of Allah, expose suspicious points, and illustrate supporting evidence. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">Hence, I would like to say that taking care of monuments in the way mentioned above <strong>would lead to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship)</strong>. This is because people&#8217;s souls are weak and are prone to cling to that which they deems beneficial. Besides, there are many types of Shirk, which are imperceptible for most people. Hence, those who stop at these monuments &#8211; whether they are real or fake monuments &#8211; will realize that ignorant people wipe themselves with the dirt of these places, and with the trees and stones therein. Those ignorant people also pray there and invoke those to whom the sites are attributed, thinking that this is a means of approaching Allah (Exalted be He), attaining Shafa`ah (intercession), and having theirs distresses relieved. Such an ignorance-based approach is maintained by misleading callers whose souls are impregnated with idolatry, and who exploit these monuments to misguide people and encourage them to visit these monuments in order to acquire some financial gains. Regretfully, there is no one at these monuments to inform people that they are meant only for people to derive an example. Rather, the opposite usually takes place. </span><span id="more-243"></span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">This is evident to the wise people in some countries that are afflicted with the obsessive attachment to shrines, where people are accustomed to worshipping them besides Allah, and circumambulating them in the same way Muslims circumambulate</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> the Ka`bah, </span><span style="color:#000000;">on the pretext that people entombed therein are Awliya&#8217; (pious people). So, how far worse would it be if they were told that such monuments are attributed to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), knowing that Satan unremittingly seizes the most suitable times to mislead people, and therefore Allah (Exalted be He) says about him: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Sad, 38: 82" target="_blank" name="Ibl%C3%AEs(Satan)]said:ByYourMight,"></a>[Iblîs (Satan)] said:<em> &#8220;By Your Might, then I will surely mislead them all,</em></span><em><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Sad, 38: 83" target="_blank" name="ExceptYourchosenslavesamongst"></a>&#8220;Except Your chosen slaves amongst them (i.e. faithful, obedient, true believers of Islâmic Monotheism).&#8221;</span></em><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> He (Exalted be He) also says about Satan, the enemy of Allah: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-A&#096;raf, 7: 16" target="_blank" name="Ibl%C3%AEs)said:BecauseYouhave"></a>(Iblîs) said:<em> &#8220;Because You have sent me astray, surely I will sit in wait against them (human beings) on Your Straight Path.</em></span><em><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></em><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-A&#096;raf, 7: 17" target="_blank" name="ThenIwillcometothemfrombefore"></a>&#8220;<em>Then I will come to them from before them and behind them, from their right and from their left, and You will not find most of them as thankful ones (i.e. they will not be dutiful to You).</em>&#8220;</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> Satan deceived Adam (peace be upon him) and caused him to be driven out of Jannah (Paradise), although Allah (Exalted be He) had warned Adam against Satan, and showed him that Satan was his enemy, as</span><span style="color:#000000;">Allah (Exalted be He) says in Surah (chapter) Ta-ha: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Ta­Ha, 20: 121" target="_blank" name="Thentheybothateofthetree,"></a><em>Thus did Adam disobey his Lord, so he went astray.</em></span><em><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Ta­Ha, 20: 122" target="_blank" name="ThenhisLordchosehim,andturned"></a>Then his Lord chose him, and turned to him with forgiveness, and gave him guidance.</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Another example is the <strong>story of</strong></span><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> the Children of Israel </span><span style="color:#000000;">with</span></strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"><strong> Al-Samiry</strong> </span><span style="color:#000000;">when he molded for them, out of their possessions, a calf to worship instead of Allah. Then, Satan made this act fair-seeming to them, although it was clearly false. It has been authentically reported in Jami` (Hadith Compilation of)</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Tirmidhy </span><span style="color:#000000;">and others through an authentic Isnad (chain of narrators) from</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Abu Waqid Al-Laythy </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;" name="WewentoutwiththeMessenger"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="10630" class="tip"></span>We went out with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) to Hunayn, when we had just recently left Kufr (disbelief). The Mushriks (those who associate others with Allah in worship) had a lote-tree which they would frequent and would hang their swords upon. They called it &#8216;Dhat Anwat&#8217;. When we passed by a lote-tree, we said, &#8216;O Messenger of Allah, assign for us a Dhat Anwat just like the one they have?&#8217; The Messenger (peace be upon him) said, &#8216;Allahu Akbar (Allah is the Most Great)! By the One (Allah) in Whose Hand is my soul, you have said what the Children of Israel said to Musa, &#8216;Make for us a god as they have gods.&#8217; Certainly, you will follow the ways of those who came before you.</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> Thus, the Prophet (peace be upon him) likened their saying: &#8220;Assign for us a Dhat Anwat just like the one they have&#8221; to that of</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> the Children of Israel </span><span style="color:#000000;">who said: &#8220;Make for us a god as they have gods.&#8221; This indicates that the meanings and purposes are what count, not merely the words. And due to the gravity of the crime of Shirk and its threats in ruining one&#8217;s work, we find the Khalil (beloved, close elect) of Allah, Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham, peace be upon him), invoke Allah to safeguard him and his children against Shirk. Allah (Exalted be He) says: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Ibrahim, 14: 35" target="_blank" name="And(remember)whenIbr%C3%A2h%C3%AEm(Abraham)"></a>And (remember) when Ibrâhîm (Abraham) said: &#8220;O my Lord! Make this city (Makkah) one of peace and security, and keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols.</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Ibrahim, 14: 36" target="_blank" name="OmyLord!Theyhaveindeedled"></a>O my Lord! They have indeed led astray many among mankind.</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> If the prophets and messengers &#8211; who are the best of creation, the most knowledgeable about Allah, and the most fearful of Him &#8211; were afraid of this, then others are more likely to fall into this trap. Hence, they should be warned of it, and all the means leading to it should be blocked.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">No matter how much precautions or reservations the followers of the truth take, this will not protect the ignorant people from the corruptions that result from sanctifying monuments</span>. This is because people differ in terms of their understanding,</span><span style="color:#000000;">vulnerability, and their search for the truth to a great extent, and therefore</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> the people of Nuh</span><span style="color:#000000;">(peace be upon him) worshipped Wadd, Suwa`, Yaghuth, Ya`uq and Nasra (these are the names of their idols), although the original purpose of hewing them out was to remind people of the good deeds of those individuals and thus encourage them to emulate these persons, not to idolize or worship them besides Allah. However, Satan misguided those who came after those people who carved such sculptures, and led them to worship these idols instead of Allah. This was the reason of Shirk among the Children of Adam, as was reported by</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Bukhari </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be Merciful with him), in his Sahih.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Regarding</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">the Tafsir (exegesis of the meanings) of Allah&#8217;s saying: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Nuh, 71: 23" target="_blank" name="Andtheyhavesaid:%E2%80%98Youshall"></a>&#8220;<em>And they have said: ‘You shall not leave your gods: nor shall you leave Wadd, nor Suwâ‘, nor Yaghûth, nor Ya‘ûq nor Nasr’ (these are the names of their idols)</em>.</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> Ibn `Abbas was reported to have said that these are names of righteous men from</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> the <strong>people of Nuh</strong>.</span><span style="color:#000000;">He added that when they perished, Satan inspired their people to set statues in the seats where those righteous men used to sit, and to name the statues after the names of those people. Sure enough, they did it. Then, they were worshipped only after those who had made them perished and knowledge was discarded.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">As for examples from the <strong>practices of the Jews and Christians</strong>, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) ordered us to guard against their ways, because it is the path to aberration and loss. It is impermissible to imitate them in their ways since they contradict our Shari`ah. They were also known for their misguidance, following their own whims, distortion of what was revealed to them through their prophets. Due to these reasons and others, we are forbidden to imitate them or to copy their ways. Consequently, the corruption which would result from restoring and reviving monuments are inescapable, and none other than Allah (Exalted be He) can know the extent and types of their evil consequences. Therefore, it is Wajib (obligatory) to prevent the revival of monuments in order to avoid that which could lead to further corruption. It is known that the Companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him, and may Allah be pleased with them) were the most knowledgeable people regarding the Religion of Allah, the most loved by the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), and the best to give advice to the slaves of Allah. However, they did not revive or sanctify these monuments, or even advise others to revive them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">Rather, when<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Umar </span>(may Allah be pleased with him) saw some people travel to the tree by which the Companions pledged allegiance to the Prophet (peace be upon him), he orderedthat it be rooted out lest people would idolize it and thus stoop to worshipping it besides Allah. The Muslims thanked him for doing so and considered this as one of his commendable acts (may Allah be pleased with him).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Moreover, if reviving these monuments or visiting them were a lawful act, the Prophet (peace be upon him) would have done so in</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Makkah </span><span style="color:#000000;">and after the Hijrah (Prophet&#8217;s migration to Madinah) or ordered people to do so, or his Companions would have either done so themselves or recommended others to do it, knowing that it has been previously mentioned that they were the most knowledgeable among people of the Law of Allah, the most loved by the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), and the best to give advice to the servants of Allah. It has not been proven that he (peace be upon him) or his Companions visited Hira&#8217; Cave when they were in</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Makkah </span><span style="color:#000000;">or in</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Thawr Cave. </span><span style="color:#000000;">They did not even do so during the `Umrah (lesser pilgrimage), the Year of Conquest, or the Farewell Pilgrimage. Besides, they did not go to the place of the two tents of</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Um Ma`bad </span><span style="color:#000000;">or the place of the tree of the pledge. Therefore, it became known that visiting these places, and paving the roads which lead to them is a newly-invented practice (in religion), which has no basis in the Law of Allah, and is among the gravest things that lead to major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship that takes the Muslim out of Islam). Since establishing buildings on graves and using them as Masjids (mosques) is one of the gravest matters that lead to Shirk, the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade it, and he cursed the Jews and Christians for making the graves of their prophets places of worship, informing us that anyone who does so is the most evil of creatures.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">It was authentically reported in Sahih</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Muslim </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be merciful to him) on the authority of</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Jundub ibn `Abdullah Al-Bajaly </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;" name="Bewareofthosewhoprecededyou"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="10699" class="tip"></span>Beware of those who preceded you and used to take the graves of their prophets and righteous men as Masjids.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">In addition, the perfect Shari`ah has indicated the obligation of blocking all verbal and practical means leading to Shirk, and scholars corroborated this with countless proofs. Among these proofs, the scholar</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Ibn Al-Qayyim </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be merciful to him) mentioned in his book [I`lam Al-Muwaqi`in] ninety-nine proofs, all of which prove the obligation of blocking all the means leading to Shirk or to sins. Such proofs include Allah&#8217;s saying:</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-An&#096;am, 6: 108" target="_blank" name="Andinsultnotthosewhomthey"></a>And insult not those whom they (disbelievers) worship besides Allâh, lest they insult Allâh wrongfully without knowledge.</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> And the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him): </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;" name="NoSalah(Prayer)istobeoffered"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="24568" class="tip"></span>No Salah (Prayer) is to be offered after the Subh (Morning Prayer) until the sun rises, and no Salah is to be offered after `Asr (Afternoon Prayer) until the sun sets.</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> This is meant to block the means leading to worship of the sun instead of Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">It is also meant to prevent imitation of those who do such acts. Another mentioned proof is that the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade building Masjids over graves, and cursed those who do so. He (peace be upon him) also forbade the plastering of the graves, venerating them, and taking them as places of worship. Moreover, he forbade facing it in Salah or offering Salah there. Likewise, he (peace be upon him) ordered leveling them (to ground), and forbade that people light lamps on them or travel to them, so that this would not be a pretext to taking them as idols or associating them with Allah in worship. Indeed, this is deemed forbidden for all people, those who idolize them and those who do not mean to do so, in order to block the means leading evil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">What is Wajib for the Muslim scholars and governors is to follow in the footsteps of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) in this and other matters. They are also obliged to forbid whatever the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) forbade, and to prevent anything which could lead to Shirk, mischief, sin or idolization of the prophets and the Awliya&#8217; in order to protect Tawhid (monotheism) and block the means leading to Shirk. We ask Allah to mend the affairs of Muslims and grant them comprehension of the religion, and to guide Muslim scholars and governors to that which will bring about their prosperity and salvation in this world and the hereafter. We also ask Allah to guide the Muslim to act upon the Law of Allah in all affairs, and to place all Muslims on His Straight Path. Indeed, He is the Patron, Capable of all things. May the Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon His Servant and His Messenger, our Prophet Muhammad, and his family and Companions and those who uprightly follow his guidance until the Day of Judgment.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Why Allah sent Prophets and Messengers ?</strong></span><br />
Source:  Appendix II from  &#8216;Interpretations and Meanings of the Noble Qu&#8217;ran&#8217;<br />
By Dr. Muhammad Taqiuddeen al-Hilaalee, Ph.D. and Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ever since people innovated the dogma of joining others in worship along with Allah, Allah had been sending Prophets and Messengers to His devotees in order to invite them to the worship of Allah and Allah Alone, to order them not to ascribe partners unto Him and bring them out of the darkness of polytheism and into the light of Monotheism. All the Prophets preached the belief in the Oneness of Allah. The following verses from the Noble Qur&#8217;an illustrate this fact:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed, We sent Nooh (Noah) to his people and he said: &#8216;O my people! Worship Allah! You have no other Ilaah (God) but him. (Laa ilaaha ill Allaah, none has the right to be worshipped but Allah). Certainly, I fear for you the torment of a great Day!'&#8221; (Al-A&#8217;araaf, The Heights 7:59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And to &#8216;Aad (people, We sent) their brother Hood. He said: &#8216;O my people! Worship Allah! You have no other Ilaah (God) but Him. (Laa ilaaha ill Allaah, none has the right to be worshipped but Allah). Will you not fear (Allah)?'&#8221; (Al-A&#8217;araaf, The Heights 7:65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And to (the people of) Madyaan (Midian), (We sent) their brother Shu&#8217;ayb. He said: &#8216;O my People! Worship Allah! You have no other Ilaah (God) but Him. (Laa ilaaha ill Allaah, none has the right to be worshipped but Allah). Verily, a clear proof (sign) from your Lord has come unto you, so give full measure and full weight and wrong not men in their things, and do not make mischief on the earth after it has been set in order, that will be better for you, if you are believers.'&#8221; (Al-A&#8217;araaf, The Heights 7:85)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And to Thamood (people, We sent) their brother Saalih. He said: &#8216;O my people! Worship Allah! You have no other Ilaah (God) but Him. (Laa ilaaha ill Allaah, none has the right to be worshipped but Allah).'&#8221; (Al-A&#8217;araaf, The Heights 7:73)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): Worship Allah (Alone) and avoid (or keep away from) Taaghoot (all false deities etc. do not worship Taaghoots besides Allah).&#8221; (An-Nahl, The Bee 16:36)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every Prophet was sent unto his own nation for their guidance, but the Message of Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam &#8211; peace be upon him) was general for all mankind and jinn (a being created from smokeless flames).</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Say [O Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam)]: &#8216;O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allah.'&#8221; (Al-A&#8217;araaf, The Heights 7:158)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the aim of sending these Prophets and Messengers to mankind and jinn was only that they should worship Allah Alone, as Allah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And I (Allah) created not the jinn and men except they should worship Me (Alone)&#8221; (Adh-Dhaariyaat, The Winds that Scatter 51:56)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And to worship Allah means to obey Him and to do all that He has ordained, &#8211; and to fear Him by abstaining from all that He has forbidden. Then those who will obey Allaah will be rewarded in Paradise, and those who will disobey Him will be punished in the Hell-fire.</p>
