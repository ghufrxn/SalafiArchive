<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>v. Reading the Life-Histories of the Salaf of this Ummah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Salaf of this ummah: the Companions of the Prophet &#8211; <em>sallallahu alaihe wa-sallam</em> &#8211; and their students and successors in righteousness, people of the first period of Islaam, are the best of all generations. They are the defenders of Islaam, guides for humankind and lions of combat. They are the participants of the great and momentous incidents and events and the bearers and transmitters of this religion to all who came after them. They have the strongest eemaan amongst the people, they are the most well grounded in knowledge, have the most pious of hearts and the purest of souls. The specifically chosen amongst them are the Companions of the Prophet &#8211; <em>sallallahu alaihe wa-sallam</em> -, whom Allaah favored with the sight of His Prophet &#8211; <em>sallallahu alaihe wa-sallam</em> -. He gratified them by granting them sight of his guise and honored them by allowing them to hear his voice and listen to his speech. They received the religion from him in a fresh and new manner, it took root in their hearts, their souls found tranquility with it and they remained firm on it on par with the stability of the mountains. It suffices as a representation of their excellence that Allaah addressed them with His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;You are the best people ever raised up for mankind&#8230;&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan (3): 110]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of which is, you are the best of all peoples and the most beneficial for the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Saheeh Muslim, Aboo Hurayrah, may Allaah be pleased with him, reports that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; <em>sallallahu alaihe wa-sallam</em> &#8211; said: <i>&#8220;The best of my ummah, is the generation that I have been sent in, then those who proceed after them &#8230;&#8221;</i>[Muslim, 4/1964. It is also related in both Saheehs by &#8216;Imraan ibn Husayn with the following wording: <i>&#8216;The best of my ummah is my generation, then those who proceed them&#8230;&#8217; </i>al-Bukhaaree, (7/3 Fath) and Muslim, 4/1964]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One who studies the condition of these righteous people, reads their biographies, perceives their sublime qualities and virtues and reflects on what they were upon, such as the tremendous character and mannerisms they had; their adherence to the noble Messenger &#8211; <em>sallallahu alaihe wa-sallam</em> -; their preservation over eemaan, fear of sins and disobedience; wariness of riyaa&#8217; and hypocrisy; their responsiveness to obedience; vying in performance of good deeds; their aversion to this transitory world and dedication to the everlasting Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One who does this, will come across during this contemplation and study, a number of fine qualities and numerous characteristics and attributes that attract him towards a truthful impersonation of them and a desire to adorn oneself with their qualities. Mention of them, reminds of Allaah and contemplation over their condition, strengthens eemaan and cleanses the heart. Fine indeed, is the verse of poetry:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Relate again their tale to me, 0 caravan leader for their tale polishes the very thirsty heart.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The areas for the study and refection on the biographies of these righteous people are the books of Taareekh (History), as-Siyar (Biographies), az-Zuhd (asceticism), or-Raqaa&#8217;iq (heart-softening narratives), al-War&#8217; (piety) and others. One benefits from those of the reports that have been authenticated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This contemplation and study produces fine imitation of them as Shaykh al-Islaam writes: <strong>&#8220;Whoever resembles them more, it will be a greater perfection in himself.&#8221;</strong> Furthermore, whoever resembles a people, becomes one of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of these aforementioned issues increase eemaan and strengthen it. They are issues that are classified under the beneficial knowledge derived from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger &#8211; <em>sallallahu alaihe wa-sallam</em> &#8211; and that which the Salaf of this ummah were upon.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>`ABDULLAAH IBN `AMR &#8211;<em>radiyallaahu `anhumaa</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(Abridged from ‘Siyar A`laamin Nubalaa·’ of Imaam adh-Dhahabee)<br />
Translated by Abu Talha Dawud Burbank <em>rahimahullaah</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdullaah ibn `Amr ibn al-`Aas ibn Waa·il ibn Haashim ibn Sa`eed ibn Sa`d ibn Sahm ibn `Amr ibn Husays ibn Ka`b ibn Lu·ayy ibn Ghaalib, the Imaam, the great scholar, the worshipper. The Companion of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and the son of his Companion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Muhammad and it is said: Aboo `Abdir-Rahmaan, and it is said: Aboo Naseer; al-Qurashee, as-Sahmee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His mother was Raa·itah bint al-Hajjaaj ibn Munabbih as-Sahmiyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His father was no older than him except by eleven years or thereabouts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has reached us that he accepted Islaam before his father; and it is said that his name was ‘<em><strong>al-`Aas</strong></em>’ [the disobedient one], so when he accepted Islaam the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) changed it to `<strong>Abdullaah</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He possessed many merits and virtues, and had a high position with regard to knowledge and action. He carried a great deal of knowledge from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was one of those who performed the <em>Hijrah</em> along with his father prior to the conquest of Makkah. His father was only eleven years older than him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) used to prefer him over his father, and in the time of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) he was a person who fasted a great deal, stood in (Night) Prayer a great deal, and recited the Qur·aan a great deal, and who sought a great deal of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He wrote down a lot of knowledge from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), and Aboo Hurairah acknowledged the great amount of knowledge he possessed, and said: “<strong>Because he used to write things down from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and I had not used to write</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ahaadeeth he narrates from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) reach seven hundred in number. al-Bukhaaree and Muslim were united in reporting seven of his ahaadeeth, al-Bukhaaree was alone in reporting eight, and Muslim twenty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He wrote down a great deal of narrations with the permission of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdullaah also narrated from Aboo Bakr, `Umar, Mu`aadh, Suraaqah ibn Maalik, and his father `Amr, and `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn `Awf, Abud-Dardaa· and a group; also from the people of the Book, and he closely examined their books and gave attention to that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was a person of excellence and was earnest in his affairs, and he criticized his father for taking part in affairs in the time of tribulation; however he feared falling into the sin of disobedience if he abandoned his father, so he was therefore present at the battle of Siffeen, but he did not unsheathe a sword.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He acquired a number of the books of the People of the Book and closely examined them, and found some amazing things in them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His father left him a vast amount of property, and he possessed slaves and servants. He also had a garden in Taa·if called <em>al-Waht</em> that was worth a thousand thousand (1,000,000) dirhams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of Egypt took a great deal of knowledge from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He passed away in Egypt in the year 65 H, during the nights of the siege of the capital &#8211;<em>al-Fustaat</em>&#8211; so when he died they were not able to take his funeral out because of the war between Marwaan ibn al-Hakam and the army of Ibn az-Zubayr. So he was buried in his home &#8211;<em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who narrated from him included Ibn al-Musayyib, `Ikrimah, Aboo `Abdir-Rahmaan al-Hubulee, `Urwah, Wahb, Ibn Abee Mulaykah, and Aboo `Amr Shu`ayb ibn Muhammad his grandson.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who narrated from him were: his son Muhammad &#8211; even though there is dispute about this, and narrations of Muhammad from him are reported in Aboo Daawood, at-Tirmidhee and an-Nasaa·ee; and his freed-slave Aboo Qaaboos, and his grandson Shu`ayb ibn Muhammad &#8211; who reported a great deal from him; and he served him and kept his company constantly, and he was brought up in his apartment because Shu`ayb’s father Muhammad died in the life time of his father `Abdullaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His students were many and included: his freed-slave Ismaa`eel, and his freed-slave Saalim, and Anas ibn Maalik, Aboo Umaamah ibn Sahl, and Jubayr ibn Nufayr; and Sa`eed ibn al-Musayyib, `Urwah, Aboo Salamah ibn `Abdir-Rahmaan, Zirr ibn Hubaysh, Humayd ibn `Abdir-Rahmaan ibn `Awf, Khaythamah ibn `Abdir-Rahmaan al-Ju`fee, Taawoos, ash-Sha`bee, `Ikrimah, `Ataa·, Mujaahid, al-Hasan al-Basree, `Abdullaah ibn Buraydah, Ibn Abee Mulaykah, `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Jubayr, `Ataa· ibn Yasaar, `Uqbah ibn Muslim, `Amr ibn Deenaar, Masrooq ibn al-Ajda`, Aboo Burdah ibn Abee Moosaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qataadah said: “He was a stout man.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hammaad ibn Salamah narrated: from `Alee ibn Zayd [[ibn Jud`aan]]: from al-`Uryaan ibn al-Haytham who said: “I came in a deputation along with my father to Yazeed. So a very tall man came. He was reddish and had a large belly. So he sat down. I said: ‘Who is this?’ So it was said: `Abdullaah ibn `Amr.”…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahyaa ibn Ayyoob narrated: from Aboo Qabeel: from `Abdullaah ibn `Amr that he said: “<strong>We used to write down what Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said in his presence.</strong>”..</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[…Yoosuf ibn Maahak: from `Abdullaah ibn `Amr who said: I used to write down everything which I heard from Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), wanting to memorize it. So the Quraish forbade me and said: ‘Do you write everything when Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) is a man, and speaks when angry and when pleased!’ So I stopped writing, and then mentioned it to Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), so he indicated with his finger to his mouth and said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Write, for by the One in Whose Hand is my soul, nothing comes out of it except what is true.</strong> &gt;&gt; (Saheeh: as-Saheehah: no. 1532)]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is established from `Amr ibn Deenaar: from Wahb ibn Munabbih: from his brother Hammaam that he heard Aboo Hurairah say: “<strong>No Companion of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) had more ahaadeeth than me, except for `Abdullaah ibn `Amr, because he used to write and I do not write</strong>.”…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qutaybah narrated: al-Layth narrated to us, along with someone else: from `Ayyaash ibn `Abbaas: from Aboo `Abdir-Rahmaan al-Hubulee: I heard `Abdullaah ibn `Amr say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“That I should be the tenth of ten poor people on the Day of Resurrection is more beloved to me than that I should be the tenth of ten wealthy people; for those with most will be the ones with the least on the Day of Resurrection, except for those who do like this and like this: meaning: they give in charity to the right and to the left.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[al-Bukhaaree narrated in his ‘Saheeh’ (no. 5052): Moosaa narrated to us: Aboo `Awaanah narrated to us: from Mugheerah: from Mujaahid: from `Abdullaah ibn `Amr who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“My father got me married to a woman of a noble family, so he often used to ask my wife about me. So she said: ‘What a fine man he is, for a man who does not come to my bed, nor has he approached me since he married me.’ So when that continued for a long time he mentioned it to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) who said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Let me meet him</strong>. &gt;&gt; So I met him afterwards and he said: &lt;&lt; <strong>How do you observe fasting?</strong> &gt;&gt; So I replied: “I fast every day.” He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>How long does it take you to complete reading the Qur·aan?</strong> &gt;&gt; I said: “I do so every night.” He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Fast for three days every month and recite the Qur&#8217;aan once every month</strong>. &gt;&gt; I said: “I have strength to do more than that.” He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Then fast the most excellent fast: the fast of Daawood: Fasting one day and refraining from fasting the next day; and finish the recitation of the whole Qur·aan once in seven nights.</strong> &gt;&gt; Would that I had accepted the concession of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), as I have become a weak old man.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he used to recite one seventh of the Qur&#8217;aan to some of his family during the day to make sure that he remembered it for the night; and whenever he wanted to gain some strength he would abstain from fasting for some days, count them and fast them later on for he disliked leaving something which he used to do during the time of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I [i.e. adh-Dhahabee] say: He inherited a very great deal of Egyptian gold from his father, so he was one of the kings amongst the Companions. …`Abdullaah accepted Islaam, and migrated after the seventh year and took part in some of the battles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo `Ubayd said: “He was in command of the right flank of the army of Mu`aawiyah on the day of Siffeen.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Khaleefah ibn Khayyaat mentions him as one of Mu`aawiyah’s governors of Koofah. He said: Then he removed him from that position and replaced him with al-Mugheerah ibn Shu`bah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There occurs in the ‘<em>Musnad</em>’ of Ahmad: Yazeed narrated to us: al- `Awwaam related to us: Aswad ibn Mas`ood narrated to me: from Hanzalah ibn Khuwaylid al-`Anbaree who said: “I was in the presence of Mu`aawiyah when two men came to him disputing with regard to the head of `Ammaar &#8211; <em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em>, so each one of them was saying: ‘I killed him.’ So `Abdullaah ibn `Amr said: “Each one of you should be pleased that it was his companion who killed him, and not himself, for I heard Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) say: &lt;&lt; <strong>The transgressing party will kill him</strong>. &gt;&gt; So Mu`aawiyah said: “O `Amr! Will you not spare us this crazy person of yours? Then why are you with us?!” He [i.e. `Abdullaah ibn `Amr] said: “My father made a complaint to Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), so he said to me: &lt;&lt; <strong>Obey your father as long as he lives.</strong> &gt;&gt; So therefore I am with you, but I will not fight.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[‘Saheeh’: ‘as-Saheehul-Musnad’ of Shaikh Muqbil]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Naafi` ibn `Umar related: from Ibn Abee Mulaykah who said: `Abdullaah ibn `Amr &#8211;<em>radiyallaahu `anhumaa</em>&#8211; said: <em>“What have I to do with Siffeen! What have I to do with fighting against the Muslims! I wish that I had died twenty years &#8211; or he said: ten years-before it. Yet even so, by Allaah, I did not strike a sword, nor fire any arrow”;</em> and it is mentioned that he held the flag.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Husayn al-Mu`allim related: from Ibn Buraydah: from Sulaymaan ibn ar- Rabee’ al-`Adawee: that he performed Hajj in the time of Mu`aawiyah amongst a group of the reciters: so it was told to us that `Abdullaah [ibn `Amr] is to be found in the lower part of Makkah. So we went towards him and found a very great party of people and baggage, with three hundred camels: one hundred for riding and two hundred for carrying, whereas we used to be told that he was one of the most humble of people. So we said: ‘What is all this?’ They said: ‘It is for his brothers; he conveys them, and whoever stays as a guest with him upon them.’ So we were surprised. So they said: He is a wealthy man, and they told us where to find him in the Masjidul-Haraam. So we went to him and found that he was a short man with mucus upon his eye-lids, and he was wearing a simple cloak and waistwrapper and a turban, and he let his shoes hang at his left side.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…Yahyaa ibn Bukayr said: “<strong>`Abdullaah ibn `Amr died in Egypt, and was buried in his small house, in the year 65 H.</strong>” This saying about the year of his death was also stated by Khaleefah, Aboo `Ubayd, al-Waaqidee, al- Fallaas and others.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;">(Abridged from ‘Siyar A`laamin Nubalaa·’ of Imaam adh-Dhahabee)</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;">Translated by Abu Talha Dawud Burbank <em>rahimahullaah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“`Abdullaah ibn `Abbaas ibn `Abdul-Muttalib -radiyallaahu `anhumaa- the Imaam, the ocean of knowledge, the great scholar (<em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>abr</em>) of the Ummah, and the Imaam of Tafseer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul-`Abbaas, al-Haashimee, the son of the paternal uncle of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), and the father of the khulafaa· [i.e. the later `Abbaasid caliphs.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was born in the mountain pass of Banoo Haashim, three years before the Hijrah. He accompanied the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) for about thirty months, and Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) died when he was thirteen years old. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) supplicated for him that Allaah should grant him knowledge and understanding of the Religion, and should teach him explanation of the Book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Khaalid al-Hadhdhaa· said: from `Ikrimah: from Ibn `Abbaas who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) stroked my head and supplicated for wisdom for me.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Aboo `Aasim: Shabeeb ibn Bishr related to us: `Ikrimah related to us: from Ibn `Abbaas who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) went to relieve himself, then he moved away and found a covered pot (of water), so he said: &lt;&lt; Who brought this? &gt;&gt; So `Abdullaah (ibn `Abbaas) said: “It was I”, so he said: &lt;&lt; O Allaah teach him explanation of the Qur·aan. &gt;&gt;</span></strong> [Saheeh: ‘Sharhut-Tahaawiyyah’ (no. 180), ‘as-Saheehah’ (no. 2589)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-al-A`mash: from `Abud-Duhaa: from Masrooq who said: Ibn Mas`ood said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“What a fine explainer of the Qur·aan is Ibn `Abbaas! If he had reached our age, then none of us would have attained a tenth of his knowledge.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-al-A`mash: from Aboo Waa·il:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> “`Alee placed Ibn `Abbaas in charge of the Hajj, so he gave a khutbah that day which was such that if it had been heard by the Turks and the Romans they would have accepted Islaam. Then he recited Sooratun-Noor to them and began explaining it.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He narrated a good number of narrations from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), and from `Umar. `Alee, Mu`aadh, his father al-`Abbaas, `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn `Awf, Aboo Sufyaan Sakhr ibn Harb, Aboo Dharr, Ubayy ibn Ka`b, Zayd ibn Thaabit, and a large number of others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He recited Qur·aan with Ubayy (ibn Ka`b) and Zayd (ibn Thaabit). Mujaahid, Sa`eed ibn Jubayr, and a group took the recitation from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who narrated from him are: his son `Alee, the son of his brother `Abdullaah ibn Ma`bad, and his freed slaves: `Ikrimah, Miqsam, and Aboo Ma`bad Naafidh; and Anas ibn Maalik, Abut-Tufayl, Aboo Umaamah ibn Sahl, and his brother Katheer ibn `Abbaas; and `Urwah ibn az-Zubayr, `Ubaydullaah ibn `Umar, Taawoos, Abush-Sha`thaa· Jaabir, `Alee ibn al- Husayn, Sa`eed ibn Jubayr, Mujaahid ibn Jabr, al-Qaasim ibn Muhammad, Aboo Saalih as-Sammaan, Aboo Rajaa· al-`Utaaridee, Abul-`Aaliyah, `Ubayd ibn `Umayr and his son `Abdullaah `Ataa· ibn Yasaar, Ibraaheem ibn `Abdullaah ibn Ma`bad, and Arbadah at-Tameemee &#8211; the companion of the ‘Tafseer’, and Aboo Saalih Baadhaam, Taleeq ibn Qays al-Hanafee, `Ataa· ibn Abee Rabaah, ash-Sha`bee, al-Hasan, Ibn Seereen, Muhammad ibn Ka`b al-Qurazee, Shahr ibn Hawshab, Ibn Mulaykah, `Amr ibn Deenaar, `Ubaydullaah ibn Abee Yazeed, Aboo Jamrah Nasr ibn `Imraan ad-Duba`ee ad-Dahhaak ibn Muzaahim, Abuz-Zubayr al-Makkee, Bakr ibn `Abdullaah al-Muzanee, Habeeb ibn Abee Thaabit, Sa`eed ibn Abil-Hasan, Ismaa`eel as-Suddee, and many others besides them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And ‘at-Tahdheeb’ mentions <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>a hundred and ninety seven people who narrated from him</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-al-Madaa·inee: from Nu`aym ibn Hafs: that Aboo Bakr said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Ibn `Abbaas came to us in Basrah, and there was not anyone the like of him amongst the `Arabs in his body, his knowledge, his explanation , his handsomeness and his completeness.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-`Abdur-Razzaaq: from Ma`mar who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The greater part of the knowledge of Ibn `Abbaas was taken from three men: `Umar, `Alee and Ubayy ibn Ka`b &#8211;<em>radiyallaahu `anhum</em>.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Aboo Bakr ibn `Ayyaash: from Muhammad ibn `Amr: from Aboo Salamah: from Ibn `Abbaas who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I used to hear that a man would have a hadeeth, so I would go to him and sit until he came out. So then I would ask him; and if I had wished I could have got him to come out to me.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Zaa·idah: `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn `Abdullaah ibn al-Asbahaanee related to us: that `Abdullaah ibn Shaddaad, will you not be amazed? A boy came to me after I had laid down to take the noon siesta, and said: ‘There is a man at the door requesting permission to enter.’ So I said: “He must have come for some need, so grant him permission to enter.” He said: So he entered and said: ‘Will you not inform me about that man.’ So I said: “Which man?” So he said: ‘`Alee ibn Abee Taalib: when will he be returned to life?’ So I said: “Subhaan Allaah! (I declare Allaah free of all imperfections!) When everybody in the graves is resurrected.” So he said: ‘I do not see except that you are saying the same as those stupid people.’ So I said: “Get him out or I will beat him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Ma`mar: from Qataadah: from Mutarrif who said: “I heard Ibn `Abbaas say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Revising knowledge for an hour is better than spending the whole night awake (in Prayer).”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His mother was Ummul-Fadl Lubaabah bint al-Haarith ibn Huzn ibn Bujayr al-Hilaaliyyah, descended from Hilaal ibn `Aamir.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He had a group of children; the eldest being al `Abbaas -after whom he took his kunyah; and `Alee -the father of the khulafaa· and he was the youngest of them, and al-Fadl, and Muhammad, and `Ubaydullaah, and Lubaabah and Asmaa·.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was a person who was pleasant-looking and handsome, tall in stature, imposing, complete intellect, quick in understanding, a man complete in his characteristics.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His children al-Fadl, Muhammad and `Ubaydullaah died without offspring; whereas Lubaabah produced children and descendants from her husband `Alee ibn `Abdullaah ibn Ja`far ibn Abee Taalib; and his other daughter Asmaa·, who was married to her paternal cousin `Abdullaah ibn `Ubaydullaah ibn al-`Abbaas, gave birth to Hasan and Husayn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn `Abbaas went with his parents to the place of Hijrah [al-Madeenah] in the year of the Conquest, having accepted Islaam before that. So it is established from him that he said: <strong>“I and my mother were from the weak ones (who were excused from migrating): I was a child and my mother from the women.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Khaalid al-Hadhdhaa·: from `Ikrimah: from Ibn `Abbaas that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) wiped my head and supplicated for wisdom for me</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[al- Bukhaaree’s narration (no. 75) is: “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Once the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) embraced me and said: &lt;&lt; O Allaah bestow upon him knowledge of the Book</strong></span> &gt;&gt;.]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Shihaab narrated: from `Ubaydullaah: from Ibn `Abbaas who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I came riding an ass, and I was close to puberty, and Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) was leading the people in Prayer in Minaa.”</strong></span> [[al-Bukhaaree: no. 492]…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Sa`eed ibn Yoonus said: Ibn `Abbaas went on military expedition to Africa with Ibn Abee Sarh; and fifteen of the people of Egypt narrated from him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo `Abdillaah ibn Mandah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“His mother was Ummul-Fadl, the sister of Ummul-Mu·mineen Maymoonah, and he was born two years before the Hijrah.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was light-skinned and tall; his complexion was tinged with yellow. He was stout and he was handsome, fair of face, and he had hair up to the ears. He dyed with henna, and the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) supplicated for wisdom for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: He was the maternal cousin of Khaalid ibn al-Waleed al- Makhzoomee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa`eed ibn Saalim narrated: Ibn Jurayj narrated to us, saying: we were sitting with `Ataa· in al-Masjidul-Haraam and were speaking about Ibn `Abbaas. So `Ataa· said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I never see the moon on the fourteenth night [[i.e. when full and bright]] except that it reminds me of the face of Ibn `Abbaas.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibraaheem ibn al-Hakam ibn Abaan narrated: from his father: from `Ikrimah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“When Ibn `Abbaas passed along a path-way the women in the walled gardens would say: ‘Is it musk that has gone by, or was it Ibn `Abbaas?’.”…</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hammaad ibn Salamah and others narrate: from `Abdullaah ibn `Uthmaan ibn Khuthaym: from Sa`eed ibn Jubayr: from `Abdullaah [Ibn `Abbaas who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I spent the night in the house of my maternal aunt Maymoonah and I placed some water for the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) to take a bath, so he said: &lt;&lt; Who has placed this? &gt;&gt; So they said: ‘`Abdullaah’, so he said: &lt;&lt; O Allaah grant him knowledge of explanation, and grant him understanding of the Religion. &gt;&gt;</strong></span> [[Saheeh: Ahmad, at-Tabaraanee…]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Zur`ah ad-Dimashqee reports in his ‘Taareekh’ from Ibn `Umar that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“He [i.e. Ibn `Abbaas] is the most knowledgeable of the people regarding that which Allaah sent down to Muhammad.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Nu`aym reports in ‘<em>al-Hilyah</em>’ from Shaqeeq who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Ibn `Abbaas delivered a khutbah to us whilst he was in charge of the Hajj. So he started reciting Sooratul-Baqarah. So he would recite and then explain. So I began saying to myself: I have never seen or heard the speech of a man the like of it; if the Persians and the Romans were to hear it they would enter into Islaam. ….</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saalih ibn Rustum al-Khazzaaz narrated: from Ibn Abee Mulaykah: I accompanied Ibn `Abbaas from Makkah to al-Madeenah. So when he camped at a place he would spend half of the night standing in Prayer. So Ayyoob asked him: ‘How had his recitation used to be?’ He said: He recited:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَجَاءَتْ سَكْرَةُ الْمَوْتِ بِالْحَقِّ ۖ ذَٰلِكَ مَا كُنتَ مِنْهُ تَحِيدُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;">And the stupor of death will come in truth: this is what you sought to flee from</span>]]. [Soorah Qaaf (50): 19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he would recite it slowly and carefully, and be sobbing a great deal.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jurayj narrated: from Ibn Abee Mulaykah: that Ibn `Abbaas said: “The people have passed away and the apes remain.” It was said: ‘What are the ‘apes’?’ So he replied: “Those who resemble the people but are not people.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taawoos narrated: from his father: from Ibn `Abbaas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Mu`aawiyah said to me: ‘Are you upon the way of `Alee?!’ So I replied: ‘No, nor upon the way of `Uthmaan. I am upon the way of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Taawoos who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I did not see anyone greater in the respect they showed to Allaah’s prohibitions than Ibn `Abbaas [and whenever I remember him I wished I would weep].</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jareer ibn Haazim narrated: from Ya`laa ibn Hakeem: from `Ikrimah: from Ibn `Abbaas who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;">“When Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) passed away, I said to a man from the Ansaar: “Come let us ask questions of the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) because they are many at this time.” So he said: ‘How surprising of you, O Ibn `Abbaas! Do you think that the people will come to need you, when there are amongst the people the Companions of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) those whom you see?!’ So he left that ,and I began asking. So whenever I heard that a man had a hadeeth I would go to him whilst he was taking the noon siesta. So I would place my cloak as a pillow at his door, and the wind would blow dust over me. Then the man would come out and see me and say: “O cousin of Allaah’s Messenger! Why didn’t you send a message so that I should come to you?’ So I would say: “It is more fitting that I should come to you and ask you.” So the man [of the Ansaar] remained until he found the people gathering around me, so he said ‘This youth was more intelligent than me.’”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdul-Malik ibn Abee Sulaymaan narrated from Sa`eed ibn Jubayr who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;">“Some men of the Muhaajiroon felt that they had a grievance with `Umar because of the fact that he brought Ibn `Abbaas close to him [in gatherings] and did not do so with them; and he used to question him. So `Umar said: “Today I will show you something that will cause you to recognize his excellence.” So he asked them about this Soorah:</span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا جَاءَ نَصْرُ اللَّهِ وَالْفَتْحُ</span></h3>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">[When comes the Help of Allah (to you, O Muhammad (Peace be upon him) against your enemies) and the conquest (of Makkah)] </span><span style="color:#000080;">[Sooratun-Nasr (110)]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;">So some of them said: ‘It is a command from Allaah for His Prophet that when he saw them entering into Allaah’s Religion in crowds he was to praise Him and seek His forgiveness.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;">So `Umar said: ‘O Ibn `Abbaas! Speak!’ So he said: “He informed him when he was going to die. Meaning: It will be a sign for the approach of your death, so praise your Lord and seek His forgiveness.” [[So `Umar said: I do not know about it except what you have said.]]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yazeed ibn Ibraaheem narrated: from Sulaymaan al-Ahwal: from Taawoos: from Ibn `Abbaas that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Concerning a single matter I would ask thirty of the Companions of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Its chain of narration is ‘Saheeh’…]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Ikrimah: I heard Mu`aawiyah say to me:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Your master [i.e. Ibn `Abbaas], by Allaah, is the most knowledgeable one of those who have died and those who are alive.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is related from `Aa·ishah that she said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The most knowledgeable person about the Hajj who remains is Ibn `Abbaas.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: And he used to hold Hajj Tamattu` as being what is essential.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">..Ibn Jurayj narrated: from Taawoos who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;I did not see anyone with more piety than Ibn `Umar, nor anyone more knowledgeable than Ibn `Abbaas.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujaahid said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“I never saw anyone the like of Ibn `Abbaas; and he was, at the time he died, the great scholar of this Ummaah.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-A`mash narrated: from Mujaahid who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Ibn `Abbaas used to be called ‘the ocean’ (<em>al-Bahr</em>) because of his extensive knowledge.”…</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Masrooq narrated, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“When I would see Ibn `Abbaas I would say: ‘He is the most handsome of the people’, and when he uttered something I would say: ‘He is the most eloquent of the people’, and when he talked I would say: ‘He is the most knowledgeable of the people.’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Qaasim ibn Muhammad said: “I never saw anything futile in the gathering of Ibn `Abbaas.”…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo `Awaanah narrated: from Abul-Juwayriyah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> ‘I saw the Izaar of Ibn `Abbaas half way down his shins, or above that and he had a roman cloak upon him and he was praying.’…</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hazm said in his book ‘al-Ihkaam’: Aboo Bakr Muhammad ibn Moosaa ibn Ya`qoob ibn al-Ma·moon, one of the imaams of Islaam, gathered together the verdicts of Ibn `Abbaas in twenty volumes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The debate of Ibn `Abbaas -radiyallaahu `anhumaa- with the Khawaarijee</strong></span> which resulted in the majority of them returning from their innovation to the truth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AT-TABARAANEE reported in ‘<em>al-Mu`jamul Kabeer</em>’ (no. 10598): “Ishaaq ibn Ibraaheem ad-Dabaree narrated to us: from `Abdur-Razzaaq. Further Isnaad: And `Alee ibn `Abdil-`Azeez narrated to us: Aboo Hudhayfah Moosaa ibn Mas`ood narrated to us: both of them from `Ikrimah ibn `Ammaar that Aboo Zameel al-Hanafee narrated to us: that `Abdullaah ibn `Abbaas narrated to us, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">“When the (<em>Khawaarij</em>) separated themselves off in Haarooraa and gathered themselves together in some abode. So I said to `Alee: “O Ameerul Mu·mineen pray the Prayer in its earliest time so that I can then go and speak to those people.” So he said: ‘I fear for you from them.’ So I dressed in the best clothes I could and wore this Yemeni cloak. So I went to them and entered upon them whilst they were resting at the time of the start of the afternoon heat. So I entered upon a people who were such that I have never seen a people who strove harder in worship than them. Their hands were like the knees of camels, and their faces were scarred with the traces of prostration. So when I entered they said: ‘Welcome, O Ibn `Abbaas, what has brought you here?’ So he said: “I came to narrate to you from the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم): the Revelation came down and they know best about its explanation.” So some of them said: ‘Don’t speak with him’ and others said: ‘Rather we will speak with him.’ He said: I said: “Tell me the criticism you have of the son of the uncle of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), his son in law, and the first of those who believed in him; and the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) are along with him.” They said: ‘We criticize him for three things.’ I said: “What are they?” </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">They said: ‘The first of them is that he caused men to pass judgement in Allaah’s Religion, whereas Allaah said:</span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنِ الْحُكْمُ إِلَّا لِلَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;">Judgement is only for Allaah</span>]].’ [Soorah Yoosuf (12): 40]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">He said: “And what else?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"> So they said: ‘He fought but did not take any females captured as slaves girls, nor did he seize war-booty. So if the enemy were Disbelievers, then their property was lawful for us; and if they were Believers, then it was forbidden for us to shed their blood.’ </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">He said: I said: “And what else?” </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">They said: ‘He erased his title ‘Ameerul-Mu·mineen’ (chief of the Believers), so if he is not the chief of the Believers, then he must be the chief of the Disbelievers.’ </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">He said: I said: “What do you think if I recite to you from the decisive Book of Allaah, and I narrate to you from the Sunnah of your Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) that which you cannot deny, will you turn back?” They said: ‘Yes’. He said: So I said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">“As for your saying that he caused men to judge in Allaah’s Religion, then He says:</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تَقْتُلُوا الصَّيْدَ وَأَنتُمْ حُرُمٌ ۚ وَمَن قَتَلَهُ مِنكُم مُّتَعَمِّدًا فَجَزَاءٌ مِّثْلُ مَا قَتَلَ مِنَ النَّعَمِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">up to His Saying:</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"> يَحْكُمُ بِهِ ذَوَا عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe, do not kill game whilst in a state of ihraam; and whoever of you does that intentionally, then the penalty is a sacrifice equal to the animal killed, as adjudged by two just men among you</span>.]] [Sooratul-Maa·idah (5): Aayah 95]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">And said, with regard to a woman and her husband:</span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ شِقَاقَ بَيْنِهِمَا فَابْعَثُوا حَكَمًا مِّنْ أَهْلِهِ وَحَكَمًا مِّنْ أَهْلِهَا </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;">If you fear a breach between the husband and wife then send an arbitrator from his family and an arbitrator from her family</span>]] [Sooratun-Nisaa· (4): 35]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">I adjure you by Allaah; does the judgement of men for the sparing of their blood and their persons and rectification of relations between them have more right, or their judgement with regard to a rabbit whose price is a quarter of a dirham?” They said: ‘O Allaah: For sparing their blood and rectifying between them.’ He said: “Have you abandoned this criticism?” They said: ‘O Allaah, yes.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">Then as for your saying that they fought but did not take captured females as slave-girls and did not take war-booty: then would you take your mother as a slave-girl and make lawful from her that which you make lawful regarding other then her, for in that case you would be Disbelievers; and if you claim that she [i.e. `Aa·ishah-<em>radiyallaahu `anhaa</em>] is not your mother, then you are Disbelievers and have left Islaam because Allaah -the Mighty and Majestic-says:</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">النَّبِيُّ أَوْلَىٰ بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ مِنْ أَنفُسِهِمْ ۖ وَأَزْوَاجُهُ أُمَّهَاتُهُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;">The Prophet has more right upon the Believers than their own selves, and his wives are as their mothers</span>]] [Sooratul-Ahzaab (33): 6]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">so you are between two deviations and may choose whichever of them you please. Do you abandon this argument?” They said: ‘O Allaah, yes.’ </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">He said: “As for your saying that he erased his title of ‘Ameerul- Mu·mineen’, then Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) called, on the day of Hudaybiyyah to write an agreement between him and them. So he said: &lt;&lt; Write: This is the judgement agreed to by Muhammad, the Messenger of Allaah. &gt;&gt; So they said: ‘By Allaah, if we knew you to be Allaah’s Messenger we would not prevent you from the House, nor would we have fought against you. But rather write: Muhammad the son of `Abdullaah.’ So he said: &lt;&lt; By Allaah I am the Messenger of Allaah even if you reject me. Write, O `Alee: Muhammad the son of `Abdullaah. &gt;&gt; So Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) was more excellent than `Alee. So do you abandon this criticism?” They said: ‘O Allaah, yes.’ </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">So twenty thousand of them returned and four thousand remained and were killed.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Hasan: ‘as-Saheehul-Musnad min Fadaa·ilis-Sahaabah’ of Mustafaa al- `Adawee (pp. 427-428)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn `Abbaas died in Taa·if in the year 68 H, and Muhammad ibn al- Hanafiyyah [the son of `Alee ibn Abee Taalib and Khawlah bint al- Hanafiyyah] lead the funeral prayer over him, and said: “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Today the wise scholar (rabbaanee) of this Ummah has died</strong></span>.” -radiyallaahu `anhumaa.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>ABOO HURAIRAH -radiyallaahu `anhu</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(Abridged from ‘Siyar A`laamin Nubalaa·’ of Imaam adh-Dhahabee)<br />
Translated by Abu Talha Dawud Burbank <em>rahimahullaah</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Aboo Hurairah ad-Dawsee, al-Yamaanee, the great memorizer, the jurist, the Companion of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم): <strong>`Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Sakhr</strong> in the most well-known saying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His name in the times of ignorance was <strong>`Abd-Shams</strong>. He said: “My father gave me the ‘kunyah’ of Aboo Hurairah (‘Father of the kitten’) because I used to tend some sheep and I found some wild kittens. So when he saw them and heard them he said: ‘You are the father of the cat,’ and my name was `Abd-Shams.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">at-Tabaraanee said: His mother -radiyallaahu `anhaa- was Maymoonah bint Sabeeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Hurairah performed hijrah and arrived at the time of the conquest of Khaybar in the seventh year.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He memorized a huge amount of knowledge from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), no one else acquired as much as him. He also took from Aboo Bakr, `Umar, Ubayy ibn Ka`b and Ka`b.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who narrated from him included al-Agharr Aboo Muslim, Sa`eed ibn al-Musayyib, Basheer ibn Naheek, Hafs ibn `Aasim, Humayd ibn `AbdirRahmaan az-Zuhree, Humayd ibn `Abdir-Rahmaan al-Himyaree, Aboo Saalih as-Sammaan, Khallaas ibn `Amr, Saalim Abul-Ghayth, Sa`eed alMaqburee -and his father Aboo Sa`eed, Sa`eed ibn Marjaanah, Salmaan alAgharr, Aboo Haazim Salaman al-Ashja`ee, Aboo Yoonus Sulaym ibn Jubayr, Sulaymaan ibn Yasaar, Shahr ibn Hawshab, Saalih mawlaa atTaw·amah, Damdam ibn Jaus, Taawoos, ash-Sha`bee, Aboo Idrees alKhawlaanee, Aboo `Uthmaan an-Nahdee, `Abdur-Rahmaan al-A`raj, Iraak ibn Khaalid, `Ikrimah, `Urwah, `Ataa·, Mujaahid, Ibn Seereen, Muhammad ibn Ziyaad al-Jumahee, Muhammad ibn Ka`b, Moosaa ibn Wardaan, Nu`aym al-Mujmir, Naafi` mawlaa Ibn `Umar, Hammaam ibn Munabbih, and a very great number of people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was one of the treasure-houses of knowledge, and one of the major imaams in verdicts, along with his great dignity and excellence, his worship and his humility.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Bukhaaree said: &#8220;<strong>Eight hundred people narrated from him</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is said: He was yellowish-brown, broad-shouldered, having his central incisor teeth widely spaced, he had two locks of hair and he used to dye with red dye. He was a poor man from the people of ‘as-Suffah’, he experienced hunger and need.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then after the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) his condition improved and his wealth increased, and he was a person who worshipped and remembered Allaah a great deal. He came to be the governor of al-Madeenah and deputed for Marwaan in his leadership, and he used to pass through the market of al-Madeenah with a bundle of firewood, saying: “Make room on the path for the chief”, and he used to joke -radiyallaahu `anhu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul-Qaasim ibn Nahhaas: I heard Aboo Bakr ibn Abee Daawood say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> “I saw Aboo Hurairah in a dream, whilst I was in Sijjistaan and was compiling his ahaadeeth, and he had a thick beard, was brown, and was wearing coarse clothes. So I said to him: “I love you”. So he replied: “I am the first student of ahaadeeth in the world.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ismaa`eel ibn Abee Khaalid: from Qays: from Aboo Hurairah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“When I migrated to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) I said along the way: ‘Oh what a long wearing night; yet it brought about rescue from the land of Unbelief’.” He said: “And a slave belonging to me ran away. So when I came and gave the pledge of allegiance the slave appeared, so the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: &lt;&lt; This is your slave, O Hurairah. &gt;&gt; So I said: “He is free for the Face of Allaah”, so I set him free.”</span></strong> [al-Bukhaaree: (no. 2531)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Ayyoob: from Muhammad: that Aboo Hurairah used to say to his daughter:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Do not wear gold, because I fear for you the blazing flame.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Saalim ibn Hayyaan: from his father: from Aboo Hurairah that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;I grew up as an orphan, and performed <em>Hijrah</em> as a poor man, and I used to be a hired worker for the daughter of Ghazwaan and my wages were food for my stomach and a turn upon the riding beast. So I would drive the camels along when they rode, and I would collect firewood when they stopped somewhere. So All praise is for Allaah Who gave strength and authority to the Religion and Who made Aboo Hurairah an <em>Imaam</em>.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-az-Zuhree: from Saalim: that he heard Aboo Hurairah say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“A people in the state of <em>ihraam</em> asked me about people not in the state of <em>ihraam</em> giving them as a gift some game that had been hunted, so I told them to eat it. Then I met `Umar and informed him of this, so he said: ‘If you had given them a different verdict I would have punished you’.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Qays ibn Abee Haazim: from Aboo Hurairah who said: “I came on the day of Khaybar after they had finished fighting.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Ibn Seereen said: Aboo Hurairah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“I would sometimes faint between the grave and the <em>minbar</em> because of severe hunger to the extent that the people would say: ‘He is possessed’, so a man would sit upon my chest. So I would raise up my head and say: “It is not what you think, it is just hunger.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Ahmad narrated in his ‘Musnad’ from Aboo Katheer as-Suhaymee from Aboo Hurairah who said: Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>O Allaah make this slave of yours -meaning Aboo Hurairah- and his mother beloved to your believing servants, and make them beloved to the two of them</strong>.</span> &gt;&gt; [Muslim: (2491)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Ibn Abee Dhi·b: from al-Maqburee: from Aboo Hurairah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“ I preserved two sack-fulls of knowledge from Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). So as for one of them, then I distributed it amongst the people; and as for the other one, then if I had opened it, then my throat would have been cut off.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[alBukhaaree: (no. 120): Ibn Hajr said in ‘Fathul-Baaree’: The scholars understand the sack of knowledge which he did not spread to be the ahaadeeth which gave the names of the evil rulers, and their conditions, and their times; and Aboo Hurairah used to allude to some of that but not state it plainly, out of fear of them for himself.]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-al-A`mash: from Aboo Saalih as-Sammaan who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Aboo Hurairah was one of the greatest memorizers amongst the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-ash-Shaafi`ee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Aboo Hurairah was the greatest memorizer who narrated hadeeth in his time.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kahmas narrated from `Abdullaah ibn Shaqeeq who said: Aboo Hurairah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> “I do not know anyone from the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) who memorized more of his ahaadeeth than me.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Aboo Daawood at-Tayaalisee: `Imraan al-Qattaan related to us: from Bakr ibn `Abdillaah: from Aboo Raafi`: from Aboo Hurairah that he met Ka`b and began narrating to him and asking him. So Ka`b said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I have not seen anyone who has not read the <em>Tawraat</em> having better knowledge of what is contained in it than Aboo Hurairah.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Hushaym: from Ya`laa ibn `Ataa·: from al-Waleed ibn `Abdir-Rahmaan: from Ibn `Umar that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> “O Aboo Hurairah: You were the one amongst us who most closely accompanied Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and the most knowledgeable of us of his ahaadeeth.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Hammaad ibn Zayd: from `Abbaas al-Jurayree: I heard Aboo `Uthmaan anNahdee who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I took Aboo Hurairah as a guest for seven days; so he, his wife and his servant followed each other, dividing the night into three. One would pray and then awaken the next who would pray, and would then awaken the third.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Ibraaheem ibn Yoosuf related to us: Ibn Rawaahah related to us: as-Silafee related to us: Ibn al-Busree related to us: as-Sukkaree related to us: asSaffaar related to us: ar-Ramaadee related to us: `Abdur-Razzaaq related to us: Ma`mar related to us: from Muhammad ibn Ziyaad who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Mu`aawiyah used to appoint Aboo Hurairah to be the governor of alMadeenah, but if he became angry with him he would send Marwaan to replace him, but it would not be long before he would re-appoint Aboo Hurairah and remove Marwaan. So he said to a black slave: “Stand at the door and do not prevent anyone from entering except Marwaan. So the servant did so. Then later when it became the turn of Marwaan he entered and said: “We were prevented (from entry)!” So he replied: ‘‘The one having the most right that I should not deny him is you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Khuthaym ibn `Iraak narrated from his father: from Aboo Hurairah that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) had gone off to Khaybar when I came as a muhaajir to al-Madeenah. So I prayed the Dawn Prayer behind Sibaa` ibn `Urfutah whom he had left in charge and in the first rak`ah he recited Soorah Maryam, and in the other one [Sooratul-Mutaffifeen] So I said: “Woe to my father! How rare it is to find a man in the land of the Azd except that he has two measures: a measure for himself and another one to short-change the people with.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Humayd ibn `Abdir-Rahmaan al-Himyaree said: “He accompanied (the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) for four years.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He suffered hunger and poverty, and adhered to the mosque. When he migrated he had a slave of his along with him but he fled and got away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hishaam: from Muhammad [i.e. Ibn Seereen] who said: we were in the presence of Aboo Hurairah [and he was wearing two linen garments dyed with red clay], and he blew his nose and wiped it upon his upper garment and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“All praise is for Allaah who has provided Aboo Hurairah with linen to blow his nose on! For I have seen a time when I would faint between the house of `Aa·ishah and the minbar because of severe hunger. So then a man would pass by and sit upon my chest </span></strong><span style="color:#000000;">[thinking that I had become possessed]</span><strong><span style="color:#000000;">. So I would raise up my head and say: “It is not what you think, it is just hunger.”</span></strong>[[al-Bukhaaree: no. 7324]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I [i.e. adh-Dhahabee] say: Those who saw him would think that he was possessed, and so sit on him to recite ‘ruqyah’ upon him, or the like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…from `Aamir: from Aboo Hurairah that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> “I was in as-Suffah </strong>[[a shaded place at the rear of the mosque of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) where the poor and those with no accommodation would stay]]<strong> so Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) sent some `Ajwah dates to us, so we would take two dates together because of our hunger; and when one of us wanted to take two dates at a time he would say to his companion: I am taking two dates at a time, so do likewise.”</strong></span>[[‘as-Saheehah’: 2323]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujaahid narrated: that Aboo Hurairah used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"> “By Allaah, besides Whom none has the right to be worshipped, I used to lay down on the ground resting upon my liver because of hunger, and I used to tie a stone upon my belly because of hunger. One day I sat by the way where the people would come out, and Aboo Bakr passed by. So I asked him about an Aayah from the Book of Allaah, and I only asked him so that he would satisfy my hunger, but then he carried on and did not do so. Then `Umar passed by me and so I asked him about an Aayah from the Book of Allaah, and I only asked him so that he would satisfy my hunger, but then he carried on and did not do so. Then Abul-Qaasim (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) passed by me and smiled when he saw me and recognized what was in my heart and on my face. He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>O Aboo Hirr!</strong> &gt;&gt; I replied: “At your service, O Messenger of Allaah.” He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Follow me</strong> &gt;&gt;. So he proceeded and I followed him, and he entered his house. So I requested permission to enter and was admitted. So he entered and found some milk in a bowl. So he said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Where is this milk from?</strong> &gt;&gt; So they said: ‘It was presented as a gift by such and such man, or such and such woman.’ He said: &lt;&lt;<strong> O Aboo Hirr!</strong> &gt;&gt; I said: “At your service, O Messenger of Allaah!” He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>go to the people of ‘Suffah’ and call them to me</strong> &gt;&gt; and the people of ‘Suffah’ were the guests of Islaam: they did not have families, wealth or any person to support them. So whenever some charity came to him he would send it to them, and he would not take anything from it himself; and whenever something was sent to him as a gift he would send something to them and take some of it himself, and cause them to share in it. So his order upset me and I said (to myself): ‘How will this small quantity of milk be enough for the people of ‘as-Suffah’?!’ I felt I was more entitled to drink from that milk in order to strengthen myself by it. But if they came, then he would command me to give it to them; and then what would remain of that milk for me?!’ However I could not but obey Allaah and obey His Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). So I went to them and invited them and they came. So they sought permission to enter and he admitted them. So they took their seats in the house. He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>O Aboo Hirr!</strong> &gt;&gt; I said “At your service, O Messenger of Allaah!” He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Take it and give it to them</strong>. &gt;&gt; So I took it and started by giving it to one man who drank until he was full, and then he returned it to me. Then I gave it to the next man who drank until he was full and then returned it to me, until I came to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and all of the people had drank until they were full. So he took the bowl and placed it upon his hand, then he looked at me and smiled, and said: &lt;&lt; <strong>O Aboo Hirr!</strong> &gt;&gt; I said: “At your service, O Messenger of Allaah!” He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>There remain I and you</strong>. &gt;&gt; I said: “You have spoken the truth, O Messenger of Allaah.” He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Sit down and drink.</strong> &gt;&gt; So I sat down and drank. He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Drink!</strong> &gt;&gt; So I drank, and he kept on saying: “Drink!” until I said: “No, by the One Who sent you with the truth, I have no more room for it.” He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Hand it to me</strong>. &gt;&gt; So I gave him the bowl, and he praised Allaah and mentioned Allaah’s Name upon it and drank the remainder.”</span> [al-Bukhaaree: (no. 6452)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…Aboo Katheer as-Suhaymee and his name was Yazeed ibn `AbdirRahmaan narrated: that Aboo Hurairah narrated to me, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“By Allaah, Allaah has not created a true Believer who hears of me except that he loves me.” I said: ‘How do you know that?’ He said: “My mother was a Mushrik woman, and I used to call her to Islaam but she would not accept it from me. So I called her one day but she said something disagreeable to me about Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). So I went to Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and I was weeping. So I informed him and asked him to supplicate for her, so he said: &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#808000;">O Allaah guide the mother of Aboo Hurairah</span>.</span> &gt;&gt; So then I went out running to give her the good news. So I arrived and the door was closed and I heard the splashing of water, and she heard the sound of my footsteps. So she said: ‘Wait as you are!’ Then she opened the door, and she had put her gown on, and had been too hasty to put on her khimaar. So she said: ‘I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and that Muhammad is His Slave and His Messenger.’ He said: “So I went back to Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) weeping with joy just as I had wept from sorrow, and I informed him, and I said: “Make supplication to Allaah that he should cause me and my mother to be beloved to His believing servants. So he said: &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#808000;">O Allaah make this slave of Yours and his mother beloved to Your believing servants, and cause them to be loved by these two</span>. &gt;&gt;” &#8211;</strong></span>“Its chain of narration is ‘hasan’.” [[Reported by Ahmad (2/319-320), and Muslim (no. 2491)]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Shihaab: from Sa`eed [Ibn al-Musayyib] and Aboo Salamah: that Aboo Hurairah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> “You people say that ‘Aboo Hurairah narrates too many ahaadeeth from Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)! And you say that why is it not the case that the <em>Muhaajiroon</em> and the <em>Ansaar</em> do not narrate like him!’ But my brothers from the <em>Muhaajiroon</em> were busy in the markets, and my brothers from the <em>Ansaar</em> were busy working upon their property. But I was a poor man from the poor people of ‘<em>as-Suffah</em>’. I used to adhere to Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and be content with what filled my stomach. So I would be present when they were absent, and remember when they would forget; and Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said to us one day: &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#808000;">No one will spread out his garment till I have finished what I am saying, and then gather his garment upon himself except that he will preserve whatever I say</span>. &gt;&gt; So I spread out a striped cloak which I had upon me until he finished what he was saying, and then gathered it upon my chest. So I did not forget anything from that narration.”</span></strong> [[al-Bukhaaree (no. 2047) and Muslim (no. 2492)]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">az-Zuhree, also: from al-A`raj: from Aboo Hurairah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> “You claim that I narrate excessively from Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)! Whereas the truth is known by Allaah. I was a poor man who accompanied Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and contented myself with whatever filled my stomach. So he narrated to us one day and said: &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#808000;">Whoever will spread out his garment, will never forget anything which he heard from me.</span> &gt;&gt; So I did so, and by the One Who sent him with the truth I have never forgotten anything which I heard from him.”</span></strong> [[al-Bukhaaree (nos. 118 &amp; 2350); Muslim (no. 2492)]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…al-Maqburee: from Aboo Hurairah who said: I said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“O Messenger of Allaah who will be the most fortunate of people to attain your intercession?” He said: &lt;&lt;<span style="color:#808000;"> I thought that none would ask me about this before you, because I have seen your eagerness upon learning hadeeth: The most fortunate of the people to attain my intercession on the day of resurrection will be whoever says: ‘None has the right to be worshipped except Allaah’, sincerely from his heart</span>. &gt;&gt;</strong></span> [[al-Bukhaaree (no. 99)]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ash-Shaafi`ee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Aboo Hurairah was the best memorizer of those who narrated hadeeth in his time</strong></span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…from Hammaam [ibn Munabbih] who said: I heard Aboo Hurairah say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“There is no one from the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) who has more hadeeth than me, except for `Abdullaah ibn `Amr because he used to write, whereas I did not write.”</strong></span> [[al-Bukhaaree (no. 113)]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdul-Waahid ibn Ziyaad and others: `Aasim ibn Kulayb narrated to us: My father narrated to us that he heard Aboo Hurairah, and he used to begin narrating hadeeth by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: &lt;&lt; Who ever lies upon me deliberately, then let him take his place in the Fire. &gt;&gt;”</strong></span> [[Ahmad: (2/413)]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…from Ibn `Umar that he said to Aboo Hurairah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>O Aboo Hurairah! You were the one from us who most closely adhered to Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), and the one from us who best memorized his ahaadeeth</strong></span>.” [[‘Saheeh Sunanit-Tirmidhee (no. 3836)]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Hurairah passed away in the year 58 H, and this was stated by a group; and others said: 59 H; and it was said: 57 H -radiyallaahu `anhu- at the age of 78.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">1- On the authority of Abu Huraira -Radi Allaahu anhu- who said the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- prayed the morning prayer, then he faced the people and said: ‘While a man was leading a cow, he began to ride it and beat it. So the cow said to him: ‘we were not created for this, rather we were created for ploughing.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the people said: ‘Subhana Allaah a cow spoke!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: ‘<strong>Indeed I believe this, me and Abu Bakr and Umar.’</strong> Even though they were not present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- continued: ‘While a man was with some sheep, suddenly a wolf attacked them and took away one sheep from amongst them. The shepherd called the sheep as if trying to rescue it from the wolf. The wolf said to him: ‘You want to rescue it from me, so who will protect it on the day when the predatory animal comes, the day when it has no shepherd other than me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the people said: ‘Subhana Allaah, a wolf spoke.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: ‘Indeed I believe this, me and Abu Bakr and Umar.’ Even though they were not present.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* Hafidh Ibn Hajr said: ‘It is possible that the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said that due to what he knew of their overwhelming Eemaan and the strength of their certainty.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- On the authority of Abu Huraira -Radi Allaahu anhu- who said the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: There was a man walking wearing a garment whose appearance impressed his own self. Allaah made the ground swallow him up and he kept tumbling down into it until the Day of Judgement.’ Abu Bakr and Umar testified to it, while Abu Bakr and Umar were not present.[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- On the authority of Ayyoob who said: that AbdurRahmaan bin Abu Bakr said to his father (Abu Bakr): I saw you on the day of Uhud but I avoided you. So Abu Bakr said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘if I had seen you I would not have avoided you.’</strong></span>[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- On the authority of Umar:<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> ‘If the Eemaan of Abu Bakr was weighed against the Eemaan of the people of the earth, the Eemaan of Abu Bakr would outweigh the others.’</strong></span> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5- On the authority of Aa’ishah who said: <strong>‘I swear by Allaah that Abu Bakr left drinking alcohol in pre-Islaamic times and he did not doubt in Allaah after having accepted Islaam.’</strong>[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6- On the authority of Ibn Shihaab who said:<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> ‘From the excellence of Abu Bakr is that he never ever doubted in Allaah – Azza wa Jal – even for an hour.’</strong></span>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7- On the authority of Bakr bin Abdullaah who said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Indeed the people did not prefer Abu Bakr because he would pray and fast more than them, rather they preferred him due to something his heart.’</strong></span>[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Aboo Bakr did not have excellence over the people ( lam yafdulin-naasa) on account of praying and fasting more than them, but rather he had excellence over them on account of something which was in his heart.&#8217; -And I think the reference should be Narrated by Imam Ahmad in ‘Fadail as-Sahabah’ with this wording (1:141) no. 118 .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from the book: ‘The Life of the Greatest Man After the Prophets &amp; Messengers: Abu Bakr asSiddeeq’ P.190-191]</p>

<p><strong>DO NOT ABUSE MY COMPANIONS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Aboo Hurairah-<em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em> who said: Allaah‟s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Do not abuse my Companions! Do not abuse my Companions! For by the One in Whose Hand is my soul! If one of you were to spend the like of Uhud in gold in charity, it would not reach the hands-full of one of them, nor even a half of it</strong></span>. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>* al-Haafiz Abul-`Abbaas al-Qurtubee said in &#8220;al-Mufhim&#8221; (6/492):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“From that which is known, about which there is not doubt, is that Allaah-the Most High-chose the Companions of His Prophet for His Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), and to establish His Religion. So everything which we now have from knowledge, actions, virtues, conditions, possessions, property, honour, authority, Religion, <em>Eemaan</em>, and other favours-which no tongue can enumerate, and which no amount of time can provide a valuation for, then it all came about by means of them. So this being the case, then it becomes obligatory upon us to acknowledge their rights, and to be grateful to them for their tremendous efforts in order to establish what Allaah-the Most High-has obligated with regard to being thankful to one who has bestowed a favor upon you, and to avoid what He has forbidden to showing ingratitude towards him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This goes along with what we have confirmed from the praise of Allaah-the Most High-upon them, and His Saying-He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">&#8230;لَّقَدْ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ إِذْ يُبَايِعُونَكَ تَحْتَ الشَّجَرَةِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah was indeed pleased with the Believers when they gave the Pledge to you under the tree</strong></span>]]…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Until His Saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">&#8230;مُّحَمَّدٌ رَّسُولُ اللَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah…</strong></span>]];</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Sooratul-Fath (48): 18-29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and His Saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">&#8230;لِلْفُقَرَاءِ الْمُهَاجِرِينَ الَّذِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And there is also a share in the booty for the emigrants…</strong></span>]] [Sooratul Hashr (59): 8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and other than this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And such as his (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>Allaah chose my Companions over all the worlds except for the Prophets and Messengers</strong>&gt;&gt; [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Along with the rest of the ahaadeeth comprising praise upon them-may Allaah be pleased with them all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So upon this whoever abuses them, and denies their tremendous rights, then he has relinquished <em>Eemaan</em>, and has responded to favours with denial.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So sufficient in this regard is what at-Tirmidhee reported from a hadeeth of `Abdullaah ibn Mughaffal-<em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em>-who said Allaah‟s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>Be dutiful to Allaah! Be dutiful to Allaah! With regard to my Companions. Do not take them as a target for (verbal) attacks after me. So whoever loves them then it is because of their love for me that they love them; and whoever has hatred for them, then it is because of their hatred for me that they hate them. Whoever wrongs/troubles them has wronged me; and whoever wrongs me has wronged Allaah; and whoever wrongs Allaah, then He will soon seize him with punishment</strong>&gt;&gt; [2], and he said: “This is a &#8220;<em>ghareeb</em>&#8221; (singular/weak) hadeeth.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this hadeeth, even though its chain of narration is weak, then it is authentic with regard to its text, since it is supported by what we have already mentioned from the Book and the authentic Sunnah, and by what is known from the Religion of the Ummah; since there is no disagreement about the obligation of having respect for them, and the forbiddance of abusing them. And there is no disagreement about the fact that whoever says that they were upon Unbelief or misguidance is an Unbeliever (<em>Kaafir</em>), and should be killed. This is because he has denied something known necessarily from Legislation: so he has declared Allaah and His Messenger to have lied in that which they informed of concerning them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same ruling applies to one who declares one of the four rightly-guided Caliphs to be an Unbeliever or to have been astray.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then is he judged to be an Apostate (<em>murtadd</em>)-such that repentance is sought from him, or is he judged to be an unbelieving heretic (<em>zindeeq</em>) –such that repentance is not sought from him, and he is thus to be killed whatever? This is something about which there is disagreement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for someone who abuses/reviles them with something other than this, then if it is something which would necessitate a prescribed punishment-such as accusing of fornication, then he is given that prescribed punishment. Following this he is given another severe punishment: life-imprisonment and he is humiliated; unless he is referring to `Aa.ishah-<em>radiyallaahu `anhaa</em>, since one who accuses her of it is to be killed. This is because he is denying what occurs in the Book and the Sunnah with regard to her innocence. This was stated by Maalik and others. Then they disagree with regard to the other wives of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). So it is said: Anyone who accuses them of adultery is to be killed, since this is to cause harm to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم); and it is said: he is to be given the prescribed punishment and further severe punishment-as we have said: there being two sayings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who reviles them with something other than accusations of fornication, then he is lashed in a manner causing pain, and he is given severe punishment. Ibn Habeeb said: And he is imprisoned until he dies, and it is related from Maalik that he said: &#8220;Whoever abuses `Aa.ishah is to be killed, without restriction‟, and it is possible to understand this to mean accusation of fornication; and Allaah-the Most High knows best.”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">‘Silsilah al-Ahadeeth as-Saheehah’.<br />
By The Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ Muhammad Nasur uddeen al-Albaani. Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3258</strong> – On the authority of Rabeeyah al-Asslamee who said : I used to serve the Messenger of Allaah <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> and he gave me some land, and he gave Abu Bakr some land, and when it came to dividing the land, we differed over a cluster of dates from a date palm tree. Abu Bakr said : this is on my side of the land! And I said : It is on my side! There used to be a problem between me and Abu Bakr, and Abu Bakr said a statement to me which I hated but he regretted saying it, so he said to me: ‘O Rabeeyah! Say something to me similar to what I said to you, so that it can be a requital.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I said : ‘I will not say it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr said : ‘You will say it or I will request the Messenger of Allaah <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> to order you to say it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I said : ‘I will not say it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr left that portion of the land for me and went off to the Prophet <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> and I followed him. The people from my tribe followed us and said to me: ‘May Allaah have mercy on Abu Bakr, why is he going to the Messenger of Allaah <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em>about you, and he said what he said about you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I said : ‘Do you know who this is?? This is Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq, he is one of the two who were in the cave, he is one who has grown old as a Muslim ( one of the elders of the Muslims), beware he does not turn around and see you assisting me against him and becomes angry and he meets the Messenger of Allaah <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> , and the Messenger of Allaah <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> will become angry due to him being angry, and then Allaah Azza wa Jal becomes angry due to them being angry and then Rabeeyah will be destroyed.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said : ‘What do you order us to do?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said : ‘Go back.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> went off to the Messenger of Allaah <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> , so I followed him by myself, until he reached the Prophet <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> and he told him the story as it was. The Prophet <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> raised his head towards me and said: ‘O Rabeeyah what’s the matter between you and as-Siddeeq?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said : ‘O Messenger of Allaah <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> such and such happened, and he said a statement to me which I disliked, then he said to me, say something similar to what I said to you so that it can be requited, but I refused.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Messenger of Allaah <em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> said: ‘Yes, do not say a word back to him, but say: May Allaah forgive you O Abu Bakr. May Allaah forgive you O Abu Bakr.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hasan said: ‘Abu Bakr turned around and he was crying.’</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 83 : Points 148-149</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong>148</strong>] <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Know that whoever speaks against anyone from the companions of Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), then know that he seeks really to attack Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and he has caused harm towards him in his grave.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong>149</strong>] <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>If some innovations become apparent to you from a person, then beware of him since what he conceals from you will be more than what he makes apparent.</strong></span></p>

<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">If you see a man criticizing anyone from the Companions of  Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>), then know that he is a follower of desires and a person of evil speech because of the saying of Allaah&#8217;s  Messenger (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>), “When my Companions are mentioned then withhold”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) knew of any slips that they were going to make after his death, yet still he did not say about them except good. And his saying , “Leave my Companions and do not say about them anything except good”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Do not discuss anything from their slips or their wars, nor that which you do not have knowledge of. Do not listen to it  from anyone who speaks with it, for  your heart will not be secure if you listen to it.</span></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Mu’aawiyah</strong> (رضي الله عنه) is the Sahaabee Sakhr Bin Harb Bin Umayyah Bin ‘Abd Shams Bin ‘Abd Manaaf Bin Qusay Bin Kilaab, Abu’Abdur Rahmaan. The Ameer of Al-Mu’mineen, and the King of Islaam. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“O Allaah! Bestow upon him the knowledge of the Book </strong>(i.e. the Qur’aan)<strong> and save him from torment.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Imaam Ahmad in Fadaa ‘il As-Sahaabah, V. 2, p. 913.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The checker said its <em>Isnaad</em> is <em>hasan</em> because of other narrations]. He also invoked Allaah saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“O Allaah! Make of him </strong>(i.e. Mu’aawiyah)<strong> a guide (to the truth), cause him to be rightly directed, and cause others to be rightly directed by him.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#808080;">Reported by Imaam Ahmad, V. 5 #17438, and by At-Tirmithee. Al-A!baanee said it is saheeh (see Saheeh Sunan At-Tirmithee, #3018)</span>.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was one of the Sahaabah who recorded the Revelation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Contrary to many false reports, Mu’aawiyah (رضي الله عنه) did not seek to take over the Khilaafah from ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah, Imaam Ath-Thahabee, At-Tabaree, and many other scholars from the Salaf asserted that Mu’aawiyah (رضي الله عنه) used to acknowledge that ‘Ali is better than him and that he [Mu’aawiyah] does not deserve the Khilaafah. His position, however, was that he wanted ‘Ali to punish the assassins of ‘Uthmaan (رضي الله عنه) before he would give his loyalty to him. He thought that he was on the truth regarding this matter. ‘Ali on the other hand, conditioned that Mu’aawiyah must give the pledge of loyalty to him because he was the Khaalefah and that he thought it is wise to wait until he consolidates his power and then seek ‘Uthmaan’s assassins. ‘Ali had nothing to do with the killing of ‘Uthmaan. Based upon many authentic narrations and prophecies from the Prophet Ahlus-Sunnah consider to be on the side of the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fitnah was ignited by a group of dissidents known as As-Saba’iyyah whose leader, ‘Abdullah Bin Saba’, was a Jew who considered ‘Ali to be Allaah incarnate! Most of the Sahaabah kept themselves away from the fitnah and only a few, not exceeding thirty, shared in the fighting between the army of ‘Ali and Mu’aawiyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Islamic rule at the time of Mu’aawiyah’s Kingdom was very strong whereby the Muslims ruled a vast area extending from Khurasaan in the East to the West African coast, and from Cyprus in the Mediterranean to the Yemen in the South. <span style="color:#808080;">[See Tahqeeq Mawaaqif AsSahaabah Fee Al-Fitnah; Establishing the (True) Position of the Sahaabah During the Fitnah (i.e. Between ‘Ali and Mu’aawiyahby Dr. Muhammad Amakhzoon, V. 2, pp. 93-130, published by Daar Tayebah and Maktabat Al-Khawthar, Riyaadh, KSA, 1415/1994.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason why that I have highlighted some of these important facts is that most of what had been written about this fitnah is either</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a) fully historical and not authenticated,<br />
b) compiled by orientalists, or<br />
c) promoting baseless accounts by the Raafidhah (the rejectionists of the Shee ‘ah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fully documented and authenticated reports from the Muhadditheen regarding the fitnah gave us the true positions of the Sahaabah regarding this matter. An excellent source is Al- ‘Awaasim Minal Qawaasim by Abu Bakr Bin ‘Al-Arabi AI-Maalikee (not the infamous mystic Sufi Ibn ‘Arabi) with commentary by Muhib-ed-Deen AI-Khateeb, 5th edition, Maktabat AsSunnah, Cairo, 1408. See also Tahtheeb Siyar ‘Alaam An-Nubalaa’, V. 1, #257. And Allaah knows best.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 62 : Point 107</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>He who limits himself to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa salam</em>) and that which his Companions and the Jamaa’ah were upon is successful and triumphs over all the people of innovation and his body is relaxed and his religion is safe, if Allah wills, since the Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said, “<span style="color:#800000;">My Ummah will split…</span>” and the Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) told us which would be the saved sect, saying, “<span style="color:#800000;">That which I and my Companions are upon</span>” </strong></span>[1]<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>. This is the cure, the explanation, the clear affair and the straight and distinct road. The Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said, “Beware of going to extremes and harshness. Beware of exaggeration and cling to the ancient religion” </strong></span>[2].</p>
<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Reported by at-Tirmidhee (no.2643) and others and it is hasan, as has preceded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] This is not a hadeeth of the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>), but is a saying of Ibn Mas’ood (<em>radiallaahu anhu</em>) as reported by ad-Daarimee in his Sunan (1/50/nos.144. 145), ‘Abdur-Razzaaq in his Musannaf (10/252) and Ibn Nasr in as-Sunnah (no.85) and others and is saheeh as such.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Abbaas (<em>radiallaahu anhu</em>) reports that the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said, <strong>“Beware of exaggeration in the religion for, indeed, those before you were destroyed due to exaggeration in the religion.”</strong> Reported by Ahmad, an-Nasaa’ee and Ibn Maajah and it is saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas’ood (<em>radiallaahu anhu</em>) reports that the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said, <strong>“ Those who go to extremes are destroyed.”</strong> Reported by Ahmad, Muslim and Abu Daawood (Eng. trans. 3/1294/no.4591) and it is saheeh</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 55: Point 98</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And acknowledge the rights of the Ansaar and the advice given by Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> concerning them and the family of the Messenger.

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/acknowledge-the-virtue-of-the-ansaar" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“<strong>And acknowledge the virtue of the Ansaar,” </strong></span>from the tribes of the Aws and the Khazraj and the companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, the most excellent of the generations. They are the most excellent of the generations because of his saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The best of you is my generation.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And because Allaah chose them to be companions of his Prophet Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and because they gave the <em>Bay`ah</em> (pledge) to the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and they fought Jihaad along with him and they carried the knowledge from him and conveyed it to mankind. So the sahaabah (companions) are the most excellent of the generations and no-one can catch them with respect to their virtue. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Do not abuse my companions for by the One in whose Hand is my soul, if one of you were to spend in charity the like of Mount U<u>h</u>ud in gold, it would not reach the handsful of one of them nor even a half of it.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning; if a person were to spend in charity with the like of the mountain of U<u>h</u>ud, it would not equal a handsful of barley, which was given by a companion. So this shows the virtue of the companions <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhum</em>. So this is tremendous virtue, which must be acknowledged for them <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَالسَّابِقُونَ الْأَوَّلُونَ مِنَ الْمُهَاجِرِينَ وَالْأَنصَارِ وَالَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوهُم بِإِحْسَانٍ رَّضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُوا عَنْهُ وَأَعَدَّ لَهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي تَحْتَهَا الْأَنْهَارُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And the first and foremost ones from the Muhaajireen and from the Ansaar and those who followed them upon good. Allaah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him and He has prepared for them gardens in Paradise beneath which rivers flow.</span> </strong>(Sooratut-Towbah (9), <em>aayah </em>100)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Majestic and Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>لَّقَدْ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ إِذْ يُبَايِعُونَكَ تَحْتَ الشَّجَرَةِ فَعَلِمَ مَا فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ فَأَنزَلَ السَّكِينَةَ عَلَيْهِمْ وَأَثَابَهُمْ فَتْحًا قَرِيبًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah was pleased with the believers when they gave you the pledge beneath the tree. So, He knew what was in their hearts and He sent down tranquility upon them and He rewarded them with a victory close at hand.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fat<u>h</u> (48), <em>aayah </em>18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>مُّحَمَّدٌ رَّسُولُ اللَّهِ ۚ وَالَّذِينَ مَعَهُ أَشِدَّاءُ عَلَى الْكُفَّارِ رُحَمَاءُ بَيْنَهُمْ ۖ تَرَاهُمْ رُكَّعًا سُجَّدًا يَبْتَغُونَ فَضْلًا مِّنَ اللَّهِ وَرِضْوَانًا ۖ سِيمَاهُمْ فِي وُجُوهِهِم مِّنْ أَثَرِ السُّجُودِ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ مَثَلُهُمْ فِي التَّوْرَاةِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah and those who are with him are stern against the disbelievers, merciful amongst themselves. You will see them bowing and prostrating seeking bounty from Allaah and His pleasure. Their sign is upon their faces from the traces of prostration. That is their description in the Towraah.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fat<u>h</u> (48), <em>aayah </em>29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, their description in the Towraat.</p>
<p><strong>وَمَثَلُهُمْ فِي الْإِنجِيلِ كَزَرْعٍ أَخْرَجَ شَطْأَهُ فَآزَرَهُ فَاسْتَغْلَظَ فَاسْتَوَىٰ عَلَىٰ سُوقِهِ يُعْجِبُ الزُّرَّاعَ لِيَغِيظَ بِهِمُ الْكُفَّارَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And their description in the Injeel is that of a plant which sends out side-shoots, which support it so that it becomes firm and strong, upright upon its stalk; it pleases those who have planted it so that the disbelievers may become enraged at them.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fat<u>h</u> (48), <em>aayah </em>29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These <em>aayahs</em> are with regard to the companions <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhum</em>, which shows their virtue and their status with Allaah and with His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and they have different levels of excellence amongst themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the four <em>Khulafaa`</em> (Caliphs); they are the most excellent ones from the companions, then the rest of the ten who are promised Paradise then, the <em>Muhaajiroon</em> because Allaah mentioned them first ahead of the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em> and because they (the <em>Muhaajireen</em>) left their homes and their wealth and their homelands for the sake of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic and they migrated in Allaah’s cause. So they have excellence over the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em>. Then the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em> <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhum</em> because they sheltered the Messenger and they gave shelter to the Muslims and supported them and they assisted them with their wealth and they lived in harmony along with them and they loved them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And those who were present at Badr also, they have virtue and specific excellence and those who were present at the pledge of <em>Ri<u>d</u>waan; Bay`atur-ri<u>d</u>waan.</em> He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>لَّقَدْ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ إِذْ يُبَايِعُونَكَ تَحْتَ الشَّجَرَةِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah was pleased with the believers when they gave you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Messenger </span><span style="color:#008000;"><em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em></span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> the pledge beneath the tree.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fat<u>h</u> (48), <em>aayah </em>18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then those who accepted Islaam before the Conquest are more excellent than those who accepted Islaam after the Conquest of Makkah. So they have different degrees of virtue amongst them. However, overall they are more excellent than others besides them from all generations until the Hour is established. No-one can match them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and the council given by Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> with regard to them,”</strong></span> meaning: the strong advice given by the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> with regard to the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em>. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“No-one will love the An<u>s</u>aar except for a believer and<br />
no-one will hate them except for a hypocrite (munaafiq).”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“<strong>And his neighbours from the people of Al-Madinah; acknowledge their virtue.” </strong></span>Meaning, the person who lives in Al-Madinah and has patience with it, hoping for reward and he has patience upon its hardships, hoping for reward and is constant upon prayer in the mosque of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, he will have reward for that. There is no doubt about it but as for the person who lives therein and he commits evil and he commits shirk along with Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, and he propagates innovations then his punishment will be multiplied for he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever commits innovations in it or who gives shelter to an innovator then upon him will be the curse of Allaah and the angels and all of mankind.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (3,650) and Muslim (2,535) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of `Imraan ibn al-<u>H</u>usayn <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s side point: Briefly with regard to the explanation of <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong></span> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah,</em> then he said with regard to the point; <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And his neighbours from the people of Al-Madinah; acknowledge their virtue.”</span> </strong>What is meant by the neighbours here are those people who are not from the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em> (<em>Aws and the Khazraj</em>) nor were they from Quraysh but they were Muslims so they have the right of Islaam and they have virtue for their having patience upon the difficulties in Al-Madinah. So it is obligatory to acknowledge the virtue of the people of virtue and Allaah is the one who grants success.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 53: Point 90B</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>This is how the religion was until the <em>Khilaafah</em> of `Umar ibn al-Kha<u>tt</u>aab; the single <em>Jamaa`ah</em>. And likewise in the time of `Uthmaan. Then when `Uthmaan </strong><strong><em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em></strong><strong> was killed, schism; splitting and differing and innovations came about. The people split into parties and sects. Amongst the people were those who remained upon the truth when the changes first started to occur; they spoke with it, acted upon it and called the people to it.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-killing-of-uthmaan-ibn-affan" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“This is how the religion was till the time of `Umar ibn al-Kha<u>tt</u>aab <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>; the single <em>Jamaa`ah</em>. And likewise in the time of `Uthmaan.” </strong></span>In the lives of the companions and the <em>taabi`een</em> (the next generation after companions), those who opposed the truth kept themselves hidden and they concealed themselves amongst the people such as the <em>Qadariyyah</em> and other than them and that was on account of the strength of Islaam and the strength of the Muslims until the Jews infiltrated. A Jewish man from Yemen who was called Ibn As Sawdaa` `Abdullaah ibn Sabaa`; the Jew. So, he came to Al-Madeenah and he manifested Islaam in the caliphate of `Uthmaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and he began speaking ill of `Uthmaan in gatherings because he was just claiming to be a Muslim as a plot against Islaam.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he started spitting out his poison in gatherings and the foolish people attended and the scoundrels, evildoers and the ignorant ones. And some people or indeed many people desire vilification, they like to hear people being abused, been spoken ill of and they like <em>qeel wa qaal</em> (rumour mongering). So therefore they gathered around him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when his reality became known and he was expelled from Al-Madeenah, he went off to Egypt and he found a village in Egypt, which was famous for dissension, splits and the like. So he immersed himself in it and he spread his poison in it and he vilified; spoke ill of `Uthmaan. Then in the end, he organised a group of them having weapons and strength. So they came to `Uthmaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and raised objections to him and declared him to be in error. So `Uthmaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> responded to them and refuted them; refuted their doubts. Then they went back.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then they rebuked themselves whilst they were on the way and they said we have achieved nothing then they went back to `Uthmaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and they encircled him whilst he was in his house and the companions wanted to defend the <em>Khaleefah</em>. However, `Uthmaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> forbade that for fear of <em>fitnah</em> (discord) and for fear of shedding blood hoping that the affair could be dealt with upon the basis of discussion and examination. He wanted to convince them. However, when they saw that they could not reach anything by using evidence then they sprang upon him during the night whilst the rest of the people were sleeping and they killed him <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When they saw that their false doubts had been refuted and that they were not going to be accepted then they ceased the opportunity at a time of inattentiveness. And most of the people were performing Hajj and the people still in Madinah were asleep in security and the matter was under discussion and being examined. So they sprang upon him by night, may Allaah disfigure them. They sprang upon in his house and they killed him as a martyr <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> whilst he was reciting the Qur&#8217;aan and he had the <em>mu<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>h</u>af</em>; the written copy of the Qur&#8217;aan so that his blood spilled onto the <em>mu<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>h</u>af</em> <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>. So then <em>fitnah</em> (discord) occurred.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this filthy one (Abdullaah ibn Sabaa), he claims that the <em>Khilaafah</em> should’ve been for `Aliyy and that it was not for Aboo Bakr nor for `Umar nor for `Uthmaan. Rather, that it should’ve been just for `Aliyy and that `Aliyy was the <em>wa<u>s</u>iyy</em> (the one personally appointed to take over) by Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and that those people had wrongfully seized the <em>Khilaafah</em> and taken it by force from `Aliyy. And the amazing thing is that `Aliyy <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> did not claim this nor did he seek the <em>Khilaafah</em> nor did he say &#8220;I have more right to it&#8221;; rather, he gave the <em>bay`ah</em> (the pledge) and he heard and obeyed his brothers, the rightly guided <em>Khulafaa</em>· <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhum</em> <em>ajma`een</em> <em>jamee`an;</em> all of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So then al-fitnah discord occurred between the Muslims and fighting occurred between the Muslims on account of this filthy one, this one who infiltrated the ranks of the Muslims. However, Allaah caused his hopes to become frustrated. It is correct that tribulations occurred between the Muslims, some of them were killed. However, this did not do anything to Islaam. Islaam and all praise is for Allaah remained strong and established and he did not damage Islaam at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he and the Jews did not damage this religion and all praise is for Allaah. Yes, some calamities occurred for the companions and discord and fighting, however, this was all in the cause of Allaah, <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhum</em> <em>wa ar<u>d</u>aahum</em> (may Allaah be pleased with them and cause them to be pleased). And this filthy one did not really achieve anything and all praise is for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a summary of the affair of the <em>fitnah</em> (discord), which came about on the killing of `Uthmaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>. And this is something which shows that it’s not permissible to rebel against the ruler and that rebelling against him brings about evil in the nation and the shedding of blood and the people have continued to suffer from <em>fitan </em>(discord) from that time till this time of ours now; and you know about the callers to discord, those who call to <em>fitnah</em> (discord) and to rebellion against the rulers and with the excuse of correcting the evil. The <em>Mu`tazilah</em> arose and the <em>Khawaarij</em>, all of them from this aspect and they still continue until this time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So when `Uthmaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> was killed then schism; splitting and differing came about and innovations.” </strong></span>It is obligatory to beware of the callers to misguidance and their affair should not be treated lightly and that it is not permissible to speak against the rulers. And therefore he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> enjoined hearing and obeying and not rebelling against those in charge of the affairs even if they are tyrannical and even if they oppress and even if they are sinful as long as they do not reach the level of clear and open <em>kufr</em> (disbelief). This is how Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> enjoined this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And the people became sects. So from the people were those who remained firm upon the truth when things first changed; and who spoke with it and acted upon it and called to it.” </strong></span>When the <em>firq</em> (sects) came about and differing, then Allaah caused the people of the truth to remain firm upon the truth and upon the Sunnah and they preceded upon that which the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his companions <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhum</em> had been upon. And the other sects contradict it, what the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his companions had been upon. So therefore they became deserving of the threat of the Fire in accordance with the degree of what occurred from them.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 42 : Point 66</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And if you hear a man speaking against the narrations and not accepting them or denying anything from the narrations of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam,</em> then doubt his Islaam since he is a person having a despicable opinion and saying. No attack may be made upon Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> nor upon his companions since we have only come to know of Allaah and His Messenger and the Qur&#8217;aan and what is good and what is bad in this world and the Hereafter by way of the narrations. So, the Qur&#8217;aan needs the Sunnah more than the Sunnah needs the Qur&#8217;aan.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F379561046&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/do-not-deny-or-speak-against-the-narrations-of-the-messenger-of-allaah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And if you hear a man speaking against the narrations and not accepting them or denying anything from the narrations of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> then doubt his Islaam,”</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> Since from the meaning of the testification that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah is to obey him with regard to whatever he commanded and to believe him regarding whatever he informed of and to avoid whatever he forbade and prohibited and that Allaah is not worshipped except with that which He legislated. This is the meaning of the testification that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا آتَاكُمُ الرَّسُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَاكُمْ عَنْهُ فَانتَهُوا ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whatever the Messenger gives you then accept it and take it and whatever he forbids you from then keep away from it.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ashr (59), <em>aayah</em> 7)</p>
<p><strong>يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَطِيعُوا اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُوا الرَّسُولَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe, obey Allaah and obey the Messenger.</span><br />
</strong><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratun-Nisaa· 4, </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> 59)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is obligatory upon the Muslim is that he complies with whatever occurs in the a<u>h</u>aadeeth from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> since they are the second revelation after the Qur&#8217;aan. Because the fundamental evidences in Islaam upon which there is agreement are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly,</strong> the Qur&#8217;aan;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly,</strong> the Prophetic Sunnah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And thirdly,</strong> consensus; <em>Al-Ijmaa`.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These evidences, it is not permissible for a person to say, “I will not accept as evidence except the Qur&#8217;aan alone and I will not accept the Sunnah as evidence,” as is said by the Khawaarij and whoever follows their way and they say that the Qur&#8217;aan is <em>mutawaatir</em> (reported by huge numbers of people at every level of transmission so huge that they cannot be gathered together upon a lie) so they say, “the Qur&#8217;aan is <em>mutawaatir</em> and is rendered secure from deficiencies but as for the Sunnah then it is what is narrated by narrators and is therefore open to deficiencies.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is to accuse the whole <em>Ummah</em> (nation) and its scholars and the companions and the <em>taabi`een</em> (those who conveyed the narrations) in lacking in reliability and of lacking in trustworthiness whereas the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed about those people in his saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“It will soon occur that a man who is full (belly) will be reclining upon his couch and will say &#8220;<em>Between us and you is the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. So, whatever we find in it to be permissible then we will take it to be permissible and whatever we find in it to be forbidden then we will take it as being forbidden</em>.” Then He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said, “Indeed, I have been given the Qur&#8217;aan and the like of it along with it.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em>`alayhissalaatu wassalaam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“May Allaah make bright the face of a person who hears my saying and he retains it and he coveys it just as he heard it or sometimes one who has something conveyed to him may better comprehend it than one who actually heard it.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em>`alayhissalaatu wassalaam</em> said when he gave the <em>khu<u>t</u>bah</em> (address) in Arafah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Let the one who witnesses amongst you convey to the one who is absent.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the one who heard conveys from the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. This is a trust; <em>amaanah</em>, which was established by the narrators of <u>h</u>adeeth and by the men of <u>h</u>adeeth, may Allaah reward them with good, Aameen. And they protected the Prophetic Sunnah from foreign things and from lies and they conveyed it pure and clear just as it came from the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> faithfully and this is from the miracles of this Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.</em> So, the Sunnah is not an arena for withholding or for making accusations. Rather, it is obligatory to believe it and it is obligatory to act upon it just as it is obligatory to act upon the Qur&#8217;aan because it is <em>wa<u>h</u>iyy</em> (revelation) from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said with regard to the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا يَنطِقُ عَنِ الْهَوَىٰ</strong> &#8211; 53:3</p>
<p><strong>إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا وَحْيٌ يُوحَىٰ</strong> &#8211; 53:4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He </strong>(the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>)<strong> does not speak from his desires, it is just revelation inspired. </strong></span>(Sooratun-Najm (53), <em>aayah </em>3-4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the <em>a<u>h</u>aadeeth</em> are revelation from Allaah even though their wordings are from the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. As for the Qur&#8217;aan then its wording and meaning is from Allaah, the Majestic and Most High and as for the Sunnah and the Prophetic <em>a<u>h</u>aadeeth</em> then their meanings is from Allaah and their wordings are from the speech of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> who does not speak from his own desires. So, his <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> wordings are preserved from error and are true and are not open to doubt. So, whoever denies the Sunnah then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) because he has discontinued the second fundamental. And the Qur&#8217;aan must have the Sunnah because it explains it and clarifies the meaning of the Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p><strong> وَأَنزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ الذِّكْرَ لِتُبَيِّنَ لِلنَّاسِ مَا نُزِّلَ إِلَيْهِمْ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We have sent down to you the reminder </strong>(the Qur&#8217;aan)<strong> for you to then explain to the people that which was sent down to them. </strong></span>(Sooratun-Nahl (16), <em>aayah </em>44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the Sunnah clarifies the Qur&#8217;aan and explains the Qur&#8217;aan because the Qur&#8217;aan comes with some things, which are <em>mujmalah</em> (unspecified) such as the prayer (<u>S</u>alaah) and the Zakaah and the Hajj and <u>S</u>iyyaam (fasting), the command for these is in the Qur&#8217;aan but how to perform them is not mentioned in the Qur&#8217;aan. So, the Qur&#8217;aan comes with some things, which are unspecified such as the prayer and the Zakaah and the Hajj and fasting, the Sunnah explains them and clarifies them. It explains the Zakaat and its amounts and fasting when it is to begin and when it is to end and the rights of Hajj; how a person should perform Hajj. So, he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Take your rights of Hajj from me.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Pray just as you have seen me praying.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High said:</p>
<p><strong>لَّقَدْ كَانَ لَكُمْ فِي رَسُولِ اللَّهِ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ  </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is indeed for you in Allaah’s Messenger a fine pattern of conduct to follow.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-A<u>h</u>zaab (33), <em>aayah </em>21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Sunnah therefore explains the Qur&#8217;aan and clarifies it and indicates it and the person who says, “I will act upon the Qur&#8217;aan but I will not act upon the Sunnah” he is a <em>ka<u>th</u>aab</em> (liar) for he has not acted upon the Qur&#8217;aan because the Qur&#8217;aan has within it:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا آتَاكُمُ الرَّسُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَاكُمْ عَنْهُ فَانتَهُوا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whatever the Messenger gives you then take it and whatever he forbids you from then desist.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ashr (59), <em>aayah</em> 7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is within it:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا يَنطِقُ عَنِ الْهَوَىٰ</strong> &#8211; 53:3</p>
<p><strong>إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا وَحْيٌ يُوحَىٰ</strong> &#8211; 53:4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And he </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the Messenger </span><span style="color:#008000;"><em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em></span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> does not speak from his desires, it is just revelation inspired.</span> </strong>(Sooratun-Najm (53), <em>aayah </em>3-4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur&#8217;aan, it is stated that the Sunnah clarifies it.</p>
<p><strong> وَأَنزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ الذِّكْرَ لِتُبَيِّنَ لِلنَّاسِ مَا نُزِّلَ إِلَيْهِمْ  </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We sent down to you </strong>(Prophet Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>)<strong> the reminder </strong>(Qur&#8217;aan)<strong> so that you should clarify to the people what has been sent down to them. </strong></span>(Sooratun-Na<u>h</u>l (16), <em>aayah </em>44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when he leaves off acting upon the Sunnah then he has not acted upon the Qur&#8217;aan, which he claims that he acts upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the people are some who make a distinction between the a<u>h</u>aadeeth and who say &#8211; &#8220;<span style="color:#993366;">the <u>h</u>adeeth which is <em>mutawaatir</em> (<u>h</u>adeeth which has so many narrators at every level of transmission that it is impossible they could have got together and invented it) brings about knowledge (<em>ilm</em>) but the <u>h</u>adeeth which are <em>aa<u>h</u>aad</em> (which doesn’t reach that level), it only amounts to <u>dh</u>ann (surmise/uncerainity)&#8221;</span>. And this is <em>baa<u>t</u>il</em> (false and futile) because everything which is authentic from the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and which is established, it brings about `<em>ilm</em> (knowledge) whether it’s <em>mutawaatir</em> or <em>aahaad</em>. So, there is no distinction to be made between the level of proof of the <u>h</u>adeeth which is authentic. It is obligatory to comply with all of it and to act upon it without any distinction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Soofees also do not act upon the Sunnah, indeed not even upon the Qur&#8217;aan. They only act upon their own tastes and their own feelings and they say, <span style="color:#993366;">“We take from Allaah directly and we do not take by way of the Messenger because we have reached Allaah so therefore, we have no need of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And the Messenger is just for the common folk, those who have not yet reached Allaah.”</span> And this is from the most baseless falsehood and the most open disbelief and Allaah’s refuge is sought. Aameen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Or he denies anything,” </strong>whoever denies the Sunnah in general and says, “<span style="color:#993366;">The Sunnah is not to be acted upon, only the Qur&#8217;aan is to be acted upon&#8221;</span> or who denies a part of the Sunnah, which are the authentic a<u>h</u>aadeeth and says, “<span style="color:#993366;">They are not to be acted upon</span>” and some of them say, “<span style="color:#993366;">Hadeeth is not acted upon except with the condition that it conforms to the Qur&#8217;aan</span>” and this is <em>baatil</em> (false and futile) and is an accusation against the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> that he may bring something which contradicts the Qur&#8217;aan. So, this saying is not permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> sometimes came with things, which were not in the Qur&#8217;aan such as the prohibition of being married to a woman along with her paternal aunt and her maternal aunt. The Qur&#8217;aan contains the prohibition of being married to two sisters, whereas, the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“A man may not combine a woman and her paternal aunt nor between a woman and her maternal aunt.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is obligatory to act upon whatever the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And if you see a person doing any of this; rejecting the authentic narrations from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> or denying anything from them then accuse his Islaam for he is a man who is despicable in his position and his saying.” </strong>The person who says this, either he will be from the Khawaarij or he will be from the Jahmiyyah and the Mu’tazilah or he will be from the Soofees; those who claim that they have no need of the a<u>h</u>aadeeth because they have reached Allaah and they take from Allaah directly and they say, “<em>You people take your religion from someone who is dead but we take from the Everliving One Who never dies</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And no accusation may be made against Allaah’s Messenger<em><u> s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> nor against his companions,” </strong>No accusation may be made against Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> because he is rendered secure from error by Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. So, the person who accuses the Messenger or attacks him and says that he follows his desires or that he behaves unjustly or that he oppresses and the like of that then this one is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise the person who makes an attack upon the companions of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> because Allaah is pleased with them and has praised them and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was pleased with them and praised them and repeated words of praise upon them and they were the best of generations. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The best of you are my generation…”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em>alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Do not abuse my companions for by the one in Whose hand is my soul, if one of you were to spend the like of U<u>h</u>ud in gold, it would not reach even a handsful amount of one of them nor even a half of it.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَالسَّابِقُونَ الْأَوَّلُونَ مِنَ الْمُهَاجِرِينَ وَالْأَنصَارِ وَالَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوهُم بِإِحْسَانٍ رَّضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُوا عَنْهُ وَأَعَدَّ لَهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي تَحْتَهَا الْأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا أَبَدًا ۚ ذَٰلِكَ الْفَوْزُ الْعَظِيمُ</strong> &#8211; 9:100</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And the First and Foremost ones from the Muhaajireen and the An<u>s</u>aar and those who followed them upon good, Allaah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him and He has prepared for them gardens of Paradise beneath which rivers flow, they will remain forever therein, that is the tremendous success.</span> </strong>(Sooratut–Towbah (9), <em>aayah </em>100)</p>
<p><strong>لَّقَدْ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ إِذْ يُبَايِعُونَكَ تَحْتَ الشَّجَرَةِ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah was pleased with the believers when they gave you the pledge beneath the tree.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fat<u>h</u> (48), <em>aayah </em>18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tree is the tree where the pledge; <em>bay</em>`<em>ah</em> was given at <u>H</u>udaybiyyah; the pledge that the companions gave to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in the 6<sup>th</sup> year after the Hijrah, pledge of <u>H</u>udaybiyyah, <em>Bay’atu</em> <em>Ri<u>d</u>waan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> فَعَلِمَ مَا فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ فَأَنزَلَ السَّكِينَةَ عَلَيْهِمْ وَأَثَابَهُمْ فَتْحًا قَرِيبًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So, He knew what was in their hearts and He sent down tranquillity upon them and He rewarded them with a victory close at hand.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fat<u>h</u> (48), <em>aayah </em>18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said at the end of the Soorah:</p>
<p><strong>مُّحَمَّدٌ رَّسُولُ اللَّهِ ۚ وَالَّذِينَ مَعَهُ أَشِدَّاءُ عَلَى الْكُفَّارِ رُحَمَاءُ بَيْنَهُمْ ۖ تَرَاهُمْ رُكَّعًا سُجَّدًا يَبْتَغُونَ فَضْلًا مِّنَ اللَّهِ وَرِضْوَانًا ۖ سِيمَاهُمْ فِي وُجُوهِهِم مِّنْ أَثَرِ السُّجُودِ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ مَثَلُهُمْ فِي التَّوْرَاةِ ۚ وَمَثَلُهُمْ فِي الْإِنجِيلِ كَزَرْعٍ أَخْرَجَ شَطْأَهُ فَآزَرَهُ فَاسْتَغْلَظَ فَاسْتَوَىٰ عَلَىٰ سُوقِهِ يُعْجِبُ الزُّرَّاعَ لِيَغِيظَ بِهِمُ الْكُفَّارَ ۗ وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ مِنْهُم مَّغْفِرَةً وَأَجْرًا عَظِيمًا</strong> &#8211; 48:29</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah and those who are with him…</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Fat<u>h </u>(48), <em>aayah 29</em>)<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning the companions (<em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>aabah</em>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>…those who are with the Messenger (the companions) are stern against the disbelievers, merciful amongst themselves, you will see them bowing and prostrating seeking the bounty of Allaah and His pleasure. Their sign will be upon their faces from the trace of prostration, that is their description in the Towraat… </strong></span>(Sooratul-Fath (48), <em>aayah </em>29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, their description, which is mentioned in the Towraat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">…and their description in the Injeel.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fath (48), <em>aayah </em>29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning their description in the Injeel, which was sent down to ‘Eesaa is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They are like a plant, which sends out a side shoot, which strengthens it and it becomes firm and stands straight upon its stalk, the sowers are pleased at it so that the disbelievers should become enraged at them.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fath (48), <em>aayah </em>29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this <em>aayah</em> is an example about the description of the companions. So, this shows that the person that becomes enraged at the companions or who hates them, he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) as is shown by the end of the <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">…so that the disbelievers should become enraged at them.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Fath (48), <em>aayah </em>29)<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Because we have only come to know of Allaah and we have come to know of His Messenger and we have come to know of the Qur&#8217;aan and we know of good and evil in this world and the Hereafter by way of the <em>aathaar</em> (narrations).” </strong>By way of the narrations, which they narrated and they are the a<u>h</u>aadeeth, which they reported from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So, whoever makes an attack upon the narrations is making an attack upon the Islamic legislation because it was narrated in that case by narrators who were liars and who are not trustworthy and this is the intent of the Jews and the Magians to plot against the Muslims. So, a group of them abuse the companions and their intent is to abolish the <em>sharee</em>`<em>ah</em> (Islamic legislation) for if they can abolish its carriers and its narrators and they can attack the best ones of this nation then their attacking other than the companions is even more likely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“For indeed the Qur&#8217;aan has more need of the Sunnah than the Sunnah has for the Qur&#8217;aan.” </strong>The Qur&#8217;aan has more need of the Sunnah as we have mentioned because the Sunnah explains and gives explanation of the Qur&#8217;aan. So, there are some things left unexplained in the Qur&#8217;aan, which have been explained in the Sunnah. So, Allaah has commanded the prayer but He has not made clear the number of its rak`ahs and He has not made clear the description of the prayer and this was made clear by the Messenger<em><u> s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Pray as you have seen me praying.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <u>H</u>ajj comes in the Qur&#8217;aan <em>mujmalan</em> (unexplained) and its explanation was left to the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So, he performed <u>H</u>ajj with the Muslims in the Farewell <u>H</u>ajj and he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Take your rights of <u>H</u>ajj from me.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, learn from my actions and my sayings what will enable you to carry out your rights of pilgrimage and Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<p><strong>لَّقَدْ كَانَ لَكُمْ فِي رَسُولِ اللَّهِ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ لِّمَن كَانَ يَرْجُو اللَّهَ وَالْيَوْمَ الْآخِرَ وَذَكَرَ اللَّهَ كَثِيرًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is for you in Allaah’s Messenger a fine example for whomever has hope in Allaah and in the Last Day and who makes mention of Allaah a great deal.</span> </strong></span>(Sooratul-A<u>h</u>zaab (33), <em>aayah </em>21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the Qur&#8217;aan has need of the Sunnah for it to clarify it. So, the person who accepts Qur&#8217;aan only then he will cut off the Qur&#8217;aan from that which explains and clarifies it and this is the goal of the people of misguidance and those who have deviation in their hearts. Because the people of deviation accept one part of the evidences and they leave the other part which explains it and clarifies it off and they take one part of the evidences, which are unclear and they leave the clear and decisive part, which clarifies it and explains it. This is the way of the people of deviation and the way of those who pretend to have knowledge and the ignorant ones; those who claim knowledge and those who do not know the correct way of deriving evidence nor the principles of establishing proof. So, they make forbidden and declare things lawful without any insight and Allaah’s refuge is sought, <em>aameen,</em> because they have not followed <em>al-manhaj al-`ilm</em> (the correct knowledge based methodology). Rather, they have just learned by themselves or from their own books or with those who are ignorant like themselves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 23 : Point 25 (Part C)</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">(Imaam al-Barbahaaree continued)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Then the best of the people after them are those who accompanied Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> for a day, a month or a year or for less than that or more than that. We supplicate for mercy upon them and we mention their virtues and we withhold from speaking about any slips they made. We do not mention a single one of them except favourably because of the saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“When my Companions are mentioned then withhold.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Sufyaan ibn `Uyaynah said, “Whoever speaks against the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> with a single word then he is a person following desires.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F367212290&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/refraining-from-abusing-the-companions" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-suhbah (Companionship) varies; so from it there was long Companionship and being constantly with the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> for a long time. Or whoever accompanied him for a short time; however such a person still has the virtue of Companionship even if his Companionship was short in length.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“We supplicate for mercy for them and we mention their virtues and we withhold from speaking about any slips they made.”</strong> Their haqq (right) upon us is that we supplicate for Allaah’s Pleasure upon them, and that we supplicate for Allaah’s Mercy upon them, and that we take them as examples to follow, and that we praise them. And we withhold our tongues from attacking them or a single one of them, or from delving into whatever occurred between them with regard to tribulations and wars; because each one of them was a mujtahid (striving to the best of his ability to attain the Truth). So some of them were a mujtahid (one who strove) and attained what was correct, then he will receive two rewards. And others from them were a mujtahid (one who strove to attain the Truth) but made a mistake, and for him there will be a single reward and the mistake is forgiven. Then also they have tremendous deeds which wipe away whatever occurred from some of them with regard to mistakes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“We do not mention anyone of them except favourably&#8230;”</strong> because they intended the Truth and they strove to attain it; each one of them acted upon his own ijtihaad (striving). So some of them attained what was correct and some of them made a mistake, for which he will be forgiven, and all of them were Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and we do not enter into what occurred between them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Carefully reflect upon this aayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And those who come after them</strong></span>. (Sooratul-Hashr (59), aayah 10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning after the Muhaajiroon and the Ansaar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They say, “O our Lord! Forgive us and our brothers who preceded us upon eemaan and do not place in our hearts any ill-feeling towards those who believed.”</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Hashr (59) aayah 10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah rahimahullaah said in that regard, “From the usool (fundamental principles) of the Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah is the sincerity, secureness, the soundness of their hearts and their tongues towards the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.” [01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘The soundness of their hearts’;</strong> so they do not hate a single one of them. And ‘the sincerity and soundness of their tongues’ means that they do not speak against a single one of them and they do not belittle him. And the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said in the authentic hadeeth, “Do not abuse my Companions for, by the One in whose Hand is my soul, if one of you were to spend the like of Mount Uhud in gold in charity, it would not reach the hands full of one of them, nor even a half of it.” [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Do not abuse my Companions,”</strong> but then there comes one who is defective in intellect, whose eemaan is shaky, who is following his desires and he speaks against the Companions of the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So this person if he is from the deviant sects then we would not speak at length about him. However, the problem is when he ascribes himself to the Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah and yet says, “This is from historical verification.” And do you have the duty put upon you of historical verification such that you have to enter into something which you do not know about and which results in dangerous consequences, and such that you cause the people to have doubts about the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and you provoke the hearts of the people against the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>? So what is obligatory is to withhold about whatever disputes occurred between them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying <strong>“because of the saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, “When my Companions are mentioned then withhold.”</strong> [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And even more explicit than it is his sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam’s saying, “Do not abuse my Companions.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a prohibition of abusing any one of the Companions. So what is obligatory is that we supplicate for mercy for them and that we supplicate for forgiveness for them, acting upon His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And those who come after them, they say, “O our Lord! Forgive us and our brothers who preceded us upon eemaan.”</span></strong> (Sooratul-Hashr (59) aayah10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that we withhold our tongues and our pens from speaking against the Companions of the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>; and that we defend them and we refute whoever belittles a single one of the Companions, and we nullify his saying because it is contrary to the correct `aqeedah (creed and belief), the `aqeedah of Ahlus-Sunnah walJamaa`ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <strong>Shaykhul-Islaam says in al-Waasitiyyah</strong>, “What is related from them is either not authentic, so that is just lies and reports added with an evil intent; and what is authentic from it, then that person is a <em>mujtahid</em>; one striving to attain the truth. And a <em>mujtahid</em>, if he attains what is correct, then he receives two rewards, and if he makes a mistake then he will still get the one reward. And also they have such virtues that will drown out and cover over whatever occurred from some of them with regard to mistakes. [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said regarding Haatib ibn Abee Balta`ah <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> when he applied his own ijtihaad and he wrote a letter to the people of Makkah, and `Umar <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> said, “Let me strike off the neck of this hypocrite!” So he <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> responded, “You do not know O `Umar, perhaps Allaah looked upon the people of Badr and said ‘Do whatever you wish for I have forgiven you.’” [05] This Companion was one of those who was present at Badr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Sufyaan ibn `Uyaynah said, ‘Whoever speaks against the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> with a single word then he is a person following desires.’’</strong>’ Because no-one speaks against them except a person of desires and one who is trying to render the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> open to attack.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is obligatory towards the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is to have love and respect and honour for them, and to recognise their value, and to take them as a role model to follow because they are the best of generations, and because they saw the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and they believed in him, and they accompanied him and they aided him and they fought jihaad along with him, and they carried the knowledge from him. So they are the most excellent ones of this nation. Indeed, they are the most excellent ones of the whole of the creation after the Prophets because Allaah specifically chose them for Companionship of His Prophet Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, the last of the Prophets and the most excellent one of the Messengers. So no-one attacks them except one who has in his heart ghill (ill-feeling) and hiqd (hidden hatred) towards Islaam. So he does not attack them because of their persons; rather, he will only attack them because of what they did with regard to aiding this Religion and conveying it faithfully to mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the one who attacks them is only attacking on that account, because he has hidden hatred towards Islaam and feelings of vengeance towards Islaam, so he seeks to use this means to vent his anger, in order to sever the link of this nation with its Prophet Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>; because they (Companions) are the intermediary between us and between the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So, this is the intent of those who attack them And therefore when He mentioned the Muhaajireen and the Ansaar in Sooratul-Hashr, He said;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And those who come after them, they say, “O our Lord! Forgive us and our brothers who preceded us upon eemaan and do not place any ill-feeling in our hearts towards those who believed.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Hashr (59) aayah 10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this shows that those who attack them, or a single one of them, then it is just on account of ghill (ill-feeling), which he finds in his heart against them. And therefore Sufyaan ibn `Uyaynah, the great imaam, said, “Whoever speaks against the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> with a single word, then he is a person following desires.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Hawaa</em> (Desires) is what leads him to do this, and the desire is their hatred and their malice towards them. So therefore you’ll find the worst of the people are those who make attacks upon the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, and they have been exposed by their lies and by being made hated amongst the people. So no-one will see one of them except that he will have strong dislike for him because Allaah has placed hatred for them upon the earth. So no-one will see one of those who has hatred towards the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> except that he will find himself having hatred towards them and loathing of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This will not harm the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and it will not harm Islaam. So the Companions, their worth and their reward is fully intact for them; and Islaam will persist and will be victorious, and all praise is for Allaah, and those people they only harm themselves. However, fear is for those people who read their books from those who do not have knowledge, so that something falls into his self against the Companions of Allah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and he is affected by that. So how many of the sons of the Muslims have fallen prey to this on account of reading the books of those people? Because if he reads them, then he will be affected by them and he will find himself having some hatred towards the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, or at the very least their value with him will be diminished and they will decrease in his estimation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is what is to be feared for the youth of the Muslims and for those who are not firmly established with knowledge, that they will be influenced by these books which attack the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, especially since they are propagated now and they are embellished and they are brought out in the finest form with regard to printing and binding and they are promoted at book fairs. So they find that as an opportunity for them to spread and circulate attacks upon the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is no doubt that an attack upon the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) is an attack upon the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>; for how could his Companions have been from those people when they describe them with the evil characteristics that they give to them? So this is indeed is an attack upon the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also it is a denial of the Book of Allaah, for Allaah praised the Companions in the tremendous Qur·aan in a number of aayahs, from them His Saying, He, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And the first and foremost ones from the Muhaajiroon and the Ansaar and those who followed them upon good, Allaah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him; and He has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow; they will dwell therein forever. That is a tremendous success.</span> </strong>(Sooratut-Towbah (9) aayah 100)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>Allaah was pleased with those believers when they gave the pledge beneath the tree. So He knew what was in their hearts and therefore He sent down tranquility upon them and He rewarded them with a victory close at hand and with plentiful booty for them to take.</b></span></span> (Sooratul-Fat.h (48) aayahs 18-19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah. And those who are with him are stern against the disbelievers, merciful amongst themselves. You will see them bowing and prostrating, seeking Bounty from Allaah and His Pleasure. Their sign is upon their faces from the effect of prostration. That was their example in the Towraat.</strong></span> (Sooratul-Fat.h (48) aayah 29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: That was their description in the Towraat. So they are mentioned in the Towraat, just as their Prophet Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And their description in the Injeel</span></strong><br />
(Sooratul-Fat.h (48) aayah 29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that which came down to `Eesaa,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Their description in the Injeel) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">is that of a plant which puts forth a side shoot so that it strengthens it and it grows strong and stands straight upon its stalk. It delights the sowers; so that Allaah, through them, enrages the disbelievers.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fat.h (48) aayah 29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this shows that no one feels rage towards the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger and no-one hates them except for a disbeliever, because of His Saying, He, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So that Allaah causes the disbelievers to be enraged at them.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fat.h (48) aayah 29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a sign of <em>kufr</em> (disbelief). So having hatred towards the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is disbelief and <em>nifaaq</em> (hypocrisy), and Allaah’s refuge is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“(Whoever speaks against the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) with a single word then he is a follower of desires.”</strong> Meaning if he speaks in belittlement of the Companions with a single word then he is a person of desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if this is the case on account of a single word then how about a person who writes whole books in abuse of them and in maligning/speaking ill of them, and seeks out places where they could have erred and seeks to inflate their seriousness? How about this; if that is the case when a person who speaks a single word against the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>), that he is a person who is a follower of desires, meaning he follows his desires? Because he does not speak except for some desire which he has in his soul and because of his having hatred towards the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 22 : Point 25 (Part B)</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Imaam al-Barbahaaree continued)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Then the most excellent of the people after them were: `Aliyy and Talhah and AzZubayr and Sa`d ibn Abee Waqqaas and Sa`eed ibn Zayd and `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn `Owf and Aboo `Ubaydah `Aamir ibnul-Jarraah. And all of them were suitable to be the khaleefah.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Then the most excellent of the people after them were the rest of the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, the first generation amongst whom he was sent, the first Muhaajiroon and the Ansaar; and they are those who prayed towards the two qiblahs (directions of Prayer).</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F367188116&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-best-of-the-companions-after-the-khulafaa" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning the most excellent of the Companions after the three <em>khulafaa</em> are the rest of those ten who were given the glad tidings of Paradise, and they are those whom the author mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“All of them were suitable to be the khaleefah”</strong> – meaning the people of the shoorah (council) whom `Umar radiyAllaahu `anhu entrusted with choosing the next khaleefah after him. Because `Umar, when he was dying, appointed a council to choose the caliph so that the matter would rest with those who remained. Because each one of them was fitting to be a khaleefah, so he referred the affair to them, and they chose `Uthmaan <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“The first generation,”</strong> from the most excellent generations, and they were the generation in which the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was sent and they believed in him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the word <em>al-as.haab</em> (Companions) is the plural of <em>sahaabiyyun</em>; and a <em>sahaabiyy</em> (a Companion) is whoever met the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam as a believer in him and he died upon that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• So a person who believed in the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> but he did not meet him, then he is not a Companion such as an-Najjaashiyy [07] (the King of Abyssinia). He is counted as being from the <em>taabi`een</em>, the Successors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• As for one who met him but did not believe in him then he is not a Companion because the mushrikeen (people of shirk) and the disbelievers met the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> but they did not believe in him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• And a person who met him and believed in him but then left Islaam then his Companionship is annulled/rendered null and void if he dies upon apostasy. As for if he repented, then Allaah accepted his repentance and his Companionship is restored.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore al-Haafiz ibn Hajar rahimahullaah, in his book an-Nukhbah [08], said, in definition of a Companion, “<strong>(He is) whoever met the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> whilst believing in him and he died upon that, even if apostasy occurred in between (his meeting the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and his dying), in the correct saying</strong>.” [09] Meaning in the most correct of the two sayings of the scholars. The second saying is that it abolishes his Companionship even if he repents because apostasy renders deeds which are before it null and void.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying <strong>“The first generation, those amongst whom he was sent amongst the first Muhaajiroon and the Ansaar and they are those who prayed towards the two qiblahs.”</strong> The Muhaajiroon (those who emigrated from Makkah) have precedence in mention over the Ansaar, so this shows that the Muhaajiroon have greater excellence through the excellence of performing hijrah (migration) in the cause of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, because they left their homelands and their wealth. And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, mentions the Muhaajiroon before the Ansaar in many aayahs just as He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the first and foremost ones from the Muhaajiroon and the Ansaar.</strong> </span>(Sooratut-Towbah (9), aayah100)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">For the poor and needy ones from the Muhaajireen, those who were forced out from their homes and their wealth; they left seeking the bounty from Allaah and His pleasure and they aid the Religion of Allaah and His Messenger. They are the true ones.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Hashr (59), aayah 8)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Up until His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And also those who resided before them in al-Madeenah and believed.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Hashr (59), aayah 9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning the Ansaar. So He gives precedence to a mention of the Muhaajireen over the Ansaar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah certainly guided the Prophet and the Muhaajiroon and the Ansaar to turn to Him.</span></strong> (Sooratut-Towbah (9), aayah117)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This shows that the Muhaajiroon have greater excellence than the Ansaar. And <em>Ansaar</em> is the plural of <em>Ansaariyy</em>, and they are believers from (the tribes of) Ows and Khazraj, the people of Madeenah, those who gave the pledge to the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam at al-`Aqabah. He (sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) migrated to them and they aided him and supported him and sheltered him and sheltered the Companions <em>radiyAllaahu `anhum</em> along with him. He, the Most High, said with regard to them, the Ansaar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And those who resided in al-Madeenah before them and believed, they love those who emigrate to them and they do not find in their chests any resentment on account of what they had been given and they give precedence to them over themselves even though they themselves were in need. And whoever is saved from the avarice of his self then they are the successful ones.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Hashr (59), aayah 9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To begin with they were called al-Ows wal-Khazraj (the tribes of Ows and Khazraj). Then when they gave the pledge to the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam to aid him (nusrah), he called them al-Ansaar (the aiders or the helpers), meaning the aiders of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.</p>

This is what is reported to us from Ibn `Umar that he said, “We used to say whilst Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was amongst us that the best of the people after Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam is Aboo Bakr and `Umar and `Uthmaan and the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> would hear that and he would not criticise it.” </strong></span>[02]</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-best-of-this-ummah-all-umam-after-prophets-is-aboo-bakr-then-umar-then-uthmaan" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most excellent generation is the generation in which Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was raised, then those who followed them, then those who followed them. And they are <strong><em>al-quroon al-mufaddalah</em></strong> (the most excellent generations).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the most excellent ones from the most excellent generations were: the sahaabah (Companions) <em>radiyAllaahu `anhum</em>. Then the Companions themselves, they vary in degree of excellence. And the most excellent of them was <strong>Aboo Bakr as-Siddeeq</strong>, the one who believed in him when he first came (as a Messenger). He supported him and defended him and he spent from his money to help him, and he would accompany him until his death. Then he became the khaleefah (caliph) after him and he fulfilled this role in the best way, and Allaah established the Religion through him after the feet of the people had been shaken by the death of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. So Allaah made him as firm as the mountains so that the nation became firm on account of him, and He rebutted the apostates through him and the disbelievers, and he consolidated Islaam after the passing away of the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. Then he passed away and he was buried along with the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So he was his Companion in life and in death and he was his companion in the cave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>When the two of them were in the cave, when he said to his companion, do not grieve, Allaah is with us.</strong></span> (Sooratut-Towbah (9), aayah 40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he is the most excellent one of the nation. Then he is followed by <strong>`Umar ibn alKhattaab</strong> <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>, the second of the khulafaa·; then he is followed by <strong>`Uthmaan</strong> <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>; then he is followed by <strong>`Aliyy</strong> <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>. They are the four Rightly Guided Khulafaa·, may Allaah be pleased with them and cause them to be pleased.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the rest of the <strong>ten</strong> most excellent ones about whom it was testified that they will be in Paradise. And they are the four Rightly Guided Khulafaa· and Sa`d ibn Abee Waqqaas, Sa`eed ibn Zayd ibn `Amr ibn Nufayl and Talhah ibn `Ubaydillaah and AzZubayr ibn `Awwaam and Aboo `Ubaydah `Aamir ibnul-Jarraah and `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn `Owf. So they are the ten who are promised Paradise. The Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam bore witness for them of Paradise, so they are the most excellent ones from the Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“Aboo Bakr will be in Paradise and `Umar will be in Paradise and `Aliyy will be in Paradise and `Uthmaan will be in Paradise and Talhah will be in Paradise and AzZubayr will be in Paradise and `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn `Owf will be in Paradise and Sa`d ibn Abee Waqqaas will be in Paradise and Sa`eed ibn Zayd ibn `Amr ibn Nufayl will be in Paradise and Aboo `Ubaydah ibnul-Jarraah will be in Paradise.’’</strong> </span>[03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then after them: those who were the people of the <strong>Battle of Badr</strong>, then those who were present at the <strong>Bay`atur-Ridwaan</strong> (the ‘pledge of those who earned Allaah’s pleasure’) from the Muhaajireen and the Ansaar [04], then those who accepted Islaam and <strong>performed the hijrah before the Conques</strong>t, they are more excellent than those who accepted Islaam and migrated after the Conquest. So they vary in degree of excellence <em>radiyAllaahu `anhum</em> in accordance with their precedence in accepting Islaam and with their position in Islaam. And they (all of the Companions) have the general virtue which cannot be reached by anyone else, and it is as-suhbah (Companionship) to Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and al-hijrah (to perform the emigration). And the Muhaajiroon (those who were in Makkah and then they emigrated to al-Madeenah) they are more excellent than the Ansaar (the Muslims of al-Madeenah). This is a virtue which is general to all of them (Companionship); no-one who came after them can reach it. So they are the most excellent of the generations and the best of the generations, may Allaah be pleased with them and may He cause them to be pleased.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever attacks them or hates them then he is a disbeliever in Allaah, because Allaah has extolled them, Allaah has praised them and chose them for Companionship of His Prophet Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So the person who makes an attack upon the Companions or declares them to be disbelievers or belittles them is a disbeliever in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, denying the truth of Allaah and His Messenger; because Allaah, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And the first and foremost [in believing in Allaah and His Messenger] from the Muhaajiroon </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(emigrants)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> and Ansaar </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(helpers)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> and those who followed them exactly</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> [in faith and in emigrating, seeking His Pleasure]</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, Allaah is pleased with all of them, and they are pleased with Him.</span> </strong>(Sooratut-Towbah (9), aayah 100)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed, Allaah was pleased with the believers when they gave their bay’ah </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(pledge)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> to you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(O Muhammad) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">under the tree.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Fat.h (48), aayah 18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“This is what is reported to us from Ibn `Umar that he said, ‘We used to say whilst Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam was amongst us that the best of the people after Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam is Aboo Bakr and `Umar and then `Uthmaan.’” </strong>[05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Aboo Bakr and `Umar then this is ijmaa` (consensus) about that. As for the level of excellence between `Uthmaan and `Aliyy then that is a point of disagreement. Some of them preferred `Uthmaan and some of them preferred `Aliyy<em> radiyAllaahu ta`aalaa `anhumaa wa ardaahumaa</em> (may Allaah be pleased with both of them and cause them to be pleased). But as for Aboo Bakr and `Umar then these two are the most excellent of this nation by consensus, ijmaa` of the Muslims; this is with regard to virtue. As for with regard to the khilaafah (Caliphate) then there has to be this (correct) order: Aboo Bakr and then `Umar and then `Uthmaan and then `Aliyy. So whoever accuses the khilaafah (Caliphate) of one of them then he is astray (<em>daal</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykhul-Islaam (Ibn Taymiyyah)</strong> said in al-Waasitiyyah: “Whoever attacks the khilaafah of one of those then he is more astray than a domesticated donkey,” because he has gone against the ijmaa’ (consensus) of the Muslims. Because the Muslims agreed in consensus upon giving precedence to Aboo Bakr for the khilaafah, then upon giving precedence to `Umar after him, then to `Uthmaan and then to `Aliyy. So a person who gives precedence to `Aliyy and says he had more right to the khilaafah even than Aboo Bakr, and who says that khilaafah after the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam should have gone to `Aliyy because he was the appointed successor of the Messenger and he was the real khaleefah but Aboo Bakr and the Companions, they wronged him and seized the khilaafah from him, this is to declare the whole nation astray – and Allaah’s refuge is sought &#8211; and it is contrary to the texts which occur with regard to the order of those khulafaa·.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the order with regard to the khilaafah is a point of <em>ijmaa</em>` (consensus), but as for the order with regard to superiority between `Aliyy and `Uthmaan, that is a point of disagreement. And what is correct is that `Uthmaan was more excellent because the Companions, and amongst them was `Aliyy <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>, they chose him as a khaleefah; they chose `Uthmaan as a khaleefah to succeed Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. And `Aliyy was present and the Companions chose `Uthmaan. The fact that the Companions chose `Uthmaan is a proof that he was more excellent. `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn `Owf said “I saw that the people do not take anyone else as being the equal of ‘Uthmaan (after passing away of Umar <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu)</em> .” [06] So this shows he was more excellent.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 12 : Point 08</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And know, may Allaah have mercy upon you, that a person’s Islaam will not be complete until he is one who follows, one who attests and one who submits </span></strong><span style="color:#993300;">(to the Book and the Sunnah)</span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">. So whoever claims that there remains anything from Islaam not sufficiently explained by the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> then he has lied against them. And this is sufficient for a person as a separation from them, and as an attack upon them. So he is an innovator, astray, leading others astray, introducing into Islaam that which is not from it.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F363464639&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/whoever-claims-that-companions-didnt-sufficiently-explain-islam-then-he-has-lied-against-them" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a completion of the previous speech. So his saying, <strong>“A person’s Islaam will not be complete until he is one who is a follower </strong>(of the Book and the Sunnah)<strong>, one who attests to it, one who submits to it.”</strong> He is one who follows, not one who innovates. He should be one who believes and attests to the Truth, not one who has doubts and is uncertain. <strong>“One who submits”</strong> meaning one who submits to the Book and the Sunnah, because these matters require submission. They are not matters were argumentation is acceptable. So we submit to Allaah and to his Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and we do not argue about this matter, or we do not give our own opinion, as they say, along with the Speech of Allaah and the speech of His Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“So whoever claims that anything remains from the affair of Islaam which the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam have not sufficed us with regard to</strong> (not sufficiently explained to us) <strong>then he has lied against them.”</strong> Meaning whoever claims that the Companions fell short in clearly explaining and in clarifying and in conveying it to the people from the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and claims that he has scope to speak or to add something, then he intends evil for the people. Because the Companions<em> radiyAllaahu`anhum</em> did not leave anything from that which they heard from the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> or anything which they saw from him except that they conveyed it to the nation faithfully; and they made it clear to the nation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore for this reason the <em>tafseer</em> (explanation of the Qur&#8217;aan) of the Companions is given precedence over the <em>tafseer</em> of anyone after them. Because they were the students of the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and they heard the Qur&#8217;aan from him <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and they heard the <em>ahaadeeth</em> (his sayings) from him and they heard the explanation of the Qur&#8217;aan from him, and they saw his <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> actions and they conveyed that faithfully. So they did not leave out anything at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever claims that they fell short and left something out that they did not convey then he is a liar and an inventor of falsehood. He is astray/misguided, leading others astray, trying to cause the people to have doubts of the Religion of Allaah and about its carriers from the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger, <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And he is acting treacherously towards the Companions, as is the way with the people of innovation. They betray the Companions and make false accusations against them in order to remove the intermediary link between us and between Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So it is obligatory to beware of those people and that we should know the true worth of the Companions and their status <em>radiyAllaahu `anhum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Where did this Qur&#8217;aan come to us from? And these <em>ahaadeeth</em> (sayings of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) and this <em>fiqh</em> (knowledge of the Religion). It did not come except through them taking it and carrying it from the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. They are the ones who carried it to us and they narrated it to us completely, each one in accordance with the amount which Allaah gifted him with and each one in accordance with his own ability. They did not leave anything from the Religion of Allaah except that they conveyed it just as they took it from Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And they are fully trustworthy because Allaah chose them to be Companions of His Prophet and to take from him and to narrate from him. Allaah chose them for that, and then people come along and accuse them of falling short or accuse them of having deficiency. No one says this except one who is astray, trying to lead other people astray. He wants to cut off the link of this nation with the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and therefore to cut off their link with Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu <em>`alayhi wa sallam</em>. We were not present at the gatherings of the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and we didn’t hear him; and between us and him there are many centuries. So the honourable Companions <em>radiyAllaahu`anhum</em>, they are the ones who conveyed to us from the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So the status of the Companions in the Religion is a tremendous status and they cannot be accused of having concealed anything or having hidden anything, and of not bringing it out openly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Then he is an innovator. He is astray, leading others astray, introducing into Islaam that which is not from it.”</strong> This is his intent, to introduce into Islaam that which is not from it, and he will not be able to do this unless he makes attacks upon the Companions and he betrays them and lies against them. Then he will be able to bring things from himself and say, “This is the religion which it is obligatory for us to proceed upon.” This is their goal in lying against the Companions and in betraying them and in belittling them. So that they can take the opportunity to establish for the people a religion from themselves, and in accordance with their intellects and their opinions; and so that we should take from shaykhs of misguidance and imaams of misguidance; those who change the Sunnah of the Messenger, <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> by lying/falsehood and who falsely bring about shaykhs and chains [01] from themselves in contradiction to sources of Islaam. This is something which is clear, which is present in what they pass on and in their thinking.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, and all praise is for Allaah, any misguidance which may persist with them is surrounded and restricted and is exposed by the light of the truth and the light of revelation. These expose the many lies which they are guilty of and which are written in their books. [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] Editor’s note: meaning chains of narration</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] Translator’s side point: Shaykh Saalih ibn Sa`d as-Suhaymee <em>hafizahullaah</em> said in his taped explanation,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It is related from Imaam Maalik, <em>rahimahullaah ta`aalaa</em>, that he used to say, <strong>‘Whoever introduces an innovation into the Religion, thinking that it is something good, then he has claimed that Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> betrayed his duty to convey the Message</strong>, because Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>This day have I completed your Religion for you, and perfected My favour upon you, and am pleased with Islaam as your Religion.’ </strong></span>(Sooratul-Maa·idah (5), aayah 3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh as-Suhaymee said, “Refer for the references of this report to al-I`tisaam of ash-Shaatibee, alBida` of Ibn Waddaah, Sharh Usool `Itiqaad Ahlis-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah of al-Laalikaa·ee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is related from Imaam ash-Shaafi`ee <em>rahimahullaah</em> that he said, <strong>‘Whoever sanctions an action as being something good then he has legislated (brought about Islaamic legislation).’</strong> Meaning: whoever holds something to be good from himself, and introduces it into the Religion as an innovation, then he has set himself up as one who can legislate besides Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Imaam Maalik rahimahullaah also said  when a man came to him and said, ‘O Aboo `Abdillaah! <strong>Where should I enter the state of ihraam from?’</strong> (the state which you enter when you want to perform `Umrah or Hajj) So he replied, ‘You enter the state of ihraam from Thul-Hulayfah, from the place where Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> entered the state of ihraam.’ (Imaam Maalik was the Imaam of Madeenah, and the man who was asking him in the city of Madeenah) So then the man said, ‘But I want to enter the state of ihraam from Madeenah itself, from the vicinity of the grave.’ So Imaam Maalik said, ‘But I fear for you fitnah (evil, tribulation).’ The man said, ‘And what fitnah can there be? <strong>It’s just some miles which I’m adding.’</strong> So Imaam Maalik said, ‘I fear for you fitnah, because Allaah, the Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So let those who contradict the command of the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam beware, lest a fitnah (trial/tribulation) befall them or a painful punishment.’</strong> </span>(Sooratun-Noor (24), aayah 63)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh as-Suhaymee said, “So the affair is dangerous; that a person introduces innovation into the Religion. He is dangerous, and introduces that which is not from it. The affair is at the limit of danger.”</p>

<p><span class="fontstyle0">Imaam al-Barbahaaree </span>rahimahullaah <span class="fontstyle0">said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And the foundation which the Jamaa`ah is built upon is the Companions of Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, may Allaah have mercy upon all of them. And they are the Ahlus-Sunnah walJamaa`ah, the People of the Sunnah and the United Body upon the Truth.

<p><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And the foundation upon which the Jamaa`ah is built upon”</strong> – who are the Jamaa`ah who have this status? They are the Companions of Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and those who come after them from the Taabi`een (their successors) and from the successors of the Taabi`een, and the most excellent generations. They are the Jamaa`ah and whoever follows them from the later peoples, they are the Jamaa`ah; those whom it is obligatory upon the Muslims to be with, whatever harm comes upon him and whatever threats and whatever blame and whatever attacks &#8211; he should still have patience upon that and he should bear it, as long as he is upon the Truth. So he should not deviate away from the Truth, rather he should have patience upon whatever befalls him, otherwise he will just be a target for those people with evil intentions and the callers to evil and the callers to misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the first and foremost ones from the Muhaajireen (the Muslims who emigrated from Makkah) and the Ansaar (the Muslims of Madeenah who gave them shelter) and those who followed them upon good. Allaah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him</strong></span>.[1] (Sooratut-Towbah (9), aayah 100)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High, when He mentioned the Muhaajireen and the Ansaar in Sooratul-Hashr, He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And those who come after them they say, O our Lord forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in Eemaan and do not place any ill feeling in our hearts towards those who truly believe. O our Lord, you are Compassionate, Merciful.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Hashr (59), aayah 10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the one who comes later he follows the earlier one from the people of the Truth and good even if there is a long period of time between him and them, he adheres to what they were upon no matter what it costs him, he should have patience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“the Companions of Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam”</strong> &#8211; from the Muhaajireen and the Ansaar because they were the ones who accompanied the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and they fought jihaad along with him and they aided him and they bore the Religion and they conveyed it to us; so they are the intermediaries between us and between Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. So those people who abuse the Companions or belittle them, they only want to demolish Islaam; however they come with this ploy. So when they speak against the Companions and they devalue them, then what will remain at that time from the intermediary that is between us and the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam? Their intent is to cut off the connection with the first and foremost ones from the Muhaajireen and the Ansaar so that the nation will go astray; otherwise what else could lead them to abusing the Companions? Did they have any dispute with the Companions with regard to money or something else? Have the Companions caused them any personal harm when there are many centuries between them and the Companions?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what led them to this is hatred in the hearts, because the Companions they are the ones who bore this Religion. So they want to cut off the link between the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and his nation so that this Religion falls. This is their intent.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and they (the Companions of Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) are the People of the Sunnah and of the Jamaa`ah (the United Body of the Muslims upon the Truth).”</strong> The Companions of Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and those who came after them, those who followed them upon good, they are the People of the Sunnah, meaning the people of the correct path; and it is the ‘Sunnah’ which we have explained in this book (the Sunnah referring to the path that which the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and his Companions were upon).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they are the true Jamaa`ah; but as for the uniting of others besides them, upon false and futile matters then they are not called the Jamaa`ah even if they are many in number.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">You think that they are all together but their hearts are actually divided.</span></strong><br />
(Sooratul-Hashr 59, aayah 14)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Jamaa`ah is whoever is upon the Truth. So the person who says, “I am with such-and-such hizb (party); this group is a jamaa`ah and you people say, “Adhere to the Jamaa`ah” and they are a jamaa`ah.” So we say to them, “Who said to you that those people are the Jamaa`ah. The Jamaa`ah is those who are upon the Truth; whoever is upon the Sunnah, they are the Jamaa`ah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“So whoever does not take from them (the Companions radiyAllaahu `anhum) then he has gone astray and has innovated.”</strong> Whoever does not take his Religion from the Companions, those who are the conveyers of the Book and the Sunnah, then he is not upon the Truth. So if they are attacked and accused then what they convey is nullified, and Allaah’s refuge is sought. And the intent of the enemies of Allaah and His Messenger is indeed to nullify Islaam, however they came with this filthy trick in order to cause a separation between the later people and the early people from the Muslims, so that it will be easy for them to devour the later people and easy to chew them up. But as for if the people tie themselves to the first Jamaa`ah and to the Book and the Sunnah then that will never be easy for them to do, indeed it will be impossible for them to chew them up by the permission of Allaah. His saying, “then he has gone astray” – meaning he has strayed away from the Truth and become lost.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“and he has innovated”</strong>&#8211; Innovation is whatever is from the matters of worship or from matters of creed and beliefs or from sayings and it does not have a proof from the Book and the Sunnah (that is an innovation). He sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;"><strong>“Whoever does an action which our affair is not in accordance with, it is rejected.”</strong> </span>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in a narration,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#339966;">“Whoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it then it is rejected.”</span></strong> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;"><strong>“And beware of newly introduced matters for every newly introduced matter is a bid`ah (an innovation) and every innovation is misguidance”</strong></span> [5].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So innovation is whatever has been introduced into the Religion and it is not from it. And how can it be known that it is not from it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it does not have a daleel, a proof, then it is not from the Religion, because Allaah the Majestic and Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>This day have I completed your Religion for you</strong></span> [6]<br />
(Sooratul-Maa·idah (5), aayah 3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Religion is complete, and all praise is for Allaah; it does not accept any additions. So it is just upon us to come to know of the Religion which Allaah the Mighty and Majestic completed, and to cling to it and that we abandon whatever is besides it from additions and from things which people deem to be good introductions and from supplements and from other than that, because these things only take people farther away from Allaah the Majestic and Most High. And there will follow a clarification that: No people introduce an innovation except that its like (a like amount of it) will be taken away from the Sunnah.[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the correct and straight path, adhering to the Jamaa`ah, adhering to the Sunnah and abandoning innovations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying,<strong> “And every innovation is misguidance”</strong> – so there is no such thing as bid`ah hasanah, ‘good innovation’, as some people say. Rather all innovations are misguidance by the textual statement of the hadeeth of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam when he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#339966;">“For every newly invented matter is an innovation (bid`ah) and every innovation is misguidance.”</span></strong> [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So innovations in the Religion, there is nothing good from them at all, rather all of them are misguidance and this is the speech of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam who did not speak from desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And misguidance and its people will be in the Hell Fire”</strong> &#8211; Misguidance and the people of misguidance will be in the Fire, either on account of their disbelief or on account of sin. So innovations are not of one level only. Some of them are kufr, disbelief, such that its person will be forever in the Fire, such as seeking aid from the dead and making supplication to the dead and making sacrifice to other than Allaah and making vows to other than Allaah &#8211; so these are innovations which are disbelief, kufr. And likewise denying the Names of Allaah and His and Attributes as is said by the Jahmiyyah, those who deny the Names and Attributes. So this is kufr, disbelief, and Allaah’s refuge is sought, because they describe Allaah as not having names or attributes; so in that case He would be nonexistent! Because that which exists must have attributes and the one who has no attributes does not exist. And therefore the Imaams judged that the Jahmiyyah are disbelievers, those who said that the Qur·aan is a created thing. So they made the Qur·aan which is the Speech of Allaah and His Revelation and that which He sent down, they made it a created thing, such as the rest of the created things. And they said Allaah does not speak so therefore they likened Him to an inanimate object; and one who does not speak cannot be a god/one deserving of worship. He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the people of Moosaa in his absence made out of the jewellery of the Copts a calf in bodily form which produced a mooing sound. Do they not then see that it could not speak to them and nor could it guide them upon the way?</strong> </span>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), aayah 148)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this shows that the one who does not speak cannot be an ilaah, one deserving of worship; whereas the Jahmiyyah say Allaah does not speak, so therefore He would not be one deserving of worship, High and Exalted is Allaah above what they say. And there occurs in Soorah Taahaa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do they not see that it cannot respond to them with any saying and it does not possess any power to harm or benefit them.</strong></span> (Soorah Taahaa (20), aayah 89)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning the calf &#8211; if they were to speak to it, it could not respond to them, so therefore was it befitting that it could be one deserving of worship? [9] And Ibraaheem `alayhissalaam said to the worshippers of the idols:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So ask them if they are able to speak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You already know that they (these idols) can’t speak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So then he said to them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then will you worship besides Allaah that which cannot benefit you at all and cannot harm you. Uff (word of anger and disgust) to you and to that which you worship besides Allaah! Do you have no intellect which prevents you from this?</strong></span> (Sooratul-Anbiyaa· (21), aayahs 66-67)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Majestic and Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord said, call upon Me, I will respond to you.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah Ghaafir (40), aayah 60)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He described Himself that He says and He speaks. So the one who does not speak He is not one deserving of worship. So therefore many of the Imaams declared the heads of the Jahmiyyah to be disbelievers, but not their blind followers or those who were just followers, those to whom the Truth had not become clear, but rather they were just blindly following upon ignorance. Those people are a case for examination and the matter must be clarified to them, and then if they persist, then judgement that they are disbelievers will be passed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Foot notes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> In tafseer of this aayah ‘And the first and foremost ones’ the people of tafseer such as at-Tabaree and those who came after them like al-Baghawee, as-Sam`aanee, Ibn Katheer and others mention a number of different sayings with regard to who are those actually meant by ‘the first and foremost ones’ (from the Muslims). Amongst what at-Tabaree brings, he brings with an authentic chain of narration from the noble Taabi`ee Sa`eed ibnul-Musayyib that he said, “The first Muhaajireen (referred to here) they are the ones who prayed towards both qiblahs” meaning the ones who accepted Islaam before the qiblah was changed, so they prayed toward Jerusalem then when the qiblah was changed they prayed towards Makkah afterwards.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise the great Salafee mufassir Aboo Muzaffar as-Sam`aanee in his tafseer, he mentioned four saying in explanation of this aayah. One of the sayings, he mentioned this same saying as Sa`eed ibnul Musayyib and he mentioned it also from Ibn Sireen and a group. Then he mentioned three further saying as well with regards to who are ‘the first and foremost ones’. The first saying he mentioned was that they are the people of Badr, meaning the people who fought at Badr; they had accepted Islaam by that time, in the second year. The second saying he quotes is that they are the people of Bay`atur-Ridwaan, the people who gave the pledge at the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah in Thul-Qa`dah in the sixth year. The third saying he quoted is that the first and foremost ones from the Muhaajireen are the ones who accepted Islaam before the Hijrah, and the first and foremost ones from the Ansaar are those who gave the pledge to Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam on the night of `Aqabah just before the Hijrah, those who accepted Islaam in Madeenah and they came for the Hajj and gave the pledge of `Aqabah to Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. Shaykul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah preferred the view that they were those who accepted Islaam before the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, and as it is known that those at the treaty of Hudaybiyyah were one thousand and four hundred and more in number. Likewise Shaykh al-Fowzaan said the same thing in his explanation of al-Waasitiyyah, that ‘the first and foremost ones’ refers to those who had accepted Islaam before the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah in the eleventh month of the sixth year. An evidence for that is an aayah from Sooratul-Hadeed (57), aayah 10:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are not equal, those who spent in charity before the Conquest (meaning the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah) and who fought&#8230;(to the end of the aayah)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee hafizahullaah said in his explanation, “The author rahimahullaah explained the importance of following and of adhering to this methodology, and that the foundation of that methodology is what we have explained a short while ago, that the foundation of the Jamaa`ah is, after Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, the Companions ridwaanullaahi `alayhim ajma`een (may Allaah be pleased with them all). So whoever makes an attack upon the Companions then he has made an attack upon the whole of Islaam and whoever abuses the Companions then he has abused Islaam and whoever maligns and attacks the Companions, then he has spoken against and accused Islaam and whoever belittles the Companions then he has belittled Islaam. Why is this the case? Because they are the ones who conveyed Islaam to us so if it were not for them Islaam would not have reached us, if it were not for the Companions, Islaam would not have reached us, for Islaam only came to us by way of them. They are the ones who conveyed the Qur·aan to us and they are the ones who conveyed the Sunnah to us and therefore Allaah praised them for that&#8230; So whoever claims that they left Islaam, became apostates (the same as the Raafidah Shee`ah say) or that they changed and altered then he is the apostate and he is the one who is changing and altering and he is the one who is making a change in the Religion.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Reported by Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 1718) and reported by al-Bukhaaree in disconnected form in his Saheeh from a hadeeth of Aa`ishah radiyAllaahu `anhaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Reported by al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh (no.2 550) and by Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 1718) from Aa`ishah radiyAllaahu `anhaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] This is part of a hadeeth of al-`Irbaad ibn Saariyah radiyAllaahu `anhu, and its checking has preceded. Translator’s side point: The checking of this hadeeth is reported by Imaam Ahmad and Aboo Daawood and at-Tirmithee and Ibn Maajah and it was declared authentic by Shaykh al-Albaanee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> This aayah came down on the day of `Arafah on the 10th year of the Hijrah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(There is) a famous saying from Imaam Maalik: So whatever was not Religion on that day it will never be Religion today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] Hassaan ibn `Atiyyah (from the Taabi`een) rahimahullaah said, “A people never introduce an innovation in their Religion except that Allaah takes away from their Sunnah its like and then He does not return it to them right until the Day of Resurrection.” Reported by ad-Daarimee and Aboo Nu`aym in al-Hilyah and al-Laalikaa·ee in Sharh Usool I`tiqaad Ahlis-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> With regards to this Taabi`ee, Hassaan ibn Atiyyah, Shaykh al-Albaanee said in his notes to al-Mishkaat, “He was a great and noble Taabi`ee who died in the year 130.” Shaykh alAlbaanee said with regard to this report from him, “Its chain of narration is saheeh and its like is also reported as a saying of Aboo Hurayrah radiyAllaahu `anhu reported by Abul-`Abbaas ibn al-Assam in his hadeeth.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] This occurs in a number of ahaadeeth, from them the hadeeth of al-`Irbaad ibn Saariyah which has just preceded, also a hadeeth of Jaabir reported by an-Nasaa·ee (no. 1578) and also by Ibn Khuzaymah in his Saheeh; and the basis of this hadeeth occurs in Saheeh Muslim (no. 768).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)   suffered the worst forms of torture because of their adherence to the correct <em>‘aqeedah, </em>and their making all worship purely and sincerely for Allaah alone, and their rejection of <em>shirk</em> and <em>kufr</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From ’Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said, “The first people to openly proclaim their Islaam were seven: Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  , Aboo Bakr, ’Ammaar and his mother Sumayyah, Suhayb, Bilaal and al-Miqdaad. So as for Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  , Allaah gave him protection through his uncle Aboo Taalib. As for Aboo Bakr, Allaah gave him protection through his people. But as for the rest of them, the <em>Mushriks</em> would take hold of them and dress them in iron armour and place them to scorch and roast in the sun. There was not one of them except that they responded to them except Bilaal, for his soul became as nothing to him for Allaah’s sake, and his people had no respect for him. So they gave him to the children who used to drag him around the streets of Makkah and he would say repeatedly, ‘<strong>(He who has the right to worship is) One, One.</strong>’”[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the <em>Seerah</em> of Ibn Hishaam [2] there occurs: ’Umayyah ibn Khalf used to take him (Bilaal) out in the midday heat of the sun, and throw him down upon his back, on the ground of the flat valley bed of Makkah, and he would order for a large rock to be placed on his chest. Then he would say, “By Allaah, you will stay like this until you die, unless you disbelieve in Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)   and you worship <em>al-Laat</em> and <em>al-’Uzzaa</em>.” So he would say, whilst he was in that condition, “<strong>(He who alone has the right to worship is) One, One</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sumayyah was tortured until death because of the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of <em>tawheed</em> not becasue she was a political leader. So from Mujaahid who said, “<strong>The first martyr in Islaam was Sumayyah the mother of ’Ammaar. Aboo Jahl thrust a spear into her abdomen.</strong>”[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Sa&#8217;d said, “She accepted Islaam early on in Makkah and she was one of those who was tortured to force them to abandon their religion. But she bore and endured it until Aboo Jahl came to her and thrust a spear into her abdomen and she died.”[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Reported by al-Haakim in <em>al-Mustadrak </em>(3/284) and he declared it <em>saheeh</em> and adh-Dhahabee mentioned it in <em>Siyar A’laamin-Nubalaa</em> (1/348) and he said, “It has a <em>saheeh</em> chain of narration&#8230;”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] <em>Seerah</em> of Ibn Hishaam (1/318).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] <em>At-Tabaqaat</em> of Ibn Sa’d (8/264/265). He said, “Ismaa’eel ibn ’Umar, Abul-Mundhir related to us that Sufyaan ath-Thawree narrated to us from Mansoor from Mujaahid who said&#8230;” This is a <em>saheeh</em> chain of narration to Mujaahid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] <em>Tabaqaat</em> <em>Ibn Sa’d</em> (8/264).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>[Excerpted from the book : “<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/dawah/methodology-of-the-prophets-in-calling-to-allaah/">The Methodology of the Prophets in Calling to Allaah – that is the way of wisdom and intelligence</a>” – by Shaykh Rabee hafidhahullaah, translated by Dawud Burbank rahimahullah]</em></p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Narrated Abu Huraira ( رضي الله عنه ) :</p>
</div>
<div class="text_details">
<p style="text-align:justify;">By Allah except Whom none has the right to- be worshipped, (sometimes) I used to lay (sleep) on the ground on my liver (abdomen) because of hunger, and (sometimes) I used to bind a stone over my belly because of hunger. One day I sat by the way from where they (the Prophet (ﷺ) and his companions) used to come out. When Abu Bakr ( رضي الله عنه )  passed by, I asked him about a Verse from Allah&#8217;s Book and I asked him only that he might satisfy my hunger, but he passed by and did not do so. Then `Umar ( رضي الله عنه ) passed by me and I asked him about a Verse from Allah&#8217;s Book, and I asked him only that he might satisfy my hunger, but he passed by without doing so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally Abu-l-Qasim (the Prophet (ﷺ) ) passed by me and he smiled when he saw me, for he knew what was in my heart and on my face. He said, &#8220;O Aba Hirr (Abu Huraira)!&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Labbaik, O Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ)!&#8221; He said to me, &#8220;Follow me.&#8221; He left and I followed him. Then he entered the house and I asked permission to enter and was admitted. He found milk in a bowl and said, &#8220;From where is this milk?&#8221; They said, &#8220;It has been presented to you by such-and-such man (or by such and such woman).&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Aba Hirr!&#8221; I said, &#8220;Labbaik, O Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ)!&#8221; He said, &#8220;Go and call the people of Suffa to me.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These people of Suffa were the guests of Islam who had no families, nor money, nor anybody to depend upon, and whenever an object of charity was brought to the Prophet, he would send it to them and would not take anything from it, and whenever any present was given to him, he used to send some for them and take some of it for himself. The order of the Prophet upset me, and I said to myself, &#8220;How will this little milk be enough for the people of As- Suffa? <strong>[1]</strong> though I was more entitled to drink from that milk in order to strengthen myself&#8221;, but behold! The Prophet (ﷺ) came to order me to give that milk to them. I wondered what will remain of that milk for me, but anyway, I could not but obey Allah and His Apostle so I went to the people of As-Suffa and called them, and they came and asked the Prophet&#8217;s permission to enter. They were admitted and took their seats in the house. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, &#8220;O Aba-Hirr!&#8221; I said, &#8220;Labbaik, O Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ)!&#8221; He said, &#8220;Take it and give it to them.&#8221; So I took the bowl (of milk) and started giving it to one man who would drink his fill and return it to me, whereupon I would give it to another man who, in his turn, would drink his fill and return it to me, and I would then offer it to another man who would drink his fill and return it to me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally, after the whole group had drunk their fill, I reached the Prophet (ﷺ) who took the bowl and put it on his hand, looked at me and smiled and said. &#8220;O Aba Hirr!&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Labbaik, O Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ)!&#8221; He said, &#8220;There remain you and I.&#8221; I said, &#8220;You have said the truth, O Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ)!&#8221; He said, &#8220;Sit down and drink.&#8221; I sat down and drank. He said, &#8220;Drink,&#8221; and I drank. He kept on telling me repeatedly to drink, till I said, &#8220;No. by Allah Who sent you with the Truth, I have no space for it (in my stomach).&#8221; He said, &#8220;Hand it over to me.&#8221; When I gave him the bowl, he praised Allah and pronounced Allah&#8217;s Name on it and drank the remaining milk.</p>

<span style="color:#808080;">Book reference  : Book 81, Hadith 41</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes</span>:</strong></p>
<p>[1] They were about eighty men or more and it is one miracle of the prophet(ﷺ) that a small  bowl of milk (hardly one kilogram) could be sufficient for over eighty men to drink to their fill.</p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Chapter 25: Their Position With Regards To The Dispute Between The Companions</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[130] The People of Hadeeth hold that one must refrain ( from discussing the dispute between the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم). The tongues must be purged from mentioning anything which entails the attribution of shortcomings and deficiencies to them. [146] They (The People of Hadeeth ), hold that one should seek Allaah’s Mercy for all of them and have love and defend each and every one of them. They also hold that one should exalt the status of the Prophet’s wives, radiyallaabu ‘anhum, supplicate for them, recognise their excellence and acknowledge that they are the Mothers of the Believers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">One thing we must understand is that defaming these chosen and unique individuals is equal to defaming the Religion itself, since it was none other than them who passed the Religion down to those who came after them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we already mentioned the words of Abu Zur&#8217;ah, in which he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;The only ones who brought this Qur&#8217;aan and Sunan (plural of Sunnah) to us are the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger. (So) they only wish to disparage and demolish our witnesses so that they can nullify the Book and the Sunnah, whereas they are more deserving of being disparaged for they are the heretics (zanaadiqah).&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This refers to those who seek to belittle any of the Companions. It implies that the one who defames them does not harm them in the least but rather he only benefits them, based on afore-mentioned hadeeth of the &#8220;<strong>bankrupt person</strong>.&#8221; The one who defames them only causes harm to himself. So whoever finds in his heart love for them and a lack of hatred for them, and withholds his tongue from mentioning anything but good about them, then he should praise Allaah for this blessing. And He should ask Allaah to keep him firm upon this guidance. And whoever holds any hatred for them in his heart and his tongue is loose in mentioning them with that which does not befit them, then he must fear Allaah and desist from these crimes. And he must repent to Allaah while the door of repentance remains open in front of him, before he regrets it at a time when regrets will be of no benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Lord do not cause our hearts to go astray after having guided us and grant us mercy from Yourself, indeed You are the One who grants all requests.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Our Lord! Forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in Faith. And put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed. Our Lord, You are indeed full of kindness, most Merciful.&#8221;</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">They knew the aim of the Book and the Sunnah. They are the ones whose <em>Fiqh </em>should be held on to as they preserved the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam</em><em>.  </em>This is why the noble Messenger –<em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam –</em> when he spoke about splitting up into sects and spoke about the <em>Firqaat-Un Najeeyah</em> said: ‘<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Those who are upon what I am upon and my Companions</strong></span>.'[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this <em>Fiqh</em> of the true <em>Deen</em> of Allaah which the noble Companions had – which they acquired from the Book of Allaah and from the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, from his sayings, actions, his teachings and his directives – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam –</em> it is obligatory upon us to take it as our reference.  The Companions are the intended believers in the saying of Allaah <em>– Tabaraka wa Ta’ala -:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been shown clearly to him and follows other than the believers’ way. We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and burn him in Hell – what an evil destination.</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [an-Nisaa: 115]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a severe threat to the one who contends with Allaah and His Messenger and follows a path other than that of the believers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So pay attention to this matter and strive to understand the way of the believers which they derived from the Book of Allaah, the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam </em>– and from his purifying and educating them upon the Book and the wisdom <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a great opportunity for you; understand from it the true <em>Deen</em> of Allaah and strive earnestly to make it apparent over all religions with proofs and evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is upon you to seek knowledge from its original watering sources; from the <em>Salafi</em> books of <em>Tafseer</em>, from the <em>Salafi</em> books of <em>‘Aqeedah</em>, which gush forth from the Book of Allaah and from the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah –<em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam</em>.  The difference between the way of the truthful believers and the way of the innovating discriminators of the true <em>Manhaj</em> of Allaah will become clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They – I swear by Allaah – are the protectors of this <em>Ummah</em> upon the <em>Deen</em> of Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em>, they had the correct <em>‘Aqeedah</em> and <em>Manhaj</em> and they were firmly upon what Muhammad <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> came with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From what is understood principally, is that it is obligatory upon us to follow the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> to hold on firmly to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> and to bite onto that with our molar teeth, just as the Messenger of Allaah mentioned – when he gave an eloquent sermon whereby tears fell and the hearts trembled  – the Companions requested him to give them some advice they said ; O Messenger of Allaah it is as if this is a farewell sermon, so advise us, he said: ‘<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>I advise you to fear Allaah…….</strong></span>’  pay attention to this advice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>….to hear and obey, whoever lives from amongst you will see many differences so it is upon you to hold on to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly guided <em>Khulafah</em>, bite on to it with your molar teeth, beware of newly invented matters, for every newly invented matter is a <em>Bida</em>’ and every <em>Bida’</em> is misguidance.</strong></span>’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[1] Translator’s note: Due to the saying of the noble Messenger of Allaah<em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> ‘Whoever does not thank the people does not thank Allaah.’ As narrated by Abee Sa’eed, &amp; authenticated by al-Albaani in as-Saheehah, I say that may Allaah reward with all goodness in this life and in the Hereafter the brother who facilitated us with the booklet and aided us in its translation.  And to our editor, may Allaah enter her into the highest grades of His Paradise among the Prophets, the Companions and the righteous for all her efforts.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;">[From &#8220;<em>Saheehus-Seeratin-Nabawiyyah</em>&#8216; (pp.80-81), Shaikh al-Albaanee &#8211; <em>rahimahullaah&#8217;s</em>&#8211; verified edition of al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer &#8211;<em>rahimahullaah&#8217;s</em>&#8211; &#8220;<em>as-Seeratun-Nabawiyyah</em>&#8216;.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Awf ibn Maalik al-Ashja`ee, who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) went off one day, and I was with him, until we entered a synagogue of the Jews (in al-Madeenah, on a festival day of theirs, and they disliked our entering upon them), and he said (to them):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#000000;">O assembly of Jews! Show me twelve men who will bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah, and Allaah will remove from every Jew beneath the sky the Anger which He has upon them</span></strong>.&gt;&gt; He said: So they remained silent; no one responded to him. Then he repeated it, but no one responded to him. So he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>You have refused, but, by Allaah ! I am indeed ‘al-Haashir’</strong> (the Prophet after whom the people will be gathered), and I am <strong>‘al-`Aaqib’</strong> (the final Prophet), and I am<strong> ‘an-Nabiyyul-Mustafaa’</strong> (the chosen Prophet): whether you believe or reject the truth</span>.</span>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he departed, and I was with him, until (when) we had almost left, a man behind us said: &#8220;Stay as you are, O Muhammad!&#8217; Then that man said: &#8221; What sort of man do you people know me to be amongst you, O company of Jews?&#8217; They said: &#8220;By Allaah! We do not know there to be any man amongst us who knows Allaah&#8217;s Scripture better than you; nor who has better understanding of the religion than you; nor than your father before you; nor than your grandfather before your father.&#8217; He said: &#8220;Then I testify for him, by Allaah, that he is indeed the Prophet of Allaah, whom you find in the Tawraat [Torah].” They said: &#8220;You have lied!&#8217; Then they rebutted his saying, and they said evil things about him, so Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>You people have lied. Your saying will never be accepted. Just now you were praising him with the good that you were praising him with; but when he believed you called him a liar, and said what you have said. Your saying will never be accepted</strong></span>.</span> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: So we departed, and we were three: Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم), myself, and `Abdullaah ibn Salaam; and Allaah -the Most High- sent down regarding him:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِن كَانَ مِنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ وَكَفَرْتُم بِهِ وَشَهِدَ شَاهِدٌ مِّن بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ عَلَىٰ مِثْلِهِ فَآمَنَ وَاسْتَكْبَرْتُمْ ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَهْدِي الْقَوْمَ الظَّالِمِينَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Say: Do you see: if this Qur·aan is from Allaah, and you reject it, and a witness from the children of Israa&#8217;eel testifies to its like, and believes in it; and you haughtily reject it; then Allaah does not guide the wrongdoing Disbelievers&#8221;</span></strong>  [ Sooratul-Ahqaaf (46): 10] [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[1] Shaikh al-Albaanee said: &#8220;Reported by Ahmad (6/25), and the additions are his; and by al-Haakim (3/415-416), and he said: &#8220;Saheeh to the standard of the two Shaikhs&#8217;! And adhDhahabee agreed with him! But it is only to the standard of Muslim, since al-Bukhaaree did not report the narrations of Safwaan ibn `Amr except in his &#8220;al-Adabul-Mufrad&#8217;.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>IMAAM AL-BUKHAAREE’S -rahimahullaah- NARRATION:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Bukhaaree narrated (no.3329): from Anas &#8211;<em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Abdullaah ibn Salaam heard of the arrival of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) at AlMadeenah, so he came to him and said: &#8220;I am going to ask you about three things which nobody but a Prophet will know.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8220;What is the first of the signs of the Hour? And what will be the first food, which the people of Paradise will eat? And on account of what does a child resemble its father; and on account of what does a child resemble its maternal uncles?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: «Jibreel has just informed me of them.» He said: `Abdullaah said: &#8220;He is the enemy to the Jews from amongst the Angels.&#8217; Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>«As for the first of the signs of the Hour, then it will be a fire, which gathers the people from the east to the west. As for the first food which the people of Paradise will eat, then it will be the extra lobe of the liver of the fish. As for the resemblance of the child, then when the man has intercourse with the woman and his semen outstrips the fluid of the woman, then the child will resemble him; and if her fluid outstrips, then the resemblance will be towards her.» </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8220;I testify that you are the Messenger of Allaah.&#8217; Then he said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah! The Jews are a people who are great liars: if they know about my Islaam before you ask them, then they will lie about me to you.&#8217; So the Jews came, and `Abdullaah ibn Salaam entered the house.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: «What sort of a man is `Abdullaah ibn Salaam amongst you?» They said: &#8220;He is the most knowledgeable one of us, and the son of the most knowledgeable one from amongst us; and he is the best one of us, and the son of the best one of us.&#8217; So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: «What would you think if `Abdullaah were to accept Islaam?» They said: &#8220;May Allaah preserve him from that.&#8217; So `Abdullaah came out to them and said: &#8220;I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah.&#8217; So they said: &#8220;He is the most evil one of us, and the son of the most evil one of us&#8217;, and they spoke against him&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>A BRIEF BIOGRAPHY OF `ABDULLAAH IBN SALAAM -radiyallaahu `anhu:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdullaah ibn Salaam ibn al-Haarith, al-Israa·eelee, Aboo Yoosuf. He was previously a confederate of Banoo `Awf ibn al-Khazraj. He accepted Islaam when Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) came to al-Madeenah. He was present at the battle of the Trench (al-Khandaq), and the battles after it. He was present with `Umar at the conquest of Jerusalem, and at alJaabiyah. He died in al-Madeenah in 43 H. <span style="color:#999999;">[[ ref. &#8220;Tahdheebut-Tahdheeb&#8217; of al-Haafiz Ibn Hajr]]</span> Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) bore witness that he will be a person of Paradise, as reported by al-Bukhaaree (no. 3812) and Muslim (no. 2483) from Sa`d ibn Abee Waqqaas &#8211;<em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em>&#8211; who said: &#8220;I never heard Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) say about anyone who still walked upon the earth that he was a person of Paradise, except `Abdullaah ibn Salaam. He said: And this Aayah came down concerning him:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَشَهِدَ شَاهِدٌ مِّن بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ عَلَىٰ مِثْلِهِ </strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">And a witness from the children of Israa·eel testifies to its like</span>&#8220;</strong> [Sooratul-Ahqaaf (46): 10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And at-Tirmidhee reported (no. 3804) from Mu`aadh ibn Jabal -radiyallaahu `anhu- who said: I heard Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) say: &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He will be the tenth of ten in Paradise</strong></span>.&gt;&gt; [ Declared &#8220;Saheeh&#8217; by Shaikh al-Albaanee.]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Haafiz `Abdul-`Azeem <strong>al-Mundhiree</strong> -rahimahullaah- (d. 656 H) said in &#8220;<strong>at-Targheeb wat-Tarheeb</strong>&#8221; [1] (The Book of Repentance and Abstention: Chapter (6): An encouragement upon Abstention (<strong>Zuhd</strong>) with regard to this world, and sufficing with a small amount from it):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And from Ibraaheem -meaning al-Ashtar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That death approached Aboo Dharr, whilst he was at ar-Rabadhah [2], so his wife wept. He said: “What causes you to weep?” She said: “I weep because I cannot do anything for you, and I have<strong> no cloth large enough to shroud you in</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: “Do not weep, for I heard Allaah&#8221;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) say one day, [and I was with him, in a group of people]: &lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#008000;">A man from amongst you will certainly die in a desert area: a group of the Believers will be present at his funeral.</span></strong> &gt;&gt; He said: “ So everyone who was along with me in that gathering has died within a group of people or separately [3] , and none from them remain except for me; and I am in a part of the desert, dying. So go out and watch the road, for you shall soon see what I say, for, by Allaah! I have not lied, nor have I been lied to.” She said: “ How can that occur, when the people travelling for Hajj have ceased?” He said: “ Watch the road.” He said: So whilst she was doing so, a group of people could be seen moving along quickly upon their riding camels, (looking) as if they were vultures [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the people came, until they stood over her, and said: “What is wrong with you?” She said:“ There is a man of the Muslims for you to shroud, and thus be rewarded for it.” They said: “Who is he?” She said: “Aboo Dharr.” So they declared that may their fathers and mothers be a ransom for him, and they hung their whips upon the necks of their camels, and they hastened to him. So he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> “Receive glad tidings, for you are the group about whom Allaah&#8221;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said what he said. So today I have entered the morning as you see me; and if I had a garment of mine that were sufficient to shroud me in, then I would not be shrouded in anything else besides it. So I implore you, by Allaah, let not a man from amongst you shroud me who has been a chief, a governor, or an official messenger.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So all of the people had attained something from that, except for a youth from the Ansaar who was with the people. He said: “ I am your companion: there are two garments in my travelling bag that were woven by my mother, and the newest of my garments are these two that I am wearing.” He said: “ You are my companion, [so you shroud me].”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Reported by Ahmad, and the wording is his, and its narrators are the narrators of the &#8220;Saheeh&#8221;; and by al-Bazzaar -with its like, in abridged form&#8230;”. Shaikh al-Albaanee said: &#8220;Hasan&#8221;.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] &#8220;Saheehut-Targheeb wat-Tarheeb&#8221; (3/295-296/no.3314) of Shaikh al-Albaanee &#8211; rahimahullaah, and the additions in square brackets were included by the Shaikh from the original hadeeth in the &#8220;Musnad&#8221; of Imaam Ahmad.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Shaikh al-Albaanee said: “ Perhaps the angle of their resemblance to vultures was on account of their having the dirt of travelling upon them.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">A <strong>Sahaabee</strong> (Companion) is anyone that met the Prophet (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) while believing in him, and dying upon that condition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Companions (<strong>Sahaabah</strong>) of the Prophet (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) are the best from all those that accompanied the prophets, due to the statement of Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam): “The best of people are my Companions.” [1] Al-Bukhaaree and others have reported this hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The best among the Sahaabah are the <strong>Muhaajiroon</strong> (those who performed the migration from Makkah to Madeenah), due to their combining between migrating and giving support (in Allaah&#8217;s Cause). Then after them, are the <strong>Ansaar</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The best among the Muhaajiroon are the <strong>four righteous Khaleefahs</strong>: Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, ‘Uthmaan and ‘Alee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Abu Bakr</strong> &#8211; He is &#8220;<strong>As-Siddeeq</strong>&#8221; ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Uthmaan bin ‘Aamir from the Tribe of Taym bin Marrah bin Ka’ab. He was the first male to believe in the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam). He was his companion in the migration (Hijrah) and his deputy during times of prayer and Hajj. He was his Khaleefah (designated successor) for his nation. Five of those who were given the glad tidings of Paradise accepted Islaam through his hands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are ‘Uthmaan, Az-Zubair, Talha, ‘Abd-ur-Rahmaan bin ‘Awf and Sa’ad bin Abee Waqqaas. He died in Jumaadal-Al-Akhirah, in the 13th year of Hijrah, when he was 63 years old. The above five along with Abu Bakr, ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib and Zayd bin Haarithah form the eight that were the first of people to accept Islaam. Ibn Ishaaq stated this and what he meant by it, was that they were the first from amongst the males, after (the advent of) the Message.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Umar</strong> &#8211; He is Abu Hafs &#8220;<strong>Al-Faarooq</strong>&#8221; ‘Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab from the tribe of ‘Adiyy bin Ka’ab bin Lu’aa. He accepted Islaam in the sixth year after the Prophet (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) was sent, after nearly forty men and eleven women (had accepted Islaam). The Muslims were overjoyed by that occasion and Islaam spread in Makkah afterward. Abu Bakr entrusted him with the leadership of the Muslim nation, and so he rose to the hardship of the Khilaafah in the best manner. This was until he was killed and died as a martyr in Dhul-Hijjah of the year 23H, at the age of 63.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Uthmaan</strong> &#8211; He is Abu ‘Abdillaah &#8220;<strong>Dhun-Noorain</strong>&#8221; ‘Uthmaan bin ‘Affaan from the tribe of Umayyah bin ‘Abd-ish-Shams bin ‘Abd Manaaf. He accepted Islaam after the Prophet’s entrance into Daar-ul-Arqam. He was a rich and generous man. He was given the Khilaafah after &#8216;Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab (radyAllaahu ‘anhu), due to the agreement of the members of the governing body. He remained Khaleefah until he was killed and martyred in Dhul-Hijjah in the year 35H. He was 90 years old at the time of his death, according to one of several opinions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Alee</strong> &#8211; He is Abul-Hasan ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib. The name of Abu Taalib was ‘Abd Manaaf bin ‘Abd-il-Muttallib. He was the first from the youth to accept Islaam. The Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) gave him the banner on the Day of Khaibar and Allaah granted victory at his hands. He was given the Khilaafah after the murder of &#8216;Uthmaan. Thus, he became the Khaleefah, governing until he was killed himself, and martyred in the month of Ramadaan in the 40H, at the age of 63.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The best of these four is Abu Bakr, then ‘Umar, then ‘Uthmaan, then ‘Alee. This is based on the report of Ibn ‘Umar (radyAllaahu ‘anhu): “We used to make preference between the people during the time of the Prophet (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam). So we preferred Abu Bakr, then ‘Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab, then ‘Uthmaan bin ‘Affaan.” This was reported by Al-Bukhaaree.[2] It is also based on (the hadeeth) in Abu Dawood: “We used to say, while the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) was alive: The best of the Prophet’s ummah after him, is Abu Bakr, then ‘Umar, then ‘Uthmaan.” At-Tabaraanee added to this in his report: “The Prophet would hear that and he would not oppose it.” I did not find the wording that the author mentions, in which there is the addition of ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib. [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most deserving from them of the Khilaafah, after the Prophet, was Abu Bakr (radyAllaahu ‘anhu). This is since he was the best of them and foremost to them in accepting Islaam. Also, the Prophet (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) preferred him to lead the prayer. Furthermore, the Sahaabah agreed upon his superiority and upon giving him the oath of allegiance (bay’ah). And it is not befitting for Allaah to unite them in agreement upon an error. Then ‘Umar, since he was the best of the Sahaabah after Abu Bakr and because Abu Bakr entrusted the Khilaafah to him. Then ‘Uthmaan, due to his merits and due to his election by the Majlis Ash-Shooraa (governing body). They are the ones mentioned in this verse from a poem:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">“’Alee, &#8216;Uthmaan, Sa&#8217;ad and Talha.<br />
Zubair and Dhu &#8216;Awf &#8212; members of the governing body.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then comes &#8216;Alee, due to his merits and the consensus of the Muslims of his time upon it. These four are the rightly guided Khaleefahs, whom the Prophet (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said concerning them: “Stick to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly-guided Khaleefahs after me. Bite onto it (the Sunnah) with your molar teeth.” And he (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: “The Khilaafah after me will endure for thirty years.” Ahmad, Abu Dawood and At-Tirmidhee reported this hadeeth and Al-Albaanee said that its chain of narration was hasan. Thus, the last part of it, was the Khilaafah of &#8216;Alee. This is as the author has stated and it is as if he places the Khilaafah of Al-Hasan subordinate to his father&#8217;s or just doesn&#8217;t acknowledge it (i.e. Al-Hasan&#8217;s Khilaafah) at all, due to his yielding it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Khilaafah of Abu Bakr (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) endured for two years, three months and nine nights, from the 13th of Rabee&#8217;-ul-Awwal 11H to the 22nd of Jumaadal-Akhirah 13H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Khilaafah of &#8216;Umar (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) lasted ten years, six months and three days, from the 23rd of Jumaadal-Akhirah 13H to the 26th of Dhul-Hijjah 23H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Khilaafah of &#8216;Uthmaan (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) lasted twelve years minus 12 days, from the month of Muharram 24H to the 18th of Dhul-Hijjah 35H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Khilaafah of &#8216;Alee (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) lasted four years and nine months from the 19th of Dhul-Hijjah 35H to the 19th of Ramadaan 40H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Combined, the Khilaafah of these four (Companions) lasted twenty-nine years, six months and four days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereafter, <strong>Al-Hasan bin &#8216;Alee</strong> (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) was given the oath of allegiance on the day that his father, &#8216;Alee died. Then, in the month of Rabee&#8217;-ul-Awwal 41H, the command was given to Mu&#8217;awiyah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) and due to that, the signs which the Prophet (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) spoke of in his statement: “The Khilaafah after me will endure for thirty years” and his statement: “Indeed, this son of mine is a Sayyid (noble) and perhaps it will be that Allaah will bring peace between two large parties (i.e. that of Al-Hasan and Mu&#8217;awiyah) through him”[4] came to pass.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Hasan</strong> was the grandson of the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and the fruit of his offspring. He was the Ameer-ul-Mu’mineen(Commander of the Believers), son of the Ameer-ul-Mu’mineen &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib. He was born on the 15th of Ramadaan in the third year after Hijrah. He died while in Madeenah and was buried in the graveyard Al-Baqee&#8217; in Rabee-ul-Awwal 50H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Husayn</strong> was the grandson of the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and the fruit of his offspring. He was the son of &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib. He was born in Sha&#8217;baan in the fourth year after Hijrah and was killed at Karbala on the tenth of Muharram 61H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>FOOTNOTES</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: Book of the Virtues of the Companions of the Prophet (no. 3651) and Saheeh Muslim: Book of the Virtues of the Companions (no. 2533) from the hadeeth of Ibn Mas’ood (radyAllaahu ‘anhu). It is also reported on the authority of ‘Imraan bin Husayn (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) in Al-Bukhaaree (no. 2561, 3650, 6438 &amp; 6695) and Muslim (no. 2535). Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) also reported it in Muslim (no. 534) as well as others. Furthermore, this is a mutawaatir hadeeth. Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr stated the correctness of it being mutawaatir in the introduction to his Al-Isaabah.[2] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: Book of the Virtues of the Companions (no. 3655). And in another wording found in Al-Bukhaaree (no. 3697), it states: “During the lifetime of the Prophet, we used to not put anyone equal to Abu Bakr, then (the same was with) ‘Umar, then (the same was with) ‘Uthmaan. Then we left the (remaining) Companions of the Prophet alone, not distinguishing between any of them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Isnaaduhu Saheeh: This is an authentic hadeeth reported by Abu Dawood (4628), At-Tirmidhee (3707) and Ibn Abee ‘Aasim in As-Sunnah (1190). Its chain of narration (isnaad) is authentic as has been stated by Al-Albaanee in his checking to As-Sunnah (2/567). As for the addition that Shaikh Ibn Al-‘Uthaimeen has mentioned, which is found in At-Tabaraanee, which is: “The Prophet would hear that and he would not oppose it”, then it is an authentic addition, which is established in many paths of narration found in Ibn Abee ‘Aasim (1194, 1195, 1196 &amp; 1197), Ahmad (2/14) and others with authentic chains. Refer to the checking of Ibn Abee ‘Aasim’s As-Sunnah (2/568-569) as well as Fath-ul-Baaree (7/16-17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: Book of Peace Making (no. 2704) from the hadeeth of Abu Bakrah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaikh-ul-lslaam Ibn Taimiyyah said in his book AI-&#8216;Aqeedat-ul-Waasitiyyah:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Among the Principles of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah is maintaining pure hearts and tongues towards the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم), as Allaah has described them in His saying: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;And those who come after them say: &#8216;Our Lord! Forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in Faith. And put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed. Our Lord, You are indeed full of kindness, most Merciful.&#8217;</span> [Surah Al-Hashr: 10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And (from their principles is) obedience to the Prophet with regard to his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) saying: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;Do not revile my Companions! For by the One whose Hand my soul is in, if one of you were to give away the size of mount Uhud in gold for charity, it would not equal a mudd of one of them nor even half of it.&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They accept what is stated in the Qur&#8217;aan, the Sunnah and the Consensus concerning their (the Companion&#8217;s) virtues and high status. And they give preference to those who spent their wealth and fought (in the Way of Allaah) before the Victory, which refers to the Treaty of al-Hudaibiyah, over those who gave their wealth and fought after it. They give precedence to the Muhaajireen over the Ansaar. And they believe that Allaah said to the people who fought in (the Battle of) Badr &#8211; who numbered over three hundred people: <strong>&#8216;Do whatever you wish, for I have already forgiven you.&#8217;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they believe that no one who pledged their allegiance to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) under the tree will enter the Hellfire, as the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) informed us. In fact, Allaah was pleased with them and they were pleased with Him. And they were more than one thousand four hundred people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They designate to Paradise whoever the Messenger of Allaah testified will be in Paradise, such as the Ten (Companions), Thaabit bin Qays bin Shammas and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They confirm what has been reported in tawaatur form on the Commander of the Believers, &#8216;Alee Ibn Abee Taalib and others that: The best of this ummah after its Prophet are Abu Bakr; then &#8216;Umar. Then they place &#8216;Uthmaan third and &#8216;Alee fourth, may Allaah be pleased with all of them. This is as is indicated in the athaar (reports from the Sahaabah) and as was unanimously agreed upon that &#8216;Uthmaan had precedence (over &#8216;Alee) for being pledged allegiance to (for the Khilaafah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In spite of this, after unanimously agreeing to the precedence of Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar, some of Ahl-us-Sunnah have disagreed with regard to &#8216;Uthmaan and &#8216;Alee as to which of them is better. So a group of them gave precedence to &#8216;Uthmaan and then remained silent, and placed &#8216;Alee as the fourth. And another group gave precedence to &#8216;Alee. And yet another group remained neutral. But the affair of Al-us-Sunnah settled upon giving precedence to &#8216;Uthmaan and then &#8216;Alee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regardless, this issue of &#8216;Uthmaan and &#8216;Alee is not from the principles by which the one who disagrees concerning it becomes misguided (and deviant), according to the majority of the (scholars of) Ahl-us-Sunnah. Rather, the issue in which the one who opposes becomes misguided is the issue of the Khilaafah &#8211; and it is that they (must) believe that the Khaleefah after Allaah&#8217;s Messenger was Abu Bakr, then &#8216;Umar, then &#8216;Uthmaan, then &#8216;Alee. And whoever attacks the Khilaafah of any one of them, then he is more astray than the donkey of his people.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Then he mentioned that they have love and affection for the Members of the Household of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger and that they preserve the Will (final requests) of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger concerning them. And that they have affection for the Wives of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger, the Mothers of the Believers and believe that they will be his wives in the Hereafter.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Then he said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;They absolve themselves from the way of the Rawaafid &#8211; those who hate the Companions and revile them &#8211; and from the way of the Nawaasib &#8211; those who abuse the Members of the (Prophet&#8217;s) Household &#8211; through speech or action. And they refrain from (delving into) the disputes that occurred between the Companions. And they say: These narrations that have been reported concerning their faults have in them some that are false, some that have had things added to them, some that have had parts omitted from them, and some that have been changed from their original state. As for those narrations that are authentic (concerning their faults), then they (the Companions) are excused (and forgiven) &#8211; either they made Ijtihaad and were correct or they made Ijtihaad and were wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, they do not believe that each of the Companions is infallible and free from committing major or minor sins. Rather, they are capable of committing sins in general, however, they possess from precedence and virtues that which necessitates that they be forgiven for whatever (sins) they commit &#8211; if they did commit any. This is even to the point that they will be forgiven for evil deeds the likes of which those who come after them will not be forgiven for. This is because they possess good deeds that wipe out the evil deeds, the likes of which will not be for those after them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is established from the saying of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) that they are the best of generations and that if one of them were to give a mudd (of gold) in charity it would be better than if someone who came after them were to give the whole of Mount Uhud in gold. And if it was the case that one of them committed a sin, then either he repented from it or he performed some good deed that wiped it out. Or he will be forgiven for it due to the virtue of his precedence or because of the intercession of Muhammad H, of which the Companions have the most right among people of receiving. Or perhaps he was tested by some affliction in this world, by which it was expiated from him. So if this is with respect to the sins that were actualized (by them), then what about the matters in which they did Ijtihaad? If they were correct they will have two rewards and if they were incorrect they will have just one reward and their error will be forgiven.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the amount of (bad) deeds committed by some of them, that is forsaken yet forgiven, is tiny in comparison to their virtues and good qualities, such as their belief in Allaah and His Messenger, their Jihaad for His Cause, their performance of Hijrah, their support (of the Religion), as well as their beneficial knowledge and good deeds. And whoever studies the history of the &#8216;people&#8217; (i.e. the Sahaabah) with knowledge and insight, and studies the merits that Allaah bestowed unto them, he will come to know with full certainty that they are the best of creation after the prophets. There was not nor will there be anyone like them. They are the safwah (chosen elite) from all the generations of this nation (of Muslims), which is itself the best and most honorable of all nations with Allaah.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">And whatever disputes and differences that occurred between (some of) them, that can be authentically confirmed, we hold that they were Mujtahideen in that regard &#8211; either they were correct and will receive one reward for their Ijtihaad and one reward for being correct, or they were wrong and will receive just one reward for their Ijtihaad while their error will be forgiven. They were not infallible since they were human beings. At times they were correct and at times they erred. But how much more were they correct as compared to others being correct, and how fewer were their errors as compared to the errors of others? And on top of this, they will receive Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness and contentment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The books of Ahl-us-Sunnah are filled with a clarification of this pure and radiant Creed concerning these elite people, who were chosen amongst mankind to accompany the best of mankind H. May Allaah be pleased with them all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of this is the statement of At-Tahaawee in his (book on the) Creed of Ahl- us-Sunnah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;We love the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger. But we do not go to extremes in our love for anyone amongst them, nor do we absolve ourselves from any of them. And we hate anyone that hates them or anyone that talks about them in a bad way. And we do not mention them except with good. Loving them is Deen (Religion), Eemaan (Faith) and Ihsaan (Goodness) and hating them is Kufr (Disbelief), Nifaaq (hypocrisy) and Tughyaan (transgression).&#8221;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn Abee Zayd Al-Qayrawaanee</strong> said in the introduction to his famous ar-Risaalah, in which he explains the Creed of Ahl-us-Sunnah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The best of generations is the one that saw the Messenger of Allaah. And the best of the Companions are the (four) rightly guided Khaleefahs &#8211; Abu Bakr, then &#8216;Umar, then &#8216;Uthmaan, then &#8216;Alee, may Allaah be pleased with them all. None of the Companions should be mentioned except in the best of manners. <strong>We believe in refraining from (speaking about) the differences that occurred between them</strong>. And that they are the most deserving of people of having excuses made for them and (that) they are to be thought of in the best way.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal</strong> said in his book as-Sunnah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And from the Sunnah is mentioning the good qualities of the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger &#8211; all of them &#8211; and to refrain from (speaking about) what disputes occurred between them. So whoever reviles the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger or (just) one of them, then he is an innovator, a Raafidee. Loving them is a Sunnah and making du&#8217;aa (supplication) for them is a means of getting close to Allaah (taqarrub). Following them is a means and taking from their example is a virtue&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It is not permissible for anyone to mention any of their faults. Nor can anyone disparage any of them. So whoever does that, then the authority (sultan) is obligated to reprimand him and punish him. And he is not to pardon him, but rather must punish him and then request him to repent. So if he repents, he should accept it from him. And if he doesn&#8217;t repent, he should reinitiate the punishment upon him and lock him in prison for good until he repents and recants (from his false belief).&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Abu &#8216;Uthmaan As-Saaboonee</strong> said in his book Aqeedat-us-Salaf wa Ashaab-il- Hadeeth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And they held it an obligation to refrain from (speaking about) the differences that occurred between the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger and to purify the tongues from mentioning anything that consists of a blemish on them or a degradation of them. And they held it an obligation to ask Allaah to grant mercy to all of them and to show friendship to all of them.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The third question of Fatwa no. 2442</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 3: <strong>What is the ruling on acting the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet, may Allah be pleased with them) in school theaters?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The Council of Senior Scholars previously reviewed this question and issued a decree as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Allah (Exalted be He) has praised and set clear the high status of the Sahabah. Thus, acting any of them on stage or on the screen is contrary to this Divine praise and is <strong>detrimental to the high status and honor</strong> which Allah has bestowed upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Representing any of them in this way <strong>exposes them to mockery and ridicule</strong>. Actors are usually people who have no room for righteousness, piety, and Islamic morals in their lives. Moreover, those who put on plays are doing so as a means to earn money, and no matter how much they try to avoid it, it will involve some lying and backbiting. Acting the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) may have an <strong>effect on their status in the hearts and minds of the Muslims, or diminish the reverence they have for them, and paves the way for arousing doubts in Muslims about their religion and disputes over the personalities of the Sahabah</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also necessarily implies that one of the actors will play the role of Abu Jahl and other disbelievers, thus he will have to <strong>utter words insulting Bilal, and insulting the Messenger (peace be upon him) and the Message of Islam</strong> that he brought. Undoubtedly, this is a great evil. This act may be targeted to confuse the Muslims about their creed, the Book of Allah and Sunnah of their Prophet (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. If it is claimed that this serves the interest of calling people to Islam and spreading noble Islamic morals and etiquette through showing exact biographies of those Sahabah is simply an assumption and wishful thinking. Whoever knows the real nature and aims of actors will realize that this kind of acting is in sharp contrast to the real nature of the actors, their standards, lives, and behaviors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. It is basically stated in the principles of Shari`ah (Islamic law) that <strong>if a certain matter is definitely or probably harmful, it will be forbidden</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">Acting the Sahabah may serve some interest, but the harm done by this is far greater than any good that might be achieved.</span> Accordingly, to protect those interests and ward off harm, and to preserve the honorable status of the Sahabah of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), we must not allow that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings of Allah be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The madh-hab of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah concerning the Companions is that of moderateness between the two ends of extremism and heedlessnessThe madh-hab of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah concerning the Companions is that of moderateness between the two ends of extremism and heedlessness.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The madh-hab of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah concerning the Companions is that of moderateness between the two ends of extremism and heedlessnessThe madh-hab of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah concerning the Companions is that of moderateness between the two ends of extremism and heedlessness. It is moderateness amidst the extremist fanatics who elevate the esteemed ones amongst them to a level that is only befitting for Allaah or for His messengers and moderateness amidst the heedless and harsh ones who belittle and revile them. So they are in the middle between those who are excessive and those who fall short &#8211; they love all of them and put each one of them in the due place that they deserve, with fairness and justice. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So they do not elevate them to a level they don&#8217;t deserve, nor do they belittle them, taking away what they are worthy of</strong></span>. Their tongues are moist with mentioning them only in good, according to what is befitting for them. And their hearts are filled with love for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whatever disputes and differences that occurred between (some of) them, that can be authentically confirmed, we hold that they were Mujtahideen in that regard &#8211; either they were correct and will receive one reward for their Ijtihaad and one reward for being correct, or they were wrong and will receive just one reward for their Ijtihaad while their error will be forgiven.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">All of the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger are trustworthy based on Allaah&#8217;s testifying that for them and because of His praise for them and the praise of His Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>An-Nawawee said in at-Taqreeb</strong></span>, which As-Suyootee explained in his Tadreeb-ur-Raawee:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;All of the Companions are trustworthy &#8211; those who were involved in the afflictions (fitan) and other than them &#8211; according to the consensus of the scholars.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr</strong></span> said in al-lsaabah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Ahl-us-Sunnah have unanimously agreed that all of them (the Sahaabah) are trustworthy and no one opposed this except some deviants amongst the innovators.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why there is no harm in not knowing a Companion in a chain of narration. So if a Taabi&#8217;ee says: &#8220;On the authority of a man who accompanied the Prophet&#8230;&#8221; this does not affect the report. This is because not knowing the Companions (in the chain) causes no harm since they are all trustworthy.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Al-Khateeb Al-Baghdaadee</strong></span> said in his book al-Kifaayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Every hadeeth that has a chain of narration that is connected between the one who reported it and the Prophet is not to be acted upon until first having affirmed the trustworthiness and reliability of all the narrators (in the chain). It is an obligation to investigate all of their conditions, except for the Sahaabee (Companion) who raises it (or attributes the hadeeth) to the Prophet. This is because the trustworthiness of the Companions is established and well known based on Allaah&#8217;s affirming that for them, His informing us of their pure state and His preference of them in the texts of the Qur&#8217;aan&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he (rahimahullaah) went on to list some ayaat and ahaadeeth concerning their virtues and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And even if Allaah or His Messenger had not mentioned anything about them from what we just stated now (of their virtues), the condition they were upon of having made Hijrah, fought in Jihaad, of having offered their support, sacrificed their lives and wealth, experienced the killings of their parents and children, of mutually advising for the Religion and having strong Faith and unshakeable certainty, (all of this) would be enough to prove their trustworthiness and enough for one to have firm faith in their honesty and integrity. And it would necessitate the understanding that they are the best from those who receive testimony and approval as to their trustworthiness and reliability from all of the people that will come after them forever and ever.&#8221;</p>

<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a – Shaykh ul-Islaam Ahmad bin AbdulHaleem Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for the level excellence of Abu Bakr then Umar, then Uthmaan and Ali, then this is agreed upon between the Imams of knowledge and <em>Deen</em>, from amongst the Companions and <em>Taba’een</em>.  It is the <em>Madhab</em> of Malik, <em>Ahl-ul- Madinah</em>, Abu Hanifah, Hamad bin Zayed, Hamad bin Salamah and the likes of them from the people of Iraq and it is the <em>Madhab</em> of Shaafi’ee, Ahmad, Ishaq, Abu Ubayd and other than them from the Imams of Islaam who have a truthful tongue from amongst the <em>Ummah</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Majmoo’ al-Fatawa 4/421]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b – Imam Nawawi said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The <em>Ummah</em> is agreed upon the correctness of the <em>Khalafah</em> of Abu Bakr and his precedence over the Companions <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhum ajmaeen</em>&#8211; due to him being the best of them, and the most deserving for the <em>Khalafah</em> than other than him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Tahathab al-‘Asmaa 2/191]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">c – Hafidh Suyootee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah</em> are united that the best person after the Messenger of Allaah is Abu Bakr, then Umar, then Uthmaan and then Ali.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Tareekh al-Khulafah p.34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">d – From Ibn Abi Layla who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abu Bakr and Umar were being discussed, so a man from ‘Attarad said: ‘Umar is better than Abu Bakr.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Jarrood said: ‘Rather Abu Bakr is better than him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This news reached Umar <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em>, and he began to beat him with a stick until he ran off, then he turned to al-Jarrood but he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Be away from me!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Umar said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abu Bakr was the best of the people after the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> in such and such thing.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Umar said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever says other than this, then we will do to him what we do to a slanderer.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Abdullaah bin Ahmad bin Hanbal in ‘as-Sunnah’ 2/579]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">e – From Abdullaah bin Salmah who said I heard Ali saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The best of the people after the Messenger of Allaah is Abu Bakr, and the best of the people after Abu Bakr is Umar . . . . .’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ibn Majah &amp; authenticated by Albaani no. 86]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">f – From Abu Juhayfah who said: ‘I heard Ali saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Shall I not inform you who is the best of this <em>Ummah</em> after its Prophet, it is Abu Bakr.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Ali continued:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Shall I not inform you who is the best of this <em>Ummah</em> after Abu Bakr it is Umar.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ahmad &amp; authenticated by Ahmad Shakir. Imam Dhahabi said in ‘Tareekh al-Khulafah’ p.115: ‘I swear by Allaah the Magnificent, that this is what Ali said and it is<em>Mutawatir</em> from him, because he said this while on the <em>Mimbar</em> in Koofah, may Allaah fight the Rafidaah, how ignorant they are!’]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">g – From Muhammad bin al-Hanafeeyah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I said to Ali bin Abi Taalib: O my father, who of the people is the best after the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abu Bakr.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Abdullaah bin Ahmad bin Hanbal in ‘as-Sunnah’ No.1363]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">h – From Muhammad bin al-Hanafeeyah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I asked my father, who of the people is the best after the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘Abu Bakr.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked: ‘Then who?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘then Umar.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I feared that he would say Uthmaan, I then said: ‘Then you?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I am no other than a person from amongst the Muslims.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">i – From Shaqeeq who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It was said to Ali <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em>: ‘Will you not appoint a leader?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> did not appoint a leader, so how can I appoint one.  If Allaah <em>– Tabaraka wa Ta’ala –</em> wants good for the people then He gathers them as He gathered them after their Prophet upon the best of them.’ [i.e. Abu Bakr]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ibn Abi Aassim in ‘as-Sunnah’ 1221]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">j – From Sufyan at-Thawri who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever claims that Ali <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> was more deserving of ruler ship than Abu Bakr and Umar, then he has claimed that Abu Bakr was wrong, likewise Umar, the<em>Muhajiroon</em>, and the <em>Ansaar</em>.  I hold the opinion that this person’s good actions will not rise up to the heavens (not accepted by Allaah), if he holds this view.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Abu Dawood &amp; Albaani said it is Saheeh al-Isnaad although it is disconnected. No.4387]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">k – From Abdullaah bin Umar who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘We used to say while the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was alive: ‘The best of the <em>Ummah</em> of the Prophet after the Prophet is Abu Bakr, then Umar, then Uthmaan <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhum ajmaeen</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Abu Dawood, Ibn Abi Aassim in ‘as-Sunnah’ &amp; Abdullaah bin Ahmad in ‘as-Sunnah’, Albaani said it’s <em>Isnad</em> is Saheeh]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">l – From Ibn Umar <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘During the time of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> we would not equate anyone along with Abu Bakr, then Umar, then Uthmaan then we would leave the Companions of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> and not choose a preference between them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">m – From Shaafi’ee who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Companions and their followers are gathered upon the excellence and precedence of Abu Bakr, then Umar, then Uthmaan, then Ali.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[‘al-Itiqaad’ by Bayhaqi]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">n – Imam Dhahabi said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The scholars of the Sunnah are agreed that the best of the Companions are the ten who had been testified with entering Paradise.  The best of those ten were Abu Bakr, then Umar bin al-Khattab, then Uthmaan bin ‘Affan, then Ali bin Abi Taalib <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhum ajmaeen</em>&#8211; and no one doubts that except an innovator, a hypocrite, or a filthy person.’</p>

</em>Following the Companions</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 -From Hudhayfah bin al-Yamaan (d. 36 A.H.) <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Follow our paths, because verily if you follow us then indeed  you have truly advanced a lot.  And if you oppose us then indeed you have become extremely misguided.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘al-Bida’ by Ibn Wadha/44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 -From Jafar bin ‘Amr (d. 207 A.H.) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘We were a group from the children of the Companions of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>, we said:  Verily our fathers have indeed preceded us with <em>Hijrah</em> and companionship of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>, so let us strive in worship in the hope that we will reach their excellence.  We came across Tameem ad-Daari (the Companion) as an old man, who could not stand nor sit due to the length of his prayer.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘Zuhud’ by Ahmad /249]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – From Salih bin Kaysaan (d. 140 A.H.) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I met up with Zuhri and we would seek knowledge( together), then we said: We should write the <em>Sunnan</em>,  we should write that which came from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>, then we should write that which came from his Companions as indeed it is the Sunnah. So I said:  It is not the Sunnah and we should not write it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continues:  So Zuhri wrote it, but I did not write it, so he was successful whereas I became lost.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘Jamia Bayyan al-Ilm’ 2/1176]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 – From Muhammad Ibn Sireen (d. 110 A.H.) who was asked about combining the Umrah into the Hajj, so he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Umar bin Khattab and Uthman bin ‘Affaan disliked it, and if it was knowledge then they are more knowledgeable than me, and if it was their opinion then their opinion is better.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘Jamia Bayyan al-Ilm’ 1/773]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5- From Sa’eed bin al-Musayib (d. 93 A.H.)that he was asked about something so he who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Companions of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> differed regarding this and I can have no opinion to place along with theirs.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘Jamia Bayyan al-Ilm’ 1/770]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 – From Mujahid (d. around 105 A.H.)who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Scholars are the Companions of Muhammad <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘Jamia Bayyan al-Ilm’ 1/770]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7 – From AbdurRahmaan bin ‘Amr al-Aawza’i (d.156 A.H.) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Knowledge is that which came from the Companions of Muhammad <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>, and that which did not come from even one of them, then it is not knowledge.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘Jamia Bayyan al-Ilm’ 1/769]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8 – From Ibrahim an-Nakha’i (d. 96 A.H.) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If it had reached me concerning them, i.e. the Companions, that they did not exceed in the <em>Wudu</em> more than a finger nail, then I would not exceed it.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">How a Companion of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-   is Identified</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">By Miseekah bint ‘Assim al-Quruti</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Companions can be known in a number of different ways:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- Sometimes the Companions can be known by being mentioned in the Noble Qur’aan, like the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;as one of two, when they were in the cave&gt;&gt; [Tawbah: 40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">the meaning of that is as-Siddiq <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> [Abu Bakr].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why the scholars say: ‘Whoever rejects Abu Bakr’s companionship of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> is a disbeliever.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise the mention of the companionship of Zayed bin Harithah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em>due to the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;So when Zayd had no longer any need for her, We married her to you&gt;&gt; [Ahzab: 37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 – By <em>Tawatir</em> (Recurring narratives) like the companionship of Umar, Uthmaan, Ali, Hudayfah, Abu Huriarah, ‘Aeysha and others from the senior Companions <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhum ajmaeen</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – By beneficial information, and that is by a Companion of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> being well-known amongst the other Companions. It is less than<em>Tawatir</em> (Recurring narratives), which means that many of the people knew them, even if it was hidden from a small number of them, like: Thaabit bin Qaays, Dhul-Yadain, Mu’aawiyah ibn al-Hakam as-Sulami, Bareerah the freed slave of ‘Aeysha and others from amongst them <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhum ajmaeen</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 – By the testification of other Companions of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam,</em> as in the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbas <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> regarding the seventy thousand who will enter Paradise without reckoning; so ‘Ukashah bin Mihsan stood up and said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah make <em>Dua’</em> to Allaah to make me from amongst them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said: ‘You are from them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 – By a Companion actually narrating from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>that he heard him <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> saying, or that he witnessed the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> in his time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 – By the testification of a <em>Taabaiee’</em> (a successor of the Companions) where he says: ‘So and so from the Companions of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> narrated to me.’  And this has some conditions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a-    That the <em>Isnad</em> (chain) is authentic from that <em>Taabaiee’</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b-    That he is a senior <em>Taabaiee’</em> so that most of his narrations are from the Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">c-    That the <em>Taabaiee’</em> is well known for his memory and precision. No mistake has been experienced from him, since he could have made a mistake and he was not aware of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7 – That the person himself says ‘I am a Companion of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.’  That he is known to be just. It is obligatory that his announcement had been made within one hundred years of the death of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>. It has been affirmed by <em>Tawatir</em> (Recurring narratives) that the last of the Companions to die was Abu at-Tufayl bin ‘Aamir bin Waathilah al-Laythi, and what is correct is that he died in the year 110 A.H. so whoever claims companionship after that, then it is not accepted from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a principle, which is beneficial, and through it we can identify the companionship of a large number of Companions by knowing a general characteristic which includes all of them to be from the Companions of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>, and this principle is taken from three <em>Athaar</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first: ‘The general people would only place the Companions in charge of battles. Whoever researches narrations which talk about the battles against those who apostated after the death of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> and the battles concerning conquering other lands, finds that there had been many Companions mentioned.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second: ‘That Ibn ‘Awf said: ‘No one would have a new born except that he would bring it to that Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> and he would supplicate for it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third: ‘There had not remained anyone in Madina, nor Makkah, nor Taif by the tenth year after the <em>Hijra</em> except that he had accepted Islaam and had witnessed the farewell Hajj.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, whoever was present at that time is classified as a Companion under this Companionship due to them seeing the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> even if he himself did not see them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">[For References of this section see: ‘Muqqadamah Ibn Salah’ along with its explanation ‘at-Taqyeed’, ‘al-Baith al-Hatheeth’ by Ibn Katheer, ‘al-Isaabah’ by Ibn Hajr &amp; ‘Fath al-Muggeeth’ by Sakhawee.’]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808000;">The Messenger’s <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> Supplication For Anas <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu<br />
</em>Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ </span><br />
<span style="color:#808000;">By the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’  </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#808000;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">140 – From Qatada who said: I heard Anas saying: I heard Umm Sulaym who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O Messenger of Allaah! Make <em>Dua</em>’ to Allaah for Anas’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said: <strong>‘O Allaah increase his wealth and offspring and bless him in what you have provided for him.’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Bukhari and Tirmidhi</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">141-  From Thaabit, from Anas bin Malik that the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> came to Umm Haraam and she brought him some dates and margarine but the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Return this to its container and the other to its jug, since I am fasting.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he stood and led us in a two <em>Rakah </em>optional prayer and Umm Haraam and Umm Sulaym stood behind us.  He made me stand on his right hand side – and according to Thaabit – Anas continued: He led us in an optional prayer on a mat. When he finished his prayer, Umm Sulaym said: I have a specific request, make <em>Dua</em>’ to Allaah for your young servant Anas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> never left anything of good from the<em>Duniya </em>and the Hereafter except that he supplicated it for me, then he <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>O Allaah increase his wealth and offspring and bless it for him.’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘My daughter informed me that I had been provided with some ninety odd offspring from my loins. There was not a man from amongst the Ansaar who had more wealth than me, then Anas said: ‘O Thaabit, I do not own any gold or silver except for my ring.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Abu Dawood, I say that this <em>Isnaad</em> is Saheeh upon the conditions of Muslim. It is also collected by Ahmad &amp; Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the narration of Ahmad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Then the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> supplicated for Umm Sulaym and her family.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the narrator mentions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Anas mentioned that his eldest daughter Ameenah informed him that there were more than one hundred and twenty from his offspring buried when Hajjaj appeared.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Albaani said: that this <em>Isnad</em> of three narrators is authentic upon the conditions of Bukhari &amp; Muslim.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Albaani Commented:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘From the benefits of the hadeeth and its <em>Fiqh</em>:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many benefits in this hadeeth, I will mention some of them briefly, except where detail is necessary:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- That supplicating for increase in wealth and offspring is something which is legislated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari has a chapter heading for this hadeeth: ‘Chapter: Supplicating for blessings in having lots of wealth and offspring.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- And that wealth and offspring are a blessing and goodness if Allaah -Tabaraka wa Ta’ala is obeyed in respect to them. How misguided is the one who tries to limit how many children they have, using so many different means, like birth control or regulating it, let alone aborting the foetus and for the most insignificant reasons, and obtaining <em>Fatawa</em> to make their actions permissible! !</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- Allaah answered the <em>Dua’</em> of His Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> for Anas, and it became reality, until he became the one with the most wealth and offspring from amongst the Ansar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- That it is allowed for the one fasting an optional fast, when he visits a person and food is presented to him that he does not have to break his fast, but he supplicates for the host with goodness. And from the chapters of Bukhari: ‘Chapter whoever visits a people and does not break his fast with them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5- That if a man is led in prayer by another man, he should stand on the right of the one leading the prayer.  What is evident is that he stands right next to him, not forward nor just behind him, because if anything like this ever occurred then the narrator would have narrated it, especially since the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> repeatedly led individual companions in prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a hadeeth of Ibn Abbas regarding this in Saheeh Bukhari and Muslim, and Bukhari brought a chapter heading for the hadeeth of Ibn Abbas, and Muslim brought it from Jabir. The chapter which Bukhari mentions is: ‘Chapter: if there are two people praying then one stands <strong>equal next </strong>to the one leading the prayer.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafidh said in ‘al-Fath’ (2/160):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Regarding the saying of Bukhari: ‘equal’ means that he does not stand forward from the Imam and nor just behind him, it is as if the compiler (Bukhari) indicates to what occurs in some of the narrations from Ibn Abbas with the wording: <strong>‘So I stood next to him’</strong> and that apparently means equal to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And AbdurRazzaq narrates from Ibn Juraij  who said: I said to ‘Atta:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘A man prays along with another man, where should he stand?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘On his right hand side.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I asked: ‘Does he stand equal to him so that he is in line with him and one is not ahead of the other?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘Yes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked: ‘Do you like it that they stand equal so there is no gap between them?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘Yes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In ‘al-Muwatta’ from Abdullaah bin Utbah bin Mas’ood who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I entered upon Umar bin al-Khattab during the morning before <em>Dhur</em> and I found him in<em>Ruku</em> (bowing in the prayer) I stood in prayer behind him, but he brought me forward until he placed me next to him on his right side.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Albaani) say: This Athar in ‘al-Muwatta’ with an authentic chain from Umar <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em>, along with the previously mentioned Ahadeeth are strong proof of the previously mentioned issue of standing equally in the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the saying that it is recommended that the single person following the Imam should stand slightly behind the Imam, as is mentioned by some of the <em>Madhahib</em>(schools of thought), with some of them elaborating about this issue – along with there being no evidence for it from the Sunnah likewise, it also opposes what is apparent from these Ahadeeth, and this narration of Umar, and the previously mentioned statement of ‘Atta and he is the Imam, the noble <em>Taba’ee</em> (Follower of the Companions) Ibn Abee Rabah and likewise it opposes the other statements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is more befitting for the Believer to leave those statements of the <em>Madhahib</em> (schools of thought) to their founders, believing that they are rewarded for it, because they endeavoured and formulated an opinion intending the truth, and it is upon the believer to follow what is established in the Sunnah, since indeed the best guidance is the guidance of the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ vol.1 hadeeth no. 219  p.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His Praise and Blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his  companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">Mu’aawiyah The Scribe of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;<br />
</em>Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> By the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">82 – ‘May Allaah not let his stomach become satisfied;’ i.e. Mu’aawiyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Abu Dawood at-Tayyalisi in his ‘Musnad’ (2746) Hishaam and Abu ‘Awaana narrated to us from Abu Hamza al-Qassaab from Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘That the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> sent someone to Mu’aawiyah to write something for him, and this person said he is eating, then the Messenger sent the person again, and again he said he is eating. Then the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘May Allaah not let his stomach become satisfied.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Albaani) say: This <em>Isnaad</em> is <em>Saheeh</em>, its narrators are all trustworthy, they are the narrators of Imam Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding Abu Hamza al-Qassaab – whose name is Umraan bin Abi ‘Atta – there is some talk about him from some of the scholars but it does not harm him, since a group from the Imams have regarded him as trustworthy, from them is Ahmad and Ibn Ma’een and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who regarded him as weak then they did not clarify the reason, so therefore it is an unknown (<em>Jarh</em>) criticism, which is unacceptable.  It is as if this is why Imam Muslim used him as a narrator and narrated this hadeeth from him in his book ‘Saheeh’ (8/27) from the way of Shu’abah from Abu Hamza al-Qassaab with this hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad narrated this hadeeth (1/240, 291, 335, 338) from Shu’abah and Abu ‘Awaana from Abu Hamza with this hadeeth without the saying: ‘May Allaah not let his stomach become satisfied.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It seems that the hadeeth was summarized by Ahmad or by some of his Shaykhs, and they mentioned an extra wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘. . . .and he was his scribe’,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And its chain is authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the sects took opportunity of this hadeeth, as a way of attacking Mu’aawiyah<em> &#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> but there is nothing in this hadeeth which helps them on this, and how can it, since in the hadeeth it mentions that he was the scribe of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, and this is why al-Hafidh Ibn ‘Aasakir said: (16/349/2):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This is the most authentic narration which has been mentioned about the excellence of Mu’aawiyah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is evident from this supplication from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>is that it was not intentional, rather it is from what is the practice of the Arabs when using certain style of speech unintentionally; such as the statement of the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> regarding some of his wives:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘May you be affected by pain in your throat’[1] [Collected by Bukhari &amp; Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘May your right hand be covered in dust’ [Collected by Bukhari &amp; Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and like his <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> statement in the hadeeth of Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘May your age not increase.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is possible that this statement from the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>about Mu’aawiyah was spurred on by his humanness which he has eloquently mentioned about himself <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> in many reoccurring Ahadeeth, and from them is the hadeeth of ‘Aeysha <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anha</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Two men entered upon the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> they spoke to him about something but I did not know what it was about, and they caused him to get angry, so he <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> cursed them and reviled them, then when they left I asked: ‘O Messenger of Allaah! Good will reach everyone except these two people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger asked: ‘And why is that?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said: ‘You cursed them and reviled them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Did you not know that I have a contract with my Lord? I said: O Allaah indeed I am a human, so any Muslim whom I cursed or reviled, then designate it as charity and a reward for him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ No. 83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Imam Muslim along with the previous hadeeth before this in the chapter entitled:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Chapter: Whoever the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>cursed, reviled or supplicated against and he was not qualified for that; then it is a charity, reward and mercy for that individual.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Imam Muslim narrated here the hadeeth of Anas bin Malik who said: ‘There was an orphan girl with Umm Sulaym, who was called Umm Anas, the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> saw the orphan girl and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Are you her? Verily you have grown up, may your age not lengthen.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the orphan girl went back to Umm Sulaym crying; Umm Sulaym said to her ‘What is wrong young girl?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The young girl said: ‘The Prophet of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> supplicated against me that my age should not ever lengthen.’ Or she said: ‘my generation.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Umm Sulaym went out hastily wrapping her headscarf on her head, until she met the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>, and the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said to her: ‘What is wrong O Umm Sulaym?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She replied: ‘O Prophet of Allaah! Did you supplicate against my orphan girl?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And how is that O Umm Sulaym?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She answered: ‘She claims that you supplicated that her age should not lengthen nor should her generation.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narrator said: The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> laughed then he <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O Sulaym! Did you not know that I have a contract with my Lord that I have a contract with my Lord and I said: Indeed I am a human and I become pleased just like a human becomes pleased, and I get angry just as a human gets angry so whoever from my<em>Ummah</em> whom I supplicated against with a supplication of which he was not deserving, then make that as a purification for him and a charity and a means of coming closer to Allaah on the Day of Judgement?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ Hadeeth No.84]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Imam Muslim follows up this hadeeth with the hadeeth of Mu’aawiyah and with that he completed the chapter.  This was an indication from Imam Muslim <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> that this hadeeth of Mu’aawiyah is from one chapter and has the same meaning, therefore, just like the supplication of the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> does not harm the orphan girl – rather it is a charity and a means of coming closer to Allaah; likewise was the supplication of the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> for Mu’aawiyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam an-Nawawi said in his ‘Explanation of Saheeh Muslim’ (2/325 – Indian Print):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for the supplication upon Mu’aawiyah, then it has two responses:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of which is : that it was said upon the tongue without intent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second: that it was a punishment for Mu’aawiyah for being late, and Muslim <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> understood from this hadeeth <strong>that </strong><strong>Mu’aawiyah</strong><strong> was not deserving</strong> of the supplication upon him, therefore, this is why Imam Muslim entered this hadeeth into this chapter.  Other scholars have placed this hadeeth from the virtues of Mu’aawiyah because in reality this does become a supplication for him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dhahabi indicated to this second meaning, he said in ‘Siyaar ‘Alaam an-Nubala’ (9/171/2):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I say: Perhaps it is said: this is a virtue for Mu’aawiyah due to the saying of the Messenger of Allaah! The one who I cursed or reviled, make that a charity and mercy for him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that the statement of the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> in these Ahadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed I am a human and I become pleased just like a human . . . ; is indeed an explanation for the statement of Allaah Tabaraka wa Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Say, I am only a man like you, to whom has been revealed that your god is one God. &gt;&gt; [Khaf: 110]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps some of those who follow desires and rash emotions hasten to reject the likes of this hadeeth by their claim of veneration for the Prophet <em>–alayhi as-Sallat wa Sallam –</em> and clearing him from having said this statement!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no scope for the likes of this rejection, since verily the hadeeth is <em>Saheeh</em>(authentic), rather we see it as <em>Mutawatir</em> (has recurring chains).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been collected by Muslim from the hadeeth of ‘Aeysha and Umm Sulaym as we have mentioned, and from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah and Jabir <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhuma</em>, and it has been mentioned from the hadeeth of Salman, Anas, Samrah, Abu Tufayl, Abu Sa’eed and other than them. See: ‘Kunz al-‘Amal’ (2/124).<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Veneration of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>is a veneration which is legislated, but it is done with having <em>Eemaan</em> with everything authentically established that came from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, and along with having that<em>Eemaan</em> is him <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>being a slave and Messenger without going to extreme or being negligent.  For he <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>is a human with the testification of the Book and the Sunnah, however he is the chief of the humans and the best of them without exception because of the text of the authentic Ahadeeth, just as the history of his life and his biography indicate to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from what Allaah Ta’ala bestowed him with of noble manners and praiseworthy characteristics, which no human has in entirety as it is completely in the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>and Allaah The Great was truthful when he addressed the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>with His Noble statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; and indeed you are on exalted standard character&gt;&gt; [Qalam:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ vol. 1 hadeeth no 82-84 p.164]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also another hadeeth from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Abu Huraira that the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O Allaah, indeed I make a pledge to You which I won’t break.  Indeed I am a human being; so any believer who I harmed, reviled, cursed or punished; make that as prayer for him, <em>Zakat</em> and a means of being close to You on the Day of Judgement.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Muslim, Ahmad &amp; in Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah No. 3999</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

</em>Taken from the book ‘The Life of the Greatest Man After the Prophets &amp; Messengers: Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq’</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">Compiled By Muhammad Uthmaan al-Anjaaree</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- On the authority of ‘Alee <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>&#8211; who said: If it was that I heard a hadeeth from the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em>then Allaah would cause me to benefit me from it with whatever He willed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If anyone other than myself would narrate to me from the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em>, I would request of him to swear that he heard it and if he swore then I would believe him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Abu Bakr narrated to me, and Abu Bakr spoke the truth, that he heard the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is no-one who commits a sin, then performs <em>Wudu</em> correctly, prays two <em>Rakah</em> and seeks forgiveness from Allaah <em>-Azza wa Jal &#8211;</em>except that he is forgiven.’[0]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- Fatima <em>–RadhiAllaahu anha</em>&#8211; said to Abu Bakr, the <em>Khalifah</em> of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em>: ‘You and what you heard from the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> know better.’[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- ‘Alee <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>&#8211; said to Abu Bakr <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>&#8211; in front of Fatima, the daughter of the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em>: ‘Indeedwe know well, O Abu Bakr, your excellence,’ and he mentioned their relationship with the Messenger of Allaah  <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em>and their rights.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah-</em>: ‘It reached ‘Alee <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>&#8211; that Ibn Sowda’ cursed Abu Bakr and Umar, so he requested his presence.  It was said that he requested him to attendin order to kill him, but Ibn Sowda’ escaped ‘Alee <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Alee <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>&#8211; also said: No-one comes to me, preferring meover Abu Bakr and Umar <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhuma</em>&#8211; except that I will lash him with the punishment of slanderer.[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 – Shaykhul-Islaam &#8211;<em>Rahimullaah-</em> said: ‘Alee –<em>RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>&#8211; named his two sons Abu Bakr and Umar.[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Taken from the Book &#8211; ‘The Narrations Mentioned by Imaams of the Sunnah in the Chapters of <em>‘Aqeedah</em> from the Book ‘<em>Siyaar ‘Alaam an-Nubala</em>’ </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Researched By Jamaal bin Ahmad bin Basheera Baadee  </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Introduction </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Verily Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em> has praised the Companions of His Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> in many places in His noble Book.  He has praised them with the best and most complete of characteristics.  Allaah blessed them with His being pleased with them and with repentance.  He informed them of what He has prepared for them of a generous reward and an eternally great recompense in Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said: &lt;&lt;And the first to embrace Islaam of the <em>Muhâjirûn</em>(those who migrated from Makkah to Al-Madinah) and the <em>Ansaar</em>(the citizens of Al-Madinah who helped and gave aid to the<em>Muhâjirûn</em>) and also those who followed them in Faith, Allaah is well-pleased with them as they are well-pleased with Him.  He has prepared for them Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise) to dwell therein forever.  That is the supreme success.&gt; &gt;[Taubah:100]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said: &lt;&lt; Allaah has forgiven the Prophet, the <em>Muhajirûn</em>(Muslim emigrants who left their homes and came to Al-Madinah) and the <em>Ansaar </em>(Muslims of Al-Madinah) who followed him in the time of distress (Tabûk expedition, etc.), after the hearts of a party of them had nearly deviated (from the Right Path), but He accepted their repentance.  Certainly, He is unto them full of Kindness, Most Merciful. &gt;&gt; [Taubah: 117]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said: &lt;&lt;Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah and those who are with him are severe against disbelievers and merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and falling down prostrate (in prayer), seeking Bounty from Allaah and (His) Good Pleasure.  The mark of them (i.e. of their Faith) is on their faces (foreheads) from the traces of (their) prostration (during prayers). This is their description in the Taurât (Torah) but their description in the Injeel (Gospel) is like a (sown) seed which sends forth its shoot, then makes it strong, then it becomes thick and stands straight on its stem, delighting the sowers that He may enrage the disbelievers with them.  Allaah has promised those among them who believe and do righteous good deeds, forgiveness and a mighty reward (i.e. Paradise). &gt;&gt; [al-Fath: 29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said: &lt;&lt; Not equal among you are those who spent and fought before the conquering (of Makkah) (with those among you who did so later).  Such are higher in degree than those who spent and fought afterwards.  But to all, Allaah has promised the best (reward).  And Allaah is All-Aware of what you do.  &gt;&gt;[al-Hadeed: 10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said:&lt;&lt;(And there is also a share in this booty) for the poor emigrants, who were expelled from their homes and their property, seeking Bounties from Allaah and to please Him and helping Allaah (i.e. helping His religion) and His Messenger.  Such are indeed the truthful (to what they say);-And those who, before them, had homes (in Al-Madinah) and had adopted the Faith, love those who emigrate to them and have no jealousy in their breasts for that which they have been given (from the booty of Banî An-Nadîr) and give them (emigrants) preference over themselves, even though they were in need of that.  And whosoever is saved from his own covetousness, such are they who will be the successful.&gt;&gt;[al-Hashr:8-9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah said, explaining the first <em>Aayah</em>: ‘Allaah made a share of what He mentioned and prepared for the Companions, of Him being pleased with them and Paradise for those who followed the Companions in goodness.’[i]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continues saying:‘So whoever follows the first to embrace Islaam, then he is from them.  They are the best of people after the Prophets.  Indeed the <em>Ummah</em> of Muhammad is the best <em>Ummah</em> that came for the people and the Companions are the best of the <em>Ummah</em>of Muhammad.’[ii] Then he derived from this principle an important issue, which is the obligation of following the Companions in what they were upon of knowledge, action and Deen for the one who wants success and salvation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh-ul-Islaam said: ‘Due to this, knowing the statements of the Companions concerning knowledge, <em>Deen</em> and their actions, is better and more beneficial than knowing the statements and actions in all sciences of the <em>Deen</em> and its actions of those who came later such as in <em>Tafseer</em>, principles of the <em>Deen</em> and its branches, <em>Zuhud</em>, worship, manners, <em>Jihad </em>etc.  This is because the Companions are better than those who came after them as the Book and the Sunnah indicate. So following the Companions is better than following those after them. Having knowledge of their <em>Ijmaa’</em> (consensus) and disputes about knowledge and <em>Deen </em>is better and more beneficial than having knowledge of what is mentioned of the <em>Ijmaa’</em> and disputes of other than them.  This is because their <em>Ijmaa’</em> is nothing other than faultless and if they disputed, then the truth never escaped them.’[iii]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> testified to their goodness and excellence.  He said in a hadeeth which is narrated ofhim by Abdullaah bin Mas’ood <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>: ‘The best of the people[iv] are of my generation, then those who came after them, then those who came after them.  Then there will come a people whose testimony will precede their oath and their making an oath is their testification.’[v]  I</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">maam an-Nawawee <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said: ‘The scholars are in agreement that the best generation is the Messenger’s <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>generation and the meaning here is the Companions.’[vi]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hajr <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said: ‘A generation is a people in one close period of time who participated in a matter from the matters of concern.’ He continues saying:‘The meaning here of ‘the generation of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>’</em> in this hadeeth is the Companions.’[vii]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The noble Companion Abdullaah bin Mas’ood <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> has an amazing statement where he describes the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> saying: ‘Indeed Allaah looked at the hearts of His slaves and He found the heart of Muhammad to be the best of the hearts of His slaves so He chose him for Himself and sent him with His Message.  Then Allaah looked into the hearts of His worshippers after the heart of Muhammad <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>and He found that the hearts of Muhammad’s Companions were the best of the hearts of His worshippers, so He made them the ministers for His Prophet and they fought for His religion.’[viii]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, on the authority of Abdullaah bin Mas’ood <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> who said: ‘Whoever from amongst you wants to follow, then he should follow the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> since their hearts were the most righteous in this <em>Ummah</em>, the deepest in knowledge, the most natural, the most correct in guidance and were in the best condition.  The Companions were people whom Allaah chose to be with His Prophet and to establish His religion.<em>  </em>So know their excellence and follow them in their footsteps, for indeed they were on the correct guidance.’[ix]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jamaah</em> have, during what has passed in history and time, in different places and countries, implemented the command of their Lord <em>–Ta’ala-</em> and the command of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> that they should honour and respect the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> with their hearts and their tongues.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> says: ‘From the principles of <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jamaah</em>: is the honour and veneration in their hearts and on their tongues for the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah  <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em> just as Allaah describes them in His saying:  &lt;&lt; And those who came after them say: ‘Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in Faith and put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed.  Our Lord!  You are indeed full of kindness, Most Merciful.’&gt;&gt; [Hashr: 10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, in obedience to the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> when he said: ‘Do not curse my Companions.  I swear by Him in Whose Hand is my soul, if one of you spent the like of mount Uhud in gold, you would not reach the equivalent of a <em>Mudd</em> (a certain weight) of one of the Companions, not even half a <em>Mudd</em>.’[x]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah</em> accept what is mentioned in the Book, the Sunnah and<em>Ijmaa’</em> regarding their excellence and rank.’[xi]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Rawafidah,[xii] Khawarij[xiii] and Nawaasib[xiv] opposed <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jamaah</em> in this issue; they did not keep to the bequest of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> regarding the rights of his Companions. As for the Rawafidah, they brought the <em>Bida’</em> of (text)that they claimed the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> stated about ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> with which they would not have an excuse to leave the Khilafah of ‘Alee, a statement that he was sinless and whosoever opposed him had committed disbelief.  Then, as a consequence, they made <em>Takfeer</em> of all the Companions except veryfew in number.  They claimed that the Companions hid these statements and changed the religion.  The Rawafidah sought closeness to Allaah – as they claim – by cursing and reviling the Companions <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhum</em>.  Abu Bakr and Umar <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhumaa-</em>received the most of their oppression and extreme lies.[xv]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Khawarij, then they made <em>Takfeer</em> of ‘Uthmaan and ‘Alee and of those who followed them and they also made <em>Takfeer</em> of both groups who took part in the battle of Siffeen.[xvi]  As for the Nawaasib, their evil belief led them to hate ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> and they belittled him.  They exaggerated in this until they accused him of evil, oppression and that he wanted the <em>Duniya.</em> Then their condition and their hatred and enmity continued until they belittled the rest of Ahl ul Bayt (the family of the Prophet), especially al-Hassan bin ‘Alee<em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[v]  Agreed upon, narrated by Bukhari in the beginning of ‘The book of the excellence of the Prophet’s Companions’ in his saheeh. &amp; by Muslim in ‘The book of the excellence of the Companions <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhum’</em> in the chapter ‘Excellence of the Companions then those after them, then those after them.’</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[ix] Narrated by Ibn AbdulBarr in ‘Jamia Bayaan al-Ilm wa Fadleehi’2/97.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[x] Narrated by Muslim in ‘The book of the excellence of the Companions <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhum-</em>. Chapter: TheProhibition of Cursing the Companions <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhum-</em>. 4/1967</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[xi]  ‘Majmoo al-Fatawa’3/152</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[xii]  Shaykhul-Islaam said: ‘From the time Zayd rebelled, the Shia split into the Rafidah and the Zaydeeyah. When Zayd was asked about Abu Bakr and Umar he said ‘May Allaah have mercy upon them,’ and the people rejected him.  He said to them: Rafadtumoonee (you have rejected me) so they were called the Rafidah, because they rejected him. Those who did not reject him from the Shia were called Zaydeeyah, since they ascribed themselves to him.’(Minhaaj as-Sunnah) 1/35.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This clarifies for us that the reason for them being Rafidah was their hatred for Abu Bakr &amp; Umar <em>–RadhiAllaahu</em> anhumaa<em>&#8211;</em>, their cursing them and not accepting them as leaders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullaah bin Ahmad said: ‘I asked my father: ‘Who is a Rafidee?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘He who curses Abu Bakr and Umar.’ narrated by al-Khalaal in ‘as-Sunnah’p.492.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[xiii] They were given this title because they rebelled against the Imam ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>.  From the most important of their beliefs is: making Takfeer of people who commit major sins, they say that these people will be in the Hell-fire eternally.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They also say that the Khilafah can be from other than the Quraish.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They make Takfeer of ‘Uthmaan, ‘Alee, Talha, Zubair and ‘Aeysha <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhum-</em> they also call forrebellion against evil leaders, they are many different sects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(See: ‘Makaalaat al-Islaameeyeen’ by ‘Ashaari 1/189, &amp; ‘al-Farq bayn al-Firq’by Bagdadi p.55 &amp; p.97.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[xiv] Nawaasib: They are those who openly declare Ahl-ul-Bayt to be enemies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[xv]  See: ‘Majmoo al-Fatawa’ 3/356.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[xvi] ‘Majmoo al-Fatawa’ &amp; ‘al-Khuttat al-Miqreezeeyah’ 2/354.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a small treatise entitled <b>“<i>’Aqeedatu Ahlis-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah fis-Sahaabat-il-Kiraam</i>”</b> (The Creed of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah concerning the Companions) written by Shaikh ‘Abdul-Muhsin Al-‘Abbaad. The source for this treatise was an article the Shaikh wrote for the Islamic University of Madeenah Newsletter (Issue 2 of their fourth year) Shawaal 1391H. This article was distributed together with a transcribed lecture from the Shaikh entitled “Sending Salaat on the Prophet” in a booklet published by the Islamic University of Madeenah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this brief presentation, Shaikh Al-‘Abbaad, one of the senior scholars and a Muhaddith in Saudi Arabia, may Allaah preserve him, outlines the proper belief a Muslim should have with regard to the Companions, and that is of moderateness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Muslim should not go to either extreme of being fanatical towards individuals amongst the Companions or being lenient and heedless about the rights they deserve. Rather, it is upon the believer, the adherent of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, to have love and respect for all of them, as well as to acknowledge their virtues and refrain from mentioning their errors and mishaps. The Shaikh presents the material in a concise but educational manner, quoting numerous ayaat, ahaadeeth and statements of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The <i>madh-hab</i> of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah concerning the Companions is that of moderateness between the two ends of extremism and heedlessness. It is moderateness amidst the extremist fanatics who elevate the esteemed ones amongst them to a level that is only befitting for Allaah or for His messengers and moderateness amidst the heedless and harsh ones who belittle and revile them. So they are in the middle between those who are excessive and those who fall short &#8211; they love all of them and put each one of them in the due place that they deserve, with fairness and justice. So they do not elevate them to a level they don’t deserve, nor do they belittle them, taking away what they are worthy of. Their tongues are moist with mentioning them only in good, according to what is befitting for them. And their hearts are filled with love for them.“</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And whatever disputes and differences that occurred between (some of) them, that can be authentically confirmed, we hold that they were Mujtahideen in that regard – either they were correct and will receive one reward for their Ijtihaad and one reward for being correct, or they were wrong and will receive just one reward for their Ijtihaad while their error will be forgiven. They were not infallible since they were human beings. At times they were correct and at times they erred. But how much more were they correct as compared to others being correct, and how fewer were their errors as compared to the errors of others? And on top of this, they will receive Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness and contentment.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;These are five examples from the sayings of the Salaf As-Saalih (righteous predecessors), which demonstrate what we are obligated to believe in with respect to the best of creation after the Prophets and Messengers. One thing we must understand is that defaming these chosen and unique individuals is equal to defaming the Religion itself, since it was none other than them who passed the Religion down to those who came after them. And we already mentioned the words of Abu Zur&#8217;ah, in which he said: &#8216;The only ones who brought this Qur&#8217;aan and Sunan (plural of Sunnah) to us are the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger. (So) they only wish to disparage and demolish our witnesses so that they can nullify the Book and the Sunnah, whereas they are more deserving of being disparaged for they are the heretics (<i>zanaadiqah</i>).'&#8221;</p>

I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, if one amongst them were to see at his feet he would have surely seen us. Thereupon he said: Abu Bakr, what can befall twain who have Allah as the third One with them.</p>

Thereupon Abu Bakr wept and he wept bitterly and said: Let our fathers and our mothers be taken as ransom for you. It was Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) who had been given the choice and Abu Bakr knew it better than us, and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) is reported to have said: Behold, of all people the most generous toward me in regard to his companionship and his property was Abu Bakr and were I to choose anyone as my bosom friend, I would have chosen Abu Bakr as my dear friend, but (for him) I cherish Islamic brotherliness and love. There shall be left open no window in the mosque except Abu Bakr&#8217;s window.</p>

I came and said: Get in, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) gives you the glad tidings of Paradise along with the trial which you shall have to face. He got in and saw the elevated plan round the well fully occupied. He sat on the other side. Sharik said that Sa&#8217;id b. al-Musayyib reported: I drew a conclusion from it that their groves would be (in this very state, the graves of Hadrat Abu Bakr, &#8216;Umar Faruq by the tide of the Holy Prophet [may peace be upon him] and the grave of Hadrat &#8216;Uthman away from their graves).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Musa. reported: I set out with the intention (of meeting) Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and came to know that he had gone to the gardens (in the suburb of Medina). I followed him and found him in a garden sitting upon an elevated place round the well with his shanks uncovered which had been dangling in the well. The rest of the hadith is the same but with this variation that there is no mention of the words of Sa&#8217;id: all drew a conclusion from it pertaining to their graves.&#8221;</p>

I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) say about &#8216;Ali as he left behind hrin in one of his campaigns (that was Tabuk). &#8216;All said to him: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, you leave me behind along with women and children.

He (the narrator) said: We have been anxiously waiting for it, when he (the Holy Prophet) said: Call &#8216;Ali. He was called and his eyes were inflamed. He applied saliva to his eyes and handed over the standard to him, and Allah gave him victory. (The third occasion is this) when the (following) verse was revealed:&#8221; Let us summon our children and your children.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) called &#8216;Ali, Fitima, Hasan and Husain and said: O Allah, they are my family.</p>

He exhorted (us) (to hold fast) to the Book of Allah and then said: The second are the members of my household I remind you (of your duties) to the members of my family. He (Husain) said to Zaid: Who are the members of his household? Aren&#8217;t his wives the members of his family? Thereupon he said: His wives are the members of his family (but here) the members of his family are those for whom acceptance of Zakat is forbidden. And he said: Who are they?

<p style="text-align:justify;">Mus&#8217;ab b. Sa&#8217;d reported on the authority of his father that many verses of the Qur&#8217;an had been revealed in connection with him. His mother Umm Sa&#8217;d had taken oath that she would never talk with him until he abandoned his faith and she neither ate nor drank and said: Allah has commanded you to treat well your parents and I am your mother and I command you to do this. She passed three days in this state until she fainted because of extreme hunger and at that time her son whose name was Umara stood up and served her drink and she began to curse Sa&#8217;d that Allah, the Exalted and Glorions, revealed these verses of the Holy Qur&#8217;an:&#8221; And We have enjoined upon a person goodness to his parents but if they contend with thee to associate (others) with Me of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not&#8221; (xxix. 8) ; Treat thein with customary good in this world&#8221; (xxxi. 15). He also reported that there fell to the lot of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) huge spoils of war and there was one sword in them. I picked that up and came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Bestow this sword upon me (as my share in the spoils of war) and you know my state. Thereupon he said: Return it to the place from where you picked it up. I went back until I decided to throw it in a store but my soul repulsed me so I came back and asked him to give that sword to me. He said in a loud voice to return it to the place from where I had picked it up. It was on this occasion that this verse was revealed:&#8221; They asked about the spoils of war&#8221; (viii. 1). He further said: I once fell ill and sent a message to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him). He visited me and I said to him: Permit me to distribute (in charity) my property as much as I like. He did not agree. I said: (Permit me to distribute) half of it. He did not agree. I said: (Permit me to distribute) the third part, whereupon he kept quiet and it was after this (that the distribution of one&#8217;s property in charity) to the extent of one-third was held valid. He further said: I came to a group of persons of the Ansir and Muhajirin and they said: Come, so that we may serve you wine, and it was before the use of wine had been prohibited. I went to them in a garden and there had been with them the roasted head of a camel and a small water-skin containing wine. I ate and drank along with them and there came under discussion the Ansr (Helpers) and Muhajirin (immigrants). I said: The immigrants are better than the Ansar, that a person picked up a portion of the head (of the camel and struck me with it that my nose was injured. I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and informed him of the situation that Aliah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed verses pertaining to wine:&#8221; Intoxicants and the games of chance and (sacrificing to) stones set up and (divining by) arrows are only an uncleanliness, the devil&#8217;s work&#8221; (v. 90).</p>

When he felt relief his eyes were fixed at the ceiling. He then said: O Allah, along with the high companions (i. e. along with the Apostles who live in the most elevated place of the Paradise). (On hearing these words), I then said (to myself) He is not going to opt us and I remembered a hadith which he had narrated to us as he was healthy and in which he said: No prophet dies until he sees his abode in Paradise, he is then given a choice. &#8216;A&#8217;isha said: These were the last words which Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) spoke (the words are): O Allah, with companions on High.</p>

Once this lot came out in my favour and that of Hafsa. They (Hafsi, and &#8216;A&#8217;isha) both went along with him and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) used to travel (on camel) when it was night along with &#8216;A&#8217;isha and talked with her.

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;A&#8217;isha reported that (one day) there sat together eleven women making an explicit promise amongst themselves that they would conceal nothing about their spouses. The first one said: My husband is a sort of the meat of a lean camel placed at the top of a hill, which it is difficult to climb up, nor (the meat) is good enough that one finds in oneself the urge to take it away (from the top of that mountain).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second one said: My husband (is so bad) that I am afraid I would not be able to describe his faults-both visible and invisible completely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third one said: My husband is a long-statured fellow (i. e. he lacks intelligence). If I give vent to my feelings about him, he would divorce me, and if I keep quiet I would be made to live in a state of suspense (neither completely abandoned by him nor entertained as wife).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth one said: My husband is like the night of Tihama (the night of Hijaz and Mecca), neither too cold nor hot, neither there is any fear of him nor grief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fifth one said: My husband is (like) a leopard as he enters the house, and behaves like a lion when he gets out, and he does not ask about that which he leaves in the house.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sixth one said: So far as my husband is concerned, he eats so much that nothing is left back and when he drinks he drinks that no drop is left behind. And when he lies down he wraps his body and does not touch me so that he may know my grief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The seventh one said: My husband is heavy in spirit, having no brightness in him, impotent, suffering from all kinds of conceivable diseases, heaving such rough manners that he may break my head or wound my body, or may do both.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eighth one said: My husband is as sweet as the sweet-smelling plant, and as soft as the softness of the hare.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ninth one said: My husband is the master of a lofty building, long-statured, having heaps of ashes (at his door) and his house is near the meeting place and the inn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tenth one said: My husband is Malik, and how fine Malik is, much above appreciation and praise (of mine). He has many folds of his camel, more in number than the pastures for them. When they (the camels) hear the sound of music they become sure that they are going to be slaughtered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eleventh one said: My husband is Abu Zara&#8217;. How fine Abu Zara&#8217; is! He has suspended in my ears heavy ornaments and (fed me liberally) that my sinews and bones are covered with fat. So he made me happy. He found me among the shepherds living in the side of the mountain, and he made me the owner of the horses, camels and lands and heaps of grain and he finds no fault with me. I sleep and get up in the morning (at my own sweet will) and drink to my heart&#8217;s content. The mother of Abu Zara&#8217;, how fine is the mother of Abu Zara&#8217;! Her bundles are heavily packed (or receptacles in her house are filled to the brim) and the house quite spacious. So far as the son of Abu Zara&#8217; is concerned, his bed is as soft as a green palm-stick drawn forth from its bark, or like a sword drawn forth from its scabbard, and whom just an arm of a lamb is enough to satiate. So far as the daughter of Abu Zara&#8217; is concerned, how fine is the daughter of Abu Zara&#8217;, obedient to her father, obedient to her mother, wearing sufficient flesh and a source of jealousy for her co-wife. As for the slave-girl of Abu Zara&#8217;, how fine is she; she does not disclose our affairs to others (outside the four walls of the house). She does not remove our wheat, or provision, or take it forth, or squander it, but she preserves it faithfully (as a sacred trust). And she does not let the house fill with rubbish. One day Abu Zara&#8217; went out (of his house) when the milk was churned in the vessels, that he met a woman, having two children like leopards playing with her pomegranates (chest) under her vest. He divorced me (Umm Zara&#8217;) and married that woman (whom Abu Zara&#8217;) met on the way. I (Umm Zara&#8217;) later on married another person, a chief, who was an expert rider, and a fine archer: he bestowed upon me many gifts and gave me one pair of every kind of animal and said: Umm Zara&#8217;, make use of everything (you need) and send forth to your parents (but the fact) is that even if I combine all the gifts that he bestowed upon me, they stand no comparison to the least gift of Abu Zara&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;A&#8217;isha reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to me: I am for you as Abu Zara&#8217; was for Umm Zara&#8217;.</p>

By Allah, if you give that to me, no one would be able to take it away, so long as there is life in me. Verily &#8216;Ali b.

He took it and drank water. She then embellished herself which she did not do before. He (Abu Talha) had a sexual intercourse with her and when she saw that he was satisfied after sexual intercourse with her, she said: Abu Talha, if some people borrow something from another family and then (the members of the family) ask for its return, would they resist its return?

Abu Talha said: O Lord, you know that I love to go along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger when he goes out and enter along with him when he enters and I have been detained as Thou seest. Umm Sulaim said: Abu Talha, I do not feel (so much pain) as I was feeling formerly, so better proceed on. So we proceeded on and she felt the pangs of delivery as they reached (Medina) and a child was born and my mother said to me: Anas, none should suckle him until you go to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) tomorrow morning.

He laid down that instrument on the ground. I brought that child to him and placed it in his lap and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) asked Ajwa dates of Medina to be brought and softened them in his month. When these had become palatable he placed them in the mouth of that child. The child began to taste them.

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah b. Samit reported that Abu Dharr said: We set out from our tribe Ghafir who look upon the prohibited months as permissible months. I and my brother Unais and our mother stayed with our maternal uncle who treated us well. The men of his tribe fell jealous and they said: When you are anay from your house, Unais commits adultery with your wife. Our -naternal uncle came and he accused us of the sin which was conveyed to him. I said: You have undone the good you did to us. We cannot stay with you after this. We came to our camels and loaded (our) luggage. Our maternal uncle began to weep covering himself with (a piece of) cloth. We proceeded on until we encamped by the side of Mecca. Unais cast lot on the camels (we had) and an equal number (above that). They both went to a Kahin and he made Unais win and Unais came with our camels and an equal number along with them. He (Abu Dharr) said: My nephew, I used to observe prayer three years before my meeting with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). I said: For whom did you say prayer? He said: For Allah. I said: To which direction did you turn your face (for observing prayer)? He said: I used to turn my face as Allah has directed me to turn my face. I used to observe the night prayer at the time of the end of night and I fell down in prostration like the mantle until the sun rose over me. Unais said: I have a work in Mecca, so you better stay here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unais went until he came to Mecca and he came to me late. I said: What did you do? He said: I met a person in Mecca who is on your religion and he claims that verily it is Allah Who has sent him. I said: What do the people say about him? He said: They say that he is a poet or a Kahin or a magician. Unais who was himself one of the poets said. I have heard the words of a Kahin but his words in no way resemble his (words). And 1 also compared his words to the verses of poets but such words cannot be uttered by any poet. By Allah, he is truthful and they are liars. Then I said: you stay here, until I go, so that I should see him. He said: I came to Mecca and I selected an insignificant person from amongst them and said to him: Where is he whom you call as-Sabi? He pointed out towards me saying: He is Sabi. Thereupon the people of the valley attacked me with sods and bows until I fell down unconscious. I stood up after havin. regained my consciousness and I found as if I was a red idol. I came to Zamzarn and washed blood from me and drank water from it and listen, O son of my brother, I stayed there for thirty nights or days and there was no food for me but the water of Zamzarn. And I became so bulky that there appeared wrinkles upon my stomach, and I did not feel any hunger in my stomach. It was during this time that the people of Mecca slept in the moonlit night and none was there to eircumambulate the House but only two women who had been invoking the name of Isafa, and Na&#8217;ila (the two idols).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They came to me while in their circuit and I said: Marry one with the other, but they did not dissuade from their invoking. They came to me and I said to them: Insert wood (in the idols&#8217; private parts). (I said this to them in such plain words) as I could not express in metaphorical terms. These women went away crying and saying: Had there been one amongst our people (he would have taught a lesson to you for the obscene words used for our idols before us). These women met Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and Abu Bakr who had also been coming down the hill. He asked them: What has happened to you? They said: There is Sabi, who has hidden himself between the Ka&#8217;ba and its curtain. He said: What did he say to you? They said: He uttered such words before us as we cannot express. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came and he kissed the Black Stone and circumambulated the House along with his Companion and then observed prayer, and when he had finished his prayer, Abu Dharr said: I was the first to greet him with the salutation of peace and uttered (these words) in this way; Allah&#8217;s Messen- ger, may there be peace upon you, whereupon he said: It may be upon you too and the mercy of Allah. He then said: Who are you? I said: From the tribe of Ghifar. He leaned his hand and placed his finger on his forehead and I said to myself: Perhaps he has not liked it that I belong to the tribe of Ghifar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I attempted to catch hold of his hand but his friend who knew about him more than I dissuaded me f rom doing so. He then lifted his head and said: Since how long have you been here? I said: I have been here for the last thirty nights or days. He said: Who has been feeding you? I said: There has been no food for me but the water of Zamzam. I have grown so bulky that there appear wrinkles upon my stomach and I do not feel any hunger. He said: It is blessed (water) and it also serves as food. Thereupon Abu Bakr said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, let me serve as a host to him for tonight, and then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) proceeded forth and so did Abu Bakr and I went along with them. Abu Bakr opened the door and then he brought for us the raisins of Ta&#8217;if and that was the first food which I ate there. Then I stayed as long as I had to stay. I then came to Allah&#8217;s Messenaer (may peace be upon him) and he said: I have been shown the land abound- ing in trees and I think it cannot be but that of Yathrib (that is the old name of Medina). You are a preacher to your people on my behalf. I hope Allah would benefit them through you and He would reward you. I came to Unais and he said: What have you done? I said: I have done that I have embraced Islam and I have testified (to the prophethood of Allah&#8217;s Messenger). He said: I have no aversion for your religion and I also embrace Islam and testify (to the prophethood of Muhammad). Then both of us came to our mother and she said: I have no aversion for your religion and I also embrace Islam and testify to the prophethood of Muhammad. We then loaded our camels and came to our tribe Ghifir and half of the tribe embraced Islam and their chief was Aimi&#8217; b. Rahada Ghifirl and he was their leader and hall of the tribe said: We will embrace Islam when Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may p,. ace be upon him) would come to Medina, and when Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to Medina the remaining half also embraced Islam. Then a tribe Aslam came to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, we also embrace Islam like our brothers who have embraced Islam. And they also embraced Islam. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Allah granted pardon to the tribe of Ghifar and Allah saved (from destruction) the tribe of Aslam.</p>

Listen to his words and then come to me. So he rode on until he came to Mecca and he heard his words (the sacred words of the Holy Prophet) and then came back to Abu Dharr and said: I have seen him exhorting (people) to develop good morals and his expressions can in no way be termed as poetry. He (Abu Dharr) said: I have not been satisfied with it regarding that which I had in my mind (as I sent you). So he took up provisions for the journey and a small water-skin con- taining water (and set forth) until he came to Mecca.

He then brought the water and his provisions to the mosque and spent a day there, but he did not see Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) until it was night. He then returned to his bed that there happened to pass &#8216;Ali and he said: This man has not been able to find his destination until this time. He made him stand and he went with him and no one made an in- quiry from his companion about anything. And when it was the third day he did the same. &#8216;Ali made him stand up and brought him along with him. He said: By Him, besides Whom there is no god, why don&#8217;t you tell me (the reason) which brought you here to this town? He said: (I shall do this) provided you hold me promise and a covenant that you would guide me aright. He then did that. He (&#8216;Ali) said: Verily, he Is truthful and he is a Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and when it is morning, follow me and if I would say anything from which I would sense fear about you I would stand (in a manner) as if I was throwing water and if I move on, you then follow me until I get in (some house). He did that and I followed him until he came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him).

Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said unto me: Will you rid me of Dhu&#8217;l-Khalasah and so I went forth at the head of 350 horsemen of the tribe of Ahmas and we destroyed it and killed whomsoever we found there.

I followed him and he got into his house and I also got in and we began to converse with each other. And when he became familiar (with me) I said to Him: When you entered (the mosque) before (your entrance in the house) a person said so and so (that you are amongst the people of Paradise), whereupon he said: It is not meet for anyone to say anything which he does not know. I shall (now) tell you why they (say) this. I saw a dream during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and narrated it to him. I seemed to be in a garden [he described its vastness, its rich fructification and its verdure]; in the midst of it, there stood an iron pillar, with its base in the earth and its summit in the sky: and upon its summit there was a handhold. It was said to me: Climb up this (pillar). I said to him (visitant in the dream): I am unable to do it. Thereupon a helper came to me, and he (supported) me (by catching hold of my) garment from behind and thus helped me with his hand and so I climbed up till I was at the summit of the pillar, and grasped the handhold. It was said to me: Ho d it tightly. It was at this that I woke up when (the handhold) was in fthe grip) of my hand.

Thereupon he said to me Do not set yourself on (them) for these are the paths of the leftists (denizens of Hell-fire). Then there were paths leading to the right side, whereupon he said: Set yourself on these paths. We came across a hill and he said to me: Climb up, and I attempted to climb up that I fell upon my buttocks. I made several attempts (but failed to succeed). He led until he came to a pillar (so high) that its upper end touched the sky and its base was in the earth. And there was a handhold at its upper end. He said to me Climb over it. I said: How can I climb upon it, as its upper end touches the sky? He cought hold of my hand and pushed me up and I found myself suspended with the handhold. He then struck the pillar and it fell down, but I remained attached to that handhold until it was morning (and the dream was thus over). I came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and narrated it to him. He said: So far as the paths which you saw on your left are concerned, these are paths of the leftists (denizens of Hell) and the paths which you saw on your right, these are the paths of the rightists (the dwellers of Paradise) and the mountain represents the destination of the martyrs which you would not be able to attain. The pillar implies the pillar of Islam. and so far as the handhold is concerned, it implies the handhold of Islam, and you would hold to it fastly until you would meet death.</p>

My mother heard the noise of my footsteps and she said: Abu Huraira, just wait, and I heard the noiee of falling of water. She took a bath and put on the shirt and quickly covered her head with a headdress and opened the door and then said: Abu Huraira, I bear witness to the fact that there is no god but Allah and Mubammad is His bondsman and His Messenger. He (Abu Huraira) said: I went back to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and (this time) I was shedding the tears of joy. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, be happy, for Allah has responded to your supplication and He has set on the right path the mother of Abu Huraira. He (the Holy Prophet) praised Allah, and extolled Him and uttered good words. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, supplicate to Allah so that He may instil love of mine and that of my mother too in the believing servants and let our hearts be filled with their love, whereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: O Allah, let there be love of these servants of yours, i. e.

I was hearing while I was engaged in extolling Allah (reciting Subhan Allah) constantly. He stood up before I finished my repetition of Subhan Allah. if I were to meet him I would have warned him in stern words that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) did not speak so quickly as you talk. Ibn Shihab transmitted on the authority of Ibn Musayyib that Abu Huraira said: People say that Abu Huraira transmits so many ahadith, whereas Allah is the Reckoner, and they say: How is it with Muhajirs and the Ansar that they do not narrate ahadith like him (like Abu Huraira)? Abu Huraira said: I tell you that my brothers from Ansar remained busy with their lands and my brothers Muhajirs were busy in transactions in the bazars, but I always kept myself attached to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) with bare subsistence. I remained present (in the company of the Holy Prophet), whereas they had been absent. I retained in my mind (what the Holy Prophet said), whereas they forgot it.

So I spread my mantle and when he had concluded his talk I then pressed it against my chest and so I never forgot after that day anything that he (the Holy Prophet) said.

He stopped and I had an encounter with him and we exchanged the strokes of (swords). I struck him with the sword and killed him. Then I came back to Abu Amir and said: Verily Allah has killed the one who killed you. And he said: Now draw out this arrow. I drew out the arrow and there came out from that (wound) water. Abu &#8216;Amir said: My nephew, go to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and convey my greetings to him and tell him that Abu Amir begs you to ask forgiveness for him. And Abu Amir appointed me as the chief of the people and he died after a short time. When I came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) I visited him and he had been lying on the cot woven by strings and there was (no) bed over it and so there had been marks of the strings on the back of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and on his sides. I narrated to him what had happened to us and narrated to him about Abu Amir and said to him that he had made a request to the effect that forgiveness should be sought for him (from Allah). Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be. upon him) called for water and performed ablution with it. He then lifted his hands and said. O Allah, grant pardon to Thy servant Abu Amir. (The Holy Prophet had raised his hands so high for supplication) that I saw the whiteness of his armpits. He again said: O Allah, grant him distinction amongst the majority of Thine created beings or from amongst the people. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, ask forgiveness for me too. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: Allah, forgive the sins of Abdullah b. Qais (Abu Musa Ash&#8217;ari) and admit him to an elevated place on the Day of Resurrection. Abu Burda said: One prayer is for abu &#8216;Amir and the other is tor Abu Musa.</p>

And I was accompanied by two brothers of mine, I being the youngest of them; one of them was Abu Burda and the other one was Abu Ruhm, and there were some other persons with them. Some say they were fifty-three or fifty-two persons of my tribe. We embarked upon a boat, and the boat sailed away to the Negus of Abyssinia. There we met Ja&#8217;far b. Abu Talib and his companions. Ja&#8217;far said: Allall&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has sent us here and has commanded us to stay here and you should also stay with us. So we stayed with him and we came back (to Medina) and met Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) when Khaibar had been conquered. He (the Holy Prophet) allocated a share to us and in the ordinary course he did not allocate the share to one who had been absent on the occasion of the conquest of Khaibar but conferred (a share) upon him only who had been present there with him. He, however, made an exception for the people of the boat, viz. for Ja&#8217;far and his companions. He allocated a share to them, and some persons from amongst the people said to us, viz. the people of the boat: We have preceded you in migration. Asma&#8217; bint &#8216;Umais who had migrated to Abyssinia and had come back along with them (along with immigrants) visited Hafsa, the wife of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him). (Accordingly), Umar had been sitting with her (Hafsa). As &#8216;Umar saw Asma, he said: Who is she? She (Hafsa) said: She is Asma, daughter of &#8216;Umais. He said: She is an Abyssinian and a sea-woman. Asma said: Yes, it is so. Thereupon &#8216;Umar said: We preceded you in migration and so we have more right to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as compared with you. At this she felt annoyed and said: &#8216;Umar, you are not stating the fact; by Allah, you had the privilege of being in the company of the Messenger (may peace be upon him) who fed the hungry among you and instructed the ignorant amongst you, whereas we had been far (from here) in the land of Abyssinia amongst the enemies and that was all for Allah and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and, by Allah, I would never take food nor take water unless I make a mention to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) of what you have said. We remained in that country in constant trouble and dread and I shall talk about it to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (way peace be upon him) and ask him (about it). By Allah, I shall not tell a lie and deviate (from the truth) and add anything to that. So, when Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) came, she said: Allah&#8217;s Apostle, &#8216;Umar says so and so. Upon this Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: His right is not more than yours, for him and his companions there is one migration, but for you, i. e. for the people of the boat, there are two migrations. She said: I saw Abu Musa and the people of the boat coming to me in groups and asking me about this hadith, because there was nothing more pleasing and more significant for them than this. Abu Burda reported that Asma said: I saw Abu Musa, asking me to repeat this hadith to him again and again.</p>

We then said: If we sit (along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger) and observe night prayer with him it would be very good, so we sat down and he came to us and said: You are still sitting here.

He then lifted his head towards the sky and it often happened that as he lifted his head towards the sky, he said: The stars are a source of security for the sky and when the stars disappear there comes to the sky, i. e. (it meets the same fate) as it has been promised (it would plunge into darkness). And I am a source of safety and security to my Companions and when I would go away there would fall to the lot (of my Companions) as they have been promised with and my Companions are a source of security for the Umma and as they would go there would fall to the lot of my Umma as (its people) have been promised.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Usair b. Jabir reported that when people from Yemen came to help (the Muslim army at the time of jihad) he asked them: Is there amongst you Uwais b. &#8216;Amir? (He continued finding him out) until he met Uwais. He said: Are you Uwais b., Amir? He said: Yes. He said: Are you from the tribe of Qaran? He said: Yes. He (Hadrat) &#8216;Umar (again) said: Did you suffer from leprosy and then you were cured from it but for the space of a dirham? He said: Yes. He (&#8216;Umar) said: Is your mother (living)? He said: Yes. He (&#8216;Umar) said: I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) say: There would come to you Uwais b. Amir with the reinforcement from the people of Yemen. (He would be) from Qaran, (the branch) of Murid. He had been suffering from leprosy from which he was cured but for a spot of a dirham. His treatment with his mother would have been excellent. If he were to take an oath in the name of Allah, He would honour that. And if it is possible for you, then do ask him to beg forgiveness for you (from your Lord). So he (Uwais) begged forgiveness for him. Umar said: Where do you intend to go? He said: To Kufa. He (&#8216;Umar) said: Let me write a letter for you to its governor, whereupon he (Uwais) said: I love to live amongst the poor people. When it was the next year, a person from among the elite (of Kufa) performed Hajj and he met Umar. He asked him about Uwais. He said: I left him in a state with meagre means of sustenance. (Thereupon) Umar said: I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: There would come to you Uwais b. &#8216;Amir, of Qaran, a branch (of the tribe) of Murid, along with the reinforcement of the people of Yemen. He had been suffering from leprosy which would have been cured but for the space of a dirham. His treatment with his mother would have been very kind. If he would take an oath in the name of Allah (for something) He would honour it. Ask him to beg forgiveness for you (from Allah) in case it is possible for you. So he came to Uwais and said.: Beg forgiveness (from Allah) for me. He (Uwais) said: You have just come from a sacred journey (Hajj) ; you, therefore, ask forgiveness for me. He (the person who had performed Hajj) said: Ask forgiveness for me (from Allah). He (Uwais again) said: You have just come from the sacred journey, so you ask forgiveness for me. (Uwais further) said: Did you meet Umar? He said: Yes. He (Uwais) then begged forgiveness for him (from Allah). So the people came to know about (the status of religious piety) of Uwais. He went away (from that place). Usair said: His clothing consisted of a mantle, and whosoever saw him said: From where did Uwais get this mantle?</p>

The Quraish passed by it and other people too, that Abdullah b. Umar happened to pass by it. He stood up there and said: May there be peace upon you, Abu Khubaib (the Kunya of Hadrat &#8216;Abdullah b. Zubair), may there be peace upon you Abu Khubaib, may there be peace upon you, Abu Khubaib! By Allah, I used to forbid you from this; by Allah, I used to forbid you from this, by Allah I used to forbid you from this. By Allah, so far as I know, you had been very much devoted to fasting and prayer and you had been paying very much care to cementing the ties of blood. By Allah, the group to which you belong (are labelled) as (a) wicked (person) is indeed a fine group. Then &#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Umar went away. The stand &#8216;Abdullah (b. &#8216;Umar) took in regard to the inhuman treatment (meted out to &#8216;Abdullah b. Zubair) and his words (in that connection) were conveyed to Hajjaj (b. Yusuf) and (as a consequence of that) he (the body of Abdullah b. Zubair) was brought down from the stump (the scaffold) by which it was hanging and thrown into the graves of the Jews. He (Hajjaj) sent (his messenger) to Asma&#8217; (bint Abu Bakr, &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s mother). But she refused to come. He again sent the messenger to her with the message that she must come, otherwise he would bring her forcibly catching hold of her hair. But she again refused and said: By Allah, I will not come to you until you send one to me who would drag me by pulling my hair. Thereupon he said: Bring me my shoes. He put on his shoes and walked on quickly swollen with vanity and pride until he came to her and said: How do you find what I have done with the enemy of Allah? She said: I find that you wronged him in this world, whereas he has spoiled your next life. It has been conveyed to me that you used to call him (&#8216;Abdullah b. Zubair) as the son of one having two belts. By Allah, I am indeed (a woman) of two belts. One is that with the help of which I used to suspend high the food of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and that of Abu Bakr (making it out of the reach) of animals and, so far as the second belt is concerned, that is the belt which no woman can dispense with. Verily Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) told us that in Thaqif, there would be born a great liar and great murderer. The liar we have seen, and as far as the murderer is concerned, I do not find anyone else besides you. &#8216;Thereupon he (Hajjaj) stood up and did not give any reply to her.</p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said. Make an assessment (of the price of its fruit). And Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) also made an assessment and it was ten wasqs. He asked that lady (to calculate the amount) until they would, God willing, come back to her. So we proceeded on until we came to Tabuk and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: The violent storm will overtake you during the night, so none amongst you should stand up and he who has a camel with him should hobble it firmly. A violent storm blew and a person who had stood up was carried away by the storm and thrown between the mountains of Tayy. Then the messenger of the son of al &#8216;Alma&#8217;, the ruler of Aila, came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) with a letter and a gift of a white mule. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) wrote him (the reply) and presented him a cloak. We came back until we halted in the Wadi al-Qura. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) asked that lady about her garden and the price of the fruits in that. She said: Ten wasqs. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: I am going to depart, and he who amongst you wishes may depart with me but he who wants to stay may stay. We resumed the journey until we came to the outskirts of Medina. (It was at this time) that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: This is Taba, this is Uhud, that is a mountain which loves us and we love it, and then said: The best amongst the houses of the Ansar is the house of Bani Najjar. Then the house of Bani Abd al-Ashhal, then the house of Bani Abd al-Harith b. Khazraj, then the house of Bani Sa&#8217;ida, and there is goodness in all the houses of the Ansar. Said b. Ubada came to us and Abu Usaid said to him: Did you not see that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has declared the houses of the Ansar good and he has kept us at the end. Said met Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, you have declared the house of the Ansar as good and have kept us at the end, whereupon he said: Is it not enough for you that you have been counted amongst the good.</p>

Neither water is retained in it, nor is the grass grown in it.

He had come in a land inhabited by haughty and cruel men along with Sara. She was very good-looking amongst the people, so he said to her: If these were to know that you are my wife they would snatch you away from me, so if they ask you tell that you are my sister and in fact you are my sister in Islam, and I do not know of any other Muslim in this land besides I and you. And when they entered that land the tyrants came to see her and said to him (the king): &#8216;there comes to your land a woman, whom you alone deserve to possess, so he (the kings sent someone (towards her) and she was brought and Ibrahim (peace be upon him) stood in preyer, and when she visited him (the tyrant king came) he could help but stretch his hand towards her and his hand was tied up. He said: Supplicate Allah so that He may release my hand and I will do no harm to you. She did that and the man repeated (the same highhandedness) and his hand was again tied up more tightly than on the first occasion and he said to her like that and she again did that (supplicated), but he repeated (the same highhandedness and his hands were tied up more tightly than on the previous occasion). He then again said: Supplicate your Lord so that He may set my hand free; by. @ llah I shall do no harm to you. She did and his hand was freed. Then he called the person who had brought her and said to him: You have brought to me the satan and you have not brought to me a human being, so turn them out from my land, and he gave Hajira as a gift to her. She returned (along with Hajira) and when Ibrahim (peace be upon him) saw her, he said: How have you returned? She said: With full safety (have I returned). Allah held the hand of that debauch and he gave me a maid-servant. Abu Hiaraira said: O sons of the rain of the sky, she is your mother.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa&#8217;id b. jubair reported: I said to Ibn Abbas that Nauf al-Bikali was of the opinion that Moses (peace be upon him), the Apostle of Bani Isra&#8217;il, was not the same who accompanied Khadir, whereupon he said: The enemy of Allah tells a lie. I heard Ubayy b. Ka&#8217;b say: Moses (peace be upon him) stood up to give sermon to the people of Isra&#8217;il. He was asked as to who amongst the people has the best knowledge, whereupon he said: I have the best knowledge. Thereupon Allah was annoyed with him that he did not attribute (the best knowledge) to Him. He revealed to him: A servant amongst My servants is at the junction of two rivers who has more knowledge than yours. Moses said: How can I meet him? It was said to him: Carry a fish in the large basket and the place where you find it missing there you will find him. Thereupon Moses proceeded forth along with a young man (Yusha&#8217;). Joshua b. Nan and Moses (peace be upon him) put the fish in the basket and there went along with him the young man (Yusha&#8217;) until they came to a certain rock and Moses and his companion went to sleep and the fish stirred in that basket and fell into the ocean and Allah stopped the current of water like a vault until the way was made for the fish. Moses and his youn. companion were astonished and they walked for the rest of the day and the night and the friend of Moses forgot to inform him of this incident. When it was morning, Moses (peace be upon him) said to the young man: Bring for us the breakfast for we are dead tired because of this journey, and they did not feel exhausted until they had passed that place where they had been commanded (to stay). He said: Don&#8217;t you know that when we reached the Sakhra (rock) I forgot the fisii and noth ng made me forget it but the satan that I. could nit remember it? How strange is it that the fish found a way in the river? Moses said: That was what we had been aiming at. Then both of them retraced their steps until they reached Sakhra; there they saw a man covered with a cloth. Moses greeted him. Khadir said to him: Where is as-Salam in our country.? He said: I am Moses, whereupon he (Khadir) said: You mean the Moses of Bani Isra&#8217;il? He said: Yes. He (Khadir) said: You have a knowledge out of the knowledge of Allah which in fact Allah imparted to you and about that I know nothing and I have knowledge out of Allah&#8217;s knowledge which He imparted to me and about that you do not know. Moses (peace be upon him) said to him: May I follow you so that you may teach me that with which you have been taught righteousness. He said: You will not be able to bear with me; how you will be able to bear that about which you do not know? Moses said: Thou wilt find me patient, nor shalt I disobey you in aught. Khadir said to him: If you were to follow me, then do not ask me about anything until I myself speak to you about it. He said: Yes. So Khadir and Moses set forth on the bank of the river that there came before them a boat. Both of theni talked to them (the owners of the boat) so that they might carry both of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They had recognised Khadir and they carried them free. Khadir thereupon took hold of a plank in the boat and broke it away. Moses said: These people have carried us without any charge and you attempt to break their boat so that the people sailing in the boat may drown. This is (something) grievous that you have done. He said: Did I not say that you would not bear with me? He said: Blame me not for what I forgot and be not hard upon what I did. Then both of them got down from the boat and began to walk along the coastline that they saw a boy who had been playing with other boys. Khadir pulled up his head and killed him. Moses said: Have you killed an innocent person who is in no way guilty of slaying another? You have done something horrible. Thereupon he said: Did I not say to you that you will not be able to bear with me? He (Moses) said: This (act) is more grievous than the first one. He (Moses) further said. If I ask you about anything after this, keep not company with me, then you would no doubt find (a plausible) excuse for this. Then they both walked on until they reached the inhabitants of a village. They asked its inhabitants for food but they refused to entertain them as their guests. They found in it a wall which had been bent on one side and was about to fall. Khadir set it right with his own hand. Moses, said to him: It is the people to whom we came but they showed us no hospitality and they did not serve us food. If you wish you can get wages for it. He (Khadir) said: This is the parting of ways between mt and you. Now I wish to reveal to you the significance of that for which you could not bear with me. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said. May Allah have mercy upon Moses! I wish if Moses could show patience and a (fuller) story of both of them could have been told. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said that the first thing which Moses said was out of forgetfulness. Then there came a sparrow until it perched on the wall of the boat and took water from the ocean. Thereupon, Khadir said: My knowledge and your knowledge in comparison with the knowledge of Allah is even less than the water taken by the sparrow in its beak in comparison to the water of the ocean, and Sa&#8217;id b. jubair used to recite (verses 79 and 80 of Sura Kahf) in this way: There was before them a king who used to seize every boat by force which was in order, the boy was an unbeliever.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Book 030, Number 5865:</p>
<p><em><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="030.5865"></a></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="030.5865"></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa, id b. jubair reported that it was said to Ibn &#8216;Abbas that Nauf al-Bikali was of the opinion that Moses who went in search of knowledge was not the Moses of Bani Isra&#8217;il. He said: Sa&#8217;id, did you hear it from him? I said: Yes. Thereupon he said that Nauf had not stated the fact. Ubayy b. Ka&#8217;b narrated to us that he had heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Moses had been delivering sermons to his people. And he made this remark: No person upon the earth has better knowledge than I or nothing better than mine. Thereupon Allah revealed to him: I know one who is better than you (in knowledge) or there is a person on the earth having more knowledge than you. Thereupon he said: My Lord, direct me to him. It was said to him: Keep a salted fish as a provision for journey. The place where that fish would be lost (there you will find that man). So he set forth and a young slave along with him until they came to a place Sakhra. but he did not find any clue. So he proceeded on and left that young man there. The fish began to stir in water and the water assumed the form of an ark over the fish. The young man said: I should meet Allah&#8217;s Apostle (peace be upon him) and inform him, but he was made to forget and when they had gone beyond that place, he (Moses) said to the young man: Bring breakfast. We have been exhausted because of the journey, and he (Moses) was not exhausted until he had crossed that (particular) place (where he had) to meet Khadir, and the youth was reminded and said: Did you not see that as we reached Sakhra I forgot the fish and it is satan alone who has made me forgetful of it&#8217;? It is strange that he has been able to find way in the ocean too. He said: This is what we sought for us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They returned retracing their steps, and he (his companion) pointed to him the location (where) the fish (had been lost). Moses began to search him there. He suddenly saw Khadir wrapped in a cloth and lying on his back. He said to him: As-Salamu-&#8216;Alaikum. He removed the cloth from his face and said: Wa &#8216;Alaikum-us-Salam! Who are you? He said: I am Moses. He said: Who Moses? He said: Moses Of Bani Isra&#8217;il. He said: What brought you here? He said: I have come so that you may teach me what you have been taught of righteousness. He said: You shall have to bear with me, and how can you have patience about a thing of which you have no comprehensive knowledge? You will not have patience when you see me doing a thing I have been ordered to do. He said: If Allah pleases, you will find me patient, nor shall I disobey you in aught. Khadir said: If you follow me, don&#8217;t ask me about anything until I explain it to you. So they went on until they embarked upon a boat. He (Khadir) made a hole in that. Thereupon he (Moses) said: You have done this so that you may drown the persons sitting in the boat. You have done something grievous. Thereupon he said: Did I not tell you that you will not be able to bear with me? Thereupon he (Moses) said: Blame me not for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for what I did. (Khadir gave him another chance.) So they went on until they reached a place where boys were playing. He went to one of them and caught hold&#8217;of one (apparently) at random and killed him. Moses (peace be upon him) felt agitated and said: You have killed an innocent person not guilty of slaying another. You have done something aboininable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: May Allah have mercy upon us and Moses. Had he shown patience he would have seen wonderful things, but fear of blame, with respect to his companion, seized him and he said: If I ask anything after this, keep not company with me. You will then have a valid excuse in my case, and had he (Moses) shown patience he would have seen many wonderful things. He (the narrator) said: Whenever he (the Holy Prophet) made mention of any Prophet, he always said: May there be mercy of Allah upon us and upon my brother so and so. They, however, proceeded on until they came to the inhabitants of a village who were very miserly. They went to the meeting places and asked for hospitality but they refused to show any hospitality to them. They both found in that village a wall which was about to fall. He (Khadir) set it right. Thereupon he (Moses) said: If you so liked. you could get wages for it. Thereupon he said: This is the partince, of ways between me and you, and, taking hold of his cloth, he said: Now I will explain to you the real significance (of all these acts) for which you could not show patience. As for the boat, it belonged to the poor people working on the river and I intended to damage it for there was ahead of them (a king) who seized boats by force. (When he came) to catch hold of it he found it a damaged boat, so he spared it (and later on) it was set right with wood. So far as the boy is concerned, he has been, by very nature, an unbeliever, whereas his parents loved him very much. Had he grown up he would have involved them in wrongdoing and unbelief, so we wished that their Lord should give them in its place one better in purity and close to mercy. And as for the wall it belonged to two orphan boys in the city and there was beneath it a (treasure) belongin to them,&#8230; up to the last verse. This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Abu Ishaq.</p>

Ibn &#8216;Abbas said that he was Khadir. There happened to pass Ubayy b. Ka&#8217;b Ansari. Ibn Abbas called him and said: Abu Tufail, come to us. There has been a difference of opinion between me and my friend about the companion of Moses whom he wanted to meet on the way. Did hear anything from Allah&#8217;s meesenger (may peace be upon him) making a mention of anything? Ubayy said: I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may Peace be upon him) as saying: As Moses was amongst the group of Bani Isra&#8217;il, there came to him a person and he said to him: Do you know anyone having better knowledge than you? Moses said: No. Thereupon Allah revealed to Moses: Of course, there is amongst Our servants Khadir (who has better knowledge) than you. Moses asked the way of meeting him. Allah made the fish a sign and it was said to him: Where you miss the fish return to that (place) and you will soon find him. So Moses moved on as Allah wished him to move on. He then said to his young companion: Bring for us the breakfast. Thereupop that young man said to Moses. when he asked him for the breakfast: Don&#8217;t you see that as we had reached the Sakhra I forgot the fish and nobody made it forget (in our mind) but the satan that I should remind you of it? Mosed said to that young man: This was what we wanted. So they retraced their steps and met Khadir and the events which followed have been described in His Book except that Yunus (the narrator) said that he followed the traces of fish in the ocean.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Uqba bin &#8216;Amr said to Hudhaifa, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you relate to  us of what you have heard from Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I heard him saying,  &#8220;When Al-Dajjal appears, he will have fire and water along with him. What the people  will consider as cold water, will be fire that will burn (things). So, if anyone of you  comes across this, he should fall in the thing which will appear to him as fire, for in  reality, it will be fresh cold water.&#8221; Hudhaifa added, &#8220;I also heard him saying,  &#8216;From among the people preceding your generation, there was a man whom the angel of death  visited to capture his soul. (So his soul was captured) and he was asked if he had done  any good deed.&#8217; He replied, &#8216;I don&#8217;t remember any good deed.&#8217; He was asked to think it  over. He said, &#8216;I do not remember, except that I used to trade with the people in the  world and I used to give a respite to the rich and forgive the poor (among my debtors). So  Allah made him enter Paradise.&#8221; Hudhaifa further said, &#8220;I also heard him saying,  &#8216;Once there was a man on his death-bed, who, losing every hope of surviving said to his  family: When I die, gather for me a large heap of wood and make a fire (to burn me). When  the fire eats my meat and reaches my bones, and when the bones burn, take and crush them  into powder and wait for a windy day to throw it (i.e. the powder) over the sea. They did  so, but Allah collected his particles and asked him: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Why did you do so? He replied: For fear of You. So Allah  forgave him.&#8221; &#8216;Uqba bin &#8216;Amr said, &#8220;I heard him saying that the Israeli used to  dig the grave of the dead (to steal their shrouds).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On his death-bed Allah&#8217;s Apostle put a sheet over his-face  and when he felt hot, he would remove it from his face. When in that state (of putting and  removing the sheet) he said, &#8220;May Allah&#8217;s Curse be on the Jews and the Christians for  they build places of worship at the graves of their prophets.&#8221; (By that) he intended  to warn (the Muslim) from what they (i.e. Jews and Christians) had done. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Your period (i.e. the Muslims&#8217;  period) in comparison to the periods of the previous nations, is like the period between  the &#8216;Asr prayer and sunset. And your example in comparison to the Jews and the Christians  is like the example of a person who employed some laborers and asked them, &#8216;Who will work  for me till midday for one Qirat each?&#8217; The Jews worked for half a day for one Qirat each.  The person asked, &#8216;Who will do the work for me from midday to the time of the &#8216;Asr  (prayer) for one Qirat each?&#8217; The Christians worked from midday till the &#8216;Asr prayer for  one Qirat. Then the person asked, &#8216;Who will do the work for me from the &#8216;Asr till sunset  for two Qirats each?&#8217; &#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;It is you (i.e. Muslims) who are  doing the work from the Asr till sunset, so you will have a double reward. The Jews and  the Christians got angry and said, &#8216;We have done more work but got less wages.&#8217; Allah  said, &#8216;Have I been unjust to you as regards your rights?&#8217; They said, &#8216;No.&#8217; So Allah said,  &#8216;Then it is My Blessing which I bestow on whomever I like. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that he heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Allah willed to  test three Israelis who were a Leper, a blind man and a bald-headed man. So, he sent them  an angel who came to the leper and said, &#8216;What thing do you like most?&#8217; He replied,  &#8220;Good color and good skin, for the people have a strong aversion to me.&#8217; The angel  touched him and his illness was cured, and he was given a good color and beautiful skin.  The angel asked him, &#8216;What kind of property do you like best?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Camels (or  cows).&#8217; (The narrator is in doubt, for either the leper or the bald-headed man demanded  camels and the other demanded cows.) So he (i.e. the leper) was given a pregnant  she-camei, and the angel said (to him), &#8216;May Allah bless you in it.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The angel then went to the bald-headed man and said, &#8216;What  thing do you like most?&#8217; He said, &#8216;I like good hair and wish to be cured of this disease,  for the people feel repulsion for me.&#8217; The angel touched him and his illness was cured,  and he was given good hair. The angel asked (him), &#8216;What kind of property do you like  bests&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Cows,&#8217; The angel gave him a pregnant cow and said, &#8216;May Allah bless  you in it.&#8217; The angel went to the blind man and asked, &#8216;What thing do you like best?&#8217; He  said, &#8216;(I like) that Allah may restore my eye-sight to me so that I may see the people.&#8217;  The angel touched his eyes and Allah gave him back his eye-sight. The angel asked him,  &#8220;What kind of property do you like best?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Sheep.&#8217; The angel gave him a  pregnant sheep. Afterwards, all the three pregnant animals gave birth to young ones, and  multiplied and brought forth so much that one of the (three) men had a herd of camels  filling a valley, and one had a herd of cows filling a valley, and one had a flock of  sheep filling a valley. Then the angel, disguised in the shape and appearance of a leper,  went to the leper and said, I am a poor man, who has lost all means of livelihood while on  a journey. So none will satisfy my need except Allah and then you. In the Name of Him Who  has given you such nice color and beautiful skin, and so much property, I ask you to give  me a camel so that I may reach my destination. The man replied, &#8216;I have many obligations  (so I cannot give you).&#8217; The angel said, &#8216;I think I know you; were you not a leper to whom  the people had a strong aversion? Weren&#8217;t you a poor man, and then Allah gave you (all  this property).&#8217; He replied, &#8216;(This is all wrong), I got this property through inheritance  from my fore-fathers&#8217; The angel said, &#8216;If you are telling a lie, then let Allah make you  as you were before. &#8216; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then the angel, disguised in the shape and appearance of a  bald man, went to the bald man and said to him the same as he told the first one, and he  too answered the same as the first one did. The angel said, &#8216;If you are telling a lie,  then let Allah make you as you were before.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The angel, disguised in the shape of a blind man, went to  the blind man and said, &#8216;I am a poor man and a traveler, whose means of livelihood have  been exhausted while on a journey. I have nobody to help me except Allah, and after Him,  you yourself. I ask you in the Name of Him Who has given you back your eye-sight to give  me a sheep, so that with its help, I may complete my journey&#8217; The man said, &#8216;No doubt, I  was blind and Allah gave me back my eye-sight; I was poor and Allah made me rich; so take  anything you wish from my property. By Allah, I will not stop you for taking anything (you  need) of my property which you may take for Allah&#8217;s sake.&#8217; The angel replied, &#8216;Keep your  property with you. You (i.e 3 men) have been tested and Allah is pleased with you and is  angry with your two companions.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 671: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Once three persons (from the  previous nations) were traveling, and suddenly it started raining and they took shelter in  a cave. The entrance of the cave got closed while they were inside. They said to each  other, &#8216;O you! Nothing can save you except the truth, so each of you should ask Allah&#8217;s  Help by referring to such a deed as he thinks he did sincerely (i.e. just for gaining  Allah&#8217;s Pleasure).&#8217; So one of them said, &#8216;O Allah! You know that I had a laborer who  worked for me for one Faraq (i.e. three Sas) of rice, but he departed, leaving it (i.e.  his wages). I sowed that Faraq of rice and with its yield I bought cows (for him). Later  on when he came to me asking for his wages, I said (to him), &#8216;Go to those cows and drive  them away.&#8217; He said to me, &#8216;But you have to pay me only a Faraq of rice,&#8217; I said to him,  &#8216;Go to those cows and take them, for they are the product of that Faraq (of rice).&#8217; So he  drove them. O Allah! If you consider that I did that for fear of You, then please remove  the rock.&#8217; The rock shifted a bit from the mouth of the cave. The second one said, &#8216;O  Allah, You know that I had old parents whom I used to provide with the milk of my sheep  every night. One night I was delayed and when I came, they had slept, while my wife and  children were crying with hunger. I used not to let them (i.e. my family) drink unless my  parents had drunk first. So I disliked to wake them up and also disliked that they should  sleep without drinking it, I kept on waiting (for them to wake) till it dawned. O Allah!  If You consider that I did that for fear of you, then please remove the rock.&#8217; So the rock  shifted and they could see the sky through it. The (third) one said, &#8216;O Allah! You know  that I had a cousin (i.e. my paternal uncle&#8217;s daughter) who was most beloved to me and I  sought to seduce her, but she refused, unless I paid her one-hundred Dinars (i.e. gold  pieces). So I collected the amount and brought it to her, and she allowed me to sleep with  her. But when I sat between her legs, she said, &#8216;Be afraid of Allah, and do not deflower  me but legally. &#8216;I got up and left the hundred Dinars (for her). O Allah! If You consider  that I did that for fear of you than please remove the rock. So Allah saved them and they  came out (of the cave).&#8221; (This Hadith indicates that one can only ask Allah for help  directly or through his performed good deeds. But to ask Allah through dead or absent  prophets, saints, spirits, holy men, angels etc. is absolutely forbidden in Islam and it  is a kind of disbelief.) </font></p>

Make me like her.&#8217; Then he said, &#8216;As for the  rider, he is an infidel, while the lady is accused of illegal sexual intercourse (falsely)  and she says: Allah is sufficient for me (He knows the truth).&#8221; </font></p>

Then he set out asking (whether his  repentance could be accepted or not). He came upon a monk and asked him if his repentance  could be accepted. The monk replied in the negative and so the man killed him. He kept on  asking till a man advised to go to such and such village. (So he left for it) but death  overtook him on the way. While dying, he turned his chest towards that village (where he  had hoped his repentance would be accepted), and so the angels of mercy and the angels of  punishment quarrelled amongst themselves regarding him. Allah ordered the village (towards  which he was going) to come closer to him, and ordered the village (whence he had come),  to go far away, and then He ordered the angels to measure the distances between his body  and the two villages. So he was found to be one span closer to the village (he was going  to). So he was forgiven.&#8221; </font></p>

While a person was amongst  his sheep, a wolf attacked and took one of the sheep. The man chased the wolf till he  saved it from the wolf, where upon the wolf said, &#8216;You have saved it from me; but who will  guard it on the day of the wild beasts when there will be no shepherd to guard them except  me (because of riots and afflictions)? &#8216; &#8221; The people said surprisingly,  &#8220;Glorified be Allah!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;A man used to give loans to the  people and used to say to his servant, &#8216;If the debtor is poor, forgive him, so that Allah  may forgive us.&#8217; So when he met Allah (after his death), Allah forgave him.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;A man used to do sinful deeds, and  when death came to him, he said to his sons, &#8216;After my death, burn me and then crush me,  and scatter the powder in the air, for by Allah, if Allah has control over me, He will  give me such a punishment as He has never given to anyone else.&#8217; When he died, his sons  did accordingly. Allah ordered the earth saying, &#8216;Collect what you hold of his particles.&#8217;  It did so, and behold! There he was (the man) standing. Allah asked (him), &#8216;What made you  do what you did?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;O my Lord! I was afraid of You.&#8217; So Allah forgave him.  &#8221; Another narrator said &#8220;The man said, Fear of You, O Lord!&#8221; </font></p>

It is incumbent on every  Muslim to wash his head and body on a Day (i.e. Friday) (at least) in every seven  days.&#8221; </font></p>

Those men are the ignorant amongst you. Beware of such hopes as make the people  go astray, for I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;Authority of ruling will remain with  Quraish, and whoever bears hostility to them, Allah will destroy him as long as they abide  by the laws of the religion.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

(&#8216;Abdullah) bin AzZubair said, &#8221; &#8216;Aisha should be stopped from doing  so.&#8221; (When &#8216;Aisha heard this), she said protestingly, &#8220;Shall I be stopped from  doing so? I vow that I will never talk to &#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair.&#8221; On that, Ibn  Az-Zubair asked some people from Quraish and particularly the two uncles of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle to intercede with her, but she refused (to talk to him). Az-Zuhriyun, the uncles  of the Prophet, including &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Aswad bin &#8216;Abd Yaghuth and Al-Miswar bin  Makhrama said to him, &#8220;When we ask for the permission to visit her, enter her house  along with us (without taking her leave).&#8221; He did accordingly (and she accepted their  intercession). He sent her ten slaves whom she manumitted as an expiation for (not  keeping) her vow. &#8216;Aisha manumitted more slaves for the same purpose till she manumitted  forty slaves. She said, &#8220;I wish I had specified what I would have done in case of not  fulfilling my vow when I made the vow, so that I might have done it easily.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Huraira said, &#8220;(The Prophet said), &#8216;(The people  of) Bani Aslam, Ghifar and some people of Muzaina (or some people of Juhaina or Muzaina)  are better in Allah&#8217;s Sight (or on the Day of Resurrection) than the tribes of Asad,  Tamim, Hawazin and Ghatafan.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were in the company of the Prophet in a Ghazwa. A large  number of emigrants joined him and among the emigrants there was a person who used to play  jokes (or play with spears); so he (jokingly) stroked an Ansari man on the hip. The  Ans-ari got so angry that both of them called their people. The Ansari said, &#8220;Help, O  Ansar!&#8221; And the emigrant said &#8220;Help, O emigrants!&#8221; The Prophet came out and  said, &#8220;What is wrong with the people (as they are calling) this call of the period of  Ignorance? &#8220;Then he said, &#8220;What is the matter with them?&#8221; So he was told  about the stroke of the emigrant to the Ansari. The Prophet said, &#8220;Stop this (i.e.  appeal for help) for it is an evil call. &#8220;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul (a hypocrite)  said, &#8220;The emigrants have called and (gathered against us); so when we return to  Medina, surely, the more honorable people will expel therefrom the meaner,&#8221; Upon that  &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! Shall we not kill this evil person (i.e. Abdullah bin  Ubai bin Salul) ?&#8221; The Prophet) said, &#8220;(No), lest the people should say that  Muhammad used to kill his companions.&#8221; </font></p>

Abu Huraira said, &#8220;The Prophet said, &#8216;I saw Amr bin &#8216;Amir bin  Luhai Al-Khuzai dragging his intestines in the (Hell) Fire, for he was the first man who  started the custom of releasing animals (for the sake of false gods).&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the news of the advent of the Prophet reached Abu  Dhar, he said to his brother, &#8220;Ride to this valley and bring me the news of this man  (i.e. the Prophet ) who claims to be a Prophet receiving information from the Heaven.  Listen to him and then come to me.&#8221; His brother set out till he met the Prophet and  listened to his speech and returned to Abu Dhar and said to him, &#8220;I have seen him  exhorting people to virtues and his speech was not like poetry.&#8221; Abu Dhar said,  &#8220;You have not satisfied me as to what I wanted.&#8221; So, he took his journey-food  and a water-skin full of water and set out till he reached Mecca, where he went to the  Mosque looking for the Prophet , whom he did not know, and he would not like to ask  someone about him. So, a portion of the night had passed when &#8216;Ali saw him and realized  that he was a stranger. Abu Dhar followed him (to his house), but neither of them asked  the other about anything till it was morning, when he carried his water-skin and food and  went to the Mosque. He spent that day without being observed by the Prophet till it was  night, when he returned to his sleeping place. &#8216;Ali again passed by him and said,  &#8220;Hasn&#8217;t the man (i.e. Abu Dhar) recognized his dwelling place yet?&#8221; So, &#8216;Ali let  him get up and took him (to his house), but neither of them asked the other about  anything, till it was the third day when &#8216;Ali had the same experience with him and Abu  Dhar again stayed with him. &#8216;Ali then asked, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you tell me what has brought you  here?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;If you give me a promise and a convention that you will  guide me, then I will tell you.&#8221; When &#8216;Ali did, Abu Dhar informed him (of his  purpose). &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;It is the Truth, and he (i.e. Muhammad) is the Apostle of  Allah. So when the morning comes, follow me, and if I should perceive any danger  threatening you, I will give you a hint by pretending to go to the watercloset. But if I  carried on walking, follow me till you enter the place that I will enter.&#8221; Abu Dhur  agreed and followed &#8216;Ali till he entered the place of the Prophet and Abu Dhur entered  with him. He then listened to the speech of the Prophet and embraced Islam on that very  spot. The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Go back to your people and inform them (of this  religion) till you receive my (further) orders.&#8221; Abu Dhur said, &#8220;By Him in Whose  Hands my life is! I will proclaim my conversion to Islam publicly amongst them (i.e.  infidels).&#8221; He went out till he reached the Mosque and announced as loudly as  possible, &#8220;I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that  Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah.&#8221; The people then got up and beat him till they  knocked him down. Al-Abbas came and threw himself over him (to protect him) saying, Woe to  you! Don&#8217;t you know that he is from Ghifar and there is the route (road) to your merchants  towards Sham (i.e. through the place where this tribe dwells)?&#8221; Thus he saved him  from them. Abu Dhar did the same on the next day and the people beat him again and  Al-&#8216;Abbas drew himself over him (to save him as before). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Jamra: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn &#8216;Abbas said to us, &#8220;Shall I tell you the story of  Abu Dhar&#8217;s conversion to Islam?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Abu Dhar  said: I was a man from the tribe of Ghifar. We heard that a man had appeared in Mecca,  claiming to be a Prophet. ! said to my brother, &#8216;Go to that man and talk to him and bring  me his news.&#8217; He set out, met him and returned. I asked him, &#8216;What is the news with you?&#8217;  He said, &#8216;By Allah, I saw a man enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil.&#8217; I  said to him, &#8216;You have not satisfied me with this little information.&#8217; So, I took a  waterskin and a stick and proceeded towards Mecca. Neither did I know him (i.e. the  Prophet ), nor did I like to ask anyone about him. I Kept on drinking Zam zam water and  staying in the Mosque. Then &#8216;Ali passed by me and said, &#8216;It seems you are a stranger?&#8217; I  said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; He proceeded to his house and I accompanied him. Neither did he ask me  anything, nor did I tell him anything. Next morning I went to the Mosque to ask about the  Prophet but no-one told me anything about him. Ali passed by me again and asked, &#8216;Hasn&#8217;t  the man recognized his dwelling place yet&#8217; I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Come along with me.&#8217; He  asked me, &#8216;What is your business? What has brought you to this town?&#8217; I said to him, &#8216;If  you keep my secret, I will tell you.&#8217; He said, &#8216;I will do,&#8217; I said to him, &#8216;We have heard  that a person has appeared here, claiming to be a Prophet. I sent my brother to speak to  him and when he returned, he did not bring a satisfactory report; so I thought of meeting  him personally.&#8217; &#8216;Ali said (to Abu Dhar), &#8216;You have reached your goal; I am going to him  just now, so follow me, and wherever I enter, enter after me. If I should see someone who  may cause you trouble, I will stand near a wall pretending to mend my shoes (as a  warning), and you should go away then.&#8217; &#8216;Ali proceeded and I accompanied him till he  entered a place, and I entered with him to the Prophet to whom I said, &#8216;Present (the  principles of) Islam to me.&#8217; When he did, I embraced Islam &#8216;immediately. He said to me, &#8216;O  Abu Dhar! Keep your conversion as a secret and return to your town; and when you hear of  our victory, return to us. &#8216; I said, &#8216;By H him Who has sent you with the Truth, I will  announce my conversion to Islam publicly amongst them (i.e. the infidels),&#8217; Abu Dhar went  to the Mosque, where some people from Quraish were present, and said, &#8216;O folk of Quraish !  I testify that None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and I (also) testify that  Muhammad is Allah&#8217;s Slave and His Apostle.&#8217; (Hearing that) the Quraishi men said, &#8216;Get at  this Sabi (i.e. Muslim) !&#8217; They got up and beat me nearly to death. Al &#8216;Abbas saw me and  threw himself over me to protect me. He then faced them and said, &#8216;Woe to you! You want to  kill a man from the tribe of Ghifar, although your trade and your communications are  through the territory of Ghifar?&#8217; They therefore left me. The next morning I returned (to  the Mosque) and said the same as I have said on the previous day. They again said, &#8216;Get at  this Sabi!&#8217; I was treated in the same way as on the previous day, and again Al-Abbas found  me and threw himself over me to protect me and told them the same as he had said the day  before.&#8217; So, that was the conversion of Abu Dhar (may Allah be Merciful to him) to  Islam.&#8221; </font></p>

The first (of the three angels) said, &#8220;Which of them is he?&#8221;  The second said, &#8220;He is the best of them.&#8221; That was all that happened then, and  he did not see them till they came at another night and he perceived their presence with  his heart, for the eyes of the Prophet were closed when he was asleep, but his heart was  not asleep (not unconscious). This is characteristic of all the prophets: Their eyes sleep  but their hearts do not sleep. Then Gabriel took charge of the Prophet and ascended along  with him to the Heaven. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That they were with the Prophet on a journey. They  travelled the whole night, and when dawn approached, they took a rest and sleep  overwhelmed them till the sun rose high in the sky. The first to get up was Abu Bakr.  Allah&#8217;s Apostles used not to be awakened from his sleep, but he would wake up by himself.  &#8216;Umar woke up and then Abu Bakr sat by the side of the Prophet&#8217;s head and started saying:  Allahu-Akbar raising his voice till the Prophet woke up, (and after traveling for a while)  he dismounted and led us in the morning prayer. A man amongst the people failed to join us  in the prayer. When the Prophet had finished the prayer, he asked (the man), &#8220;O  so-and-so! What prevented you from offering the prayer with us?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I  am Junub,&#8221; Alllah&#8217;s Apostle ordered him to perform Tayammam with clean earth. The man  then offered the prayer. Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered me and a few others to go ahead of him.  We had become very thirsty. While we were on our way (looking for water), we came across a  lady (riding an animal), hanging her legs between two water-skins. We asked her,  &#8220;Where can we get water?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;Oh ! There is no water.&#8221; We  asked, &#8220;how far is your house from the water?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;A distance of  a day and a night travel.&#8221; We said, &#8220;Come on to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, &#8220;She  asked, &#8220;What is Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; So we brought her to Allah&#8217;s Apostle against  her will, and she told him what she had told us before and added that she was the mother  of orphans. So the Prophet ordered that her two water-skins be brought and he rubbed the  mouths of the water-skins. As we were thirsty, we drank till we quenched our thirst and we  were forty men. We also filled all our waterskins and other utensils with water, but we  did not water the camels. The waterskin was so full that it was almost about to burst. The  Prophet then said, &#8220;Bring what (foodstuff) you have.&#8221; So some dates and pieces  of bread were collected for the lady, and when she went to her people, she said, &#8220;I  have met either the greatest magician or a prophet as the people claim.&#8221; So Allah  guided the people of that village through that lady. She embraced Islam and they all  embraced Islam. </font></p>

He asked, &#8216;What is wrong with you?&#8217; They replied, &#8216;We have no water either for performing  ablution or for drinking except what is present in front of you.&#8217; So he placed his hand in  that pot and the water started flowing among his fingers like springs. We all drank and  performed ablution (from it).&#8221; I asked Jabir, &#8220;How many were you?&#8221; he  replied, &#8220;Even if we had been one-hundred-thousand, it would have been sufficient for  us, but we were fifteen-hundred.&#8221; </font></p>

I said, &#8220;Yes&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said to the men  around him, &#8220;Get up!&#8221; He set out (accompanied by them) and I went ahead of them  till I reached Abu Talha and told him (of the Prophet&#8217;s visit). Abu Talha said, &#8220;O Um  Sulaim! Allah&#8217;s Apostle is coming with the people and we have no food to feed them.&#8221;  She said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; So Abu Talha went out to receive  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Allah&#8217;s Apostle came along with Abu Talha. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O  Um Sulaim! Bring whatever you have.&#8221; She brought the bread which Allah&#8217;s Apostle  ordered to be broken into pieces. Um Sulaim poured on them some butter from an oilskin.  Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle recited what Allah wished him to recite, and then said, &#8220;Let ten  persons come (to share the meal).&#8221; Ten persons were admitted, ate their fill and went  out. Then he again said, &#8220;Let another ten do the same.&#8221; They were admitted, ate  their fill and went out. Then he again said, &#8216;&#8221;&#8216;Let another ten persons (do the  same.)&#8221; They were admitted, ate their fill and went out. Then he said, &#8220;Let  another ten persons come.&#8221; In short, all of them ate their fill, and they were  seventy or eighty men. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We used to consider miracles as Allah&#8217;s Blessings, but you  people consider them to be a warning. Once we were with Allah&#8217;s Apostle on a journey, and  we ran short of water. He said, &#8220;Bring the water remaining with you.&#8221; The people  brought a utensil containing a little water. He placed his hand in it and said, &#8220;Come  to the blessed water, and the Blessing is from Allah.&#8221; I saw the water flowing from  among the fingers of Allah&#8217;s Apostle , and no doubt, we heard the meal glorifying Allah,  when it was being eaten (by him). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My father had died in debt. So I came to the Prophet and  said, &#8220;My father (died) leaving unpaid debts, and I have nothing except the yield of  his date palms; and their yield for many years will not cover his debts. So please come  with me, so that the creditors may not misbehave with me.&#8221; The Prophet went round one  of the heaps of dates and invoked (Allah), and then did the same with another heap and sat  on it and said, &#8220;Measure (for them).&#8221; He paid them their rights and what  remained was as much as had been paid to them. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 781: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The companions of Suffa were poor people. The Prophet once  said, &#8220;Whoever has food enough for two persons, should take a third one (from among  them), and whoever has food enough for four persons, should take a fifth or a sixth (or  said something similar).&#8221; Abu Bakr brought three persons while the Prophet took ten.  And Abu Bakr with his three family member (who were I, my father and my mother) (the  sub-narrator is in doubt whether &#8216;Abdur-Rahman said, &#8220;My wife and my servant who was  common for both my house and Abu Bakr&#8217;s house.&#8221;) Abu Bakr took his supper with the  Prophet and stayed there till he offered the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayers. He returned and stayed till  Allah&#8217;s Apostle took his supper. After a part of the night had passed, he returned to his  house. His wife said to him, &#8220;What has detained you from your guests?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Have you served supper to them?&#8221; She said, &#8220;They refused to take supper)  until you come. They (i.e. some members of the household) presented the meal to them but  they refused (to eat)&#8221; I went to hide myself and he said, &#8220;O Ghunthar!&#8221; He  invoked Allah to cause my ears to be cut and he rebuked me. He then said (to them): Please  eat!&#8221; and added, I will never eat the meal.&#8221; By Allah, whenever we took a  handful of the meal, the meal grew from underneath more than that handful till everybody  ate to his satisfaction; yet the remaining food was more than the original meal. Abu Bakr  saw that the food was as much or more than the original amount. He called his wife,  &#8220;O sister of Bani Firas!&#8221; She said, &#8220;O pleasure of my eyes. The food has  been tripled in quantity.&#8221; Abu Bakr then started eating thereof and said, &#8220;It  (i.e. my oath not to eat) was because of Sa all.&#8221; He took a handful from it, and  carried the rest to the Prophet. SO that food was with the Prophet . There was a treaty  between us and some people, and when the period of that treaty had elapsed, he divided US  into twelve groups, each being headed by a man. Allah knows how many men were under the  command of each leader. Anyhow, the Prophet surely sent a leader with each group. Then all  of them ate of that meal. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, the people of  Medina suffered from drought. So while the Prophet was delivering a sermon on a Friday a  man got up saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The horses and sheep have perished. Will you  invoke Allah to bless us with rain?&#8221; The Prophet lifted both his hands and invoked.  The sky at that time was as clear as glass. Suddenly a wind blew, raising clouds that  gathered together, and it started raining heavily. We came out (of the Mosque) wading  through the flowing water till we reached our homes. It went on raining till the next  Friday, when the same man or some other man stood up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  The houses have collapsed; please invoke Allah to withhold the rain.&#8221; On that the  Prophet smiled and said, &#8220;O Allah, (let it rain) around us and not on us.&#8221; I  then looked at the clouds to see them separating forming a sort of a crown round Medina. </font></p>

Shall we make a pulpit  for you?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;If you wish.&#8221; So they made a pulpit for him and when  it was Friday, he proceeded towards the pulpit (for delivering the sermon). The date-palm  cried like a child! The Prophet descended (the pulpit) and embraced it while it continued  moaning like a child being quietened. The Prophet said, &#8220;It was crying for (missing)  what it used to hear of religious knowledge given near to it.&#8221; </font></p>

You need not fear those (afflictions) as there is a closed door  between you and them.&#8221; &#8216;Umar asked, &#8220;Will that door be opened or broken?&#8221;  Hudhaifa replied, &#8220;No, it will be broken.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Then it is very  likely that the door will not be closed again.&#8221; Later on the people asked Hudhaifa,  &#8220;Did &#8216;Umar know what that door meant?&#8221; He said. &#8220;Yes, &#8216;Umar knew it as  everyone knows that there will be night before the tomorrow morning. I narrated to &#8216;Umar  an authentic narration, not lies.&#8221; We dared not ask Hudhaifa; therefore we requested  Masruq who asked him, &#8220;What does the door stand for?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Umar.&#8221;  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was in the city of the Prophet, a man came and  complained to him (the Prophet, ) of destitution and poverty. Then another man came and  complained of robbery (by highwaymen). The Prophet said, &#8220;Adi! Have you been to  Al-Hira?&#8221; I said, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t been to it, but I was informed about it.&#8221; He  said, &#8220;If you should live for a long time, you will certainly see that a lady in a  Howdah traveling from Al-Hira will (safely reach Mecca and) perform the Tawaf of the  Ka&#8217;ba, fearing none but Allah.&#8221; I said to myself, &#8220;What will happen to the  robbers of the tribe of Tai who have spread evil through out the country?&#8221; The  Prophet further said. &#8220;If you should live long, the treasures of Khosrau will be  opened (and taken as spoils).&#8221; I asked, &#8220;You mean Khosrau, son of Hurmuz?&#8221;  He said, &#8220;Khosrau, son of Hurmuz; and if you should live long, you will see that one  will carry a handful of gold or silver and go out looking for a person to accept it from  him, but will find none to accept it from him. And any of you, when meeting Allah, will  meet Him without needing an interpreter between him and Allah to interpret for him, and  Allah will say to him: &#8216;Didn&#8217;t I send a messenger to teach you?&#8217; He will say: &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Allah  will say: &#8216;Didn&#8217;t I give you wealth and do you favors?&#8217; He will say: &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Then he will  look to his right and see nothing but Hell, and look to his left and see nothing but  Hell.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Adi further said: I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;Save  yourself from the (Hell) Fire even with half a date (to be given in charity) and if you do  not find a half date, then with a good pleasant word.&#8221; &#8216;Adi added: (later on) I saw a  lady in a Howdah traveling from Al-Hira till she performed the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, fearing  none but Allah. And I was one of those who opened (conquered) the treasures of Khosrau,  son of Hurmuz. If you should live long, you will see what the Prophet Abu-l-Qasim had  said: &#8216;A person will come out with a handful. of gold&#8230;etc. </font></p>

Once I said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We were in ignorance and in evil and Allah has bestowed upon us the  present good; will there by any evil after this good?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; I  asked, &#8220;Will there be good after that evil?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, but it would be  tained with Dakhan (i.e. Little evil).&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What will its Dakhan be?&#8221;  He said, &#8220;There will be some people who will lead (people) according to principles  other than my tradition. You will see their actions and disapprove of them.&#8221; I said,  &#8220;Will there by any evil after that good?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, there will be some  people who will invite others to the doors of Hell, and whoever accepts their invitation  to it will be thrown in it (by them).&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Describe  those people to us.&#8221; He said, &#8220;They will belong to us and speak our  language&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What do you order me to do if such a thing should take place  in my life?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Adhere to the group of Muslims and their Chief.&#8221; I  asked, &#8220;If there is neither a group (of Muslims) nor a chief (what shall I do)?&#8221;  He said, &#8220;Keep away from all those different sects, even if you had to bite (i.e.  eat) the root of a tree, till you meet Allah while you are still in that state.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While we were with Allah&#8217;s Apostle who was distributing  (i.e. some property), there came Dhu-l-Khuwaisira, a man from the tribe of Bani Tamim and  said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Do Justice.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Woe to you! Who  could do justice if I did not? I would be a desperate loser if I did not do justice.&#8221;  &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allow me to chop his head off.&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;Leave him, for he has companions who pray and fast in such a way that you will  consider your fasting negligible in comparison to theirs. They recite Qur&#8217;an but it does  not go beyond their throats (i.e. they do not act on it) and they will desert Islam as an  arrow goes through a victim&#8217;s body, so that the hunter, on looking at the arrow&#8217;s blade,  would see nothing on it; he would look at its Risaf and see nothing: he would look at its  Na,di and see nothing, and he would look at its Qudhadh ( 1 ) and see nothing (neither  meat nor blood), for the arrow has been too fast even for the blood and excretions to  smear. The sign by which they will be recognized is that among them there will be a black  man, one of whose arms will resemble a woman&#8217;s breast or a lump of meat moving loosely.  Those people will appear when there will be differences amongst the people.&#8221; I  testify that I heard this narration from Allah&#8217;s Apostle and I testify that &#8216;Ali bin Abi  Talib fought with such people, and I was in his company. He ordered that the man  (described by the Prophet ) should be looked for. The man was brought and I looked at him  and noticed that he looked exactly as the Prophet had described him. </font></p>

But when I tell  you a thing which is between you and me, then no doubt, war is guile. I heard Allah&#8217;s  Apostle saying, &#8220;In the last days of this world there will appear some young foolish  people who will use (in their claim) the best speech of all people (i.e. the Qur&#8217;an) and  they will abandon Islam as an arrow going through the game.

We said to him, &#8220;Would you seek help for us?  Would you pray to Allah for us?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Among the nations before you a  (believing) man would be put in a ditch that was dug for him, and a saw would be put over  his head and he would be cut into two pieces; yet that (torture) would not make him give  up his religion. His body would be combed with iron combs that would remove his flesh from  the bones and nerves, yet that would not make him abandon his religion. By Allah, this  religion (i.e. Islam) will prevail till a traveler from Sana (in Yemen) to Hadrarmaut will  fear none but Allah, or a wolf as regards his sheep, but you (people) are hasty. </font></p>

He asked Thabit, &#8220;What&#8217;s the  matter?&#8221; Thabit replied, &#8220;An evil situation: A man used to raise his voice over  the voice of the Prophet and so all his good deeds have been annulled and he is from the  people of Hell.&#8221; The man went back and told the Prophet that Thabit had said  so-and-so. (The sub-narrator, Musa bin Anas said, &#8220;The man went to Thabit again with  glad tidings).&#8221; The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Go and say to Thabit: &#8216;You are not  from the people of Fire, but from the people of Paradise.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara&#8217; bin &#8216;Azib: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Bakr came to my father who was at home and purchased a  saddle from him. He said to &#8216;Azib. &#8220;Tell your son to carry it with me.&#8221; So I  carried it with him and my father followed us so as to take the price (of the saddle). My  father said, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! Tell me what happened to you on your night journey with  Allah&#8217;s Apostle (during Migration).&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, we travelled the whole night  and also the next day till midday. when nobody could be seen on the way ( because of the  severe heat) . Then there appeared a long rock having shade beneath it, and the sunshine  had not come to it yet. So we dismounted there and I levelled a place and covered it with  an animal hide or dry grass for the Prophet to sleep on (for a while). I then said,  &#8216;Sleep, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and I will guard you.&#8217; So he slept and I went out to guard him.  Suddenly I saw a shepherd coming with his sheep to that rock with the same intention we  had when we came to it. I asked (him). &#8216;To whom do you belong, O boy?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;I  belong to a man from Medina or Mecca.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Do your sheep have milk?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217;  I said, &#8216;Will you milk for us?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; He caught hold of a sheep and I asked him  to clean its teat from dust, hairs and dirt. (The sub-narrator said that he saw Al-Bara&#8217;  striking one of his hands with the other, demonstrating how the shepherd removed the  dust.) The shepherd milked a little milk in a wooden container and I had a leather  container which I carried for the Prophet to drink and perform the ablution from. I went  to the Prophet, hating to wake him up, but when I reached there, the Prophet had already  awakened; so I poured water over the middle part of the milk container, till the milk was  cold. Then I said, &#8216;Drink, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8217; He drank till I was pleased. Then he asked,  &#8216;Has the time for our departure come?&#8217; I said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; So we departed after midday. Suraqa  bin Malik followed us and I said, &#8216;We have been discovered, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8217; He said,  Don&#8217;t grieve for Allah is with us.&#8217; The Prophet invoked evil on him (i.e. Suraqa) and so  the legs of his horse sank into the earth up to its belly. (The subnarrator, Zuhair is not  sure whether Abu Bakr said, &#8220;(It sank) into solid earth.&#8221;) Suraqa said, &#8216;I see  that you have invoked evil on me. Please invoke good on me, and by Allah, I will cause  those who are seeking after you to return.&#8217; The Prophet invoked good on him and he was  saved. Then, whenever he met somebody on the way, he would say, &#8216;I have looked for him  here in vain.&#8217; So he caused whomever he met to return. Thus Suraqa fulfilled his  promise.&#8221; </font></p>

No, for  it is a fever which boils in (the body of) an old man, and will lead him to the  grave.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes, then may it be as you say.&#8221; </font></p>

Later on he returned to Christianity again and he used to say: &#8220;Muhammad knows  nothing but what I have written for him.&#8221; Then Allah caused him to die, and the  people buried him, but in the morning they saw that the earth had thrown his body out.  They said, &#8220;This is the act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our  companion and took his body out of it because he had run away from them.&#8221; They again  dug the grave deeply for him, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown  his body out. They said, &#8220;This is an act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the  grave of our companion and threw his body outside it, for he had run away from them.&#8221;  They dug the grave for him as deep as they could, but in the morning they again saw that  the earth had thrown his body out. So they believed that what had befallen him was not  done by human beings and had to leave him thrown (on the ground). </font></p>

He stood before Musailama (and his companions) and said, &#8220;If you asked me even this  piece (of a leaf), I would not give it to you. You cannot avoid the fate you are destined  to, by Allah. If you reject Islam, Allah will destroy you. I think that you are most  probably the same person whom I have seen in the dream.&#8221; Abu Huraira told me that  Allah&#8217;s Apostle; said, &#8220;While I was sleeping, I saw (in a dream) two gold bracelets  round my arm, and that worried me too much. Then I was instructed divinely in my dream, to  blow them off and so I blew them off, and they flew away. I interpreted the two bracelets  as symbols of two liars who would appear after me. And so one of them was Al-Ansi and the  other was Musailama Al-Kadhdhab from Al-Yamama.&#8221; </font></p>

I thought that it was Al-Yamama or  Hajar, but it came to be Medina i.e. Yathrib. In the same dream I saw myself moving a  sword and its blade got broken. It came to symbolize the defeat which the Muslims suffered  from, on the Day of Uhud. I moved the sword again, and it became normal as before, and  that was the symbol of the victory Allah bestowed upon Muslims and their gathering  together. I saw cows in my dream, and by Allah, that was a blessing, and they symbolized  the believers on the Day of Uhud. And the blessing was the good Allah bestowed upon us and  the reward of true belief which Allah gave us after the day of Badr. </font></p>

Umaiya  said to Sad, &#8220;Will you wait till midday when the people are (at their homes), then  you may go and perform the Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba?&#8221; So, while Sad was going around the  Ka&#8217;ba, Abu Jahl came and asked, &#8220;Who is that who is performing Tawaf?&#8221; Sad  replied, &#8220;I am Sad.&#8221; Abu Jahl said, &#8220;Are you circumambulating the Ka&#8217;ba  safely although you have given refuge to Muhammad and his companions?&#8221; Sad said,  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; and they started quarreling. Umaiya said to Sad, &#8220;Don&#8217;t shout at  Abi-l-Hakam (i.e. Abu Jahl), for he is chief of the valley (of Mecca).&#8221; Sad then said  (to Abu Jahl). &#8216;By Allah, if you prevent me from performing the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, I will  spoil your trade with Sham.&#8221; Umaiya kept on saying to Sad, &#8220;Don&#8217;t raise your  voice.&#8221; and kept on taking hold of him. Sad became furious and said, (to Umaiya),  &#8220;Be away from me, for I have heard Muhammad saying that he will kill you.&#8221;  Umaiiya said, &#8220;Will he kill me?&#8221; Sad said, &#8220;Yes,.&#8221; Umaiya said,  &#8220;By Allah! When Muhammad says a thing, he never tells a lie.&#8221; Umaiya went to his  wife and said to her, &#8220;Do you know what my brother from Yathrib (i.e. Medina) has  said to me?&#8221; She said, &#8220;What has he said?&#8221; He said, &#8220;He claims that he  has heard Muhammad claiming that he will kill me.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>She said, By Allah! Muhammad never tells a lie.&#8221; So  when the infidels started to proceed for Badr (Battle) and declared war (against the  Muslims), his wife said to him, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember what your brother from Yathrib  told you?&#8221; Umaiya decided not to go but Abu Jahl said to him, &#8220;You are from the  nobles of the valley of Mecca), so you should accompany us for a day or two.&#8221; He went  with them and thus Allah got him killed. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I got the news that Gabriel came to the Prophet while Um  Salama was present. Gabriel started talking (to the Prophet and then left. The Prophet  said to Um Salama, &#8220;(Do you know) who it was?&#8221; (or a similar question). She  said, &#8220;It was Dihya (a handsome person amongst the companions of the Prophet ).&#8221;  Later on Um Salama said, &#8220;By Allah! I thought he was none but Dihya, till I heard the  Prophet talking about Gabriel in his sermon.&#8221; (The Sub-narrator asked Abu &#8216;Uthman,  &#8220;From where have you heard this narration?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;From Usama bin  Zaid.&#8221;) </font></p>

May Allah forgive him. Then &#8216;Umar  took the bucket and in his hands it turned into a very large bucket. I had never seen  anyone amongst: the people who could draw the water as strongly as &#8216;Umar till all the  people drank their fill and watered their camels that knelt down there. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Jews came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and told him that a man  and a woman from amongst them had committed illegal sexual intercourse. Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said to them, &#8220;What do you find in the Torah (old Testament) about the legal  punishment of Ar-Rajm (stoning)?&#8221; They replied, (But) we announce their crime and  lash them.&#8221; Abdullah bin Salam said, &#8220;You are telling a lie; Torah contains the  order of Rajm.&#8221; They brought and opened the Torah and one of them solaced his hand on  the Verse of Rajm and read the verses preceding and following it. Abdullah bin Salam said  to him, &#8220;Lift your hand.&#8221; When he lifted his hand, the Verse of Rajm was written  there. They said, &#8220;Muhammad has told the truth; the Torah has the Verse of Rajm. The  Prophet then gave the order that both of them should be stoned to death. (&#8216;Abdullah bin  &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I saw the man leaning over the woman to shelter her from the  stones.&#8221; </font></p>

Then he sold one of the sheep for  one Dinar, and brought one Dinar and a sheep to the Prophet. On that, the Prophet invoked  Allah to bless him in his deals. So &#8216;Urwa used to gain (from any deal) even if he bought  dust.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 839: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;A horse may be kept for one of  three purposes: for a man it may be a source of reward; for another it may be a means of  living; and for a third it may be a burden (a source of committing sins). As for the one  for whom it is a source of reward, he is the one who keeps his horse for the sake of Jihad  in Allah&#8217;s Cause; he ties it with a long rope on a pasture or in a garden. So whatever its  rope allows it to eat, will be regarded as good rewardable deeds (for its owner). And if  it breaks off its rope and jumps over one or two hillocks, even its dung will be  considered amongst his good deeds. And if it passes by a river and drinks water from it,  that will be considered as good deeds for his benefit) even if he has had no intention of  watering it. A horse is a shelter for the one who keeps it so that he may earn his living  honestly and takes it as a refuge to keep him from following illegal ways (of gaining  money), and does not forget the rights of Allah (i.e. paying the Zakat and allowing others  to use it for Allah&#8217;s Sake). But a horse is a burden (and a source of committing sins for  him who keeps it out of pride and pretense and with the intention of harming the  Muslims.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet was asked about donkeys. He replied,  &#8220;Nothing has been revealed to be concerning them except this comprehensive Verse  (which covers everything) :&#8211;&#8216;Then whosoever has done good equal to the weight of an atom  (or a small ant), Shall see it (its reward) And whosoever has done evil equal to the  weight of an atom (or a small ) ant), Shall see it (Its punishment).&#8221; (99.7-8) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle reached Khaibar in the early morning and  the people of Khaibar came out with their spades, and when they saw the Prophet they said,  &#8220;Muhammad and his army!&#8221; and returned hurriedly to take refuge in the fort. The  Prophet raised his hands and said, &#8220;Allah is Greater! Khaibar is ruined ! If we  approach a nation, then miserable is the morning of those who are warned.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I hear many narrations  from you but I forget them.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Spread your covering sheet.&#8221; I  spread my sheet and he moved both his hands as if scooping something and emptied them in  the sheet and said, &#8220;Wrap it.&#8221; I wrapped it round my body, and since then I have  never forgotten a single Hadith. </font></p>

Then a time will come upon the people when a group of people will wage a holy war, and it will be said, &#8220;Is there amongst you a none who has accompanied the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; And so victory will be bestowed on them. Then a time will come upon the people when a group of people will wage a holy war, and it will be said, &#8220;Is there amongst you anyone who has been in the company of the companions of the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; And victory will be bestowed on them.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 2:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Imran bin Husain:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;The best of my followers are those living in my generation (i.e. my contemporaries). and then those who will follow the latter&#8221; &#8216;Imran added, &#8220;I do not remember whether he mentioned two or three generations after his generation, then the Prophet added, &#8216;There will come after you, people who will bear witness without being asked to do so, and will be treacherous and untrustworthy, and they will vow and never fulfill their vows, and fatness will appear among them.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 3:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The best people are those living in my generation, and then those who will follow them, and then those who will follow the latter. Then there will come some people who will bear witness before taking oaths, and take oaths before bearing witness.&#8221; (Ibrahim, a sub-narrator said, &#8220;They used to beat us for witnesses and covenants when we were still children.&#8221;)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 4:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr bought a (camel) saddle from &#8216;Azib for thirteen Dirhams. Abu Bakr said to &#8216;Azib, &#8220;Tell Al-Bara&#8217; to carry the saddle for me.&#8221; &#8216;Azib said, &#8220;No, unless you relate to me what happened to you and Allah &#8216;s Apostle when you left Mecca while the pagans were in search of you.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;We left Mecca and we travel led continuously for that night and the following day till it was midday. I looked (around) searching for shade to take as shelter, and suddenly I came across a rock, and found a little shade there. So I cleaned the place and spread a bed for the Prophet in the shade and said to him, &#8216;Lie down, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8217; So the Prophet lay down and I went out, looking around to see if there was any person pursuing us. Suddenly I saw a shepherd driving his sheep towards the rock, seeking what we had already sought from it. I asked him, &#8216;To whom do you belong, O boy?&#8217; He said, &#8216;I belong to a man from Quraish.&#8217; He named the man and I recognized him. I asked him, &#8216;Is there any milk with your sheep?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Will you then milk (some) for us?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Then I asked him to tie the legs of one of the sheep and clean its udder, and then ordered him to clean his hands from dust. Then the shepherd cleaned his hands by striking his hands against one another. After doing so, he milked a small amount of milk. I used to keep for Allah&#8217;s Apostle a leather water-container, the mouth of which was covered with a piece of cloth. I poured water on the milk container till its lower part was cold. Then I took the milk to the Prophet whom I found awake. I said to him, &#8216;Drink, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8217; So he drank till I became pleased. Then I said, &#8216;It is time for us to move, O Allahs Apostle!&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; So we set out while the people (i.e. Quraish pagans) were searching for us, but none found us except Suraiqa bin Malik bin Jushum who was riding his horse. I said, &#8216;These are our pursuers who have found us. O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8217; He said, &#8216;Do not grieve, for Allah is with us.&#8221;</p>
<hr />

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to the Prophet while I was in the Cave. &#8220;If any of them should look under his feet, he would see us.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! What do you think of two (persons) the third of whom is Allah?&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle addressed the people saying, &#8220;Allah has given option to a slave to choose this world or what is with Him. The slave has chosen what is with Allah.&#8221; Abu Bakr wept, and we were astonished at his weeping caused by what the Prophet mentioned as to a Slave ( of Allah) who had been offered a choice, (we learned later on) that Allah&#8217;s Apostle himself was the person who was given the choice, and that Abu Bakr knew best of all of us. Allah&#8217;s Apostle added, &#8220;The person who has favored me most of all both with his company and wealth, is Abu Bakr. If I were to take a Khalil other than my Lord, I would have taken Abu Bakr as such, but (what relates us) is the Islamic brotherhood and friendliness. All the gates of the Mosque should be closed except the gate of Abu Bakr.&#8221;</p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 10:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Abi Mulaika:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of Kufa sent a letter to Ibn Az-Zubair, asking about (the inheritance of) (paternal) grandfather. He replied that the right of the inheritance of (paternal) grandfather is the same as that of father if the father is dead) and added, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216; If I were to take a Khalil from this nation, I would have taken him (i.e. Abu Bakr).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Ad-Darda:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While I was sitting with the Prophet, Abu Bakr came, lifting up one corner of h is garment uncovering h is knee. The Prophet said, &#8220;Your companion has had a quarrel.&#8221; Abu Bakr greeted (the Prophet ) and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! There was something (i.e. quarrel) between me and the Son of Al-Khattab. I talked to him harshly and then regretted that, and requested him to forgive me, but he refused. This is why I have come to you.&#8221; The Prophet said thrice, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! May Allah forgive you.&#8221; In the meanwhile, &#8216;Umar regretted (his refusal of Abu Bakr&#8217;s excuse) and went to Abu Bakr&#8217;s house and asked if Abu Bakr was there. They replied in the negative. So he came to the Prophet and greeted him, but signs of displeasure appeared on the face of the Prophet till Abu Bakr pitied (&#8216;Umar), so he knelt and said twice, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! By Allah! I was more unjust to him (than he to me).&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah sent me (as a Prophet) to you (people) but you said (to me), &#8216;You are telling a lie,&#8217; while Abu Bakr said, &#8216;He has said the truth,&#8217; and consoled me with himself and his money.&#8221; He then said twice, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you then give up harming my companion?&#8221; After that nobody harmed Abu Bakr.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;While a shepherd was amongst his sheep, a wolf attacked them and took away one sheep. When the shepherd chased the wolf, the wolf turned towards him and said, &#8216;Who will be its guard on the day of wild animals when nobody except I will be its shepherd. And while a man was driving a cow with a load on it, it turned towards him and spoke to him saying, &#8216;I have not been created for this purpose, but for ploughing.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;Glorified be Allah.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;But I believe in it and so does Abu Bakr end &#8216;Umar.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;While I was sleeping, I saw myself standing at a well, on it there was a bucket. I drew water from the well as much as Allah wished. Then Ibn Abi Quhafa (i.e. Abu Bakr) took the bucket from me and brought out one or two buckets (of water) and there was weakness in his drawing the water. May Allah forgive his weakness for him. Then the bucket turned into a very big one and Ibn Al-Khattab took it over and I had never seen such a mighty person amongst the people as him in performing such hard work, till the people drank to their satisfaction and watered their camels that knelt down there.&#8221;</p>

This is good.&#8217; He who is amongst those who pray will be called from the gate of the prayer (in Paradise) and he who is from the people of Jihad will be called from the gate of Jihad, and he who is from those&#8217; who give in charity (i.e. Zakat) will be called from the gate of charity, and he who is amongst those who observe fast will be called from the gate of fasting, the gate of Raiyan.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;He who is called from all those gates will need nothing,&#8221; He added, &#8220;Will anyone be called from all those gates, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, and I hope you will be among those, O Abu Bakr.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 19:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) Allah&#8217;s Apostle died while Abu Bakr was at a place called As-Sunah (Al-&#8216;Aliya) &#8216;Umar stood up and said, &#8220;By Allah! Allah&#8217;s Apostle is not dead!&#8221; &#8216;Umar (later on) said, &#8220;By Allah! Nothing occurred to my mind except that.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Verily! Allah will resurrect him and he will cut the hands and legs of some men.&#8221; Then Abu Bakr came and uncovered the face of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, kissed him and said, &#8220;Let my mother and father be sacrificed for you, (O Allah&#8217;s Apostle), you are good in life and in death. By Allah in Whose Hands my life is, Allah will never make you taste death twice.&#8221; Then he went out and said, &#8220;O oath-taker! Don&#8217;t be hasty.&#8221; When Abu Bakr spoke, &#8216;Umar sat down. Abu Bakr praised and glorified Allah and said, No doubt! Whoever worshipped Muhammad, then Muhammad is dead, but whoever worshipped Allah, then Allah is Alive and shall never die.&#8221; Then he recited Allah&#8217;s Statement.:&#8211; &#8220;(O Muhammad) Verily you will die, and they also will die.&#8221; (39.30) He also recited:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Muhammad is no more than an Apostle; and indeed many Apostles have passed away, before him, If he dies Or is killed, will you then Turn back on your heels? And he who turns back On his heels, not the least Harm will he do to Allah And Allah will give reward to those Who are grateful.&#8221; (3.144)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people wept loudly, and the Ansar were assembled with Sad bin &#8216;Ubada in the shed of Bani Saida. They said (to the emigrants). &#8220;There should be one &#8216;Amir from us and one from you.&#8221; Then Abu Bakr, Umar bin Al-Khattab and Abu &#8216;baida bin Al-Jarrah went to them. &#8216;Umar wanted to speak but Abu Bakr stopped him. &#8216;Umar later on used to say, &#8220;By Allah, I intended only to say something that appealed to me and I was afraid that Abu Bakr would not speak so well. Then Abu Bakr spoke and his speech was very eloquent. He said in his statement, &#8220;We are the rulers and you (Ansars) are the ministers (i.e. advisers),&#8221; Hubab bin Al-Mundhir said, &#8220;No, by Allah we won&#8217;t accept this. But there must be a ruler from us and a ruler from you.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;No, we will be the rulers and you will be the ministers, for they (i.e. Quarish) are the best family amongst the &#8216;Arabs and of best origin. So you should elect either &#8216;Umar or Abu &#8216;Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah as your ruler.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said (to Abu Bakr), &#8220;No but we elect you, for you are our chief and the best amongst us and the most beloved of all of us to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; So &#8216;Umar took Abu Bakr&#8217;s hand and gave the pledge of allegiance and the people too gave the pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr. Someone said, &#8220;You have killed Sad bin Ubada.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Allah has killed him.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said (in another narration), (&#8220;When the Prophet was on his death-bed) he looked up and said thrice, (Amongst) the Highest Companion (See Qur&#8217;an 4.69)&#8217; Aisha said, Allah benefited the people by their two speeches. &#8216;Umar frightened the people some of whom were hypocrites whom Allah caused to abandon Islam because of &#8216;Umar&#8217;s speech. Then Abu Bakr led the people to True Guidance and acquainted them with the right path they were to follow so that they went out reciting:&#8211; &#8220;Muhammad is no more than an Apostle and indeed many Apostles have passed away before him..&#8221; (3.144)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">We went out with Allah&#8217;s Apostle on one of his journeys till we reached Al-Baida or Dhatul-Jaish where my necklace got broken (and lost). Allah&#8217;s Apostle stopped to search for it and the people too stopped with him. There was no water at that place and they had no water with them. So they went to Abu Bakr and said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see what &#8216;Aisha has done? She has made Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the people stop where there is no water and they have no water with them. Abu Bakr came while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was sleeping with his head on my thigh and said, &#8220;You detained Allah Apostle and the people where there is no water and they have no water.&#8221; He then admonished me and said what Allah wished and pinched me at my flanks with his hands, but I did not move because the head of Allah&#8217;s Apostle was on my thigh .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle kept on sleeping till be got up in the morning and found no water. Then Allah revealed the Divine Verse of Tayammum, and the people performed Tayammum. Usaid bin AlHudair said. &#8220;O family of Abu Bakr! This is not the first blessings of yours.&#8221; We urged the camel on which I was sitting to get up from its place and the necklace was found under it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 23:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ashari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I performed ablution in my house and then went out and said, &#8220;Today I shall stick to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and stay with him all this day of mine (in his service).&#8221; I went to the Mosque and asked about the Prophet . They said, &#8220;He had gone in this direction.&#8221; So I followed his way, asking about him till he entered a place called Bir Aris. I sat at its gate that was made of date-palm leaves till the Prophet finished answering the call of nature and performed ablution. Then I went up to him to see him sitting at the well of Aris at the middle of its edge with his legs uncovered, hanging in the well. I greeted him and went back and sat at the gate. I said, &#8220;Today I will be the gatekeeper of the Prophet.&#8221; Abu Bakr came and pushed the gate. I asked, &#8220;Who is it?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Abu Bakr.&#8221; I told him to wait, went in and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Abu Bakr asks for permission to enter.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Admit him and give him the glad tidings that he will be in Paradise.&#8221; So I went out and said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;Come in, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle gives you the glad tidings that you will be in Paradise&#8221; Abu Bakr entered and sat on the right side of Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the built edge of the well and hung his legs n the well as the Prophet did and uncovered his legs. I then returned and sat (at the gate). I had left my brother performing ablution and he intended to follow me. So I said (to myself). &#8220;If Allah wants good for so-and-so (i.e. my brother) He will bring him here.&#8221; Suddenly somebody moved the door. I asked, &#8220;Who is it?&#8221; He said, &#8220;&#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab.&#8221; I asked him to wait, went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, greeted him and said, &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks the permission to enter.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Admit him, and give him the glad tidings that he will be in Paradise.&#8221; I went to &#8220;Umar and said &#8220;Come in, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle, gives you the glad tidings that you will be in Paradise.&#8221; So he entered and sat beside Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the built edge of the well on the left side and hung his legs in the well. I returned and sat (at the gate) and said, (to myself), &#8220;If Allah wants good for so-and-so, He will bring him here.&#8221; Somebody came and moved the door. I asked &#8220;Who is it?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Uthman bin Affan.&#8221; I asked him to wait and went to the Prophet and informed him. He said, &#8220;Admit him, and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise, I asked him to wait and went to the Prophet and informed him. He said, &#8220;Admit him, and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise after a calamity that will befall him.&#8221; So I went up to him and said to him, &#8220;Come in; Allah&#8217;s Apostle gives you the glad tidings of entering Paradise after a calamity that will befall you. &#8220;Uthman then came in and found that the built edge of the well was occupied, so he sat opposite to the Prophet on the other side. Said bin Al-Musaiyab said, &#8220;I interpret this (narration) in terms of their graves.&#8221;</p>

I always hoped that Allah will keep you with your two companions, for I often heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;I, Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar were (somewhere). I, Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar did (something).

Abu Bakr came and pulled &#8216;Uqba away from the Prophet and said, &#8220;Do you intend to kill a man just because he says: &#8216;My Lord is Allah, and he has brought forth to you the Evident Signs from your Lord?&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A man asked the Prophet about the Hour (i.e. Day of Judgment) saying, &#8220;When will the Hour be?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;What have you prepared for it?&#8221; The man said, &#8220;Nothing, except that I love Allah and His Apostle.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;You will be with those whom you love.&#8221; We had never been so glad as we were on hearing that saying of the Prophet (i.e., &#8220;You will be with those whom you love.&#8221;) Therefore, I love the Prophet, Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar, and I hope that I will be with them because of my love for them though my deeds are not similar to theirs.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Among the nations before you there used to be people who were inspired (though they were not prophets). And if there is any of such a persons amongst my followers, it is &#8216;Umar.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, &#8220;Among the nation of Bani Israel who lived before you, there were men who used to be inspired with guidance though they were not prophets, and if there is any of such persons amongst my followers, it is &#8216;Umar.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whilst a shepherd was amongst his sheep, a wolf attacked them and took away a sheep. The shepherd chased it and got that sheep freed from the wolf. The wolf turned towards the shepherd and said, &#8216;Who will guard the sheep on the day of wild animals when it will have no shepherd except myself?&#8221; The people said, &#8220;Glorified be Allah.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;But I believe in it and so do Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar although Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar were not present there (at the place of the event).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;While I was sleeping, the people were presented to me (in a dream). They were wearing shirts, some of which were merely covering their (chests). and some were a bit longer. &#8216;Umar was presented before me and his shirt was so long that he was dragging it.&#8221; They asked, &#8220;How have you interpreted it, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Religion.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Miswar bin Makhrama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When &#8216;Umar was stabbed, he showed signs of agony. Ibn &#8216;Abbas, as if intending to encourage &#8216;Umar, said to him, &#8220;O Chief of the believers! Never mind what has happened to you, for you have been in the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and you kept good relations with him and you parted with him while he was pleased with you. Then you were in the company of Abu Bakr and kept good relations with him and you parted with him (i.e. he died) while he was pleased with you. Then you were in the company of the Muslims, and you kept good relations with them, and if you leave them, you will leave them while they are pleased with you.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, (to Ibn &#8220;Abbas), &#8220;As for what you have said about the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his being pleased with me, it is a favor, Allah did to me; and as for what you have said about the company of Abu Bakr and his being pleased with me, it is a favor Allah did to me; and concerning my impatience which you see, is because of you and your companions. By Allah! If (at all) I had gold equal to the earth, I would have ransomed myself with it from the Punishment of Allah before I meet Him.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While I was with the Prophet in one of the gardens of Medina, a man came and asked me to open the gate. The Prophet said to me, &#8220;Open the gate for him and give him the glad tidings that he will enter Paradise.&#8221; I opened (the gate) for him, and behold! It was Abu Bakr. I informed him of the glad tidings the Prophet had said, and he praised Allah. Then another man came and asked me to open the gate. The Prophet said to me &#8220;Open (the gate) and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise.&#8221; I opened (the gate) for him, and behold! It was &#8216;Umar. I informed him of what the Prophet had said, and he praised Allah. Then another man came and asked me to open the gate. The Prophet said to me. &#8220;Open (the gate) for him and inform him of the glad tidings, of entering Paradise with a calamity which will befall him. &#8221; Behold ! It was &#8216;Uthman, I informed him of what Allah&#8217;s Apostle had said. He praised Allah and said, &#8220;I seek Allah&#8217;s Aid.&#8221;</p>

The Prophet said, &#8220;Admit him and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise.&#8221; Behold! It was &#8216;Umar. Then another man came, asking the permission to enter. The Prophet kept silent for a short while and then said, &#8220;Admit him and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise with a calamity which will befall him.&#8221; Behold! It was &#8216;Uthman bin &#8216;Affan. &#8216;Asim, in another narration, said that the Prophet was sitting in a place where there was water, and he was uncovering both his knees or his knee, and when &#8216;Uthman entered, he covered them (or it).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ubaid-ullah bin &#8216;Adi bin Al-Khiyar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Miswar bin Makhrama and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Aswad bin &#8216;Abu Yaghuth said (to me), &#8220;What forbids you to talk to &#8216;Uthman about his brother Al-Walid because people have talked much about him?&#8221; So I went to &#8216;Uthman and when he went out for prayer I said (to him), &#8220;I have something to say to you and it is a piece of advice for you &#8221; &#8216;Uthman said, &#8220;O man, from you.&#8221; (Umar said: I see that he said, &#8220;I seek Refuge with Allah from you.&#8221;) So I left him and went to them. Then the messenger of Uthman came and I went to him (i.e. &#8216;Uthman), &#8216;Uthman asked, &#8220;What is your advice?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Allah sent Muhammad with the Truth, and revealed the Divine Book (i.e. Quran) to him; and you were amongst those who followed Allah and His Apostle, and you participated in the two migrations (to Ethiopia and to Medina) and enjoyed the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and saw his way. No doubt, the people are talking much about Al-Walid.&#8221; &#8216;Uthman said, &#8220;Did you receive your knowledge directly from Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; I said, &#8220;No, but his knowledge did reach me and it reached (even) to a virgin in her seclusion.&#8221; &#8216;Uthman said, &#8220;And then Allah sent Muhammad with the Truth and I was amongst those who followed Allah and His Apostle and I believed in what ever he (i.e. the Prophet) was sent with, and participated in two migrations, as you have said, and I enjoyed the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and gave the pledge of allegiance him. By Allah! I never disobeyed him, nor did I cheat him till Allah took him unto Him. Then I treated Abu Bakr and then &#8216;Umar similarly and then I was made Caliph. So, don&#8217;t I have rights similar to theirs?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Then what are these talks reaching me from you people? Now, concerning what you mentioned about the question of Al-Walid, Allah willing, I shall deal with him according to what is right.&#8221; Then he called &#8216;Ali and ordered him to flog him, and &#8216;Ali flogged him (i.e. Al-Walid) eighty lashes.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle ascended the (mountain) of Uhud with Abu Bakr and &#8216;Uthman and it shook. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Be calm, O Uhud!&#8221; I think he stroked it with his foot and added, &#8220;There is none on you but a Prophet, a Siddiq and two martyrs.&#8221; (The two martyrs were Umar and Uthman) (See Hadith No. 24)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 47:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the lifetime of the Prophet we considered Abu Bakr as peerless and then &#8216;Umar and then &#8216;Uthman (coming next to him in superiority) and then we used not to differentiate between the companions of the Prophet</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 48:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Uthman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the son of Muhib) An Egyptian who came and performed the Hajj to the Kaba saw some people sitting. He enquire, &#8220;Who are these people?&#8221; Somebody said, &#8220;They are the tribe of Quraish.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Who is the old man sitting amongst them?&#8221; The people replied, &#8220;He is &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Ibn Umar! I want to ask you about something; please tell me about it. Do you know that &#8216;Uthman fled away on the day (of the battle) of Uhud?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The (Egyptian) man said, &#8220;Do you know that &#8216;Uthman was absent on the day (of the battle) of Badr and did not join it?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;Do you know that he failed to attend the Ar Ridwan pledge and did not witness it (i.e. Hudaibiya pledge of allegiance)?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;Allahu Akbar!&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Let me explain to you (all these three things). As for his flight on the day of Uhud, I testify that Allah has excused him and forgiven him; and as for his absence from the battle of Badr, it was due to the fact that the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle was his wife and she was sick then. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to him, &#8220;You will receive the same reward and share (of the booty) as anyone of those who participated in the battle of Badr (if you stay with her).&#8217; As for his absence from the Ar-Ridwan pledge of allegiance, had there been any person in Mecca more respectable than &#8216;Uthman (to be sent as a representative). Allah&#8217;s Apostle would have sent him instead of him. No doubt, Allah&#8217;s Apostle had sent him, and the incident of the Ar-Ridwan pledge of Allegiance happened after &#8216;Uthman had gone to Mecca. Allah&#8217;s Apostle held out his right hand saying, &#8216;This is &#8216;Uthman&#8217;s hand.&#8217; He stroke his (other) hand with it saying, &#8216;This (pledge of allegiance) is on the behalf of &#8216;Uthman.&#8217; Then Ibn &#8216;Umar said to the man, &#8216;Bear (these) excuses in mind with you.&#8217;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 49:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet ascended the mountain of Uhud and Abu Bakr, &#8216;Umar and &#8216;Uthman were accompanying him. The mountain gave a shake (i.e. trembled underneath them) . The Prophet said, &#8220;O Uhud ! Be calm.&#8221; I think that the Prophet hit it with his foot, adding, &#8220;For upon you there are none but a Prophet, a Siddiq and two martyrs.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 50:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amr bin Maimun:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I saw &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab a few days before he was stabbed in Medina. He was standing with Hudhaifa bin Al-Yaman and &#8216;Uthman bin Hunaif to whom he said, &#8220;What have you done? Do you think that you have imposed more taxation on the land (of As-Swad i.e. &#8216;Iraq) than it can bear?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;We have imposed on it what it can bear because of its great yield.&#8221; &#8216;Umar again said, &#8220;Check whether you have imposed on the land what it can not bear.&#8221; They said, &#8220;No, (we haven&#8217;t).&#8221; &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;If Allah should keep me alive I will let the widows of Iraq need no men to support them after me.&#8221; But only four days had elapsed when he was stabbed (to death ). The day he was stabbed, I was standing and there was nobody between me and him (i.e. Umar) except Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas. Whenever Umar passed between the two rows, he would say, &#8220;Stand in straight lines.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he saw no defect (in the rows), he would go forward and start the prayer with Takbir. He would recite Surat Yusuf or An-Nahl or the like in the first Rak&#8217;a so that the people may have the time to Join the prayer. As soon as he said Takbir, I heard him saying, &#8220;The dog has killed or eaten me,&#8221; at the time he (i.e. the murderer) stabbed him. A non-Arab infidel proceeded on carrying a double-edged knife and stabbing all the persons he passed by on the right and left (till) he stabbed thirteen persons out of whom seven died. When one of the Muslims saw that, he threw a cloak on him. Realizing that he had been captured, the non-Arab infidel killed himself, &#8216;Umar held the hand of &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Auf and let him lead the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who were standing by the side of &#8216;Umar saw what I saw, but the people who were in the other parts of the Mosque did not see anything, but they lost the voice of &#8216;Umar and they were saying, &#8220;Subhan Allah! Subhan Allah! (i.e. Glorified be Allah).&#8221; Abdur-Rahman bin Auf led the people a short prayer. When they finished the prayer, &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Ibn &#8216;Abbas! Find out who attacked me.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas kept on looking here and there for a short time and came to say. &#8220;The slave of Al Mughira.&#8221; On that &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;The craftsman?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;May Allah curse him. I did not treat him unjustly. All the Praises are for Allah Who has not caused me to die at the hand of a man who claims himself to be a Muslim. No doubt, you and your father (Abbas) used to love to have more non-Arab infidels in Medina.&#8221; Al-Abbas had the greatest number of slaves. Ibn &#8216;Abbas said to &#8216;Umar. &#8220;If you wish, we will do.&#8221; He meant, &#8220;If you wish we will kill them.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;You are mistaken (for you can&#8217;t kill them) after they have spoken your language, prayed towards your Qibla, and performed Hajj like yours.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Umar was carried to his house, and we went along with him, and the people were as if they had never suffered a calamity before. Some said, &#8220;Do not worry (he will be Alright soon).&#8221; Some said, &#8220;We are afraid (that he will die).&#8221; Then an infusion of dates was brought to him and he drank it but it came out (of the wound) of his belly. Then milk was brought to him and he drank it, and it also came out of his belly. The people realized that he would die. We went to him, and the people came, praising him. A young man came saying, &#8220;O chief of the believers! Receive the glad tidings from Allah to you due to your company with Allah&#8217;s Apostle and your superiority in Islam which you know. Then you became the ruler (i.e. Caliph) and you ruled with justice and finally you have been martyred.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I wish that all these privileges will counterbalance (my shortcomings) so that I will neither lose nor gain anything.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the young man turned back to leave, his clothes seemed to be touching the ground. &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Call the young man back to me.&#8221; (When he came back) &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O son of my brother! Lift your clothes, for this will keep your clothes clean and save you from the Punishment of your Lord.&#8221; &#8216;Umar further said, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar! See how much I am in debt to others.&#8221; When the debt was checked, it amounted to approximately eighty-six thousand. &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;If the property of &#8216;Umar&#8217;s family covers the debt, then pay the debt thereof; otherwise request it from Bani &#8216;Adi bin Ka&#8217;b, and if that too is not sufficient, ask for it from Quraish tribe, and do not ask for it from any one else, and pay this debt on my behalf.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umar then said (to &#8216;Abdullah), &#8220;Go to &#8216;Aisha (the mother of the believers) and say: &#8220;Umar is paying his salutation to you. But don&#8217;t say: &#8216;The chief of the believers,&#8217; because today I am not the chief of the believers. And say: &#8220;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks the permission to be buried with his two companions (i.e. the Prophet, and Abu Bakr).&#8221; Abdullah greeted &#8216;Aisha and asked for the permission for entering, and then entered to her and found her sitting and weeping. He said to her, &#8220;&#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab is paying his salutations to you, and asks the permission to be buried with his two companions.&#8221; She said, &#8220;I had the idea of having this place for myself, but today I prefer Umar to myself.&#8221; When he returned it was said (to &#8216;Umar), &#8220;&#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar has come.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Make me sit up.&#8221; Somebody supported him against his body and &#8216;Umar asked (&#8216;Abdullah), &#8220;What news do you have?&#8221; He said, &#8220;O chief of the believers! It is as you wish. She has given the permission.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Praise be to Allah, there was nothing more important to me than this. So when I die, take me, and greet &#8216;Aisha and say: &#8220;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks the permission (to be buried with the Prophet ), and if she gives the permission, bury me there, and if she refuses, then take me to the grave-yard of the Muslims.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Hafsa (the mother of the believers) came with many other women walking with her. When we saw her, we went away. She went in (to &#8216;Umar) and wept there for sometime. When the men asked for permission to enter, she went into another place, and we heard her weeping inside. The people said (to &#8216;Umar), &#8220;O chief of the believers! Appoint a successor.&#8221; Umar said, &#8220;I do not find anyone more suitable for the job than the following persons or group whom Allah&#8217;s Apostle had been pleased with before he died.&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar mentioned &#8216;Ali, &#8216;Uthman, AzZubair, Talha, Sad and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman (bin Auf) and said, &#8220;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar will be a witness to you, but he will have no share in the rule. His being a witness will compensate him for not sharing the right of ruling. If Sad becomes the ruler, it will be alright: otherwise, whoever becomes the ruler should seek his help, as I have not dismissed him because of disability or dishonesty.&#8221; &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;I recommend that my successor takes care of the early emigrants; to know their rights and protect their honor and sacred things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also recommend that he be kind to the Ansar who had lived in Medina before the emigrants and Belief had entered their hearts before them. I recommend that the (ruler) should accept the good of the righteous among them and excuse their wrong-doers, and I recommend that he should do good to all the people of the towns (Al-Ansar), as they are the protectors of Islam and the source of wealth and the source of annoyance to the enemy. I also recommend that nothing be taken from them except from their surplus with their consent. I also recommend that he do good to the &#8216;Arab bedouin, as they are the origin of the &#8216;Arabs and the material of Islam. He should take from what is inferior, amongst their properties and distribute that to the poor amongst them. I also recommend him concerning Allah&#8217;s and His Apostle&#8217;s protectees (i.e. Dhimmis) to fulfill their contracts and to fight for them and not to overburden them with what is beyond their ability.&#8221; So when &#8216;Umar expired, we carried him out and set out walking. &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar greeted (&#8216;Aisha) and said, &#8220;&#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks for the permission.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;Bring him in.&#8221; He was brought in and buried beside his two companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he was buried, the group (recommended by &#8216;Umar) held a meeting. Then &#8216;Abdur-Rahman said, &#8221; Reduce the candidates for rulership to three of you.&#8221; Az-Zubair said, &#8220;I give up my right to Ali.&#8221; Talha said, &#8220;I give up my right to &#8216;Uthman,&#8221; Sad, &#8216;I give up my right to &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf.&#8221; &#8216;Abdur-Rahman then said (to &#8216;Uthman and &#8216;Ali), &#8220;Now which of you is willing to give up his right of candidacy to that he may choose the better of the (remaining) two, bearing in mind that Allah and Islam will be his witnesses.&#8221; So both the sheiks (i.e. &#8216;Uthman and &#8216;Ali) kept silent. &#8216;Abdur-Rahman said, &#8220;Will you both leave this matter to me, and I take Allah as my Witness that I will not choose but the better of you?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; So &#8216;Abdur-Rahman took the hand of one of them (i.e. &#8216;Ali) and said, &#8220;You are related to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and one of the earliest Muslims as you know well. So I ask you by Allah to promise that if I select you as a ruler you will do justice, and if I select &#8216;Uthman as a ruler you will listen to him and obey him.&#8221; Then he took the other (i.e. &#8216;Uthman) aside and said the same to him. When &#8216;Abdur-Rahman secured (their agreement to) this covenant, he said, &#8220;O &#8216;Uthman! Raise your hand.&#8221; So he (i.e. &#8216;Abdur-Rahman) gave him (i.e. &#8216;Uthman) the solemn pledge, and then &#8216;Ali gave him the pledge of allegiance and then all the (Medina) people gave him the pledge of allegiance.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 51:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sahl bin Sad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Tomorrow I will give the flag to a man with whose leadership Allah will grant (the Muslim) victory.&#8221; So the people kept on thinking the whole night as to who would be given the flag. The next morning the people went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and every one of them hoped that he would be given the flag. The Prophet said, &#8220;Where is Ali bin Abi Talib?&#8221; The people replied, &#8220;He is suffering from eye trouble, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Send for him and bring him to me.&#8221; So when &#8216;Ali came, the Prophet spat in his eyes and invoked good on him, and he became alright as if he had no ailment. The Prophet then gave him the flag. &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall I fight them (i.e. enemy) till they become like us?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Proceed to them steadily till you approach near to them and then invite them to Islam and inform them of their duties towards Allah which Islam prescribes for them, for by Allah, if one man is guided on the right path (i.e. converted to Islam) through you, it would be better for you than (a great number of) red camels.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ali happened to stay behind the Prophet and (did not join him) during the battle of Khaibar for he was having eye trouble. Then he said, &#8220;How could I remain behind Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; So &#8216;Ali set out following the Prophet , When it was the eve of the day in the morning of which Allah helped (the Muslims) to conquer it, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;I will give the flag (to a man), or tomorrow a man whom Allah and His Apostle love will take the flag,&#8221; or said, &#8220;A man who loves Allah and His Apostle; and Allah will grant victory under his leadership.&#8221; Suddenly came &#8216;Ali whom we did not expect. The people said, &#8220;This is &#8216;Ali.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave him the flag and Allah granted victory under his leadership.</p>

How (was this name given to &#8216;Ali)?&#8221; Sahl said, &#8220;&#8216;Ali went to Fatima and then came out and slept in the Mosque. The Prophet asked Fatima, &#8220;Where is your cousin?&#8221; She said, &#8220;In the Mosque.&#8221; The Prophet went to him and found that his (i.e. Ali&#8217;s) covering sheet had slipped of his back and dust had soiled his back. The Prophet started wiping the dust off his back and said twice, &#8220;Get up! O Abu Turab (i.e. O. man with the dust).&#8221;</p>

Ali added &#8220;So the Prophet came to us, while we had gone to our bed I wanted to get up but the Prophet said, &#8220;Remain at your place&#8221;. Then he sat down between us till I found the coolness of his feet on my chest. Then he said, &#8220;Shall I teach you a thing which is better than what you have asked me? When you go to bed, say, &#8216;Allahu-Akbar&#8217; thirty-four times, and &#8216;Subhan Allah thirty-three times, and &#8216;Alhamdu-lillah thirty-three times for that is better for you both than a servant.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The people used to say, &#8220;Abu Huraira narrates too many narrations.&#8221; In fact I used to keep close to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and was satisfied with what filled my stomach. I ate no leavened bread and dressed no decorated striped clothes, and never did a man or a woman serve me, and I often used to press my belly against gravel because of hunger, and I used to ask a man to recite a Quranic Verse to me although I knew it, so that he would take me to his home and feed me. And the most generous of all the people to the poor was Ja&#8217;far bin Abi Talib. He used to take us to his home and offer us what was available therein. He would even offer us an empty folded leather container (of butter) which we would split and lick whatever was in it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatima sent somebody to Abu Bakr asking him to give her her inheritance from the Prophet from what Allah had given to His Apostle through Fai (i.e. booty gained without fighting). She asked for the Sadaqa (i.e. wealth assigned for charitable purposes) of the Prophet at Medina, and Fadak, and what remained of the Khumus (i.e., one-fifth) of the Khaibar booty. Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;We (Prophets), our property is not inherited, and whatever we leave is Sadaqa, but Muhammad&#8217;s Family can eat from this property, i.e. Allah&#8217;s property, but they have no right to take more than the food they need.&#8217; By Allah! I will not bring any change in dealing with the Sadaqa of the Prophet (and will keep them) as they used to be observed in his (i.e. the Prophet&#8217;s) life-time, and I will dispose with it as Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to do,&#8221; Then &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and that Muhammad is His Apostle,&#8221; and added, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! We acknowledge your superiority.&#8221; Then he (i.e. &#8216;Ali) mentioned their own relationship to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and their right. Abu Bakr then spoke saying, &#8220;By Allah in Whose Hands my life is. I love to do good to the relatives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle rather than to my own relatives&#8221; Abu Bark added: Look at Muhammad through his family (i.e. if you are no good to his family you are not good to him).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Ali demanded the hand of the daughter of Abu Jahl. Fatima heard of this and went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Your people think that you do not become angry for the sake of your daughters as &#8216;Ali is now going to marry the daughter of Abu Jahl. &#8220;On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up and after his recitation of Tashah-hud. I heard him saying, &#8220;Then after! I married one of my daughters to Abu Al-&#8216;As bin Al-Rabi&#8217; (the husband of Zainab, the daughter of the Prophet ) before Islam and he proved truthful in whatever he said to me. No doubt, Fatima is a part of me, I hate to see her being troubled. By Allah, the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Enemy cannot be the wives of one man.&#8221; So &#8216;Ali gave up that engagement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Al-Miswar further said: I heard the Prophet talking and he mentioned a son-in-law of his belonging to the tribe of Bani &#8216;Abd-Shams.

The Qa&#8217;if said.

The Prophet said, &#8216;If a reputable man amongst the children of Bani Israel committed a theft, they used to forgive him, but if a poor man committed a theft, they would cut his hand. But I would cut even the hand of Fatima (i.e. the daughter of the Prophet) if she committed a theft.&#8221;</p>

He was seen by Ibn &#8216;Umar not performing his bowing and prostrations in a perfect manner. So Ibn &#8216;Umar told him to repeat his prayer. Harmala, the freed slave of Usama bin Zaid said that while he was in the company of &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar, Al-Hajjaj bin Aiman came in and (while praying) he did not perform his bowing and prostrations properly. So Ibn &#8216;Umar told him to repeat his prayer. When he went away, Ibn &#8216;Umar asked me, &#8220;Who is he?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Al-Hajjaj bin Um Aiman.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;If Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw him, he would have loved him.&#8221; Then Ibn &#8216;Umar mentioned the love of the Prophet for the children of Um Aimn.

Is there amongst you the one who keeps the secrets of the Prophet which nobody knows except him?&#8221; Abu Darda further asked, &#8220;How does &#8216;Abdullah (bin Mas&#8217;ud) recite the Sura starting with, &#8216;By the Night as it conceals (the light).&#8221; (92.1) Then I recited before him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;By the Night as it envelops: And by the Day as it appears in brightness; And by male and female.&#8217; (91.1-3) On this Abu Ad-Darda&#8217; said, &#8220;By Allah, the Prophet made me recite the Sura in this way while I was listening to him (reciting it).&#8221;</p>

Weren&#8217;t there amongst you the man who was given Allah&#8217;s Refuge from the Satan? And weren&#8217;t there amongst you the man who used to keep the (Prophet&#8217;s) secrets which nobody else knew?

<hr />

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abu Mulaika:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muawiya offered one Rak&#8217;a Witr prayer after the &#8216;Isha prayer, and at that time a freed slave of Ibn &#8216;Abbas was present. He (i.e. the slave) went to Ibn &#8216;Abbas (and told him that Muawiya offered one Rak&#8217;a Witr prayer).

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Salama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;Once Allah&#8217;s Apostle said (to me), &#8216;O Aish (&#8216;Aisha)! This is Gabriel greeting you.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Peace and Allah&#8217;s Mercy and Blessings be on him, you see what I don&#8217;t see&#8217; &#8221; She was addressing Allah &#8216;s Apostle.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ash&#8217;ari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Many amongst men attained perfection but amongst women none attained the perfection except Mary, the daughter of Imran and Asiya, the wife of Pharaoh. And the superiority of &#8216;Aisha to other women is like the superiority of Tharid (i.e. an Arabic dish) to other meals.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 114:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The superiority of &#8216;Aisha over other women is like the superiority of Tharid to other meals.&#8221;</p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 116:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Wail:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When &#8216;Ali sent &#8216;Ammar and Al-Hasan to (the people of) Kufa to urge them to fight, &#8216;Ammar addressed them saying, &#8220;I know that she (i.e. &#8216;Aisha) is the wife of the Prophet in this world and in the Hereafter (world to come), but Allah has put you to test, whether you will follow Him (i.e. Allah) or her.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That she borrowed a necklace from Asma&#8217; and it was lost. Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent some of his companions to look for it. During their journey the time of prayer was due and they prayed without ablution. When they returned to the Prophet they complained about it. So the Divine Verse of Tayammum was revealed. Usaid bin Hudair said (to &#8216;Aisha), &#8220;May Allah reward you handsomely. By Allah, whenever you have a difficulty, Allah took you out of it and brought with it, a Blessing for the Muslims.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 118:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hisham&#8217;s father:</p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 119:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hisham&#8217;s father:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people used to send presents to the Prophet on the day of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s turn. &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;My companions (i.e. the other wives of the Prophet) gathered in the house of Um Salama and said, &#8220;0 Um Salama! By Allah, the people choose to send presents on the day of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s turn and we too, love the good (i.e. presents etc.) as &#8216;Aisha does. You should tell Allah&#8217;s Apostle to tell the people to send their presents to him wherever he may be, or wherever his turn may be.&#8221; Um Salama said that to the Prophet and he turned away from her, and when the Prophet returned to her (i.e. Um Salama), she repeated the same, and the Prophet again turned away, and when she told him the same for the third time, the Prophet said, &#8220;O Um Salama! Don&#8217;t trouble me by harming &#8216;Aisha, for by Allah, the Divine Inspiration never came to me while I was under the blanket of any woman amongst you except her.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Questioner</strong>:</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;There are those who come forth and claim that the Sahaabah differed in matters of &#8216;Aqeedah. What is the ruling on this? Please give us a fatwa, may you be rewarded.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Al-&#8216;Allâmah Sâlih al-Luhaydan</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Astaghfirullaah! No one says this, except a misguided innovator. He says that the Sahaabah differed whilst the Sahaabah were people of &#8216;aqeedah. If there was any disagreement between them, then it was merely in some of the affairs of ijtihaad related to deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the affairs of &#8216;aqeedah, that Allah is One and that He is All-Hearing and All-Seeing, and that He does what He wills, that He is the Supreme Creator, and that He is the Creator of everything and that He is aware of everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No! They did not differ (in Aqeedah). And no one brings up this affair, except a caller to fitnah. Except that he disguises himself &#8212; with his claim &#8212; that he is from the people of goodness. He may have known some good and started to speak with the good he knows, to mislead the people and drag them into the falsehood that he is inclined to and is eager in spreading.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he is from those who are deceived, let him seek Allah&#8217;s forgiveness and repent to Him and let him return to the people of knowledge and ask them. And if he is from those who like to conceal their agendas and cover their true objectives let him be exposed so the people can be protected from his evil.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillaah Al-Hamdulillaah wa salatu wa salaamu &#8216;ala rasulullaah<br />
Amma-ba&#8217;d</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>From The Virtues of Abu Bakr as-Siddiq (radiallaahu Ta&#8217;aala &#8216;anhu)<span style="font-size:large;"><br />
</span></strong></span>Jumu&#8217;ah khutbah given by <strong>Shaikh Muhammad ibn Salih al-&#8216;Uthaimeen (rahimahullaah)</strong></p>
<div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is for Allaah. All Praise is for Allaah. All Praise is for Allaah, The One Who sent His Messenger Muhammad (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) to the best of generations, and chose for him companions &#8211; the most whole and complete in intellect, the most upright in religion, the most abundant in knowledge, and the bravest hearts &#8211; a people who truly strove in the way of Allaah, Who established the Religion with them, and made them triumphant over all the world as they wished to make His Word the most high and victorious.</div>
</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I bear witness that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah, Who is Alone and has no partner, <strong>Illaahul Awaleen wal Akhireen</strong> (The True God of the first and the last), and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger, the seal of the Prophets and leader of the righteous. May Allaah&#8217;s peace and blessings be upon him, his family, companions and followers in perfection til the Day of Judgement. As to what proceeds:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oh slaves of Allaah! Know that Allaah chose Muhammad (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) from the children of Adam to send to all of mankind after him. Allaah, The Most High, chose to send him with the most perfect, sound and suitable Religion for the creation with regards to both their faith and wordly affairs. So for certain, his companions &#8211; whom he was sent &#8211; are the best of generations, as has been firmly and authentically reported that the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: <span style="color:#008000;"><em>The best of people are my generation, then those that follow them, then those that follow them</em></span>.Oh slaves of Allaah! Beware of what this generation of the companions possessed of virtue, struggled in the way of Allaah, inviting to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and supported the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam). Beware that they possessed numerous virtues and many great characteristics. By way of them, Allaah supported the religion of Islaam, and with it, made them victorious. And from them were the rightly-guided Caliphs and leaders, those who established the rule after the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) in the best way, thus preserving the Religion, and governing the people with justice and wisdom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their rule was the best of the past and the best of the future. And we don&#8217;t say this haphazardly or blindly, and we don&#8217;t say this as a mere unsupported claim. But we say this, as their actions bear witness to it, and speak for what they did.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most lofty of them in ability and highest in honor was <strong>Abu Bakr as-Siddiq</strong>, &#8216;Abdullaah ibn &#8216;Uthman (radiallaahu Ta&#8217;aala &#8216;anhu). <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The sun neither rose nor set above anyone &#8211; after the Prophets &#8211; better than Abu Bakr</strong></span>. The sun neither rose nor set &#8211; since Allaah (The Mighty and Majestic) created it until the Last Day &#8211; over anyone, after the Prophets (&#8216;alayhimi salaam), better than Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (radiallaahu Ta&#8217;aala &#8216;anhu).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) left him behind for his nation, appointing him the first ruler, after its Prophet. From a signal from him (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), which is very close to being clearly explicit, as it has been authentically reported in al-Bukhaaree that : <em><span style="color:#008000;">a woman came to the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) for a need. And he (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) ordered her to return to him later, meaning that he did not take care of her need at that time, but rather he ordered her to return to him later. And she said, <strong>&#8220;What if I don&#8217;t find you?&#8221; And he (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: Go to Abu Bakr.</strong></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an explicit quote, showing that Abu Bakr was to be the ruler after the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam). Likewise, <strong><span id="more-7578"></span></strong>he (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) intended to [command someone to write] in words that the rule was to pass to Abu Bakr As-Siddiq, and said: <em><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah and the Muslims refuse except for Abu Bakr</span></em>. And in another narration: <em><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah forbid that the believers should differ regarding Abu Bakr</span></em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) appointed him in a lesser position of leadership when he (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) ordered him [Abu Bakr] to lead the people in salat, so he [<strong>Abu Bakr] would lead them in salat during the sickness of the Prophet</strong> (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam). He (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) also appointed him to a position greater than that when he appointed him the <strong>leader of the people for the Hajj in the ninth year</strong> [after Hijra].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this is an indication that he [Abu Bakr] (radiallaahu &#8216;anhu) is the successor of him [the Prophet] (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam). And if there was anyone worthy of this position other than Abu Bakr, then the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) would have appointed him to lead the people in the salat and during the Hajj.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) addressed the people at the end of his life, he ordered the people to seal the branching doors to the masjid, except for the door of Abu Bakr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr was from the leading wealthy nobles of Quraish. Aimm Daghila witnessed for Abu Bakr, in front of the nobles of Quraish, that which is similar to what Khadijah witnessed for the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) when she said, &#8220;Verily you gain that which is lost, join the family ties, endure fatigue and weariness, host guests and aid those who represent the truth.&#8221; This is what Khadijah said to the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) when he informed her of what came to him of revelation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when the Prophet was sent on his mission of calling to Allaah, Abu Bakr rushed to Eeman (faith), and quickly believed in him, and did not hesitate when he (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) called him to Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr remained with him (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) in times of travel, residence and settlement. He (radiallaahu &#8216;anhu) did not leave the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) the entire period of his stay in Makkah. He accompanied him (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) in his Hijra (migration), and remained with him in Madeenah. Likewise, he [Abu Bakr] fought all of the battles, and <strong>five of the ten who were given glad tidings of Paradise accepted Islaam from him</strong>: &#8216;Uthman ibn &#8216;Affaan, Zubair ibn al-Awwam, Sa&#8217;d ibn Abee Waqqas, Talha ibn &#8216;Ubaidullah, and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman ibn &#8216;Awf (radiallaahu &#8216;anhum ajma&#8217;een).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah to join me and you with them in Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (radiallaahu &#8216;anhu) also <strong>bought seven Muslim slaves</strong> &#8211; who were being tortured by the kufaar due to their acceptance of Islaam &#8211; and freed them. From them was Bilal, the Mu`adhdhin (caller to prayer) of the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam). Thus, he [Abu Bakr] is <strong>&#8216;Ateeq, the one who frees</strong>. Abu Bakr also freed &#8216;Amr ibn Fuhaira, who accompanied both the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and Abu Bakr during the Hijra to serve them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (radiallaahu &#8216;anhu) was the most knowledgeable [from this Ummah] of the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), and his speech was both significant and meaningful, for the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) addressed the people at the end of his life and said: <span style="color:#008000;"><em>Verily, Allaah has chosen a servant between the world and between what is with Him (meaning what is with Allaah), and he has chosen what is with Him</em></span>. This is what he said, and none from the companions understood from it what Abu Bakr understood. As he understood that the chosen was the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), and he cried. And the people were astonished from his tears, as they didn&#8217;t understand what the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said as Abu Bakr understood it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It&#8217;s not strange. It&#8217;s not strange at all that Abu Bakr would be the most understanding of the speech of the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), for he remained with him the most. And it is something known that whoever increases in the company of someone, then he will be the most knowledgeable regarding their speech and meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, Abu Bakr (radiallaahu &#8216;anhu) was the most beloved of people to the Messenger, as he was asked about the <strong>most beloved of people to him</strong>, and he said: Abu Bakr. Thusly, he was the most beloved to him, even more than &#8216;Ali ibn Abi Talib (radiallaahu &#8216;anhu), who was his nephew and who married [the Prophet&#8217;s] daughter [Fatimah].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr (radiallaahu &#8216;anhu) has many virtues and characteristics that many from the companions did not possess. The Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) addressed the people and said: <em><span style="color:#008000;">Truly, he who gives the most to me from his wealth [in the sake of Allaah] and companionship is Abu Bakr</span></em>. Pay attention to this. He (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: he who gives the most, and he did not say &#8220;from the people who give the most.&#8221; Meaning he did not use that which refers to some, but rather that which refers to the best or most, and refers to unrestricted virtue. As he said: <em><span style="color:#008000;">Truly, he who gives the most to me from his wealth and companionship is Abu Bakr. And if I were to take a Khaleel (a close friend) from my nation, I would have taken Abu Bakr.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So who is a close friend or Khaleel? He is the one whose love spreads through the soul. As was mentioned by a poet about his sweetheart: you have spread through a path to my soul. And for that reason, they have named a close friend a Khaleel. The Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam): <span style="color:#008000;"><em>If I were to take a khaleel from my nation, then indeed, I would have taken Abu Bakr. But between us is the brotherhood of Islaam and friendship.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One time, Abu Bakr came to the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and said: Something has come between me and Ibnul-Khattab. So I quickly went to him and was regretful, and asked him to forgive me, which he refused to do, so I came to you. The Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam): Oh Abu Bakr: may Allaah forgive you. Oh Abu Bakr: may Allaah forgive you. Oh Abu Bakr: may Allaah forgive you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) seeking forgiveness for Abu Bakr was better than &#8216;Umar ibn al-Khattab seeking forgiveness for Abu Bakr. Then &#8216;Umar regretted what happened between him and Abu Bakr, and went to Abu Bakr&#8217;s home, and asked if he was there. And they replied in the negative. So he went to the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), and gave salaam, and made the face of the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) change into anger. So much so that Abu Bakr feared that the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) would say something which he&#8230; So Abu Bakr touched his (the Prophet&#8217;s) knees, and said, &#8220;Oh Messenger of Allaah. By Allaah, I was being oppressive. By Allaah, I was being oppressive.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How good were the companions? The individual who tells the truth explicitly &#8211; even if it is against him &#8211; even in the situation such as this when the face of the Prophet changed and showed anger due to what was mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) &#8211; while &#8216;Umar was listening &#8211; said: Allaah sent me (as a Prophet) to you (people) but you said (to me), &#8216;You are telling a lie,&#8217; while Abu Bakr said, &#8216;He has said the truth,&#8217; and consoled me with himself and his money. He then said twice: Won&#8217;t you then give up harming my companion? [Won&#8217;t you then give up harming my companion?] After that, Abu Bakr was never harmed again.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And with his soft and kind heart, Abu Bakr was the firmest of the companions with calamities and trials. For in the <strong>pact of al-Hudaybia</strong>, many of the companions could not handle all of the conditions which were agreed upon by the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and Quraish, which included:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; The Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) returning from Hudaybia without completing his &#8216;Umrah, even though he came to perform &#8216;Umrah with a camel to sacrifice. The ignorant zeal of the Quraish prevented them from letting him (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) enter Makkah, even though they would have welcomed someone else of the most severe disbelief and sinfulness to perform &#8216;Umrah. That Muhammad (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and his companions, who have more right to the ka&#8217;bah, were stopped by Quraish and prevented from the house of Allaah. In this, there was wisdom, which Allaah later revealed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the conditions that were agreed upon by the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and Quraish, they included:</p>
<ul>
<li>1- The Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) would return to Madeenah without completing the &#8216;Umrah.</li>
<li>2- Whoever came from Quraish to the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) would be returned to them &#8211; be he Muslim or not.</li>
<li>3- And whoever went to Quraish would not be returned to the Muslims.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They were all very heavy conditions, and difficult for the Muslims, but they were for the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam). The conditions were so difficult that the people began to talk about it, and &#8216;Umar even went to consult with the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) about them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said to him: Verily, I am the Messenger of Allaah, and I will not disobey Him while He is The One Who grants me victory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when &#8216;Umar saw that he did not get from the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), he went to Abu Bakr to seek his aid in the affair. And Abu Bakr said to him: &#8220;Oh man, he is the Messenger of Allaah, and will not disobey his Lord, while He is The One Who grants him victory.&#8221; And he grabbed his leather stir and said: &#8220;By Allaah, he (the Prophet) is upon the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Abu Bakr&#8217;s answer to &#8216;Umar was like the Prophet&#8217;s answer to &#8216;Umar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was a situation in which Abu Bakr (radiallaahu &#8216;anhu) was firm, and showed his strength and determination.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Another situation</strong> was the death of the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), and the bewilderment of the Muslims, as they had a right to be bewildered since they had just lost the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), and everything in Madeenah went dark just as his arrival enlightened everything. The Muslims were bewildered and astonished, so much so that &#8216;Umar stood and denied the death of the Prophet, and said that he did not die, and swore and said, &#8220;by Allaah, the Messenger of Allaah did not die, and will send him and he will cut some of your arms and legs off.&#8221; This is what he said to some of the people in the masjid while the people were gathered with &#8216;Umar due to his strength and solidity. But the calamity was great.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Abu Bakr, he came from a place of his outside of Madeenah, as it was [decreed] by the wisdom of Allaah that the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) was in better health on Monday &#8211; the day he died &#8211; than he was before. So Abu Bakr felt okay to leave to his place outside of Madeenah. And then the news of the Messenger&#8217;s passing reached him. He went to the Messenger&#8217;s house, uncovered him, and kissed him. And from this, the scholars hold that it is permissible to kiss the dead after their death. So he kissed him and said: &#8220;May my mother and father be sacrificed for you. You were good alive and dead.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he went out to the place, climbed the minbar, and addressed them with a firm heart and a mighty statement that deserves to be written in golden ink, saying: <em><span style="color:#008000;">Alaa man kanna ya&#8217;budu Muhammad fa inna Muhammadan qad mat; wa man kanna ya&#8217;bud Allaah, fa inna Allaaha Hayun La ya mut (As for he who used to worship Muhammad, then know that Muhammad has died. And as for he who used to worship Allaah, then Allaah is living and never dies.)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What a great and powerful statement!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everything which is connected to the creation &#8211; to the human being &#8211; and for sure, the human will pass on. And nothing will benefit him except what Allaah has ordained for him of benefit. And as for all that is connected to Allaah, such as worship, fear, hope, desire and awe, then it is success which occurs seeking Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Abu Bakr] said: As for he who used to worship Muhammad, then know that Muhammad has died. And as for he who used to worship Allaah, then Allaah is living and never dies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oh Allaah, grant us sincerity in your worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then [Abu Bakr] recited the statement of Allaah, The Most High: <span style="color:#008000;">Verily, you (Oh Muhammad) will die and verily, they (too)</span> will die. (Az-Zumar, ayah 30) and Allaah&#8217;s statement: <span style="color:#008000;">Muhammad is no more than a Messenger, and indeed (many) Messengers have passed away before him. If he dies or is killed, will you then turn back on your heels (as disbelievers)? And he who turns back on his heels, not the least harm will he do to Allaah, and Allaah will give reward to those who are grateful.</span> (Aali &#8216;Imran, ayah 144)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the second situation which demonstrated Abu Bakr&#8217;s strength when faced with difficulty and firmness in worrisome situations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <strong>third situation</strong>, then it is when he [Abu Bakr] wanted to send the army of Usamah after the death of the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), who had already sent the army in which they prepared for battle and took out posts at the outskirts of Madeenah, due to his falling ill. So when the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) died, Abu Bakr was determined to send the army. So &#8216;Umar (radiallaahu &#8216;anhu) and others consulted with him regarding the affair, and said: &#8220;Oh Abu Bakr, do not let the army go. We need them to fight the apostates.&#8221; But Abu Bakr had made up his mind to send the army, and said: &#8220;By Allaah, I will not stop an army which the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) has prepared to send.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what he said, and this is the third situation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <strong>fourth situation</strong> is when the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) died, and a group of people from the Arabs left Islaam, and denied the obligation of the zakat, for which Abu Bakr determined to fight them, due to their denial of the zakat. Some of the companions consulted with him, but he was set on fighting them and said: &#8220;<em><span style="color:#008000;">By Allaah, even if they denied me the tie of the camel which they gave to the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), then I would fight them for it.</span></em>&#8221; And in another narration: &#8220;<em><span style="color:#008000;">Even if they were to deny me a baby goat, then I would fight them over it.&#8221;&#8216; </span></em>Umar (radiallaahu &#8216;anhu) said that he knew that [Abu Bakr&#8217;s statement] was the truth.&#8217;Ali ibn Abi Talib (radiallaahu &#8216;anhu) described Abu Bakr (radiallaahu &#8216;anhu) when he told him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;You were the first of the people to accept Islaam, and the most sincere of them in Eeman (faith). You were the best of them as a companion, and the most like the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) in both guidance and humility, and the most generous of them to him. You succeeded him in the Religion well when the people left Islaam, and you held firm to the methodology of the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam). You were like a mountain that was not moved by the storm nor crushed by the quake. You are modest with yourself, and great with Allaah. And the closest people to you are the most obedient to Allaah, and the most pious.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is how &#8216;Ali ibn Abi Talib described him (radiallaahu &#8216;anhum).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr succeeded the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), and this was before he was buried, as the companions delayed his burial in order to establish the rule before the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) was put into the ground.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, Abu Bakr proceeded to rule the people in a very good manner. And Allaah blessed his succession, which was a short term of two years, three months, and nine nights. He (radiallaahu &#8216;anhu) died between the Maghrib and &#8216;Isha prayers on Tuesday, the evening of the 23rd of Jumad ath-Thani, 13 Hijra.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From his great blessings upon this nation (which Allaah bestowed upon him) is his appointing &#8216;Umar ibn al-Khattab (radiallaahu &#8216;anhu) as the leader of the believers with a clear, undeniable decision. And all of you know the biography of &#8216;Umar ibn al-Khattab. This affair is considered from his good actions, and may Allaah be pleased with both of them, the rightly-guided Caliphs and all the companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah to join me and you with them in Paradise, with those whom Allaah has favored from the Prophets, the truthful, the martyrs, and the righteous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Listen to Allaah&#8217;s statement (which means): <em><span style="color:#008000;">And the first to embrace Islam of the Muhaajiroon and the Ansaar and also those who followed them exactly (in Faith). Allaah is well-pleased with them as they are well-pleased with Him. He has prepared for them Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise), to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme success.</span></em> (At-Tawbah, ayah 100)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oh Allaah, make us of those who follow them in perfection. Oh Allaah, make us of those who follow them in perfection. Oh Allaah, make us of those who follow them in perfection! And let us part from this life upon complete Tawheed and Eeman. You are The Greatest, The Most Noble and Benevolent. All Praise is for Allaah, The Lord of all of creation, and may the salutations of peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, and upon his family, and all of his companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Second Khutbah:]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is for Allaah, just as He likes and is pleased with. I bear witness that there is no deity worshipped in truth except Allaah, Who is Alone and has no partner. For Him is all praise. And I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger, His Khaleel, and chosen one, may Allaah&#8217;s peace and blessings be upon him, his family, companions and whoever is guided with his guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oh slaves of Allaah! It is a must that we know one thing in this situation, which is that it is an obligation upon us to love the companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger, and that we order and arrange our love for them according to their rank and virtue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars of Ahlus-Sunnah have said that the best of the companions after their Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) is Abu Bakr (radiallaahu &#8216;anhu). The most virtuous of them is Abu Bakr, then &#8216;Umar ibn al-Khattab, then &#8216;Uthman ibn &#8216;Affan, then &#8216;Ali ibn Abi Talib (radiallaahu &#8216;anhum ajma&#8217;een). This is how the affair has been decided by Ahlus-Sunnah in accordance to their virtue and like their arrangement in leadership. [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is a must that we love all of the companions of the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), and that we know all of their virtues &#8211; both general and specific &#8211; so that our love for them will increase. And our love for them obtains for us many benefits, such as their aiding our Prophet, and our love for them due to aiding him (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, our love for them requires that we magnify their opinions and what they came with of statement and action that does not oppose the legislation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus we imitate them and, in regards to this, Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (radiallaahu &#8216;anhu wa rahimahullaah) used to say: &#8220;The statement of the companions is taken before juristic reasoning and rather taken over a weak narration, which has not been authentically linked to the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This requires that their statements be put before those who came after them, from their followers. All of which must be understood and applied by someone who has a knowledge of Fiqh (jurisprudence) and Islamic knowledge. As the one who possesses this is closer to being correct after them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah be pleased with them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, from the benefits of us loving the companions and knowing their virtues is knowing that cursing them and slandering them &#8211; even in a round-about way &#8211; is a great wrong! Whoever does so must change his methodology, so that he will be from the followers of Muhammad (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), rather than following his desires after guidance has been made clear to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For Allaah, Ta&#8217;aala, said in His Book (what means): And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger (Muhammad, (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam)) after the right path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers&#8217; way. We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and burn him in Hell &#8211; what an evil destination. (An-Nisa, ayah 115)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this with the fact that they actualized and realized worship and sincerity to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. So there is no one like them in this Religion, in this Ummah in regards to worship and glorifying Allaah, The Most High, and there is no one like them in this Ummah with regards to sincerity and following the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for what has been reported of some of them opposing the text, then this is excused without a doubt, for I am absolutely certain that it is not possible for any of them to oppose the statement of Allaah and His Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) on purpose! Also, what has been reported of some regarding incorrect actions, then they possess such great deeds that it demands forgiveness of what appeared.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, the companions are the most deserving of the Prophet&#8217;s intercession, as they were the closest to sincerity. And the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said the closest people to his intercession is he who says, &#8216;La illaaha il-Allaah,&#8217; sincerely from his heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">La illaaha il-Allaahu WaHdahu la Sharika Lahu LaHul-Mulku wa LaHul-Hamdu wa Huwa &#8216;ala kulli Shay`in Qadeer (There is no deity worshipped in truth except Allaah, Who is Alone without partner. For Him is the Dominion, and All Praise, and He is over all things capable).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oh brothers, I invite you and myself to read that which is authentic regarding the Rightly-Guided Caliphs and the companions, so that our hearts be filled with love for them, so that we know their virtues. May Allaah give us success in that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that the best speech is the Book of Allaah, and the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam). The worst of affairs are the newly invented matters, and every new matter in the Religion is a bid&#8217;ah (innovation), and every bid&#8217;ah (innovation) is a going astray.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Upon you is the Jama&#8217;ah (the main body of the Muslims who are upon the truth). Stick to it &#8211; joining upon the way of the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), sincerely for Allaah. For Allaah&#8217;s hand is over that group, and know that whoever strays, strays into the fire. For the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: Every bid&#8217;ah (innovation) is in the fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Increase in sending salutations of peace and blessings upon your Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), especially on Friday, for your salutations are conveyed to him. Increase in sending salutations in compliance with the command of Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic, as He said (what means): <em><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah sends His Salaat (Graces, Honours, Blessings, Mercy, etc.) on the Prophet (Muhammad) and also His angels too (ask Allaah to bless and forgive him). O you who believe! Send your Salaat on (ask Allaah to bless) him (Muhammad)&#8230;</span></em> (Al-Ahzab, ayah 56)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oh Allaah, send Your peace and blessings upon Your slave and Messenger Muhammad. Oh Allaah, send Your peace and blessings upon Your slave and Messenger Muhammad. Oh Allaah, send Your peace and blessings upon Your slave and Messenger Muhammad.</p>

<br style="text-align:justify;" /> [1] It is also authentically reported that &#8216;Abdullaah bin &#8216;Umar &#8211; radiallaahu &#8216;anhumma &#8211; said that the Companions used to say during the lifetime of the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam): The best of this Ummah after its Prophet, is Abu Bakr then &#8216;Umar then &#8216;Uthman. [Al-Bukhaaree, no. 3655] and the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) approved of that.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Class of Thursday, May 17, 2012</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Explanation of the Creed (<strong>Sharhus-Sunnah</strong>) by Imaam Abu Muhammad al-Hasan <strong>al-Barbahaaree</strong> from the book of our noble <strong>Sheikh Saaleh al-Fawzaan</strong>, hafidhahullah, entitled: إتحاف القاري بالتعليقات على شرح السنة</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s talk we begin with point 5 (in the english translation, though it is still 4 in the arabic).</p>
<p><strong>Adhering to the Understanding of the Companions</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">May Allaah have mercy upon you. Know that the Religion is what came from Allaah, the Blessed and Most High. It is not something left to the intellect and opinions of men. Knowledge it is what comes from Allaah and His Messenger, so do not follow anything based upon your desires and so deviate away from the Religion and leave Islaam. There will be no excuse for you since Allaah&#8217;s Messenger explained the Sunnah to his Ummah and made it clear to his Companions and they are the Jamaa&#8217;ah, and they are the Main Body (as-Sawaad ul-A&#8217;dham), and the Main Body is the truth and its followers.So he who contradicts the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallallahu alaihiwasallam in any of the affairs of the Religion, then he has fallen into disbelief.</span></p>

Is there a purpose for my existence? Who is the True God? What is the True Road for Salvation? Is It Islam? If I become a Muslim what does it mean to me, my family and the society at large?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Today many realize that all of the materialistic and secular progress produced a spiritual vacuum that led to social, economical, political and psychological problems. That is why people who used to say: &#8220;let us live this life and enjoy it.&#8221; or &#8220;hey! We don&#8217;t want to know about God&#8221;, are in search again</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Looking for the faults of Sahabah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 2: What do you think of a group of people who searches for the defects of the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet), disparages them, and accuses them of debauchery, niggardliness and cowardliness? They even claim that the Sahabah differed in their `Aqidah (creed). Please advise about the `Aqidah of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim main body) concerning the Sahabah and defending them against slander. How should Muslims behave towards this group of people? May Allah guide them to the truth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) stated, Do not abuse my Companions, for by Him in Whose Hands my life is, if anyone of you spends gold equal to Uhud (in Allah&#8217;s Cause) it would not be equal to a Mud (a dry measure of half bushel, 543 grams) or even a half Mud spent by one of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (may He be Exalted) states regarding the Muhajirun (Emigrants from Makkah to Madinah) and the Ansar (Helpers, inhabitants of Madinah who supported the Prophet),Surah Al-Hashr, 59: 10 And those who came after them say:</p>
<p>&#8220;Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in Faith, and put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed. Our Lord! You are indeed full of kindness, Most Merciful.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is impermissible to dispraise any of the Sahabah. We love them, ask Allah to be pleased with them, and seek Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for them. Whoever abuses them or dispraises them, is nothing but a misguided Mubtadi` (one who introduces innovations in religion).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn Mas’ud</strong> said to his companions, ‘You fast and pray more than the Companions of Muhammad (sal’Allahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) but they were better than you.’ They asked, ‘How so?’ He replied, ‘<strong>They were more abstinent of this world and desirous of the Hereafter</strong>.’ Hence he indicated that the superiority of the Companions lay in the attachment of their hearts to the Hereafter, their desire for it, their turning away from this world, and their thinking little of it even if it be readily available to them. Their hearts were empty of the world and filled with the Hereafter. This is what they inherited from their Prophet (sal’Allahu ‘alayhi wa sallam). He (sal’Allahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) was one whose heart was most devoid of the world and most attached to Allah and the Abode of the Hereafter, this despite his outwardly interacting with the creation, fulfilling the duties of Prophethood, and implementing the politics of religion and world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the state of the Khulafa who came after him and those who followed them in goodness such as al-Hasan and ‘Umar ibn ‘Abdul-‘Aziz. There were, in their times, those who fasted more than them and prayed more than them, but their hearts had not attained the levels of theirs in terms of leaving the world and turning to the Hereafter, and settling there.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam once climbed the mountain of Uhud with Abu Bakr, &#8216;Umar and &#8216;Uthman radhiallahu `anhum. The mountain shook with them. The Prophet said (to the mountain), &#8220;Be firm, O Uhud! For on you there are no more than a Prophet, a Siddiq and two martyrs.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">( Sahih Bukhari Companions of the Prophet [VOL 5: Hadith No. 1-119] )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ashari:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I performed ablution in my house and then went out and said, &#8220;Today I shall stick to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and stay with him all this day of mine (in his service).&#8221; I went to the Mosque and asked about the Prophet . They said, &#8220;He had gone in this direction.&#8221; So I followed his way, asking about him till he entered a place called Bir Aris. I sat at its gate that was made of date-palm leaves till the Prophet finished answering the call of nature and performed ablution. Then I went up to him to see him sitting at the well of Aris at the middle of its edge with his legs uncovered, hanging in the well. I greeted him and went back and sat at the gate. I said, &#8220;Today I will be the gatekeeper of the Prophet.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr came and pushed the gate. I asked, &#8220;Who is it?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Abu Bakr.&#8221; I told him to wait, went in and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Abu Bakr asks for permission to enter.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Admit him and give him the glad tidings that he will be in Paradise.&#8221; So I went out and said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;Come in, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle gives you the glad tidings that you will be in Paradise&#8221; Abu Bakr entered and sat on the right side of Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the built edge of the well and hung his legs n the well as the Prophet did and uncovered his legs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I then returned and sat (at the gate). I had left my brother performing ablution and he intended to follow me. So I said (to myself). &#8220;If Allah wants good for so-and-so (i.e. my brother) He will bring him here.&#8221; Suddenly somebody moved the door. I asked, &#8220;Who is it?&#8221; He said, &#8220;&#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab.&#8221; I asked him to wait, went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, greeted him and said, &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks the permission to enter.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Admit him, and give him the glad tidings that he will be in Paradise.&#8221; I went to &#8220;Umar and said &#8220;Come in, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle, gives you the glad tidings that you will be in Paradise.&#8221; So he entered and sat beside Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the built edge of the well on the left side and hung his legs in the well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I returned and sat (at the gate) and said, (to myself), &#8220;If Allah wants good for so-and-so, He will bring him here.&#8221; Somebody came and moved the door. I asked &#8220;Who is it?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Uthman bin Affan.&#8221; I asked him to wait and went to the Prophet and informed him. He said, &#8220;Admit him, and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise after a calamity that will befall him.&#8221; So I went up to him and said to him, &#8220;Come in; Allah&#8217;s Apostle gives you the glad tidings of entering Paradise after a calamity that will befall you. &#8220;Uthman then came in and found that the built edge of the well was occupied, so he sat opposite to the Prophet on the other side. Said bin Al-Musaiyab said, &#8220;I interpret this (narration) in terms of their graves.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">Compiled by <strong>Owais Al-Hâshimi</strong> (hafidhahullaah)</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The Assassination of ‘Umar – Part 1</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">Note: the English version of this account is based on <strong>Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan’s translation of <em>Sahîh Al-Bukhârî</em>,</strong> with slight modifications. The notes have been compiled from classic hadîth commentaries including <em>Fath Al-Bârî</em> of Ibn Hajr, as well as points from the lectures and classes of contemporary scholars.</span></p>
<p>Narrated ‘Amr b. Maimûn:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I saw ‘Umar b. Al-Khattâb a few days before he was stabbed in Al-Madînah. He was standing with Hudhayfah b. Al-Yamân and ‘Uthmân b. Hunaif to whom he said, “What have you done? Do you think that you have imposed more taxation on the land (of As-Swad i.e. ‘Iraq) than it can bear?” They replied, “We have imposed on it what it can bear because of its great yield.” ‘Umar again said, “Check whether you have imposed on the land what it cannot bear.” They said, “No, (we haven’t).” ‘Umar added, “If Allâh should keep me alive I will let the widows of ‘Irâq need no men to support them after me.” But only four days had elapsed when he was stabbed. The day he was stabbed, I was standing and there was nobody between me and him except Abdullah b. ‘Abbas. <span style="color:#008000;">Whenever Umar passed between rows, he would say, “Stand in straight lines.”</span> When he saw no defect (in the rows), he would go forward and start the prayer with Takbîr. He would recite Sûrah Yusuf or An-Nahl or the like in the first rak’ah so that people would have time to join the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The assassination of ‘Umar took place in 23H, following ‘Umar’s return from Hajj. He was assassinated by a Persian Majûsî (Fire Worshipper) called Abû Lu`-lu` Fayrauz, who was in the employment of Hudhayfah – Allâh be pleased with him. ‘Umar didn’t used to allow war captives to enter Al-Madînah, but Hudhayfah wrote to him requesting him to allow this worker to be hired for his skills in carpentry and metalwork. Hudhayfah believed people in Al-Medînah could benefit from his skills. Hudhayfah taxed this worker in the conventional manner, but he complained to ‘Umar about the amount. ‘Umar told him that he was not being taxed unfairly for what he was doing. This angered the Majûsî. One day, ‘Umar passed by the worker and enquired, “I have been told that you claim you can build a mill powered by wind (a windmill).” The Fire worshipper replied with a frown, “I will build you a mill that all the people will talk about.” ‘Umar turned to those who were with him and said, “The slave has given me an appointment [warning].”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Points to note</strong></p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>‘Umar’s great concern for justice and fairness.</li>
<li>His concern that Muslim society should not be adversely influenced by unbelievers.</li>
<li>His concern and care for the wellbeing of the Muslims, especially the poor and the weak.</li>
<li>The attention given by him to the correct performance of al-salâh (prayer), and his implementation of the Sunnah of the imâm making sure the rows are straight and no gaps are left between the worshippers.</li>
<li>His assisting worshippers in getting the most out of their prayer.</li>
<li>His intelligence and insight, whereby he understood the disguised threat made to him.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The Assassination of ‘Umar – Part 2</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As soon as he said Takbîr, I heard him say, “The dog has killed or eaten me,” when the murderer stabbed him. A non-Arab infidel came carrying a double-edged knife and stabbed everyone he passed by on the right and left, stabbing thirteen people out of whom seven died. When one of the Muslims saw that, he threw a cloak on him. Realizing that he had been captured, the non-Arab infidel killed himself. ‘Umar took the hand of ‘Abdur-Rahmân b. ‘Auf and let him lead the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who were standing by the side of ‘Umar saw what I saw, but the people who were in the other parts of the Mosque did not see anything, but they lost the voice of ‘Umar and they were saying, “Subhân Allâh! Subhân Allâh!” ‘Abdur-Rahmân b. ‘Auf led the people a short prayer. When they finished the prayer, ‘Umar said, “O Ibn ‘Abbâs! Find out who attacked me.” Ibn ‘Abbâs kept on looking here and there for a short time and then came back and said, “The slave of Al-Mughîrah.” At that, ‘Umar said, “The craftsman?” Ibn ‘Abbâs replied, “Yes.” ‘Umar said, “May Allah destroy him. I only treated him well. All praises are for Allâh who has not caused me to die at the hand of a man who claims to be a Muslim. No doubt, you and your father (Al-Abbâs) used to love to have more non-Arab infidels in Al-Madînah.” Al-Abbas had the greatest number of slaves. Ibn ‘Abbâs said to ‘Umar. “If you wish, we will do it.” He meant, “If you wish we will kill them.” ‘Umar said, “You are mistaken (for you cannot kill them) after they have spoken your language, prayed towards your Qiblah, and performed Hajj like yours.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Points to note</strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Some narrations mention that the one who threw the cloak over the assassin was a person named Hattân Al-Tamîmî Al-Yarbû’î from the Muhâjirûn.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">A narration from Ibn Shihâb describes how ‘Umar bled heavily and fainted. He was carried to his house, where he remained unconscious for a while. When he awoke and saw the people around him, the first thing he said was, “Have the people prayed?” When he was told that they had, he said, “There is no place in Islâm for those who leave the prayer.” He then performed ablution and prayed, with his wound bleeding heavily.</span> This, coupled with the fact the first thing ‘Umar did was appoint an imâm in his place, all goes to show the importance and status of the salâh, as well as the nobleness of ‘Umar.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">This narration also mentions that ‘Umar feared he had done some wrong to someone in the community, but when Ibn ‘Abbâs informed him it was the unbeliever who had stabbed him, and when Ibn ‘Abbâs saw everyone crying as if they had lost their own children, ‘Umar became relieved that this situation was not because of any injustice on his part. This shows the piety and taqwâ of ‘Umar.</li>
</ol>
<p>Continued inshâ Allâh.</p>
