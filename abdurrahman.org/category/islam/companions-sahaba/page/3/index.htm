		<p style="text-align:justify;">The third question of Fatwa no. 2442</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 3: <strong>What is the ruling on acting the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet, may Allah be pleased with them) in school theaters?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The Council of Senior Scholars previously reviewed this question and issued a decree as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Allah (Exalted be He) has praised and set clear the high status of the Sahabah. Thus, acting any of them on stage or on the screen is contrary to this Divine praise and is <strong>detrimental to the high status and honor</strong> which Allah has bestowed upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Representing any of them in this way <strong>exposes them to mockery and ridicule</strong>. Actors are usually people who have no room for righteousness, piety, and Islamic morals in their lives. Moreover, those who put on plays are doing so as a means to earn money, and no matter how much they try to avoid it, it will involve some lying and backbiting. Acting the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) may have an <strong>effect on their status in the hearts and minds of the Muslims, or diminish the reverence they have for them, and paves the way for arousing doubts in Muslims about their religion and disputes over the personalities of the Sahabah</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also necessarily implies that one of the actors will play the role of Abu Jahl and other disbelievers, thus he will have to <strong>utter words insulting Bilal, and insulting the Messenger (peace be upon him) and the Message of Islam</strong> that he brought. Undoubtedly, this is a great evil. This act may be targeted to confuse the Muslims about their creed, the Book of Allah and Sunnah of their Prophet (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. If it is claimed that this serves the interest of calling people to Islam and spreading noble Islamic morals and etiquette through showing exact biographies of those Sahabah is simply an assumption and wishful thinking. Whoever knows the real nature and aims of actors will realize that this kind of acting is in sharp contrast to the real nature of the actors, their standards, lives, and behaviors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. It is basically stated in the principles of Shari`ah (Islamic law) that <strong>if a certain matter is definitely or probably harmful, it will be forbidden</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">Acting the Sahabah may serve some interest, but the harm done by this is far greater than any good that might be achieved.</span> Accordingly, to protect those interests and ward off harm, and to preserve the honorable status of the Sahabah of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), we must not allow that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings of Allah be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">The madh-hab of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah concerning the Companions is that of moderateness between the two ends of extremism and heedlessnessThe madh-hab of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah concerning the Companions is that of moderateness between the two ends of extremism and heedlessness. It is moderateness amidst the extremist fanatics who elevate the esteemed ones amongst them to a level that is only befitting for Allaah or for His messengers and moderateness amidst the heedless and harsh ones who belittle and revile them. So they are in the middle between those who are excessive and those who fall short &#8211; they love all of them and put each one of them in the due place that they deserve, with fairness and justice. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So they do not elevate them to a level they don&#8217;t deserve, nor do they belittle them, taking away what they are worthy of</strong></span>. Their tongues are moist with mentioning them only in good, according to what is befitting for them. And their hearts are filled with love for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whatever disputes and differences that occurred between (some of) them, that can be authentically confirmed, we hold that they were Mujtahideen in that regard &#8211; either they were correct and will receive one reward for their Ijtihaad and one reward for being correct, or they were wrong and will receive just one reward for their Ijtihaad while their error will be forgiven. They were not infallible since they were human beings. At times they were correct and at times they erred. But how much more were they correct as compared to others being correct, and how fewer were their errors as compared to the errors of others? And on top of this, they will receive Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness and contentment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The books of Ahl-us-Sunnah are filled with a clarification of this pure and radiant Creed concerning these elite people, who were chosen amongst mankind to accompany the best of mankind (صلى الله عليه و سلم). May Allaah be pleased with them all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of this is the statement of <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>At-Tahaawee</strong> </span>in his (book on the) Creed of Ahl- us-Sunnah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;We love the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger. But we do not go to extremes in our love for anyone amongst them, nor do we absolve ourselves from any of them. And we hate anyone that hates them or anyone that talks about them in a bad way. And we do not mention them except with good. Loving them is Deen (Religion), Eemaan (Faith) and Ihsaan (Goodness) and hating them is Kufr (Disbelief), Nifaaq (hypocrisy) and Tughyaan (transgression).&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal</strong></span> said in his book as-Sunnah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And from the Sunnah is mentioning the good qualities of the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger &#8211; all of them &#8211; and to refrain from (speaking about) what disputes occurred between them. <strong>So whoever reviles the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger or (just) one of them, then he is an innovator, a Raafidee</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;"><strong>Loving them is a Sunnah and making du&#8217;aa (supplication) for them is a means of getting close to Allaah (taqarrub). Following them is a means and taking from their example is a virtue&#8230;</strong></span>&#8220;</p>

	<div class="entry-content th-content">
		<p style="text-align:justify;">All of the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger are trustworthy based on Allaah&#8217;s testifying that for them and because of His praise for them and the praise of His Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>An-Nawawee said in at-Taqreeb</strong></span>, which As-Suyootee explained in his Tadreeb-ur-Raawee:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;All of the Companions are trustworthy &#8211; those who were involved in the afflictions (fitan) and other than them &#8211; according to the consensus of the scholars.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr</strong></span> said in al-lsaabah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Ahl-us-Sunnah have unanimously agreed that all of them (the Sahaabah) are trustworthy and no one opposed this except some deviants amongst the innovators.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why there is no harm in not knowing a Companion in a chain of narration. So if a Taabi&#8217;ee says: &#8220;On the authority of a man who accompanied the Prophet&#8230;&#8221; this does not affect the report. This is because not knowing the Companions (in the chain) causes no harm since they are all trustworthy.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Al-Khateeb Al-Baghdaadee</strong></span> said in his book al-Kifaayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Every hadeeth that has a chain of narration that is connected between the one who reported it and the Prophet is not to be acted upon until first having affirmed the trustworthiness and reliability of all the narrators (in the chain). It is an obligation to investigate all of their conditions, except for the Sahaabee (Companion) who raises it (or attributes the hadeeth) to the Prophet. This is because the trustworthiness of the Companions is established and well known based on Allaah&#8217;s affirming that for them, His informing us of their pure state and His preference of them in the texts of the Qur&#8217;aan&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he (rahimahullaah) went on to list some ayaat and ahaadeeth concerning their virtues and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And even if Allaah or His Messenger had not mentioned anything about them from what we just stated now (of their virtues), the condition they were upon of having made Hijrah, fought in Jihaad, of having offered their support, sacrificed their lives and wealth, experienced the killings of their parents and children, of mutually advising for the Religion and having strong Faith and unshakeable certainty, (all of this) would be enough to prove their trustworthiness and enough for one to have firm faith in their honesty and integrity. And it would necessitate the understanding that they are the best from those who receive testimony and approval as to their trustworthiness and reliability from all of the people that will come after them forever and ever.&#8221;</p>

<span style="color:#666699;">‘The Life of the Greatest Man After the Prophets &amp; Messengers: Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq’</span><br>
<span style="color:#666699;">Compiled By Muhammad Uthmaan al-Anjaaree</span><br>
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a – Shaykh ul-Islaam Ahmad bin AbdulHaleem Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for the level excellence of Abu Bakr then Umar, then Uthmaan and Ali, then this is agreed upon between the Imams of knowledge and <em>Deen</em>, from amongst the Companions and <em>Taba’een</em>.  It is the <em>Madhab</em> of Malik, <em>Ahl-ul- Madinah</em>, Abu Hanifah, Hamad bin Zayed, Hamad bin Salamah and the likes of them from the people of Iraq and it is the <em>Madhab</em> of Shaafi’ee, Ahmad, Ishaq, Abu Ubayd and other than them from the Imams of Islaam who have a truthful tongue from amongst the <em>Ummah</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Majmoo’ al-Fatawa 4/421]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b – Imam Nawawi said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The <em>Ummah</em> is agreed upon the correctness of the <em>Khalafah</em> of Abu Bakr and his precedence over the Companions <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhum ajmaeen</em>&#8211; due to him being the best of them, and the most deserving for the <em>Khalafah</em> than other than him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Tahathab al-‘Asmaa 2/191]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">c – Hafidh Suyootee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah</em> are united that the best person after the Messenger of Allaah is Abu Bakr, then Umar, then Uthmaan and then Ali.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Tareekh al-Khulafah p.34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">d – From Ibn Abi Layla who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abu Bakr and Umar were being discussed, so a man from ‘Attarad said: ‘Umar is better than Abu Bakr.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Jarrood said: ‘Rather Abu Bakr is better than him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This news reached Umar <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em>, and he began to beat him with a stick until he ran off, then he turned to al-Jarrood but he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Be away from me!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Umar said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abu Bakr was the best of the people after the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> in such and such thing.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Umar said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever says other than this, then we will do to him what we do to a slanderer.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Abdullaah bin Ahmad bin Hanbal in ‘as-Sunnah’ 2/579]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">e – From Abdullaah bin Salmah who said I heard Ali saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The best of the people after the Messenger of Allaah is Abu Bakr, and the best of the people after Abu Bakr is Umar . . . . .’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ibn Majah &amp; authenticated by Albaani no. 86]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">f – From Abu Juhayfah who said: ‘I heard Ali saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Shall I not inform you who is the best of this <em>Ummah</em> after its Prophet, it is Abu Bakr.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Ali continued:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Shall I not inform you who is the best of this <em>Ummah</em> after Abu Bakr it is Umar.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ahmad &amp; authenticated by Ahmad Shakir. Imam Dhahabi said in ‘Tareekh al-Khulafah’ p.115: ‘I swear by Allaah the Magnificent, that this is what Ali said and it is<em>Mutawatir</em> from him, because he said this while on the <em>Mimbar</em> in Koofah, may Allaah fight the Rafidaah, how ignorant they are!’]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">g – From Muhammad bin al-Hanafeeyah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I said to Ali bin Abi Taalib: O my father, who of the people is the best after the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abu Bakr.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Abdullaah bin Ahmad bin Hanbal in ‘as-Sunnah’ No.1363]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">h – From Muhammad bin al-Hanafeeyah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I asked my father, who of the people is the best after the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘Abu Bakr.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked: ‘Then who?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘then Umar.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I feared that he would say Uthmaan, I then said: ‘Then you?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I am no other than a person from amongst the Muslims.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">i – From Shaqeeq who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It was said to Ali <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em>: ‘Will you not appoint a leader?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> did not appoint a leader, so how can I appoint one.  If Allaah <em>– Tabaraka wa Ta’ala –</em> wants good for the people then He gathers them as He gathered them after their Prophet upon the best of them.’ [i.e. Abu Bakr]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ibn Abi Aassim in ‘as-Sunnah’ 1221]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">j – From Sufyan at-Thawri who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever claims that Ali <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> was more deserving of ruler ship than Abu Bakr and Umar, then he has claimed that Abu Bakr was wrong, likewise Umar, the<em>Muhajiroon</em>, and the <em>Ansaar</em>.  I hold the opinion that this person’s good actions will not rise up to the heavens (not accepted by Allaah), if he holds this view.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Abu Dawood &amp; Albaani said it is Saheeh al-Isnaad although it is disconnected. No.4387]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">k – From Abdullaah bin Umar who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘We used to say while the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was alive: ‘The best of the <em>Ummah</em> of the Prophet after the Prophet is Abu Bakr, then Umar, then Uthmaan <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhum ajmaeen</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Abu Dawood, Ibn Abi Aassim in ‘as-Sunnah’ &amp; Abdullaah bin Ahmad in ‘as-Sunnah’, Albaani said it’s <em>Isnad</em> is Saheeh]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">l – From Ibn Umar <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘During the time of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> we would not equate anyone along with Abu Bakr, then Umar, then Uthmaan then we would leave the Companions of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> and not choose a preference between them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">m – From Shaafi’ee who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Companions and their followers are gathered upon the excellence and precedence of Abu Bakr, then Umar, then Uthmaan, then Ali.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[‘al-Itiqaad’ by Bayhaqi]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">n – Imam Dhahabi said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The scholars of the Sunnah are agreed that the best of the Companions are the ten who had been testified with entering Paradise.  The best of those ten were Abu Bakr, then Umar bin al-Khattab, then Uthmaan bin ‘Affan, then Ali bin Abi Taalib <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhum ajmaeen</em>&#8211; and no one doubts that except an innovator, a hypocrite, or a filthy person.’</p>

		<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#666699;"><em>Narrations of the Salaf part 3<br>
</em>Following the Companions</span><br>
<span style="color:#666699;"> Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 -From Hudhayfah bin al-Yamaan (d. 36 A.H.) <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Follow our paths, because verily if you follow us then indeed  you have truly advanced a lot.  And if you oppose us then indeed you have become extremely misguided.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘al-Bida’ by Ibn Wadha/44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 -From Jafar bin ‘Amr (d. 207 A.H.) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘We were a group from the children of the Companions of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>, we said:  Verily our fathers have indeed preceded us with <em>Hijrah</em> and companionship of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>, so let us strive in worship in the hope that we will reach their excellence.  We came across Tameem ad-Daari (the Companion) as an old man, who could not stand nor sit due to the length of his prayer.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘Zuhud’ by Ahmad /249]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – From Salih bin Kaysaan (d. 140 A.H.) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I met up with Zuhri and we would seek knowledge( together), then we said: We should write the <em>Sunnan</em>,  we should write that which came from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>, then we should write that which came from his Companions as indeed it is the Sunnah. So I said:  It is not the Sunnah and we should not write it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continues:  So Zuhri wrote it, but I did not write it, so he was successful whereas I became lost.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘Jamia Bayyan al-Ilm’ 2/1176]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 – From Muhammad Ibn Sireen (d. 110 A.H.) who was asked about combining the Umrah into the Hajj, so he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Umar bin Khattab and Uthman bin ‘Affaan disliked it, and if it was knowledge then they are more knowledgeable than me, and if it was their opinion then their opinion is better.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘Jamia Bayyan al-Ilm’ 1/773]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5- From Sa’eed bin al-Musayib (d. 93 A.H.)that he was asked about something so he who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Companions of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> differed regarding this and I can have no opinion to place along with theirs.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘Jamia Bayyan al-Ilm’ 1/770]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 – From Mujahid (d. around 105 A.H.)who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Scholars are the Companions of Muhammad <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘Jamia Bayyan al-Ilm’ 1/770]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7 – From AbdurRahmaan bin ‘Amr al-Aawza’i (d.156 A.H.) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Knowledge is that which came from the Companions of Muhammad <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>, and that which did not come from even one of them, then it is not knowledge.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘Jamia Bayyan al-Ilm’ 1/769]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8 – From Ibrahim an-Nakha’i (d. 96 A.H.) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If it had reached me concerning them, i.e. the Companions, that they did not exceed in the <em>Wudu</em> more than a finger nail, then I would not exceed it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ash-Sharh wal-Ibaanah /161]</p>

		<p align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">How a Companion of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-   is Identified</span><br>
<span style="color:#666699;">By Miseekah bint ‘Assim al-Quruti</span><br>
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Companions can be known in a number of different ways:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- Sometimes the Companions can be known by being mentioned in the Noble Qur’aan, like the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;as one of two, when they were in the cave&gt;&gt; [Tawbah: 40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">the meaning of that is as-Siddiq <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> [Abu Bakr].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why the scholars say: ‘Whoever rejects Abu Bakr’s companionship of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> is a disbeliever.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise the mention of the companionship of Zayed bin Harithah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em>due to the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;So when Zayd had no longer any need for her, We married her to you&gt;&gt; [Ahzab: 37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 – By <em>Tawatir</em> (Recurring narratives) like the companionship of Umar, Uthmaan, Ali, Hudayfah, Abu Huriarah, ‘Aeysha and others from the senior Companions <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhum ajmaeen</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – By beneficial information, and that is by a Companion of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> being well-known amongst the other Companions. It is less than<em>Tawatir</em> (Recurring narratives), which means that many of the people knew them, even if it was hidden from a small number of them, like: Thaabit bin Qaays, Dhul-Yadain, Mu’aawiyah ibn al-Hakam as-Sulami, Bareerah the freed slave of ‘Aeysha and others from amongst them <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhum ajmaeen</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 – By the testification of other Companions of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam,</em> as in the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbas <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> regarding the seventy thousand who will enter Paradise without reckoning; so ‘Ukashah bin Mihsan stood up and said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah make <em>Dua’</em> to Allaah to make me from amongst them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said: ‘You are from them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 – By a Companion actually narrating from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>that he heard him <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> saying, or that he witnessed the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> in his time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 – By the testification of a <em>Taabaiee’</em> (a successor of the Companions) where he says: ‘So and so from the Companions of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> narrated to me.’  And this has some conditions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a-    That the <em>Isnad</em> (chain) is authentic from that <em>Taabaiee’</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b-    That he is a senior <em>Taabaiee’</em> so that most of his narrations are from the Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">c-    That the <em>Taabaiee’</em> is well known for his memory and precision. No mistake has been experienced from him, since he could have made a mistake and he was not aware of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7 – That the person himself says ‘I am a Companion of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.’  That he is known to be just. It is obligatory that his announcement had been made within one hundred years of the death of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>. It has been affirmed by <em>Tawatir</em> (Recurring narratives) that the last of the Companions to die was Abu at-Tufayl bin ‘Aamir bin Waathilah al-Laythi, and what is correct is that he died in the year 110 A.H. so whoever claims companionship after that, then it is not accepted from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a principle, which is beneficial, and through it we can identify the companionship of a large number of Companions by knowing a general characteristic which includes all of them to be from the Companions of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>, and this principle is taken from three <em>Athaar</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first: ‘The general people would only place the Companions in charge of battles. Whoever researches narrations which talk about the battles against those who apostated after the death of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> and the battles concerning conquering other lands, finds that there had been many Companions mentioned.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second: ‘That Ibn ‘Awf said: ‘No one would have a new born except that he would bring it to that Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> and he would supplicate for it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third: ‘There had not remained anyone in Madina, nor Makkah, nor Taif by the tenth year after the <em>Hijra</em> except that he had accepted Islaam and had witnessed the farewell Hajj.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, whoever was present at that time is classified as a Companion under this Companionship due to them seeing the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> even if he himself did not see them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">[For References of this section see: ‘Muqqadamah Ibn Salah’ along with its explanation ‘at-Taqyeed’, ‘al-Baith al-Hatheeth’ by Ibn Katheer, ‘al-Isaabah’ by Ibn Hajr &amp; ‘Fath al-Muggeeth’ by Sakhawee.’]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From: ‘Sahabatul Nabi <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam’</em>  p.15-16]</p>

		<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808000;">The Messenger’s <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> Supplication For Anas <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu<br>
</em>Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ </span><br>
<span style="color:#808000;">By the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’  </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani</span><br>
<span style="color:#808000;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">140 – From Qatada who said: I heard Anas saying: I heard Umm Sulaym who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O Messenger of Allaah! Make <em>Dua</em>’ to Allaah for Anas’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said: <strong>‘O Allaah increase his wealth and offspring and bless him in what you have provided for him.’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Bukhari and Tirmidhi</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">141-  From Thaabit, from Anas bin Malik that the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> came to Umm Haraam and she brought him some dates and margarine but the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Return this to its container and the other to its jug, since I am fasting.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he stood and led us in a two <em>Rakah </em>optional prayer and Umm Haraam and Umm Sulaym stood behind us.  He made me stand on his right hand side – and according to Thaabit – Anas continued: He led us in an optional prayer on a mat. When he finished his prayer, Umm Sulaym said: I have a specific request, make <em>Dua</em>’ to Allaah for your young servant Anas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> never left anything of good from the<em>Duniya </em>and the Hereafter except that he supplicated it for me, then he <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>O Allaah increase his wealth and offspring and bless it for him.’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘My daughter informed me that I had been provided with some ninety odd offspring from my loins. There was not a man from amongst the Ansaar who had more wealth than me, then Anas said: ‘O Thaabit, I do not own any gold or silver except for my ring.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Abu Dawood, I say that this <em>Isnaad</em> is Saheeh upon the conditions of Muslim. It is also collected by Ahmad &amp; Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the narration of Ahmad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Then the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> supplicated for Umm Sulaym and her family.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the narrator mentions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Anas mentioned that his eldest daughter Ameenah informed him that there were more than one hundred and twenty from his offspring buried when Hajjaj appeared.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Albaani said: that this <em>Isnad</em> of three narrators is authentic upon the conditions of Bukhari &amp; Muslim.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Albaani Commented:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘From the benefits of the hadeeth and its <em>Fiqh</em>:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many benefits in this hadeeth, I will mention some of them briefly, except where detail is necessary:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- That supplicating for increase in wealth and offspring is something which is legislated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari has a chapter heading for this hadeeth: ‘Chapter: Supplicating for blessings in having lots of wealth and offspring.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- And that wealth and offspring are a blessing and goodness if Allaah -Tabaraka wa Ta’ala is obeyed in respect to them. How misguided is the one who tries to limit how many children they have, using so many different means, like birth control or regulating it, let alone aborting the foetus and for the most insignificant reasons, and obtaining <em>Fatawa</em> to make their actions permissible! !</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- Allaah answered the <em>Dua’</em> of His Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> for Anas, and it became reality, until he became the one with the most wealth and offspring from amongst the Ansar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- That it is allowed for the one fasting an optional fast, when he visits a person and food is presented to him that he does not have to break his fast, but he supplicates for the host with goodness. And from the chapters of Bukhari: ‘Chapter whoever visits a people and does not break his fast with them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5- That if a man is led in prayer by another man, he should stand on the right of the one leading the prayer.  What is evident is that he stands right next to him, not forward nor just behind him, because if anything like this ever occurred then the narrator would have narrated it, especially since the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> repeatedly led individual companions in prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a hadeeth of Ibn Abbas regarding this in Saheeh Bukhari and Muslim, and Bukhari brought a chapter heading for the hadeeth of Ibn Abbas, and Muslim brought it from Jabir. The chapter which Bukhari mentions is: ‘Chapter: if there are two people praying then one stands <strong>equal next </strong>to the one leading the prayer.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafidh said in ‘al-Fath’ (2/160):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Regarding the saying of Bukhari: ‘equal’ means that he does not stand forward from the Imam and nor just behind him, it is as if the compiler (Bukhari) indicates to what occurs in some of the narrations from Ibn Abbas with the wording: <strong>‘So I stood next to him’</strong> and that apparently means equal to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And AbdurRazzaq narrates from Ibn Juraij  who said: I said to ‘Atta:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘A man prays along with another man, where should he stand?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘On his right hand side.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I asked: ‘Does he stand equal to him so that he is in line with him and one is not ahead of the other?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘Yes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked: ‘Do you like it that they stand equal so there is no gap between them?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘Yes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In ‘al-Muwatta’ from Abdullaah bin Utbah bin Mas’ood who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I entered upon Umar bin al-Khattab during the morning before <em>Dhur</em> and I found him in<em>Ruku</em> (bowing in the prayer) I stood in prayer behind him, but he brought me forward until he placed me next to him on his right side.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Albaani) say: This Athar in ‘al-Muwatta’ with an authentic chain from Umar <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em>, along with the previously mentioned Ahadeeth are strong proof of the previously mentioned issue of standing equally in the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the saying that it is recommended that the single person following the Imam should stand slightly behind the Imam, as is mentioned by some of the <em>Madhahib</em>(schools of thought), with some of them elaborating about this issue – along with there being no evidence for it from the Sunnah likewise, it also opposes what is apparent from these Ahadeeth, and this narration of Umar, and the previously mentioned statement of ‘Atta and he is the Imam, the noble <em>Taba’ee</em> (Follower of the Companions) Ibn Abee Rabah and likewise it opposes the other statements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is more befitting for the Believer to leave those statements of the <em>Madhahib</em> (schools of thought) to their founders, believing that they are rewarded for it, because they endeavoured and formulated an opinion intending the truth, and it is upon the believer to follow what is established in the Sunnah, since indeed the best guidance is the guidance of the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ vol.1 hadeeth no. 219  p.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His Praise and Blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his  companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">Mu’aawiyah The Scribe of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;<br>
</em>Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’</span><br>
<span style="color:#666699;"> By the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani</span><br>
<span style="color:#666699;"> Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">82 – ‘May Allaah not let his stomach become satisfied;’ i.e. Mu’aawiyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Abu Dawood at-Tayyalisi in his ‘Musnad’ (2746) Hishaam and Abu ‘Awaana narrated to us from Abu Hamza al-Qassaab from Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘That the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> sent someone to Mu’aawiyah to write something for him, and this person said he is eating, then the Messenger sent the person again, and again he said he is eating. Then the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘May Allaah not let his stomach become satisfied.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Albaani) say: This <em>Isnaad</em> is <em>Saheeh</em>, its narrators are all trustworthy, they are the narrators of Imam Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding Abu Hamza al-Qassaab – whose name is Umraan bin Abi ‘Atta – there is some talk about him from some of the scholars but it does not harm him, since a group from the Imams have regarded him as trustworthy, from them is Ahmad and Ibn Ma’een and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who regarded him as weak then they did not clarify the reason, so therefore it is an unknown (<em>Jarh</em>) criticism, which is unacceptable.  It is as if this is why Imam Muslim used him as a narrator and narrated this hadeeth from him in his book ‘Saheeh’ (8/27) from the way of Shu’abah from Abu Hamza al-Qassaab with this hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad narrated this hadeeth (1/240, 291, 335, 338) from Shu’abah and Abu ‘Awaana from Abu Hamza with this hadeeth without the saying: ‘May Allaah not let his stomach become satisfied.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It seems that the hadeeth was summarized by Ahmad or by some of his Shaykhs, and they mentioned an extra wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘. . . .and he was his scribe’,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And its chain is authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the sects took opportunity of this hadeeth, as a way of attacking Mu’aawiyah<em> &#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> but there is nothing in this hadeeth which helps them on this, and how can it, since in the hadeeth it mentions that he was the scribe of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, and this is why al-Hafidh Ibn ‘Aasakir said: (16/349/2):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This is the most authentic narration which has been mentioned about the excellence of Mu’aawiyah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is evident from this supplication from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>is that it was not intentional, rather it is from what is the practice of the Arabs when using certain style of speech unintentionally; such as the statement of the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> regarding some of his wives:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘May you be affected by pain in your throat’[1] [Collected by Bukhari &amp; Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘May your right hand be covered in dust’ [Collected by Bukhari &amp; Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and like his <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> statement in the hadeeth of Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘May your age not increase.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is possible that this statement from the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>about Mu’aawiyah was spurred on by his humanness which he has eloquently mentioned about himself <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> in many reoccurring Ahadeeth, and from them is the hadeeth of ‘Aeysha <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anha</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Two men entered upon the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> they spoke to him about something but I did not know what it was about, and they caused him to get angry, so he <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> cursed them and reviled them, then when they left I asked: ‘O Messenger of Allaah! Good will reach everyone except these two people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger asked: ‘And why is that?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said: ‘You cursed them and reviled them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Did you not know that I have a contract with my Lord? I said: O Allaah indeed I am a human, so any Muslim whom I cursed or reviled, then designate it as charity and a reward for him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ No. 83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Imam Muslim along with the previous hadeeth before this in the chapter entitled:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Chapter: Whoever the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>cursed, reviled or supplicated against and he was not qualified for that; then it is a charity, reward and mercy for that individual.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Imam Muslim narrated here the hadeeth of Anas bin Malik who said: ‘There was an orphan girl with Umm Sulaym, who was called Umm Anas, the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> saw the orphan girl and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Are you her? Verily you have grown up, may your age not lengthen.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the orphan girl went back to Umm Sulaym crying; Umm Sulaym said to her ‘What is wrong young girl?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The young girl said: ‘The Prophet of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> supplicated against me that my age should not ever lengthen.’ Or she said: ‘my generation.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Umm Sulaym went out hastily wrapping her headscarf on her head, until she met the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>, and the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said to her: ‘What is wrong O Umm Sulaym?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She replied: ‘O Prophet of Allaah! Did you supplicate against my orphan girl?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And how is that O Umm Sulaym?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She answered: ‘She claims that you supplicated that her age should not lengthen nor should her generation.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narrator said: The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> laughed then he <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O Sulaym! Did you not know that I have a contract with my Lord that I have a contract with my Lord and I said: Indeed I am a human and I become pleased just like a human becomes pleased, and I get angry just as a human gets angry so whoever from my<em>Ummah</em> whom I supplicated against with a supplication of which he was not deserving, then make that as a purification for him and a charity and a means of coming closer to Allaah on the Day of Judgement?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ Hadeeth No.84]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Imam Muslim follows up this hadeeth with the hadeeth of Mu’aawiyah and with that he completed the chapter.  This was an indication from Imam Muslim <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> that this hadeeth of Mu’aawiyah is from one chapter and has the same meaning, therefore, just like the supplication of the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> does not harm the orphan girl – rather it is a charity and a means of coming closer to Allaah; likewise was the supplication of the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> for Mu’aawiyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam an-Nawawi said in his ‘Explanation of Saheeh Muslim’ (2/325 – Indian Print):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for the supplication upon Mu’aawiyah, then it has two responses:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of which is : that it was said upon the tongue without intent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second: that it was a punishment for Mu’aawiyah for being late, and Muslim <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> understood from this hadeeth <strong>that </strong><strong>Mu’aawiyah</strong><strong> was not deserving</strong> of the supplication upon him, therefore, this is why Imam Muslim entered this hadeeth into this chapter.  Other scholars have placed this hadeeth from the virtues of Mu’aawiyah because in reality this does become a supplication for him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dhahabi indicated to this second meaning, he said in ‘Siyaar ‘Alaam an-Nubala’ (9/171/2):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I say: Perhaps it is said: this is a virtue for Mu’aawiyah due to the saying of the Messenger of Allaah! The one who I cursed or reviled, make that a charity and mercy for him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that the statement of the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> in these Ahadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed I am a human and I become pleased just like a human . . . ; is indeed an explanation for the statement of Allaah Tabaraka wa Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Say, I am only a man like you, to whom has been revealed that your god is one God. &gt;&gt; [Khaf: 110]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps some of those who follow desires and rash emotions hasten to reject the likes of this hadeeth by their claim of veneration for the Prophet <em>–alayhi as-Sallat wa Sallam –</em> and clearing him from having said this statement!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no scope for the likes of this rejection, since verily the hadeeth is <em>Saheeh</em>(authentic), rather we see it as <em>Mutawatir</em> (has recurring chains).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been collected by Muslim from the hadeeth of ‘Aeysha and Umm Sulaym as we have mentioned, and from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah and Jabir <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhuma</em>, and it has been mentioned from the hadeeth of Salman, Anas, Samrah, Abu Tufayl, Abu Sa’eed and other than them. See: ‘Kunz al-‘Amal’ (2/124).<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Veneration of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>is a veneration which is legislated, but it is done with having <em>Eemaan</em> with everything authentically established that came from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, and along with having that<em>Eemaan</em> is him <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>being a slave and Messenger without going to extreme or being negligent.  For he <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>is a human with the testification of the Book and the Sunnah, however he is the chief of the humans and the best of them without exception because of the text of the authentic Ahadeeth, just as the history of his life and his biography indicate to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from what Allaah Ta’ala bestowed him with of noble manners and praiseworthy characteristics, which no human has in entirety as it is completely in the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>and Allaah The Great was truthful when he addressed the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>with His Noble statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; and indeed you are on exalted standard character&gt;&gt; [Qalam:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ vol. 1 hadeeth no 82-84 p.164]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also another hadeeth from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Abu Huraira that the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O Allaah, indeed I make a pledge to You which I won’t break.  Indeed I am a human being; so any believer who I harmed, reviled, cursed or punished; make that as prayer for him, <em>Zakat</em> and a means of being close to You on the Day of Judgement.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Muslim, Ahmad &amp; in Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah No. 3999</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] T.N. al-hafidh Muhammad bin Nasr al-Humaydi (d.488 A.H.) said: ‘These are words which the Arabs supplicate with, when they get angry with someone.  The meaning is ‘May Allaah make her barren and destroy her.’ Which is that she be affected by pain in her throat.  This is to show how great the matter was which caused the person to get angry.’ [Taken from: ‘Tafseer Ghareeb ma Fee Saheehayin al-Bukhari &amp; Muslim’ p.141]</p>

		<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Love of Ahl-ul-Bayt <em>-RadiAllaah anhum-</em> for the<em>Khalifah</em> of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –<br>
</em>Taken from the book ‘The Life of the Greatest Man After the Prophets &amp; Messengers: Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq’</span><br>
<span style="color:#993300;">Compiled By Muhammad Uthmaan al-Anjaaree</span><br>
<span style="color:#993300;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- On the authority of ‘Alee <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>&#8211; who said: If it was that I heard a hadeeth from the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em>then Allaah would cause me to benefit me from it with whatever He willed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If anyone other than myself would narrate to me from the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em>, I would request of him to swear that he heard it and if he swore then I would believe him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Abu Bakr narrated to me, and Abu Bakr spoke the truth, that he heard the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is no-one who commits a sin, then performs <em>Wudu</em> correctly, prays two <em>Rakah</em> and seeks forgiveness from Allaah <em>-Azza wa Jal &#8211;</em>except that he is forgiven.’[0]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- Fatima <em>–RadhiAllaahu anha</em>&#8211; said to Abu Bakr, the <em>Khalifah</em> of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em>: ‘You and what you heard from the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> know better.’[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- ‘Alee <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>&#8211; said to Abu Bakr <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>&#8211; in front of Fatima, the daughter of the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em>: ‘Indeedwe know well, O Abu Bakr, your excellence,’ and he mentioned their relationship with the Messenger of Allaah  <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em>and their rights.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah-</em>: ‘It reached ‘Alee <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>&#8211; that Ibn Sowda’ cursed Abu Bakr and Umar, so he requested his presence.  It was said that he requested him to attendin order to kill him, but Ibn Sowda’ escaped ‘Alee <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Alee <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>&#8211; also said: No-one comes to me, preferring meover Abu Bakr and Umar <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhuma</em>&#8211; except that I will lash him with the punishment of slanderer.[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 – Shaykhul-Islaam &#8211;<em>Rahimullaah-</em> said: ‘Alee –<em>RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>&#8211; named his two sons Abu Bakr and Umar.[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Verily Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em> has praised the Companions of His Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> in many places in His noble Book.  He has praised them with the best and most complete of characteristics.  Allaah blessed them with His being pleased with them and with repentance.  He informed them of what He has prepared for them of a generous reward and an eternally great recompense in Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said: &lt;&lt;And the first to embrace Islaam of the <em>Muhâjirûn</em>(those who migrated from Makkah to Al-Madinah) and the <em>Ansaar</em>(the citizens of Al-Madinah who helped and gave aid to the<em>Muhâjirûn</em>) and also those who followed them in Faith, Allaah is well-pleased with them as they are well-pleased with Him.  He has prepared for them Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise) to dwell therein forever.  That is the supreme success.&gt; &gt;[Taubah:100]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said: &lt;&lt; Allaah has forgiven the Prophet, the <em>Muhajirûn</em>(Muslim emigrants who left their homes and came to Al-Madinah) and the <em>Ansaar </em>(Muslims of Al-Madinah) who followed him in the time of distress (Tabûk expedition, etc.), after the hearts of a party of them had nearly deviated (from the Right Path), but He accepted their repentance.  Certainly, He is unto them full of Kindness, Most Merciful. &gt;&gt; [Taubah: 117]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said: &lt;&lt;Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah and those who are with him are severe against disbelievers and merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and falling down prostrate (in prayer), seeking Bounty from Allaah and (His) Good Pleasure.  The mark of them (i.e. of their Faith) is on their faces (foreheads) from the traces of (their) prostration (during prayers). This is their description in the Taurât (Torah) but their description in the Injeel (Gospel) is like a (sown) seed which sends forth its shoot, then makes it strong, then it becomes thick and stands straight on its stem, delighting the sowers that He may enrage the disbelievers with them.  Allaah has promised those among them who believe and do righteous good deeds, forgiveness and a mighty reward (i.e. Paradise). &gt;&gt; [al-Fath: 29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said: &lt;&lt; Not equal among you are those who spent and fought before the conquering (of Makkah) (with those among you who did so later).  Such are higher in degree than those who spent and fought afterwards.  But to all, Allaah has promised the best (reward).  And Allaah is All-Aware of what you do.  &gt;&gt;[al-Hadeed: 10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said:&lt;&lt;(And there is also a share in this booty) for the poor emigrants, who were expelled from their homes and their property, seeking Bounties from Allaah and to please Him and helping Allaah (i.e. helping His religion) and His Messenger.  Such are indeed the truthful (to what they say);-And those who, before them, had homes (in Al-Madinah) and had adopted the Faith, love those who emigrate to them and have no jealousy in their breasts for that which they have been given (from the booty of Banî An-Nadîr) and give them (emigrants) preference over themselves, even though they were in need of that.  And whosoever is saved from his own covetousness, such are they who will be the successful.&gt;&gt;[al-Hashr:8-9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah said, explaining the first <em>Aayah</em>: ‘Allaah made a share of what He mentioned and prepared for the Companions, of Him being pleased with them and Paradise for those who followed the Companions in goodness.’[i]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continues saying:‘So whoever follows the first to embrace Islaam, then he is from them.  They are the best of people after the Prophets.  Indeed the <em>Ummah</em> of Muhammad is the best <em>Ummah</em> that came for the people and the Companions are the best of the <em>Ummah</em>of Muhammad.’[ii] Then he derived from this principle an important issue, which is the obligation of following the Companions in what they were upon of knowledge, action and Deen for the one who wants success and salvation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh-ul-Islaam said: ‘Due to this, knowing the statements of the Companions concerning knowledge, <em>Deen</em> and their actions, is better and more beneficial than knowing the statements and actions in all sciences of the <em>Deen</em> and its actions of those who came later such as in <em>Tafseer</em>, principles of the <em>Deen</em> and its branches, <em>Zuhud</em>, worship, manners, <em>Jihad </em>etc.  This is because the Companions are better than those who came after them as the Book and the Sunnah indicate. So following the Companions is better than following those after them. Having knowledge of their <em>Ijmaa’</em> (consensus) and disputes about knowledge and <em>Deen </em>is better and more beneficial than having knowledge of what is mentioned of the <em>Ijmaa’</em> and disputes of other than them.  This is because their <em>Ijmaa’</em> is nothing other than faultless and if they disputed, then the truth never escaped them.’[iii]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> testified to their goodness and excellence.  He said in a hadeeth which is narrated ofhim by Abdullaah bin Mas’ood <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>: ‘The best of the people[iv] are of my generation, then those who came after them, then those who came after them.  Then there will come a people whose testimony will precede their oath and their making an oath is their testification.’[v]  I</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">maam an-Nawawee <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said: ‘The scholars are in agreement that the best generation is the Messenger’s <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>generation and the meaning here is the Companions.’[vi]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hajr <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said: ‘A generation is a people in one close period of time who participated in a matter from the matters of concern.’ He continues saying:‘The meaning here of ‘the generation of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>’</em> in this hadeeth is the Companions.’[vii]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The noble Companion Abdullaah bin Mas’ood <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> has an amazing statement where he describes the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> saying: ‘Indeed Allaah looked at the hearts of His slaves and He found the heart of Muhammad to be the best of the hearts of His slaves so He chose him for Himself and sent him with His Message.  Then Allaah looked into the hearts of His worshippers after the heart of Muhammad <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>and He found that the hearts of Muhammad’s Companions were the best of the hearts of His worshippers, so He made them the ministers for His Prophet and they fought for His religion.’[viii]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, on the authority of Abdullaah bin Mas’ood <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> who said: ‘Whoever from amongst you wants to follow, then he should follow the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> since their hearts were the most righteous in this <em>Ummah</em>, the deepest in knowledge, the most natural, the most correct in guidance and were in the best condition.  The Companions were people whom Allaah chose to be with His Prophet and to establish His religion.<em>  </em>So know their excellence and follow them in their footsteps, for indeed they were on the correct guidance.’[ix]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jamaah</em> have, during what has passed in history and time, in different places and countries, implemented the command of their Lord <em>–Ta’ala-</em> and the command of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> that they should honour and respect the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> with their hearts and their tongues.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> says: ‘From the principles of <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jamaah</em>: is the honour and veneration in their hearts and on their tongues for the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah  <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em> just as Allaah describes them in His saying:  &lt;&lt; And those who came after them say: ‘Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in Faith and put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed.  Our Lord!  You are indeed full of kindness, Most Merciful.’&gt;&gt; [Hashr: 10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, in obedience to the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> when he said: ‘Do not curse my Companions.  I swear by Him in Whose Hand is my soul, if one of you spent the like of mount Uhud in gold, you would not reach the equivalent of a <em>Mudd</em> (a certain weight) of one of the Companions, not even half a <em>Mudd</em>.’[x]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah</em> accept what is mentioned in the Book, the Sunnah and<em>Ijmaa’</em> regarding their excellence and rank.’[xi]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Rawafidah,[xii] Khawarij[xiii] and Nawaasib[xiv] opposed <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jamaah</em> in this issue; they did not keep to the bequest of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> regarding the rights of his Companions. As for the Rawafidah, they brought the <em>Bida’</em> of (text)that they claimed the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> stated about ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> with which they would not have an excuse to leave the Khilafah of ‘Alee, a statement that he was sinless and whosoever opposed him had committed disbelief.  Then, as a consequence, they made <em>Takfeer</em> of all the Companions except veryfew in number.  They claimed that the Companions hid these statements and changed the religion.  The Rawafidah sought closeness to Allaah – as they claim – by cursing and reviling the Companions <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhum</em>.  Abu Bakr and Umar <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhumaa-</em>received the most of their oppression and extreme lies.[xv]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Khawarij, then they made <em>Takfeer</em> of ‘Uthmaan and ‘Alee and of those who followed them and they also made <em>Takfeer</em> of both groups who took part in the battle of Siffeen.[xvi]  As for the Nawaasib, their evil belief led them to hate ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> and they belittled him.  They exaggerated in this until they accused him of evil, oppression and that he wanted the <em>Duniya.</em> Then their condition and their hatred and enmity continued until they belittled the rest of Ahl ul Bayt (the family of the Prophet), especially al-Hassan bin ‘Alee<em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[v]  Agreed upon, narrated by Bukhari in the beginning of ‘The book of the excellence of the Prophet’s Companions’ in his saheeh. &amp; by Muslim in ‘The book of the excellence of the Companions <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhum’</em> in the chapter ‘Excellence of the Companions then those after them, then those after them.’</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[ix] Narrated by Ibn AbdulBarr in ‘Jamia Bayaan al-Ilm wa Fadleehi’2/97.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[x] Narrated by Muslim in ‘The book of the excellence of the Companions <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhum-</em>. Chapter: TheProhibition of Cursing the Companions <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhum-</em>. 4/1967</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[xi]  ‘Majmoo al-Fatawa’3/152</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[xii]  Shaykhul-Islaam said: ‘From the time Zayd rebelled, the Shia split into the Rafidah and the Zaydeeyah. When Zayd was asked about Abu Bakr and Umar he said ‘May Allaah have mercy upon them,’ and the people rejected him.  He said to them: Rafadtumoonee (you have rejected me) so they were called the Rafidah, because they rejected him. Those who did not reject him from the Shia were called Zaydeeyah, since they ascribed themselves to him.’(Minhaaj as-Sunnah) 1/35.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This clarifies for us that the reason for them being Rafidah was their hatred for Abu Bakr &amp; Umar <em>–RadhiAllaahu</em> anhumaa<em>&#8211;</em>, their cursing them and not accepting them as leaders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullaah bin Ahmad said: ‘I asked my father: ‘Who is a Rafidee?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘He who curses Abu Bakr and Umar.’ narrated by al-Khalaal in ‘as-Sunnah’p.492.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[xiii] They were given this title because they rebelled against the Imam ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>.  From the most important of their beliefs is: making Takfeer of people who commit major sins, they say that these people will be in the Hell-fire eternally.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They also say that the Khilafah can be from other than the Quraish.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They make Takfeer of ‘Uthmaan, ‘Alee, Talha, Zubair and ‘Aeysha <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhum-</em> they also call forrebellion against evil leaders, they are many different sects.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[xiv] Nawaasib: They are those who openly declare Ahl-ul-Bayt to be enemies.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Shaikh &#8216;Abdul-Muhsin bin Hamad Al-&#8216;Abbaad<br>
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah.Com<br>
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a small treatise entitled <b>“<i>’Aqeedatu Ahlis-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah fis-Sahaabat-il-Kiraam</i>”</b> (The Creed of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah concerning the Companions) written by Shaikh ‘Abdul-Muhsin Al-‘Abbaad. The source for this treatise was an article the Shaikh wrote for the Islamic University of Madeenah Newsletter (Issue 2 of their fourth year) Shawaal 1391H. This article was distributed together with a transcribed lecture from the Shaikh entitled “Sending Salaat on the Prophet” in a booklet published by the Islamic University of Madeenah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this brief presentation, Shaikh Al-‘Abbaad, one of the senior scholars and a Muhaddith in Saudi Arabia, may Allaah preserve him, outlines the proper belief a Muslim should have with regard to the Companions, and that is of moderateness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Muslim should not go to either extreme of being fanatical towards individuals amongst the Companions or being lenient and heedless about the rights they deserve. Rather, it is upon the believer, the adherent of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, to have love and respect for all of them, as well as to acknowledge their virtues and refrain from mentioning their errors and mishaps. The Shaikh presents the material in a concise but educational manner, quoting numerous ayaat, ahaadeeth and statements of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The <i>madh-hab</i> of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah concerning the Companions is that of moderateness between the two ends of extremism and heedlessness. It is moderateness amidst the extremist fanatics who elevate the esteemed ones amongst them to a level that is only befitting for Allaah or for His messengers and moderateness amidst the heedless and harsh ones who belittle and revile them. So they are in the middle between those who are excessive and those who fall short &#8211; they love all of them and put each one of them in the due place that they deserve, with fairness and justice. So they do not elevate them to a level they don’t deserve, nor do they belittle them, taking away what they are worthy of. Their tongues are moist with mentioning them only in good, according to what is befitting for them. And their hearts are filled with love for them.“</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And whatever disputes and differences that occurred between (some of) them, that can be authentically confirmed, we hold that they were Mujtahideen in that regard – either they were correct and will receive one reward for their Ijtihaad and one reward for being correct, or they were wrong and will receive just one reward for their Ijtihaad while their error will be forgiven. They were not infallible since they were human beings. At times they were correct and at times they erred. But how much more were they correct as compared to others being correct, and how fewer were their errors as compared to the errors of others? And on top of this, they will receive Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness and contentment.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;These are five examples from the sayings of the Salaf As-Saalih (righteous predecessors), which demonstrate what we are obligated to believe in with respect to the best of creation after the Prophets and Messengers. One thing we must understand is that defaming these chosen and unique individuals is equal to defaming the Religion itself, since it was none other than them who passed the Religion down to those who came after them. And we already mentioned the words of Abu Zur&#8217;ah, in which he said: &#8216;The only ones who brought this Qur&#8217;aan and Sunan (plural of Sunnah) to us are the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger. (So) they only wish to disparage and demolish our witnesses so that they can nullify the Book and the Sunnah, whereas they are more deserving of being disparaged for they are the heretics (<i>zanaadiqah</i>).'&#8221;</p>

Thereupon Abu Bakr wept and he wept bitterly and said: Let our fathers and our mothers be taken as ransom for you. It was Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) who had been given the choice and Abu Bakr knew it better than us, and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) is reported to have said: Behold, of all people the most generous toward me in regard to his companionship and his property was Abu Bakr and were I to choose anyone as my bosom friend, I would have chosen Abu Bakr as my dear friend, but (for him) I cherish Islamic brotherliness and love. There shall be left open no window in the mosque except Abu Bakr&#8217;s window.</p>

I said: For whom is it meant? They said: It is meant for &#8216;Umar b. Khattab. (The Holy Prophet) said: There came across my mind the feeling of Umar and so I turned back and went away. Abu Huraira said: &#8216;Umar wept as we were present in that meeting with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) amongst us and Umar said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, may my father and mother be taken as ransom for you. Could I at all feel any jealousy about you? This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Ibn Shihab with the same chain of transmitters.</p>

Thereupon &#8216;Umar said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, may Allah keep you happy all your life. Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: I wonder at these women who were with me and no sooner did they hear your voice, they immediately went behind the curtain. Thereupon &#8216;Umar said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, you have more right that they should fear you. Then Umar (addressing the women) said: O ye enemies of yourselves, do you fear me and fear not the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)? They said: Yes, you are harsh and strict as compared to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). Thereupon, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (maypeace be upon him) said: By Him in Whose Hand is my life, if satan would encounter you in the way he would certainly take a different way from that of yours.</p>

He came to the mosque, and asked about Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him). They (his Companions) said: He has gone in this direction. He (Abu Musa Ash&#8217;ari) said: I followed his steps asking about him until I came to Bi&#8217;r Aris (it is a well in the suburb of Medina). I sat by its wooden door until Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had relieved himself and then performed ablution.

There came Abu Bakr and knocked the door and I said: Who is it? He said: This is Abu Bakr. I said: Wait, please. I went and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, here is Abu Bakr seeking permission. Thereupon he said: Admit him and give him glad tidings of Paradise. I came and I said to Abu Bakr to get in (and also told him) that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was giving him the glad tidings of Paradise. Abu Bakr got in and sat on the right side of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and dangled his feet in the well as Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had done, and he uncovered his shanks. I then returned and sat there and I had left my brother as he had been performing ablution and he was to meet me and I said: If Allah would intend goodness for such and such he would intend goodness for his brother and He would bring him. I was thinking this that a person stirred the door. I said: Who is it. He said: This is Umar b., Khattab. I said: Wait. Then I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), greeted him and said: Here is &#8216;Umar seeking your. permission to get in. Thereupon he said: Let him come in and give him glad tid- ings of Paradise. I came to Umar and said: There is permission for you and glad tidings for you from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) for Paradise. He got in and sat on the left side of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) with his feet dangling in the well. I then returned and sat and said: If Allah would intend goodness for such and such (that is for his brother), He would bring him. And I was contemplat- ing over it that a man stirred the door and I said: Who is it? He said: This is Uthman b. Affan. I said: Wait, please. I then came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and informed him. and he said: Admit him and give him glad tidings (and inform) him of the turmoil which he shall have to face. I came and said: Get in, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) gives you the glad tidings of Paradise along with the trial which you shall have to face. He got in and saw the elevated plan round the well fully occupied. He sat on the other side. Sharik said that Sa&#8217;id b. al-Musayyib reported: I drew a conclusion from it that their groves would be (in this very state, the graves of Hadrat Abu Bakr, &#8216;Umar Faruq by the tide of the Holy Prophet [may peace be upon him] and the grave of Hadrat &#8216;Uthman away from their graves).</p>

Abu Talib? They said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, his eyes are sore. He then sent for him and he was brought and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) applied saliva to his eyes and invoked blessings and he was all right, as if he had no ailment at all, and coraferred upon him the standard. &#8216;Ali said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, I will fight them until they are like us. Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Advance cautiously until you reach their open places, thereafter invite them to Islam and inform them what is obligatory for them from the rights of Allah, for, by Allah, if Allah guides aright even one person through you that is better for you than to possess the most valuable of the camels.</p>

Zaid, you have in fact earned a great virtue. Zaid, narrate to us what you heard from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him).

He exhorted (us) (to hold fast) to the Book of Allah and then said: The second are the members of my household I remind you (of your duties) to the members of my family. He (Husain) said to Zaid: Who are the members of his household? Aren&#8217;t his wives the members of his family? Thereupon he said: His wives are the members of his family (but here) the members of his family are those for whom acceptance of Zakat is forbidden. And he said: Who are they?

He said in a loud voice to return it to the place from where I had picked it up. It was on this occasion that this verse was revealed:&#8221; They asked about the spoils of war&#8221; (viii. 1). He further said: I once fell ill and sent a message to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him).

I went to them in a garden and there had been with them the roasted head of a camel and a small water-skin containing wine. I ate and drank along with them and there came under discussion the Ansr (Helpers) and Muhajirin (immigrants). I said: The immigrants are better than the Ansar, that a person picked up a portion of the head (of the camel and struck me with it that my nose was injured.

I often heard him praise her, and his lord, the Exalted and Glorious, had commanded him to give her the glad tidings of a palace of jewels in Paradise: and whenever he slaughtered a sheep he presented (its meat) to her female companions.</p>

She ouaht permission to get in as he had been lying with me in my mantle.

She (&#8216;A&#8217;isha) said: I kept quiet. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to her (Fatima): 0 daughter, don&#8217;t you love whom I love? She said: Yes, (I do). Thereupon he said: I love this one. Fatima then stood up as she heard this from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and went to the wives of Allatt&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and informed them of what she had said to him and what Allah&#8217;s messenger (may peace be upon him) had said to her. Thereupon they said to her: We think that you have been of no avail to us. You may again go to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and tell him that his wives seek equity in case of the daughter of Abu Quhafa. Fitima said: By Allah, I will never talk to him about this matter. &#8216;A&#8217;isha (further) reported: The wives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) then sent Zainab b. jahsh, the wife of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him), and she was one who was somewhat equal in rank with me in the eyes of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and I have never seen a woman more advanced in religious piety than Zainab, more God-conscious, more truthful, more alive to the ties of blood, more generous and having more. sense of self-sacrifice in practical life and having more charitable disposition and thus more close to God, the Exalted, than her. She, however, lost temper very soon but was soon calm. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) permitted her to enter as she (&#8216;A&#8217;isha) was along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) in her mantle, in the same very state when Fatima had entered. She said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, your wives have sent me to you seeking equity in case of the daughter of Abu Quhafa. She then came to me and showed harshness to me and I was seeing the eyes of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) whether he would permit me. Zainab went on until I came to know that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) would not disapprove if I retorted. Then I exchanged hot words until I made her quiet.

If I give vent to my feelings about him, he would divorce me, and if I keep quiet I would be made to live in a state of suspense (neither completely abandoned by him nor entertained as wife).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth one said: My husband is like the night of Tihama (the night of Hijaz and Mecca), neither too cold nor hot, neither there is any fear of him nor grief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fifth one said: My husband is (like) a leopard as he enters the house, and behaves like a lion when he gets out, and he does not ask about that which he leaves in the house.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sixth one said: So far as my husband is concerned, he eats so much that nothing is left back and when he drinks he drinks that no drop is left behind. And when he lies down he wraps his body and does not touch me so that he may know my grief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The seventh one said: My husband is heavy in spirit, having no brightness in him, impotent, suffering from all kinds of conceivable diseases, heaving such rough manners that he may break my head or wound my body, or may do both.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eighth one said: My husband is as sweet as the sweet-smelling plant, and as soft as the softness of the hare.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ninth one said: My husband is the master of a lofty building, long-statured, having heaps of ashes (at his door) and his house is near the meeting place and the inn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tenth one said: My husband is Malik, and how fine Malik is, much above appreciation and praise (of mine). He has many folds of his camel, more in number than the pastures for them. When they (the camels) hear the sound of music they become sure that they are going to be slaughtered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eleventh one said: My husband is Abu Zara&#8217;. How fine Abu Zara&#8217; is! He has suspended in my ears heavy ornaments and (fed me liberally) that my sinews and bones are covered with fat. So he made me happy. He found me among the shepherds living in the side of the mountain, and he made me the owner of the horses, camels and lands and heaps of grain and he finds no fault with me. I sleep and get up in the morning (at my own sweet will) and drink to my heart&#8217;s content. The mother of Abu Zara&#8217;, how fine is the mother of Abu Zara&#8217;! Her bundles are heavily packed (or receptacles in her house are filled to the brim) and the house quite spacious. So far as the son of Abu Zara&#8217; is concerned, his bed is as soft as a green palm-stick drawn forth from its bark, or like a sword drawn forth from its scabbard, and whom just an arm of a lamb is enough to satiate. So far as the daughter of Abu Zara&#8217; is concerned, how fine is the daughter of Abu Zara&#8217;, obedient to her father, obedient to her mother, wearing sufficient flesh and a source of jealousy for her co-wife. As for the slave-girl of Abu Zara&#8217;, how fine is she; she does not disclose our affairs to others (outside the four walls of the house). She does not remove our wheat, or provision, or take it forth, or squander it, but she preserves it faithfully (as a sacred trust). And she does not let the house fill with rubbish. One day Abu Zara&#8217; went out (of his house) when the milk was churned in the vessels, that he met a woman, having two children like leopards playing with her pomegranates (chest) under her vest. He divorced me (Umm Zara&#8217;) and married that woman (whom Abu Zara&#8217;) met on the way. I (Umm Zara&#8217;) later on married another person, a chief, who was an expert rider, and a fine archer: he bestowed upon me many gifts and gave me one pair of every kind of animal and said: Umm Zara&#8217;, make use of everything (you need) and send forth to your parents (but the fact) is that even if I combine all the gifts that he bestowed upon me, they stand no comparison to the least gift of Abu Zara&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;A&#8217;isha reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to me: I am for you as Abu Zara&#8217; was for Umm Zara&#8217;.</p>

Mu&#8217;awiya after the martyrdom of Husain b. &#8216;Ali (Allah be pleased with him) Miswar b. Makhramah met him and said to him: Is there any work for me which you ask me to do? I said to him: No. He again said to me: Would you not give me the sword of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) for I fear that the people may snatch it from you? By Allah, if you give that to me, no one would be able to take it away, so long as there is life in me. Verily &#8216;Ali b. Abi Talib sent a proposal of marriage to the daughter of Abu Jahl in spite of (the fact that his wife) Fatima (had been living in his house). Thereupon I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) say while addressing the people on the pulpit. I was adolescing in those days. He said: Fatima is a part of me and I fear that she may be put to trial in regard to religion. He then made a mention of his son-in law who had been from the tribe of &#8216;Abd Shams and praised his behaviour as a son-in-law and said: Whatever he said to me he told the truth and whatever he promised he fulfilled it for me. I am not going to declare forbidden what is lawful and make lawful what is forbidden, but, by Allah, the daaghter of Allah&#8217;s Messenger and the daughter of the enemy of Allah can never be combined at one place.</p>

When Fatima heard about it, she came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and said: The people say that you never feel angry on account of your daughters and now &#8216;Ali is going to marry the daughter of Abu Jahl. Makhramah said: Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) rose up and I heard him reciting Tashahhud and say: Now to the point. I gave a daughter of mine (Zainab) to Abu&#8217;l-&#8216;As b. Rabi, and he spoke to me and spoke the truth. Verily Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad, is a part of me and I do not approve that she may be put to any trial and by Allah, the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Messenger cannot be combined with the daughter of God&#8217;s enemy (as the co-wives) of one person.

He took it and drank water. She then embellished herself which she did not do before. He (Abu Talha) had a sexual intercourse with her and when she saw that he was satisfied after sexual intercourse with her, she said: Abu Talha, if some people borrow something from another family and then (the members of the family) ask for its return, would they resist its return?

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah b. Samit reported that Abu Dharr said: We set out from our tribe Ghafir who look upon the prohibited months as permissible months. I and my brother Unais and our mother stayed with our maternal uncle who treated us well. The men of his tribe fell jealous and they said: When you are anay from your house, Unais commits adultery with your wife. Our -naternal uncle came and he accused us of the sin which was conveyed to him. I said: You have undone the good you did to us. We cannot stay with you after this. We came to our camels and loaded (our) luggage. Our maternal uncle began to weep covering himself with (a piece of) cloth. We proceeded on until we encamped by the side of Mecca. Unais cast lot on the camels (we had) and an equal number (above that). They both went to a Kahin and he made Unais win and Unais came with our camels and an equal number along with them. He (Abu Dharr) said: My nephew, I used to observe prayer three years before my meeting with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). I said: For whom did you say prayer? He said: For Allah. I said: To which direction did you turn your face (for observing prayer)? He said: I used to turn my face as Allah has directed me to turn my face. I used to observe the night prayer at the time of the end of night and I fell down in prostration like the mantle until the sun rose over me. Unais said: I have a work in Mecca, so you better stay here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unais went until he came to Mecca and he came to me late. I said: What did you do? He said: I met a person in Mecca who is on your religion and he claims that verily it is Allah Who has sent him. I said: What do the people say about him? He said: They say that he is a poet or a Kahin or a magician. Unais who was himself one of the poets said. I have heard the words of a Kahin but his words in no way resemble his (words). And 1 also compared his words to the verses of poets but such words cannot be uttered by any poet. By Allah, he is truthful and they are liars. Then I said: you stay here, until I go, so that I should see him. He said: I came to Mecca and I selected an insignificant person from amongst them and said to him: Where is he whom you call as-Sabi? He pointed out towards me saying: He is Sabi. Thereupon the people of the valley attacked me with sods and bows until I fell down unconscious. I stood up after havin. regained my consciousness and I found as if I was a red idol. I came to Zamzarn and washed blood from me and drank water from it and listen, O son of my brother, I stayed there for thirty nights or days and there was no food for me but the water of Zamzarn. And I became so bulky that there appeared wrinkles upon my stomach, and I did not feel any hunger in my stomach. It was during this time that the people of Mecca slept in the moonlit night and none was there to eircumambulate the House but only two women who had been invoking the name of Isafa, and Na&#8217;ila (the two idols).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They came to me while in their circuit and I said: Marry one with the other, but they did not dissuade from their invoking. They came to me and I said to them: Insert wood (in the idols&#8217; private parts). (I said this to them in such plain words) as I could not express in metaphorical terms. These women went away crying and saying: Had there been one amongst our people (he would have taught a lesson to you for the obscene words used for our idols before us). These women met Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and Abu Bakr who had also been coming down the hill. He asked them: What has happened to you? They said: There is Sabi, who has hidden himself between the Ka&#8217;ba and its curtain. He said: What did he say to you? They said: He uttered such words before us as we cannot express. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came and he kissed the Black Stone and circumambulated the House along with his Companion and then observed prayer, and when he had finished his prayer, Abu Dharr said: I was the first to greet him with the salutation of peace and uttered (these words) in this way; Allah&#8217;s Messen- ger, may there be peace upon you, whereupon he said: It may be upon you too and the mercy of Allah. He then said: Who are you? I said: From the tribe of Ghifar. He leaned his hand and placed his finger on his forehead and I said to myself: Perhaps he has not liked it that I belong to the tribe of Ghifar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I attempted to catch hold of his hand but his friend who knew about him more than I dissuaded me f rom doing so. He then lifted his head and said: Since how long have you been here? I said: I have been here for the last thirty nights or days. He said: Who has been feeding you? I said: There has been no food for me but the water of Zamzam. I have grown so bulky that there appear wrinkles upon my stomach and I do not feel any hunger. He said: It is blessed (water) and it also serves as food. Thereupon Abu Bakr said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, let me serve as a host to him for tonight, and then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) proceeded forth and so did Abu Bakr and I went along with them. Abu Bakr opened the door and then he brought for us the raisins of Ta&#8217;if and that was the first food which I ate there. Then I stayed as long as I had to stay. I then came to Allah&#8217;s Messenaer (may peace be upon him) and he said: I have been shown the land abound- ing in trees and I think it cannot be but that of Yathrib (that is the old name of Medina). You are a preacher to your people on my behalf. I hope Allah would benefit them through you and He would reward you. I came to Unais and he said: What have you done? I said: I have done that I have embraced Islam and I have testified (to the prophethood of Allah&#8217;s Messenger). He said: I have no aversion for your religion and I also embrace Islam and testify (to the prophethood of Muhammad). Then both of us came to our mother and she said: I have no aversion for your religion and I also embrace Islam and testify to the prophethood of Muhammad. We then loaded our camels and came to our tribe Ghifir and half of the tribe embraced Islam and their chief was Aimi&#8217; b. Rahada Ghifirl and he was their leader and hall of the tribe said: We will embrace Islam when Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may p,. ace be upon him) would come to Medina, and when Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to Medina the remaining half also embraced Islam. Then a tribe Aslam came to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, we also embrace Islam like our brothers who have embraced Islam. And they also embraced Islam. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Allah granted pardon to the tribe of Ghifar and Allah saved (from destruction) the tribe of Aslam.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbas reported that when Abu Dharr heard of the advent of the Apostle (may peace be upon him) in Mecca he said: Brother, ride in this valley and bring information for me about the person who claims that there comes to him information from the Heavens. Listen to his words and then come to me. So he rode on until he came to Mecca and he heard his words (the sacred words of the Holy Prophet) and then came back to Abu Dharr and said: I have seen him exhorting (people) to develop good morals and his expressions can in no way be termed as poetry. He (Abu Dharr) said: I have not been satisfied with it regarding that which I had in my mind (as I sent you). So he took up provisions for the journey and a small water-skin con- taining water (and set forth) until he came to Mecca. He came to the mosque (Ka&#8217;ba) and began to find out Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and he did not re- cognise him (the Holy Prophet) and he did not even like that he should ask about him from anyone until it was night, and he slept. &#8216;All saw him and found him to be a stranger. So he went with him. He followed hive but one did not make any inquiry from the other about anything until it was morning. He then brought the water and his provisions to the mosque and spent a day there, but he did not see Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) until it was night. He then returned to his bed that there happened to pass &#8216;Ali and he said: This man has not been able to find his destination until this time. He made him stand and he went with him and no one made an in- quiry from his companion about anything. And when it was the third day he did the same. &#8216;Ali made him stand up and brought him along with him. He said: By Him, besides Whom there is no god, why don&#8217;t you tell me (the reason) which brought you here to this town? He said: (I shall do this) provided you hold me promise and a covenant that you would guide me aright. He then did that. He (&#8216;Ali) said: Verily, he Is truthful and he is a Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and when it is morning, follow me and if I would say anything from which I would sense fear about you I would stand (in a manner) as if I was throwing water and if I move on, you then follow me until I get in (some house). He did that and I followed him until he came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). He entered (the house) of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) along with him and listened to his words and embraced Islam at his very place. Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said to him: Go to your people and inform them until my command reaches you. Thereupon he said: By Him in Whose Hand is my life, I shall say to the people of Mecca this thing at the top of my voice So he set forth until he came to the mosque and then spoke at the top of his voice (saying): I bear testimony to the fact that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. The people attacked him and made him fall down when &#8216;Abbas came and he leaned over him and said: Woe be upon you, don&#8217;t you know that he is from amongst the tribe of Ghifar and your trad- ing route to Syria passes through (the settlements of this tribe), and he rescued him. He (Abu Dharr) did the same on the next day and they (the Meccans) again attacked him and Abbas leaned upon him and he rescued him.</p>

Some people said: He is a person from amongst the people of Paradise; he is a person from amongst the people of Paradise. He observed two short rak&#8217;ahs of prayer and then went out. I followed him and he got into his house and I also got in and we began to converse with each other. And when he became familiar (with me) I said to Him: When you entered (the mosque) before (your entrance in the house) a person said so and so (that you are amongst the people of Paradise), whereupon he said: It is not meet for anyone to say anything which he does not know. I shall (now) tell you why they (say) this. I saw a dream during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and narrated it to him. I seemed to be in a garden [he described its vastness, its rich fructification and its verdure]; in the midst of it, there stood an iron pillar, with its base in the earth and its summit in the sky: and upon its summit there was a handhold. It was said to me: Climb up this (pillar). I said to him (visitant in the dream): I am unable to do it. Thereupon a helper came to me, and he (supported) me (by catching hold of my) garment from behind and thus helped me with his hand and so I climbed up till I was at the summit of the pillar, and grasped the handhold. It was said to me: Ho d it tightly. It was at this that I woke up when (the handhold) was in fthe grip) of my hand. I narrated it (the dream) to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him), whereupon he said: That garden implies al-Islam and that pillar implies the pillar of Islam. And that handhold is the firmest faith (as refered to in the Qur&#8217;an). And you will remain attached to Islam until you shall die. And that man was &#8216;Abdullah b. Salim.</p>

I said to him: As you stood up, I heard people say about you: He who is desirous of seeing a person from among the people of Paradise should look at him. So I became desirous of accompanying you. He (&#8216;Abdullah b. Salim) said: It is Allah Who knows best about the people of Paradise. I would, however, narrate to you as to why they said like it.

(So I stood up) and he caught hold of my hand and I walked along with him, and, lo, I found some paths on my left and I was about to set out upon them. Thereupon he said to me Do not set yourself on (them) for these are the paths of the leftists (denizens of Hell-fire). Then there were paths leading to the right side, whereupon he said: Set yourself on these paths. We came across a hill and he said to me: Climb up, and I attempted to climb up that I fell upon my buttocks. I made several attempts (but failed to succeed). He led until he came to a pillar (so high) that its upper end touched the sky and its base was in the earth. And there was a handhold at its upper end. He said to me Climb over it. I said: How can I climb upon it, as its upper end touches the sky? He cought hold of my hand and pushed me up and I found myself suspended with the handhold. He then struck the pillar and it fell down, but I remained attached to that handhold until it was morning (and the dream was thus over). I came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and narrated it to him. He said: So far as the paths which you saw on your left are concerned, these are paths of the leftists (denizens of Hell) and the paths which you saw on your right, these are the paths of the rightists (the dwellers of Paradise) and the mountain represents the destination of the martyrs which you would not be able to attain. The pillar implies the pillar of Islam. and so far as the handhold is concerned, it implies the handhold of Islam, and you would hold to it fastly until you would meet death.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Huraira reported: I invited my mother, who was a polytlieist, to Islam. I invited her one day and she said to me something about Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) which I hated. I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) weeping and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, I invited my mother to Islam but she did not accept (my invitation). I invited her today but she said to me something which I did not like. (Kindly) supplicate Allah that He may set the mother of Abu Huraira right. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: O Allah, set the mother of Abu Huraira on the right path. I came out quite pleased with the supplication of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and when I came near the door it was closed from within. My mother heard the noise of my footsteps and she said: Abu Huraira, just wait, and I heard the noiee of falling of water. She took a bath and put on the shirt and quickly covered her head with a headdress and opened the door and then said: Abu Huraira, I bear witness to the fact that there is no god but Allah and Mubammad is His bondsman and His Messenger. He (Abu Huraira) said: I went back to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and (this time) I was shedding the tears of joy. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, be happy, for Allah has responded to your supplication and He has set on the right path the mother of Abu Huraira. He (the Holy Prophet) praised Allah, and extolled Him and uttered good words. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, supplicate to Allah so that He may instil love of mine and that of my mother too in the believing servants and let our hearts be filled with their love, whereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: O Allah, let there be love of these servants of yours, i. e. Abu Huraira and his mother, in the hearts of the believing servants and let their hearts be filled with the love of the believing servants. (Abu Huraira said: This prayer) was so well granted by Allah that no believer was ever born who heard of me and who saw me but did not love me.</p>

I was a poor man and I served Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) being satisfied with bare subsistence, whereas the immigrants remained busy with transactions in the bazar; while the Ansar had been engaged in looking after their properties. (He further reported) that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He who spreads the cloth would not forget anything that he would hear from me. I spread my cloth until he narrated something. I then pressed it against my (chest), so I never forgot anything that I heard from him.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;A&#8217;isha reported: Don&#8217;t you feel surprised at Abu Huraira? He came (one day) and sat beside the nook of my apartment and began to narrate (the hadith of Allah&#8217;s Apostle). I was hearing while I was engaged in extolling Allah (reciting Subhan Allah) constantly. He stood up before I finished my repetition of Subhan Allah. if I were to meet him I would have warned him in stern words that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) did not speak so quickly as you talk. Ibn Shihab transmitted on the authority of Ibn Musayyib that Abu Huraira said: People say that Abu Huraira transmits so many ahadith, whereas Allah is the Reckoner, and they say: How is it with Muhajirs and the Ansar that they do not narrate ahadith like him (like Abu Huraira)? Abu Huraira said: I tell you that my brothers from Ansar remained busy with their lands and my brothers Muhajirs were busy in transactions in the bazars, but I always kept myself attached to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) with bare subsistence. I remained present (in the company of the Holy Prophet), whereas they had been absent. I retained in my mind (what the Holy Prophet said), whereas they forgot it. One day Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He who amongst you spreads the cloth and listens to my talk and would then press it against his chest would never forget anything heard from me. So I spread my mantle and when he had concluded his talk I then pressed it against my chest and so I never forgot after that day anything that he (the Holy Prophet) said. And if these two verses would not have been revealed in the Book I would have never transmitted anything (to anybody):&#8221; Those who conceal the clear evidence and the guidance that We revealed&#8221; (ii. 159) tip to the last verse.</p>

She would be in possession of a letter, which you must get from her. So we rushed on horses and when we met that woman, we asked her to deliver that letter to us. She said: There is no letter with me. We said: Either bring out that letter or we would take off your clothes. She brought out that letter from (the plaited hair of) her head. We delivered that letter to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) in which Hatib b. Abu Balta&#8217;a had informed some people amongst the polytheists of Mecca about the affairs of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Hatib, what is this? He said: Allah&#8217;s messenger, do not be hasty in judging my intention. I was a person attached to the Quraish. Sufyan said: He was their ally but had no relationship with them. (Hatib further said): Those who are with you amongst the emigrants have blood-relationship with them (the Quraish) and thus they would protect their families. I wished that when I had no blood-relationship with them I should find some supporters from (amongst them) who would help my family. I have not done this because of any unbelief or apostasy and I have no liking for the unbelief after I have (accepted) Islam. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: You have told the truth. &#8216;Umar said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, permit me to strike the neck of this hypocrite. But he (the Holy Prophet) said: He was a participant in Badr and you little know that Allah revealed about the people of Badr: Do what you like for there is forgiveness for you. And Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, said:&#8221; O you who believe, do not take My enemy and your enemy for friends&#8221; (lx. 1). And there is no mention of this verse in the hadith transmitted on the authority of Abu Bakr and Zubair and Ishaq has in his narration made a mention of the recitation of this verse by Sufyan.</p>

I went to him and said: Uncle, who shot an arrow upon you? Abu &#8216;Amir pointed out to Abu Musa and said: Verily that one who shot an arrow upon me in fact killed me. Abu Musa said: I followed him with the determination to kill him and overtook him and when he saw me he turned upon his heels. I followed him and I said to him: Don&#8217;t you feel ashamed (that you run), aren&#8217;t you an Arab? Why don&#8217;t you stop? He stopped and I had an encounter with him and we exchanged the strokes of (swords). I struck him with the sword and killed him. Then I came back to Abu Amir and said: Verily Allah has killed the one who killed you. And he said: Now draw out this arrow. I drew out the arrow and there came out from that (wound) water. Abu &#8216;Amir said: My nephew, go to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and convey my greetings to him and tell him that Abu Amir begs you to ask forgiveness for him. And Abu Amir appointed me as the chief of the people and he died after a short time. When I came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) I visited him and he had been lying on the cot woven by strings and there was (no) bed over it and so there had been marks of the strings on the back of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and on his sides. I narrated to him what had happened to us and narrated to him about Abu Amir and said to him that he had made a request to the effect that forgiveness should be sought for him (from Allah). Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be. upon him) called for water and performed ablution with it. He then lifted his hands and said. O Allah, grant pardon to Thy servant Abu Amir. (The Holy Prophet had raised his hands so high for supplication) that I saw the whiteness of his armpits. He again said: O Allah, grant him distinction amongst the majority of Thine created beings or from amongst the people. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, ask forgiveness for me too. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: Allah, forgive the sins of Abdullah b. Qais (Abu Musa Ash&#8217;ari) and admit him to an elevated place on the Day of Resurrection. Abu Burda said: One prayer is for abu &#8216;Amir and the other is tor Abu Musa.</p>

And I was accompanied by two brothers of mine, I being the youngest of them; one of them was Abu Burda and the other one was Abu Ruhm, and there were some other persons with them. Some say they were fifty-three or fifty-two persons of my tribe. We embarked upon a boat, and the boat sailed away to the Negus of Abyssinia. There we met Ja&#8217;far b. Abu Talib and his companions. Ja&#8217;far said: Allall&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has sent us here and has commanded us to stay here and you should also stay with us. So we stayed with him and we came back (to Medina) and met Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) when Khaibar had been conquered. He (the Holy Prophet) allocated a share to us and in the ordinary course he did not allocate the share to one who had been absent on the occasion of the conquest of Khaibar but conferred (a share) upon him only who had been present there with him. He, however, made an exception for the people of the boat, viz. for Ja&#8217;far and his companions. He allocated a share to them, and some persons from amongst the people said to us, viz. the people of the boat: We have preceded you in migration. Asma&#8217; bint &#8216;Umais who had migrated to Abyssinia and had come back along with them (along with immigrants) visited Hafsa, the wife of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him). (Accordingly), Umar had been sitting with her (Hafsa). As &#8216;Umar saw Asma, he said: Who is she? She (Hafsa) said: She is Asma, daughter of &#8216;Umais. He said: She is an Abyssinian and a sea-woman. Asma said: Yes, it is so. Thereupon &#8216;Umar said: We preceded you in migration and so we have more right to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as compared with you. At this she felt annoyed and said: &#8216;Umar, you are not stating the fact; by Allah, you had the privilege of being in the company of the Messenger (may peace be upon him) who fed the hungry among you and instructed the ignorant amongst you, whereas we had been far (from here) in the land of Abyssinia amongst the enemies and that was all for Allah and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and, by Allah, I would never take food nor take water unless I make a mention to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) of what you have said. We remained in that country in constant trouble and dread and I shall talk about it to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (way peace be upon him) and ask him (about it). By Allah, I shall not tell a lie and deviate (from the truth) and add anything to that. So, when Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) came, she said: Allah&#8217;s Apostle, &#8216;Umar says so and so. Upon this Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: His right is not more than yours, for him and his companions there is one migration, but for you, i. e. for the people of the boat, there are two migrations. She said: I saw Abu Musa and the people of the boat coming to me in groups and asking me about this hadith, because there was nothing more pleasing and more significant for them than this. Abu Burda reported that Asma said: I saw Abu Musa, asking me to repeat this hadith to him again and again.</p>

So Abu Bakr came to them and said: O my brothers, I have annoyed you. They said: No, our brother, may Allah forgive you</p>

Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said:&#8221; you were to say that Aslam, Ghifar, Muzaina and I think Juhaina are better than Banu Tamim, Banu &#8216;Amir and Asad, Ghatfan, then would these people (of latter group of tribes) be in loss? He said: Yes. Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: By Him in Whose Hand is my life, these people are better than Banu Tamim, Banu Amir, Asad and Ghatfan, and in this hadith of Abu Shaiba (these words are not found) that Muhammad (the narrator) had a doubt about.</p>

He (&#8216;Umar) said: Let me write a letter for you to its governor, whereupon he (Uwais) said: I love to live amongst the poor people.

He (the person who had performed Hajj) said: Ask forgiveness for me (from Allah). He (Uwais again) said: You have just come from the sacred journey, so you ask forgiveness for me. (Uwais further) said: Did you meet Umar? He said: Yes. He (Uwais) then begged forgiveness for him (from Allah). So the people came to know about (the status of religious piety) of Uwais.

And he gave him half a wasq of barley, and the person and his wife and their guests kept on making use of it (as a food) until he weighed it (in order to find out the actual quantity, and it was no more). He came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) (and informed him about it). He said: Had you not weighed it, you would be eating out of it and it would have remained intact for you.</p>

He then went in and (later on) came out and then after that offered the sunset and night prayers together and then said: God willing, you would reach by tomorrow the fountain of Tabuk and you should not come to that until it is dawn, and he who amongst you happens to go there should not touch its water until I come. We came to that and two persons (amongst) us reached that fountain ahead of us. It was a thin flow of water like the shoelace. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) asked them whether they had touched the water. They said: Yes. Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) scolded them, and he said to them what he had to say by the will of God. The people then took water of the fountain in their palms until it became somewhat significant and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) washed his hands and his face too in it, and then, took it again in that (fountain) and there gushed forth abundant water from that fountain, until all the people drank to their fill. He then said: Mu&#8217;adh, it is hoped that if you live long you would see its water irrigating well the gardens.</p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said. Make an assessment (of the price of its fruit). And Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) also made an assessment and it was ten wasqs.

So we proceeded on until we came to Tabuk and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: The violent storm will overtake you during the night, so none amongst you should stand up and he who has a camel with him should hobble it firmly. A violent storm blew and a person who had stood up was carried away by the storm and thrown between the mountains of Tayy. Then the messenger of the son of al &#8216;Alma&#8217;, the ruler of Aila, came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) with a letter and a gift of a white mule. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) wrote him (the reply) and presented him a cloak. We came back until we halted in the Wadi al-Qura. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) asked that lady about her garden and the price of the fruits in that. She said: Ten wasqs. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: I am going to depart, and he who amongst you wishes may depart with me but he who wants to stay may stay. We resumed the journey until we came to the outskirts of Medina. (It was at this time) that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: This is Taba, this is Uhud, that is a mountain which loves us and we love it, and then said: The best amongst the houses of the Ansar is the house of Bani Najjar. Then the house of Bani Abd al-Ashhal, then the house of Bani Abd al-Harith b. Khazraj, then the house of Bani Sa&#8217;ida, and there is goodness in all the houses of the Ansar. Said b.

Said met Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, you have declared the house of the Ansar as good and have kept us at the end, whereupon he said: Is it not enough for you that you have been counted amongst the good.</p>

One day while a girl was combing me I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) say:&#8221; O people.&#8221; I said to that girl: Keep away from me. She said: He (the Holy Prophet) has addressed the men only and he has not invited the attention of the women. I said: I am amongst the people also (and have thus every right to listen to the things pertaining to religion). Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: I shall be your harbinger on the Cistern; therefore, be cautious lest one of you should come (to me) and may be driven away like a stray camel. I would ask the reasons, and it would be said to me: You don&#8217;t know what innovations they made after you. And I would then also say: Be away.</p>

One night the people of Medina felt disturbed and set forth in the direction of a sound when Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) met them on his way back as he had gone towards that sound ahead of them. He was on the horse of Abu Talha which had no saddle over it, and a sword was slung round his neck, and he was saying: There was nothing to be afraid of, and he also said: We found it (this horse) like a torrent of water (indicating its swift-footedness), whereas the horse had been slow before that time.</p>

He said: What are you doing? They said: We are grafting them, whereupon he said: It may perhaps be good for you if you do not do that, so they abandoned this practice (and the date-palms) began to yield less fruit. They made a mention of it (to the Holy Prophet), whereupon he said: I am a human being, so when I command you about a thing pertaining to religion, do accept it, and when I command you about a thing out of my personal opinion, keep it in mind that I am a human being. &#8216;Ikrima reported that he said something like this.</p>

He had come in a land inhabited by haughty and cruel men along with Sara. She was very good-looking amongst the people, so he said to her: If these were to know that you are my wife they would snatch you away from me, so if they ask you tell that you are my sister and in fact you are my sister in Islam, and I do not know of any other Muslim in this land besides I and you. And when they entered that land the tyrants came to see her and said to him (the king): &#8216;there comes to your land a woman, whom you alone deserve to possess, so he (the kings sent someone (towards her) and she was brought and Ibrahim (peace be upon him) stood in preyer, and when she visited him (the tyrant king came) he could help but stretch his hand towards her and his hand was tied up. He said: Supplicate Allah so that He may release my hand and I will do no harm to you. She did that and the man repeated (the same highhandedness) and his hand was again tied up more tightly than on the first occasion and he said to her like that and she again did that (supplicated), but he repeated (the same highhandedness and his hands were tied up more tightly than on the previous occasion). He then again said: Supplicate your Lord so that He may set my hand free; by. @ llah I shall do no harm to you. She did and his hand was freed. Then he called the person who had brought her and said to him: You have brought to me the satan and you have not brought to me a human being, so turn them out from my land, and he gave Hajira as a gift to her. She returned (along with Hajira) and when Ibrahim (peace be upon him) saw her, he said: How have you returned? She said: With full safety (have I returned). Allah held the hand of that debauch and he gave me a maid-servant. Abu Hiaraira said: O sons of the rain of the sky, she is your mother.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa&#8217;id b. jubair reported: I said to Ibn Abbas that Nauf al-Bikali was of the opinion that Moses (peace be upon him), the Apostle of Bani Isra&#8217;il, was not the same who accompanied Khadir, whereupon he said: The enemy of Allah tells a lie. I heard Ubayy b. Ka&#8217;b say: Moses (peace be upon him) stood up to give sermon to the people of Isra&#8217;il. He was asked as to who amongst the people has the best knowledge, whereupon he said: I have the best knowledge. Thereupon Allah was annoyed with him that he did not attribute (the best knowledge) to Him. He revealed to him: A servant amongst My servants is at the junction of two rivers who has more knowledge than yours. Moses said: How can I meet him? It was said to him: Carry a fish in the large basket and the place where you find it missing there you will find him. Thereupon Moses proceeded forth along with a young man (Yusha&#8217;). Joshua b. Nan and Moses (peace be upon him) put the fish in the basket and there went along with him the young man (Yusha&#8217;) until they came to a certain rock and Moses and his companion went to sleep and the fish stirred in that basket and fell into the ocean and Allah stopped the current of water like a vault until the way was made for the fish. Moses and his youn. companion were astonished and they walked for the rest of the day and the night and the friend of Moses forgot to inform him of this incident. When it was morning, Moses (peace be upon him) said to the young man: Bring for us the breakfast for we are dead tired because of this journey, and they did not feel exhausted until they had passed that place where they had been commanded (to stay). He said: Don&#8217;t you know that when we reached the Sakhra (rock) I forgot the fisii and noth ng made me forget it but the satan that I. could nit remember it? How strange is it that the fish found a way in the river? Moses said: That was what we had been aiming at. Then both of them retraced their steps until they reached Sakhra; there they saw a man covered with a cloth. Moses greeted him. Khadir said to him: Where is as-Salam in our country.? He said: I am Moses, whereupon he (Khadir) said: You mean the Moses of Bani Isra&#8217;il? He said: Yes. He (Khadir) said: You have a knowledge out of the knowledge of Allah which in fact Allah imparted to you and about that I know nothing and I have knowledge out of Allah&#8217;s knowledge which He imparted to me and about that you do not know. Moses (peace be upon him) said to him: May I follow you so that you may teach me that with which you have been taught righteousness. He said: You will not be able to bear with me; how you will be able to bear that about which you do not know? Moses said: Thou wilt find me patient, nor shalt I disobey you in aught. Khadir said to him: If you were to follow me, then do not ask me about anything until I myself speak to you about it. He said: Yes. So Khadir and Moses set forth on the bank of the river that there came before them a boat. Both of theni talked to them (the owners of the boat) so that they might carry both of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They had recognised Khadir and they carried them free. Khadir thereupon took hold of a plank in the boat and broke it away. Moses said: These people have carried us without any charge and you attempt to break their boat so that the people sailing in the boat may drown. This is (something) grievous that you have done. He said: Did I not say that you would not bear with me? He said: Blame me not for what I forgot and be not hard upon what I did. Then both of them got down from the boat and began to walk along the coastline that they saw a boy who had been playing with other boys. Khadir pulled up his head and killed him. Moses said: Have you killed an innocent person who is in no way guilty of slaying another? You have done something horrible. Thereupon he said: Did I not say to you that you will not be able to bear with me? He (Moses) said: This (act) is more grievous than the first one. He (Moses) further said. If I ask you about anything after this, keep not company with me, then you would no doubt find (a plausible) excuse for this. Then they both walked on until they reached the inhabitants of a village. They asked its inhabitants for food but they refused to entertain them as their guests. They found in it a wall which had been bent on one side and was about to fall. Khadir set it right with his own hand. Moses, said to him: It is the people to whom we came but they showed us no hospitality and they did not serve us food. If you wish you can get wages for it. He (Khadir) said: This is the parting of ways between mt and you. Now I wish to reveal to you the significance of that for which you could not bear with me. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said. May Allah have mercy upon Moses! I wish if Moses could show patience and a (fuller) story of both of them could have been told. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said that the first thing which Moses said was out of forgetfulness. Then there came a sparrow until it perched on the wall of the boat and took water from the ocean. Thereupon, Khadir said: My knowledge and your knowledge in comparison with the knowledge of Allah is even less than the water taken by the sparrow in its beak in comparison to the water of the ocean, and Sa&#8217;id b. jubair used to recite (verses 79 and 80 of Sura Kahf) in this way: There was before them a king who used to seize every boat by force which was in order, the boy was an unbeliever.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="030.5865"></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa, id b. jubair reported that it was said to Ibn &#8216;Abbas that Nauf al-Bikali was of the opinion that Moses who went in search of knowledge was not the Moses of Bani Isra&#8217;il. He said: Sa&#8217;id, did you hear it from him? I said: Yes. Thereupon he said that Nauf had not stated the fact. Ubayy b. Ka&#8217;b narrated to us that he had heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Moses had been delivering sermons to his people. And he made this remark: No person upon the earth has better knowledge than I or nothing better than mine. Thereupon Allah revealed to him: I know one who is better than you (in knowledge) or there is a person on the earth having more knowledge than you. Thereupon he said: My Lord, direct me to him. It was said to him: Keep a salted fish as a provision for journey. The place where that fish would be lost (there you will find that man). So he set forth and a young slave along with him until they came to a place Sakhra. but he did not find any clue. So he proceeded on and left that young man there. The fish began to stir in water and the water assumed the form of an ark over the fish. The young man said: I should meet Allah&#8217;s Apostle (peace be upon him) and inform him, but he was made to forget and when they had gone beyond that place, he (Moses) said to the young man: Bring breakfast. We have been exhausted because of the journey, and he (Moses) was not exhausted until he had crossed that (particular) place (where he had) to meet Khadir, and the youth was reminded and said: Did you not see that as we reached Sakhra I forgot the fish and it is satan alone who has made me forgetful of it&#8217;? It is strange that he has been able to find way in the ocean too. He said: This is what we sought for us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They returned retracing their steps, and he (his companion) pointed to him the location (where) the fish (had been lost). Moses began to search him there. He suddenly saw Khadir wrapped in a cloth and lying on his back. He said to him: As-Salamu-&#8216;Alaikum. He removed the cloth from his face and said: Wa &#8216;Alaikum-us-Salam! Who are you? He said: I am Moses. He said: Who Moses? He said: Moses Of Bani Isra&#8217;il. He said: What brought you here? He said: I have come so that you may teach me what you have been taught of righteousness. He said: You shall have to bear with me, and how can you have patience about a thing of which you have no comprehensive knowledge? You will not have patience when you see me doing a thing I have been ordered to do. He said: If Allah pleases, you will find me patient, nor shall I disobey you in aught. Khadir said: If you follow me, don&#8217;t ask me about anything until I explain it to you. So they went on until they embarked upon a boat. He (Khadir) made a hole in that. Thereupon he (Moses) said: You have done this so that you may drown the persons sitting in the boat. You have done something grievous. Thereupon he said: Did I not tell you that you will not be able to bear with me? Thereupon he (Moses) said: Blame me not for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for what I did. (Khadir gave him another chance.) So they went on until they reached a place where boys were playing. He went to one of them and caught hold&#8217;of one (apparently) at random and killed him. Moses (peace be upon him) felt agitated and said: You have killed an innocent person not guilty of slaying another. You have done something aboininable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: May Allah have mercy upon us and Moses. Had he shown patience he would have seen wonderful things, but fear of blame, with respect to his companion, seized him and he said: If I ask anything after this, keep not company with me. You will then have a valid excuse in my case, and had he (Moses) shown patience he would have seen many wonderful things. He (the narrator) said: Whenever he (the Holy Prophet) made mention of any Prophet, he always said: May there be mercy of Allah upon us and upon my brother so and so. They, however, proceeded on until they came to the inhabitants of a village who were very miserly. They went to the meeting places and asked for hospitality but they refused to show any hospitality to them. They both found in that village a wall which was about to fall. He (Khadir) set it right. Thereupon he (Moses) said: If you so liked. you could get wages for it. Thereupon he said: This is the partince, of ways between me and you, and, taking hold of his cloth, he said: Now I will explain to you the real significance (of all these acts) for which you could not show patience. As for the boat, it belonged to the poor people working on the river and I intended to damage it for there was ahead of them (a king) who seized boats by force. (When he came) to catch hold of it he found it a damaged boat, so he spared it (and later on) it was set right with wood. So far as the boy is concerned, he has been, by very nature, an unbeliever, whereas his parents loved him very much. Had he grown up he would have involved them in wrongdoing and unbelief, so we wished that their Lord should give them in its place one better in purity and close to mercy. And as for the wall it belonged to two orphan boys in the city and there was beneath it a (treasure) belongin to them,&#8230; up to the last verse. This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Abu Ishaq.</p>

Ibn &#8216;Abbas said that he was Khadir. There happened to pass Ubayy b. Ka&#8217;b Ansari. Ibn Abbas called him and said: Abu Tufail, come to us. There has been a difference of opinion between me and my friend about the companion of Moses whom he wanted to meet on the way. Did hear anything from Allah&#8217;s meesenger (may peace be upon him) making a mention of anything? Ubayy said: I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may Peace be upon him) as saying: As Moses was amongst the group of Bani Isra&#8217;il, there came to him a person and he said to him: Do you know anyone having better knowledge than you? Moses said: No. Thereupon Allah revealed to Moses: Of course, there is amongst Our servants Khadir (who has better knowledge) than you. Moses asked the way of meeting him. Allah made the fish a sign and it was said to him: Where you miss the fish return to that (place) and you will soon find him. So Moses moved on as Allah wished him to move on. He then said to his young companion: Bring for us the breakfast. Thereupop that young man said to Moses. when he asked him for the breakfast: Don&#8217;t you see that as we had reached the Sakhra I forgot the fish and nobody made it forget (in our mind) but the satan that I should remind you of it? Mosed said to that young man: This was what we wanted. So they retraced their steps and met Khadir and the events which followed have been described in His Book except that Yunus (the narrator) said that he followed the traces of fish in the ocean.</p>

<h3 align="center"><font>Virtues and Merits of the Prophet(Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) and his Companions </font></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.056.659">Volume 4, Book 56, Number 659: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Rabi bin Hirash: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Uqba bin &#8216;Amr said to Hudhaifa, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you relate to  us of what you have heard from Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I heard him saying,  &#8220;When Al-Dajjal appears, he will have fire and water along with him. What the people  will consider as cold water, will be fire that will burn (things). So, if anyone of you  comes across this, he should fall in the thing which will appear to him as fire, for in  reality, it will be fresh cold water.&#8221; Hudhaifa added, &#8220;I also heard him saying,  &#8216;From among the people preceding your generation, there was a man whom the angel of death  visited to capture his soul. (So his soul was captured) and he was asked if he had done  any good deed.&#8217; He replied, &#8216;I don&#8217;t remember any good deed.&#8217; He was asked to think it  over. He said, &#8216;I do not remember, except that I used to trade with the people in the  world and I used to give a respite to the rich and forgive the poor (among my debtors). So  Allah made him enter Paradise.&#8221; Hudhaifa further said, &#8220;I also heard him saying,  &#8216;Once there was a man on his death-bed, who, losing every hope of surviving said to his  family: When I die, gather for me a large heap of wood and make a fire (to burn me). When  the fire eats my meat and reaches my bones, and when the bones burn, take and crush them  into powder and wait for a windy day to throw it (i.e. the powder) over the sea. They did  so, but Allah collected his particles and asked him: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Why did you do so? He replied: For fear of You. So Allah  forgave him.&#8221; &#8216;Uqba bin &#8216;Amr said, &#8220;I heard him saying that the Israeli used to  dig the grave of the dead (to steal their shrouds).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 660: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha and Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On his death-bed Allah&#8217;s Apostle put a sheet over his-face  and when he felt hot, he would remove it from his face. When in that state (of putting and  removing the sheet) he said, &#8220;May Allah&#8217;s Curse be on the Jews and the Christians for  they build places of worship at the graves of their prophets.&#8221; (By that) he intended  to warn (the Muslim) from what they (i.e. Jews and Christians) had done. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 661: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The Israelis used to be ruled and  guided by prophets: Whenever a prophet died, another would take over his place. There will  be no prophet after me, but there will be Caliphs who will increase in number.&#8221; The  people asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What do you order us (to do)?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Obey the one who will be given the pledge of allegiance first. Fulfil their (i.e.  the Caliphs) rights, for Allah will ask them about (any shortcoming) in ruling those Allah  has put under their guardianship.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 662: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Said: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;You will follow the wrong ways, of  your predecessors so completely and literally that if they should go into the hole of a  mastigure, you too will go there.&#8221; We said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Do you mean the  Jews and the Christians?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Whom else?&#8221; (Meaning, of course, the  Jews and the Christians.) </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.056.663"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 663: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people mentioned the fire and the bell (as means  proposed for announcing the time of prayer) and by such a suggestion they referred to the  Jews and the Christians. But Bilal was ordered, &#8220;Pronounce the words of the Adhan  (i.e. call for the prayer) twice and the Iqama once only.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 664: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That she used to hate that one should keep his hands on his  flanks while praying. She said that the Jew used to do so. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.056.665"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 665: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Your period (i.e. the Muslims&#8217;  period) in comparison to the periods of the previous nations, is like the period between  the &#8216;Asr prayer and sunset. And your example in comparison to the Jews and the Christians  is like the example of a person who employed some laborers and asked them, &#8216;Who will work  for me till midday for one Qirat each?&#8217; The Jews worked for half a day for one Qirat each.  The person asked, &#8216;Who will do the work for me from midday to the time of the &#8216;Asr  (prayer) for one Qirat each?&#8217; The Christians worked from midday till the &#8216;Asr prayer for  one Qirat. Then the person asked, &#8216;Who will do the work for me from the &#8216;Asr till sunset  for two Qirats each?&#8217; &#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;It is you (i.e. Muslims) who are  doing the work from the Asr till sunset, so you will have a double reward. The Jews and  the Christians got angry and said, &#8216;We have done more work but got less wages.&#8217; Allah  said, &#8216;Have I been unjust to you as regards your rights?&#8217; They said, &#8216;No.&#8217; So Allah said,  &#8216;Then it is My Blessing which I bestow on whomever I like. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard &#8216;Umar saying, &#8220;May Allah Curse so-and-so!  Doesn&#8217;t he know that the Prophet said, &#8216;May Allah curse the Jews for, though they were  forbidden (to eat) fat, they liquefied it and sold it. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Convey (my teachings) to the people  even if it were a single sentence, and tell others the stories of Bani Israel (which have  been taught to you), for it is not sinful to do so. And whoever tells a lie on me  intentionally, will surely take his place in the (Hell) Fire.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 668: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The Jews and the Christians do  not dye (their grey hair), so you shall do the opposite of what they do (i.e. dye your  grey hair and beards).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 669: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jundub: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Amongst the nations before you  there was a man who got a wound, and growing impatient (with its pain), he took a knife  and cut his hand with it and the blood did not stop till he died. Allah said, &#8216;My Slave  hurried to bring death upon himself so I have forbidden him (to enter) Paradise.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.056.670"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 670: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that he heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Allah willed to  test three Israelis who were a Leper, a blind man and a bald-headed man. So, he sent them  an angel who came to the leper and said, &#8216;What thing do you like most?&#8217; He replied,  &#8220;Good color and good skin, for the people have a strong aversion to me.&#8217; The angel  touched him and his illness was cured, and he was given a good color and beautiful skin.  The angel asked him, &#8216;What kind of property do you like best?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Camels (or  cows).&#8217; (The narrator is in doubt, for either the leper or the bald-headed man demanded  camels and the other demanded cows.) So he (i.e. the leper) was given a pregnant  she-camei, and the angel said (to him), &#8216;May Allah bless you in it.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The angel then went to the bald-headed man and said, &#8216;What  thing do you like most?&#8217; He said, &#8216;I like good hair and wish to be cured of this disease,  for the people feel repulsion for me.&#8217; The angel touched him and his illness was cured,  and he was given good hair. The angel asked (him), &#8216;What kind of property do you like  bests&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Cows,&#8217; The angel gave him a pregnant cow and said, &#8216;May Allah bless  you in it.&#8217; The angel went to the blind man and asked, &#8216;What thing do you like best?&#8217; He  said, &#8216;(I like) that Allah may restore my eye-sight to me so that I may see the people.&#8217;  The angel touched his eyes and Allah gave him back his eye-sight. The angel asked him,  &#8220;What kind of property do you like best?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Sheep.&#8217; The angel gave him a  pregnant sheep. Afterwards, all the three pregnant animals gave birth to young ones, and  multiplied and brought forth so much that one of the (three) men had a herd of camels  filling a valley, and one had a herd of cows filling a valley, and one had a flock of  sheep filling a valley. Then the angel, disguised in the shape and appearance of a leper,  went to the leper and said, I am a poor man, who has lost all means of livelihood while on  a journey. So none will satisfy my need except Allah and then you. In the Name of Him Who  has given you such nice color and beautiful skin, and so much property, I ask you to give  me a camel so that I may reach my destination. The man replied, &#8216;I have many obligations  (so I cannot give you).&#8217; The angel said, &#8216;I think I know you; were you not a leper to whom  the people had a strong aversion? Weren&#8217;t you a poor man, and then Allah gave you (all  this property).&#8217; He replied, &#8216;(This is all wrong), I got this property through inheritance  from my fore-fathers&#8217; The angel said, &#8216;If you are telling a lie, then let Allah make you  as you were before. &#8216; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then the angel, disguised in the shape and appearance of a  bald man, went to the bald man and said to him the same as he told the first one, and he  too answered the same as the first one did. The angel said, &#8216;If you are telling a lie,  then let Allah make you as you were before.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The angel, disguised in the shape of a blind man, went to  the blind man and said, &#8216;I am a poor man and a traveler, whose means of livelihood have  been exhausted while on a journey. I have nobody to help me except Allah, and after Him,  you yourself. I ask you in the Name of Him Who has given you back your eye-sight to give  me a sheep, so that with its help, I may complete my journey&#8217; The man said, &#8216;No doubt, I  was blind and Allah gave me back my eye-sight; I was poor and Allah made me rich; so take  anything you wish from my property. By Allah, I will not stop you for taking anything (you  need) of my property which you may take for Allah&#8217;s sake.&#8217; The angel replied, &#8216;Keep your  property with you. You (i.e 3 men) have been tested and Allah is pleased with you and is  angry with your two companions.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 671: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Once three persons (from the  previous nations) were traveling, and suddenly it started raining and they took shelter in  a cave. The entrance of the cave got closed while they were inside. They said to each  other, &#8216;O you! Nothing can save you except the truth, so each of you should ask Allah&#8217;s  Help by referring to such a deed as he thinks he did sincerely (i.e. just for gaining  Allah&#8217;s Pleasure).&#8217; So one of them said, &#8216;O Allah! You know that I had a laborer who  worked for me for one Faraq (i.e. three Sas) of rice, but he departed, leaving it (i.e.  his wages). I sowed that Faraq of rice and with its yield I bought cows (for him). Later  on when he came to me asking for his wages, I said (to him), &#8216;Go to those cows and drive  them away.&#8217; He said to me, &#8216;But you have to pay me only a Faraq of rice,&#8217; I said to him,  &#8216;Go to those cows and take them, for they are the product of that Faraq (of rice).&#8217; So he  drove them. O Allah! If you consider that I did that for fear of You, then please remove  the rock.&#8217; The rock shifted a bit from the mouth of the cave. The second one said, &#8216;O  Allah, You know that I had old parents whom I used to provide with the milk of my sheep  every night. One night I was delayed and when I came, they had slept, while my wife and  children were crying with hunger. I used not to let them (i.e. my family) drink unless my  parents had drunk first. So I disliked to wake them up and also disliked that they should  sleep without drinking it, I kept on waiting (for them to wake) till it dawned. O Allah!  If You consider that I did that for fear of you, then please remove the rock.&#8217; So the rock  shifted and they could see the sky through it. The (third) one said, &#8216;O Allah! You know  that I had a cousin (i.e. my paternal uncle&#8217;s daughter) who was most beloved to me and I  sought to seduce her, but she refused, unless I paid her one-hundred Dinars (i.e. gold  pieces). So I collected the amount and brought it to her, and she allowed me to sleep with  her. But when I sat between her legs, she said, &#8216;Be afraid of Allah, and do not deflower  me but legally. &#8216;I got up and left the hundred Dinars (for her). O Allah! If You consider  that I did that for fear of you than please remove the rock. So Allah saved them and they  came out (of the cave).&#8221; (This Hadith indicates that one can only ask Allah for help  directly or through his performed good deeds. But to ask Allah through dead or absent  prophets, saints, spirits, holy men, angels etc. is absolutely forbidden in Islam and it  is a kind of disbelief.) </font></p>

Do not make my  child like her.&#8217; The child said, &#8216;O Allah! Make me like her.&#8217; Then he said, &#8216;As for the  rider, he is an infidel, while the lady is accused of illegal sexual intercourse (falsely)  and she says: Allah is sufficient for me (He knows the truth).&#8221; </font></p>

Then he set out asking (whether his  repentance could be accepted or not). He came upon a monk and asked him if his repentance  could be accepted. The monk replied in the negative and so the man killed him. He kept on  asking till a man advised to go to such and such village. (So he left for it) but death  overtook him on the way. While dying, he turned his chest towards that village (where he  had hoped his repentance would be accepted), and so the angels of mercy and the angels of  punishment quarrelled amongst themselves regarding him. Allah ordered the village (towards  which he was going) to come closer to him, and ordered the village (whence he had come),  to go far away, and then He ordered the angels to measure the distances between his body  and the two villages. So he was found to be one span closer to the village (he was going  to). So he was forgiven.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;From this side from the east,  afflictions will appear. Rudeness and lack of mercy are characteristics of the rural  bedouins who are busy with their camels and cows (and pay no attention to religion). Such  are the tribes of Rabi&#8217;a and Mudar.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Pride and arrogance  are characteristics of the rural bedouins while calmness is found among the owners of  sheep. Belief is Yemenite, and wisdom is also Yemenite i.e. the Yemenites are well-known  for their true belief and wisdom).&#8221; Abu &#8216;Abdullah (Al-Bukhari) said, &#8220;Yemen was  called so because it is situated to the right of the Ka&#8217;ba, and Sham was called so because  it is situated to the left of the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That while he was with a delegation from Quraish to  Muawiya, the latter heard the news that &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr bin Al-&#8216;As said that there  would be a king from the tribe of Qahtan. On that Muawiya became angry, got up and then  praised Allah as He deserved, and said, &#8220;Now then, I have heard that some men amongst  you narrate things which are neither in the Holy Book, nor have been told by Allah&#8217;s  Apostle. Those men are the ignorant amongst you. Beware of such hopes as make the people  go astray, for I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;Authority of ruling will remain with  Quraish, and whoever bears hostility to them, Allah will destroy him as long as they abide  by the laws of the religion.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair was the most beloved person to  &#8216;Aisha excluding the Prophet and Abu Bakr, and he in his turn, was the most devoted to  her, &#8216;Aisha used not to withhold the money given to her by Allah, but she used to spend it  in charity. (&#8216;Abdullah) bin AzZubair said, &#8221; &#8216;Aisha should be stopped from doing  so.&#8221; (When &#8216;Aisha heard this), she said protestingly, &#8220;Shall I be stopped from  doing so? I vow that I will never talk to &#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair.&#8221; On that, Ibn  Az-Zubair asked some people from Quraish and particularly the two uncles of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle to intercede with her, but she refused (to talk to him). Az-Zuhriyun, the uncles  of the Prophet, including &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Aswad bin &#8216;Abd Yaghuth and Al-Miswar bin  Makhrama said to him, &#8220;When we ask for the permission to visit her, enter her house  along with us (without taking her leave).&#8221; He did accordingly (and she accepted their  intercession). He sent her ten slaves whom she manumitted as an expiation for (not  keeping) her vow. &#8216;Aisha manumitted more slaves for the same purpose till she manumitted  forty slaves. She said, &#8220;I wish I had specified what I would have done in case of not  fulfilling my vow when I made the vow, so that I might have done it easily.&#8221; </font></p>

The Ansari said, &#8220;Help, O  Ansar!&#8221; And the emigrant said &#8220;Help, O emigrants!&#8221; The Prophet came out and  said, &#8220;What is wrong with the people (as they are calling) this call of the period of  Ignorance? &#8220;Then he said, &#8220;What is the matter with them?&#8221; So he was told  about the stroke of the emigrant to the Ansari. The Prophet said, &#8220;Stop this (i.e.  appeal for help) for it is an evil call. &#8220;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul (a hypocrite)  said, &#8220;The emigrants have called and (gathered against us); so when we return to  Medina, surely, the more honorable people will expel therefrom the meaner,&#8221; Upon that  &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the news of the advent of the Prophet reached Abu  Dhar, he said to his brother, &#8220;Ride to this valley and bring me the news of this man  (i.e. the Prophet ) who claims to be a Prophet receiving information from the Heaven.  Listen to him and then come to me.&#8221; His brother set out till he met the Prophet and  listened to his speech and returned to Abu Dhar and said to him, &#8220;I have seen him  exhorting people to virtues and his speech was not like poetry.&#8221; Abu Dhar said,  &#8220;You have not satisfied me as to what I wanted.&#8221; So, he took his journey-food  and a water-skin full of water and set out till he reached Mecca, where he went to the  Mosque looking for the Prophet , whom he did not know, and he would not like to ask  someone about him. So, a portion of the night had passed when &#8216;Ali saw him and realized  that he was a stranger. Abu Dhar followed him (to his house), but neither of them asked  the other about anything till it was morning, when he carried his water-skin and food and  went to the Mosque. He spent that day without being observed by the Prophet till it was  night, when he returned to his sleeping place. &#8216;Ali again passed by him and said,  &#8220;Hasn&#8217;t the man (i.e. Abu Dhar) recognized his dwelling place yet?&#8221; So, &#8216;Ali let  him get up and took him (to his house), but neither of them asked the other about  anything, till it was the third day when &#8216;Ali had the same experience with him and Abu  Dhar again stayed with him. &#8216;Ali then asked, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you tell me what has brought you  here?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;If you give me a promise and a convention that you will  guide me, then I will tell you.&#8221; When &#8216;Ali did, Abu Dhar informed him (of his  purpose). &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;It is the Truth, and he (i.e. Muhammad) is the Apostle of  Allah. So when the morning comes, follow me, and if I should perceive any danger  threatening you, I will give you a hint by pretending to go to the watercloset. But if I  carried on walking, follow me till you enter the place that I will enter.&#8221; Abu Dhur  agreed and followed &#8216;Ali till he entered the place of the Prophet and Abu Dhur entered  with him. He then listened to the speech of the Prophet and embraced Islam on that very  spot. The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Go back to your people and inform them (of this  religion) till you receive my (further) orders.&#8221; Abu Dhur said, &#8220;By Him in Whose  Hands my life is! I will proclaim my conversion to Islam publicly amongst them (i.e.  infidels).&#8221; He went out till he reached the Mosque and announced as loudly as  possible, &#8220;I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that  Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah.&#8221; The people then got up and beat him till they  knocked him down. Al-Abbas came and threw himself over him (to protect him) saying, Woe to  you! Don&#8217;t you know that he is from Ghifar and there is the route (road) to your merchants  towards Sham (i.e. through the place where this tribe dwells)?&#8221; Thus he saved him  from them. Abu Dhar did the same on the next day and the people beat him again and  Al-&#8216;Abbas drew himself over him (to save him as before). </font></p>

We heard that a man had appeared in Mecca,  claiming to be a Prophet. ! said to my brother, &#8216;Go to that man and talk to him and bring  me his news.&#8217; He set out, met him and returned. I asked him, &#8216;What is the news with you?&#8217;  He said, &#8216;By Allah, I saw a man enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil.&#8217; I  said to him, &#8216;You have not satisfied me with this little information.&#8217; So, I took a  waterskin and a stick and proceeded towards Mecca. Neither did I know him (i.e. the  Prophet ), nor did I like to ask anyone about him. I Kept on drinking Zam zam water and  staying in the Mosque. Then &#8216;Ali passed by me and said, &#8216;It seems you are a stranger?&#8217; I  said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; He proceeded to his house and I accompanied him. Neither did he ask me  anything, nor did I tell him anything. Next morning I went to the Mosque to ask about the  Prophet but no-one told me anything about him. Ali passed by me again and asked, &#8216;Hasn&#8217;t  the man recognized his dwelling place yet&#8217; I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Come along with me.&#8217; He  asked me, &#8216;What is your business? What has brought you to this town?&#8217; I said to him, &#8216;If  you keep my secret, I will tell you.&#8217; He said, &#8216;I will do,&#8217; I said to him, &#8216;We have heard  that a person has appeared here, claiming to be a Prophet. I sent my brother to speak to  him and when he returned, he did not bring a satisfactory report; so I thought of meeting  him personally.&#8217; &#8216;Ali said (to Abu Dhar), &#8216;You have reached your goal; I am going to him  just now, so follow me, and wherever I enter, enter after me. If I should see someone who  may cause you trouble, I will stand near a wall pretending to mend my shoes (as a  warning), and you should go away then.&#8217; &#8216;Ali proceeded and I accompanied him till he  entered a place, and I entered with him to the Prophet to whom I said, &#8216;Present (the  principles of) Islam to me.&#8217; When he did, I embraced Islam &#8216;immediately. He said to me, &#8216;O  Abu Dhar! Keep your conversion as a secret and return to your town; and when you hear of  our victory, return to us. &#8216; I said, &#8216;By H him Who has sent you with the Truth, I will  announce my conversion to Islam publicly amongst them (i.e. the infidels),&#8217; Abu Dhar went  to the Mosque, where some people from Quraish were present, and said, &#8216;O folk of Quraish !  I testify that None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and I (also) testify that  Muhammad is Allah&#8217;s Slave and His Apostle.&#8217; (Hearing that) the Quraishi men said, &#8216;Get at  this Sabi (i.e. Muslim) !&#8217; They got up and beat me nearly to death. Al &#8216;Abbas saw me and  threw himself over me to protect me. He then faced them and said, &#8216;Woe to you! You want to  kill a man from the tribe of Ghifar, although your trade and your communications are  through the territory of Ghifar?&#8217; They therefore left me. The next morning I returned (to  the Mosque) and said the same as I have said on the previous day. They again said, &#8216;Get at  this Sabi!&#8217; I was treated in the same way as on the previous day, and again Al-Abbas found  me and threw himself over me to protect me and told them the same as he had said the day  before.&#8217; So, that was the conversion of Abu Dhar (may Allah be Merciful to him) to  Islam.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>By chance I went to the Prophet at noon while he was at  Al-Abtah (resting) in a tent. Bilal came out (of the tent) and pronounced the Adhan for  the prayer, and entering again, he brought out the water which was left after Allah&#8217;s  Apostle had performed the ablution. The people rushed to take some of the water. Bilal  again went in and brought out a spear-headed stick, and then Allah&#8217;s Apostle came out. As  if I were now looking at the whiteness of his leg. Bilal fixed the stick and the Prophet  offered a two-Rakat Zuhr prayer and a two-Rak&#8217;at &#8216;Asr prayer, while women and donkeys were  passing in front of the Prophet (beyond the stick) . </font></p>

He left before I finished my optional prayer. Had I  found him still there.

He used to offer four Rakat, let  alone their beauty and length, and then four Rakat, let alone their beauty and length.  Afterwards he would offer three Rakat. I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Do you go to bed before  offering the Witr prayer?&#8217; He said, &#8216;My eyes sleep, but my heart does not sleep.&#8221;&#8216; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Anas bin Malik telling us about the night when the  Prophet was made to travel from the Ka&#8217;ba Mosque. Three persons (i.e. angels) came to the  Prophet before he was divinely inspired was an Aspostle), while he was sleeping in Al  Masjid-ul-Haram. The first (of the three angels) said, &#8220;Which of them is he?&#8221;  The second said, &#8220;He is the best of them.&#8221; That was all that happened then, and  he did not see them till they came at another night and he perceived their presence with  his heart, for the eyes of the Prophet were closed when he was asleep, but his heart was  not asleep (not unconscious). This is characteristic of all the prophets: Their eyes sleep  but their hearts do not sleep. Then Gabriel took charge of the Prophet and ascended along  with him to the Heaven. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Imran bin Husain: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That they were with the Prophet on a journey. They  travelled the whole night, and when dawn approached, they took a rest and sleep  overwhelmed them till the sun rose high in the sky. The first to get up was Abu Bakr.  Allah&#8217;s Apostles used not to be awakened from his sleep, but he would wake up by himself.  &#8216;Umar woke up and then Abu Bakr sat by the side of the Prophet&#8217;s head and started saying:  Allahu-Akbar raising his voice till the Prophet woke up, (and after traveling for a while)  he dismounted and led us in the morning prayer. A man amongst the people failed to join us  in the prayer. When the Prophet had finished the prayer, he asked (the man), &#8220;O  so-and-so! What prevented you from offering the prayer with us?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I  am Junub,&#8221; Alllah&#8217;s Apostle ordered him to perform Tayammam with clean earth. The man  then offered the prayer. Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered me and a few others to go ahead of him.  We had become very thirsty. While we were on our way (looking for water), we came across a  lady (riding an animal), hanging her legs between two water-skins. We asked her,  &#8220;Where can we get water?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;Oh ! There is no water.&#8221; We  asked, &#8220;how far is your house from the water?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;A distance of  a day and a night travel.&#8221; We said, &#8220;Come on to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, &#8220;She  asked, &#8220;What is Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; So we brought her to Allah&#8217;s Apostle against  her will, and she told him what she had told us before and added that she was the mother  of orphans. So the Prophet ordered that her two water-skins be brought and he rubbed the  mouths of the water-skins. As we were thirsty, we drank till we quenched our thirst and we  were forty men. We also filled all our waterskins and other utensils with water, but we  did not water the camels. The waterskin was so full that it was almost about to burst. The  Prophet then said, &#8220;Bring what (foodstuff) you have.&#8221; So some dates and pieces  of bread were collected for the lady, and when she went to her people, she said, &#8220;I  have met either the greatest magician or a prophet as the people claim.&#8221; So Allah  guided the people of that village through that lady. She embraced Islam and they all  embraced Islam. </font></p>

They could  not find water to perform the ablution. One of them went away and brought a little amount  of water in a pot. The Prophet took it and performed the ablution, and then stretched his  four fingers on to the pot and said (to the people), &#8220;Get up to perform the  ablution.&#8221; They started performing the ablution till all of them did it, and they  were seventy or so persons. </font></p>

A stone pot containing water  was brought to the Prophet, who wanted to put his hand in it, but It was too small for him  to spread his hand in it, and so he had to bring his fingers together before putting his  hand in the pot. Then all the people performed the ablution (with that water).&#8221; I  asked Anas, &#8220;How many persons were they.&#8221; He replied, &#8220;There were eighty  men.&#8221; </font></p>

He asked, &#8216;What is wrong with you?&#8217; They replied, &#8216;We have no water either for performing  ablution or for drinking except what is present in front of you.&#8217; So he placed his hand in  that pot and the water started flowing among his fingers like springs. We all drank and  performed ablution (from it).&#8221; I asked Jabir, &#8220;How many were you?&#8221; he  replied, &#8220;Even if we had been one-hundred-thousand, it would have been sufficient for  us, but we were fifteen-hundred.&#8221; </font></p>

We stayed for  a short while and then drew water from the well and quenched our thirst, and even our  riding animals drank water to their satisfaction. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Talha said to Um Sulaim, &#8220;I have noticed  feebleness in the voice of Allah&#8217;s Apostle which I think, is caused by hunger. Have you  got any food?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; She brought out some loaves of barley and  took out a veil belonging to her, and wrapped the bread in part of it and put it under my  arm and wrapped part of the veil round me and sent me to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. I went carrying  it and found Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the Mosque sitting with some people. When I stood there,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked, &#8220;Has Abu Talha sent you?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes&#8221;. He  asked, &#8220;With some food? I said, &#8220;Yes&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said to the men  around him, &#8220;Get up!&#8221; He set out (accompanied by them) and I went ahead of them  till I reached Abu Talha and told him (of the Prophet&#8217;s visit). Abu Talha said, &#8220;O Um  Sulaim! Allah&#8217;s Apostle is coming with the people and we have no food to feed them.&#8221;  She said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; So Abu Talha went out to receive  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Allah&#8217;s Apostle came along with Abu Talha. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O  Um Sulaim! Bring whatever you have.&#8221; She brought the bread which Allah&#8217;s Apostle  ordered to be broken into pieces. Um Sulaim poured on them some butter from an oilskin.  Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle recited what Allah wished him to recite, and then said, &#8220;Let ten  persons come (to share the meal).&#8221; Ten persons were admitted, ate their fill and went  out. Then he again said, &#8220;Let another ten do the same.&#8221; They were admitted, ate  their fill and went out. Then he again said, &#8216;&#8221;&#8216;Let another ten persons (do the  same.)&#8221; They were admitted, ate their fill and went out. Then he said, &#8220;Let  another ten persons come.&#8221; In short, all of them ate their fill, and they were  seventy or eighty men. </font></p>

He placed his hand in it and said, &#8220;Come  to the blessed water, and the Blessing is from Allah.&#8221; I saw the water flowing from  among the fingers of Allah&#8217;s Apostle , and no doubt, we heard the meal glorifying Allah,  when it was being eaten (by him). </font></p>

So please come  with me, so that the creditors may not misbehave with me.&#8221; The Prophet went round one  of the heaps of dates and invoked (Allah), and then did the same with another heap and sat  on it and said, &#8220;Measure (for them).&#8221; He paid them their rights and what  remained was as much as had been paid to them. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The companions of Suffa were poor people. The Prophet once  said, &#8220;Whoever has food enough for two persons, should take a third one (from among  them), and whoever has food enough for four persons, should take a fifth or a sixth (or  said something similar).&#8221; Abu Bakr brought three persons while the Prophet took ten.  And Abu Bakr with his three family member (who were I, my father and my mother) (the  sub-narrator is in doubt whether &#8216;Abdur-Rahman said, &#8220;My wife and my servant who was  common for both my house and Abu Bakr&#8217;s house.&#8221;) Abu Bakr took his supper with the  Prophet and stayed there till he offered the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayers. He returned and stayed till  Allah&#8217;s Apostle took his supper. After a part of the night had passed, he returned to his  house. His wife said to him, &#8220;What has detained you from your guests?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Have you served supper to them?&#8221; She said, &#8220;They refused to take supper)  until you come. They (i.e. some members of the household) presented the meal to them but  they refused (to eat)&#8221; I went to hide myself and he said, &#8220;O Ghunthar!&#8221; He  invoked Allah to cause my ears to be cut and he rebuked me. He then said (to them): Please  eat!&#8221; and added, I will never eat the meal.&#8221; By Allah, whenever we took a  handful of the meal, the meal grew from underneath more than that handful till everybody  ate to his satisfaction; yet the remaining food was more than the original meal. Abu Bakr  saw that the food was as much or more than the original amount. He called his wife,  &#8220;O sister of Bani Firas!&#8221; She said, &#8220;O pleasure of my eyes. The food has  been tripled in quantity.&#8221; Abu Bakr then started eating thereof and said, &#8220;It  (i.e. my oath not to eat) was because of Sa all.&#8221; He took a handful from it, and  carried the rest to the Prophet. SO that food was with the Prophet . There was a treaty  between us and some people, and when the period of that treaty had elapsed, he divided US  into twelve groups, each being headed by a man. Allah knows how many men were under the  command of each leader. Anyhow, the Prophet surely sent a leader with each group. Then all  of them ate of that meal. </font></p>

So while the Prophet was delivering a sermon on a Friday a  man got up saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The horses and sheep have perished. Will you  invoke Allah to bless us with rain?&#8221; The Prophet lifted both his hands and invoked.  The sky at that time was as clear as glass. Suddenly a wind blew, raising clouds that  gathered together, and it started raining heavily. We came out (of the Mosque) wading  through the flowing water till we reached our homes. It went on raining till the next  Friday, when the same man or some other man stood up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  The houses have collapsed; please invoke Allah to withhold the rain.&#8221; On that the  Prophet smiled and said, &#8220;O Allah, (let it rain) around us and not on us.&#8221; I  then looked at the clouds to see them separating forming a sort of a crown round Medina. </font></p>

The date-palm  cried like a child! The Prophet descended (the pulpit) and embraced it while it continued  moaning like a child being quietened.

You need not fear those (afflictions) as there is a closed door  between you and them.&#8221; &#8216;Umar asked, &#8220;Will that door be opened or broken?&#8221;  Hudhaifa replied, &#8220;No, it will be broken.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Then it is very  likely that the door will not be closed again.&#8221; Later on the people asked Hudhaifa,  &#8220;Did &#8216;Umar know what that door meant?&#8221; He said. &#8220;Yes, &#8216;Umar knew it as  everyone knows that there will be night before the tomorrow morning.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The Hour will not be established  till you fight a nation wearing hairy shoes, and till you fight the Turks, who will have  small eyes, red faces and flat noses; and their faces will be like flat shields. And you  will find that the best people are those who hate responsibility of ruling most of all  till they are chosen to be the rulers. And the people are of different natures: The best  in the pre-lslamic period are the best in Islam. A time will come when any of you will  love to see me rather than to have his family and property doubled.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Adi bin Hatim: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was in the city of the Prophet, a man came and  complained to him (the Prophet, ) of destitution and poverty. Then another man came and  complained of robbery (by highwaymen). The Prophet said, &#8220;Adi! Have you been to  Al-Hira?&#8221; I said, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t been to it, but I was informed about it.&#8221; He  said, &#8220;If you should live for a long time, you will certainly see that a lady in a  Howdah traveling from Al-Hira will (safely reach Mecca and) perform the Tawaf of the  Ka&#8217;ba, fearing none but Allah.&#8221; I said to myself, &#8220;What will happen to the  robbers of the tribe of Tai who have spread evil through out the country?&#8221; The  Prophet further said. &#8220;If you should live long, the treasures of Khosrau will be  opened (and taken as spoils).&#8221; I asked, &#8220;You mean Khosrau, son of Hurmuz?&#8221;  He said, &#8220;Khosrau, son of Hurmuz; and if you should live long, you will see that one  will carry a handful of gold or silver and go out looking for a person to accept it from  him, but will find none to accept it from him. And any of you, when meeting Allah, will  meet Him without needing an interpreter between him and Allah to interpret for him, and  Allah will say to him: &#8216;Didn&#8217;t I send a messenger to teach you?&#8217; He will say: &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Allah  will say: &#8216;Didn&#8217;t I give you wealth and do you favors?&#8217; He will say: &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Then he will  look to his right and see nothing but Hell, and look to his left and see nothing but  Hell.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Adi further said: I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;Save  yourself from the (Hell) Fire even with half a date (to be given in charity) and if you do  not find a half date, then with a good pleasant word.&#8221; &#8216;Adi added: (later on) I saw a  lady in a Howdah traveling from Al-Hira till she performed the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, fearing  none but Allah. And I was one of those who opened (conquered) the treasures of Khosrau,  son of Hurmuz. If you should live long, you will see what the Prophet Abu-l-Qasim had  said: &#8216;A person will come out with a handful. of gold&#8230;etc. </font></p>

Zainab said, &#8220;I said,  &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall we be destroyed though amongst us there are pious people? &#8216; He  said, &#8216;Yes, if evil increases.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Um Salama: The Prophet woke up and said,  &#8220;Glorified be Allah: What great (how many) treasures have been sent down, and what  great (how many ) afflictions have been sent down!&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people used to ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle about good, but I  used to ask him about evil for fear that it might overtake me. Once I said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

You will see their actions and disapprove of them.&#8221; I said,  &#8220;Will there by any evil after that good?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, there will be some  people who will invite others to the doors of Hell, and whoever accepts their invitation  to it will be thrown in it (by them).&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Describe  those people to us.&#8221; He said, &#8220;They will belong to us and speak our  language&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What do you order me to do if such a thing should take place  in my life?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Adhere to the group of Muslims and their Chief.&#8221; I  asked, &#8220;If there is neither a group (of Muslims) nor a chief (what shall I do)?&#8221;  He said, &#8220;Keep away from all those different sects, even if you had to bite (i.e.  eat) the root of a tree, till you meet Allah while you are still in that state.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While we were with Allah&#8217;s Apostle who was distributing  (i.e. some property), there came Dhu-l-Khuwaisira, a man from the tribe of Bani Tamim and  said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Do Justice.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Woe to you! Who  could do justice if I did not? I would be a desperate loser if I did not do justice.&#8221;  &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allow me to chop his head off.&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;Leave him, for he has companions who pray and fast in such a way that you will  consider your fasting negligible in comparison to theirs. They recite Qur&#8217;an but it does  not go beyond their throats (i.e. they do not act on it) and they will desert Islam as an  arrow goes through a victim&#8217;s body, so that the hunter, on looking at the arrow&#8217;s blade,  would see nothing on it; he would look at its Risaf and see nothing: he would look at its  Na,di and see nothing, and he would look at its Qudhadh ( 1 ) and see nothing (neither  meat nor blood), for the arrow has been too fast even for the blood and excretions to  smear. The sign by which they will be recognized is that among them there will be a black  man, one of whose arms will resemble a woman&#8217;s breast or a lump of meat moving loosely.  Those people will appear when there will be differences amongst the people.&#8221; I  testify that I heard this narration from Allah&#8217;s Apostle and I testify that &#8216;Ali bin Abi  Talib fought with such people, and I was in his company. He ordered that the man  (described by the Prophet ) should be looked for. The man was brought and I looked at him  and noticed that he looked exactly as the Prophet had described him. </font></p>

Would you pray to Allah for us?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Among the nations before you a  (believing) man would be put in a ditch that was dug for him, and a saw would be put over  his head and he would be cut into two pieces; yet that (torture) would not make him give  up his religion. His body would be combed with iron combs that would remove his flesh from  the bones and nerves, yet that would not make him abandon his religion. By Allah, this  religion (i.e. Islam) will prevail till a traveler from Sana (in Yemen) to Hadrarmaut will  fear none but Allah, or a wolf as regards his sheep, but you (people) are hasty. </font></p>

He asked Thabit, &#8220;What&#8217;s the  matter?&#8221; Thabit replied, &#8220;An evil situation: A man used to raise his voice over  the voice of the Prophet and so all his good deeds have been annulled and he is from the  people of Hell.&#8221; The man went back and told the Prophet that Thabit had said  so-and-so. (The sub-narrator, Musa bin Anas said, &#8220;The man went to Thabit again with  glad tidings).&#8221; The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Go and say to Thabit: &#8216;You are not  from the people of Fire, but from the people of Paradise.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara&#8217; bin &#8216;Azib: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Bakr came to my father who was at home and purchased a  saddle from him. He said to &#8216;Azib. &#8220;Tell your son to carry it with me.&#8221; So I  carried it with him and my father followed us so as to take the price (of the saddle). My  father said, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! Tell me what happened to you on your night journey with  Allah&#8217;s Apostle (during Migration).&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, we travelled the whole night  and also the next day till midday. when nobody could be seen on the way ( because of the  severe heat) . Then there appeared a long rock having shade beneath it, and the sunshine  had not come to it yet. So we dismounted there and I levelled a place and covered it with  an animal hide or dry grass for the Prophet to sleep on (for a while). I then said,  &#8216;Sleep, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and I will guard you.&#8217; So he slept and I went out to guard him.  Suddenly I saw a shepherd coming with his sheep to that rock with the same intention we  had when we came to it. I asked (him). &#8216;To whom do you belong, O boy?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;I  belong to a man from Medina or Mecca.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Do your sheep have milk?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217;  I said, &#8216;Will you milk for us?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; He caught hold of a sheep and I asked him  to clean its teat from dust, hairs and dirt. (The sub-narrator said that he saw Al-Bara&#8217;  striking one of his hands with the other, demonstrating how the shepherd removed the  dust.) The shepherd milked a little milk in a wooden container and I had a leather  container which I carried for the Prophet to drink and perform the ablution from. I went  to the Prophet, hating to wake him up, but when I reached there, the Prophet had already  awakened; so I poured water over the middle part of the milk container, till the milk was  cold. Then I said, &#8216;Drink, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8217; He drank till I was pleased. Then he asked,  &#8216;Has the time for our departure come?&#8217; I said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; So we departed after midday. Suraqa  bin Malik followed us and I said, &#8216;We have been discovered, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8217; He said,  Don&#8217;t grieve for Allah is with us.&#8217; The Prophet invoked evil on him (i.e. Suraqa) and so  the legs of his horse sank into the earth up to its belly. (The subnarrator, Zuhair is not  sure whether Abu Bakr said, &#8220;(It sank) into solid earth.&#8221;) Suraqa said, &#8216;I see  that you have invoked evil on me. Please invoke good on me, and by Allah, I will cause  those who are seeking after you to return.&#8217; The Prophet invoked good on him and he was  saved. Then, whenever he met somebody on the way, he would say, &#8216;I have looked for him  here in vain.&#8217; So he caused whomever he met to return. Thus Suraqa fulfilled his  promise.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet paid a visit to a sick bedouin. The Prophet  when visiting a patient used to say, &#8220;No harm will befall you! May Allah cure you!  May Allah cure you!&#8221; So the Prophet said to the bedouin. &#8220;No harm will befall  you. May Allah cure you!&#8221; The bedouin said, &#8220;You say, may Allah cure me? No, for  it is a fever which boils in (the body of) an old man, and will lead him to the  grave.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes, then may it be as you say.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>There was a Christian who embraced Islam and read  Surat-al-Baqara and Al-Imran, and he used to write (the revelations) for the Prophet.  Later on he returned to Christianity again and he used to say: &#8220;Muhammad knows  nothing but what I have written for him.&#8221; Then Allah caused him to die, and the  people buried him, but in the morning they saw that the earth had thrown his body out.  They said, &#8220;This is the act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our  companion and took his body out of it because he had run away from them.&#8221; They again  dug the grave deeply for him, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown  his body out. They said, &#8220;This is an act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the  grave of our companion and threw his body outside it, for he had run away from them.&#8221;  They dug the grave for him as deep as they could, but in the morning they again saw that  the earth had thrown his body out. So they believed that what had befallen him was not  done by human beings and had to leave him thrown (on the ground). </font></p>

He stood before Musailama (and his companions) and said, &#8220;If you asked me even this  piece (of a leaf), I would not give it to you. You cannot avoid the fate you are destined  to, by Allah. If you reject Islam, Allah will destroy you. I think that you are most  probably the same person whom I have seen in the dream.&#8221; Abu Huraira told me that  Allah&#8217;s Apostle; said, &#8220;While I was sleeping, I saw (in a dream) two gold bracelets  round my arm, and that worried me too much. Then I was instructed divinely in my dream, to  blow them off and so I blew them off, and they flew away. I interpreted the two bracelets  as symbols of two liars who would appear after me. And so one of them was Al-Ansi and the  other was Musailama Al-Kadhdhab from Al-Yamama.&#8221; </font></p>

I thought that it was Al-Yamama or  Hajar, but it came to be Medina i.e. Yathrib. In the same dream I saw myself moving a  sword and its blade got broken. It came to symbolize the defeat which the Muslims suffered  from, on the Day of Uhud. I moved the sword again, and it became normal as before, and  that was the symbol of the victory Allah bestowed upon Muslims and their gathering  together. I saw cows in my dream, and by Allah, that was a blessing, and they symbolized  the believers on the Day of Uhud. And the blessing was the good Allah bestowed upon us and  the reward of true belief which Allah gave us after the day of Badr. </font></p>

I think this portends my death, and you will be the  first of my family to follow me.&#8217; So I started weeping.

Umaiya  said to Sad, &#8220;Will you wait till midday when the people are (at their homes), then  you may go and perform the Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba?&#8221; So, while Sad was going around the  Ka&#8217;ba, Abu Jahl came and asked, &#8220;Who is that who is performing Tawaf?&#8221; Sad  replied, &#8220;I am Sad.&#8221; Abu Jahl said, &#8220;Are you circumambulating the Ka&#8217;ba  safely although you have given refuge to Muhammad and his companions?&#8221; Sad said,  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; and they started quarreling. Umaiya said to Sad, &#8220;Don&#8217;t shout at  Abi-l-Hakam (i.e. Abu Jahl), for he is chief of the valley (of Mecca).&#8221; Sad then said  (to Abu Jahl). &#8216;By Allah, if you prevent me from performing the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, I will  spoil your trade with Sham.&#8221; Umaiya kept on saying to Sad, &#8220;Don&#8217;t raise your  voice.&#8221; and kept on taking hold of him. Sad became furious and said, (to Umaiya),  &#8220;Be away from me, for I have heard Muhammad saying that he will kill you.&#8221;  Umaiiya said, &#8220;Will he kill me?&#8221; Sad said, &#8220;Yes,.&#8221; Umaiya said,  &#8220;By Allah! When Muhammad says a thing, he never tells a lie.&#8221; Umaiya went to his  wife and said to her, &#8220;Do you know what my brother from Yathrib (i.e. Medina) has  said to me?&#8221; She said, &#8220;What has he said?&#8221; He said, &#8220;He claims that he  has heard Muhammad claiming that he will kill me.&#8221; </font></p>

As for the one  for whom it is a source of reward, he is the one who keeps his horse for the sake of Jihad  in Allah&#8217;s Cause; he ties it with a long rope on a pasture or in a garden. So whatever its  rope allows it to eat, will be regarded as good rewardable deeds (for its owner). And if  it breaks off its rope and jumps over one or two hillocks, even its dung will be  considered amongst his good deeds. And if it passes by a river and drinks water from it,  that will be considered as good deeds for his benefit) even if he has had no intention of  watering it. A horse is a shelter for the one who keeps it so that he may earn his living  honestly and takes it as a refuge to keep him from following illegal ways (of gaining  money), and does not forget the rights of Allah (i.e. paying the Zakat and allowing others  to use it for Allah&#8217;s Sake). But a horse is a burden (and a source of committing sins for  him who keeps it out of pride and pretense and with the intention of harming the  Muslims.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet was asked about donkeys. He replied,  &#8220;Nothing has been revealed to be concerning them except this comprehensive Verse  (which covers everything) :&#8211;&#8216;Then whosoever has done good equal to the weight of an atom  (or a small ant), Shall see it (its reward) And whosoever has done evil equal to the  weight of an atom (or a small ) ant), Shall see it (Its punishment).&#8221; (99.7-8) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle reached Khaibar in the early morning and  the people of Khaibar came out with their spades, and when they saw the Prophet they said,  &#8220;Muhammad and his army!&#8221; and returned hurriedly to take refuge in the fort. The  Prophet raised his hands and said, &#8220;Allah is Greater! Khaibar is ruined ! If we  approach a nation, then miserable is the morning of those who are warned.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I hear many narrations  from you but I forget them.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Spread your covering sheet.&#8221; I  spread my sheet and he moved both his hands as if scooping something and emptied them in  the sheet and said, &#8220;Wrap it.&#8221; I wrapped it round my body, and since then I have  never forgotten a single Hadith. </font></p>

<h3 align="center">Companions of the Prophet</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="005.057.001"></a>Volume 5, Book 57, Number 1:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;A time will come upon the people, when a group of people will wage a holy war and it will be said, &#8216;Is there amongst you anyone who has accompanied Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; And so victory will be bestowed on them. Then a time will come upon the people when a group of people will wage a holy war, and it will be said, &#8220;Is there amongst you a none who has accompanied the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; And so victory will be bestowed on them. Then a time will come upon the people when a group of people will wage a holy war, and it will be said, &#8220;Is there amongst you anyone who has been in the company of the companions of the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; And victory will be bestowed on them.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 2:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Imran bin Husain:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;The best of my followers are those living in my generation (i.e. my contemporaries). and then those who will follow the latter&#8221; &#8216;Imran added, &#8220;I do not remember whether he mentioned two or three generations after his generation, then the Prophet added, &#8216;There will come after you, people who will bear witness without being asked to do so, and will be treacherous and untrustworthy, and they will vow and never fulfill their vows, and fatness will appear among them.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 3:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The best people are those living in my generation, and then those who will follow them, and then those who will follow the latter. Then there will come some people who will bear witness before taking oaths, and take oaths before bearing witness.&#8221; (Ibrahim, a sub-narrator said, &#8220;They used to beat us for witnesses and covenants when we were still children.&#8221;)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 4:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr bought a (camel) saddle from &#8216;Azib for thirteen Dirhams. Abu Bakr said to &#8216;Azib, &#8220;Tell Al-Bara&#8217; to carry the saddle for me.&#8221; &#8216;Azib said, &#8220;No, unless you relate to me what happened to you and Allah &#8216;s Apostle when you left Mecca while the pagans were in search of you.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;We left Mecca and we travel led continuously for that night and the following day till it was midday. I looked (around) searching for shade to take as shelter, and suddenly I came across a rock, and found a little shade there. So I cleaned the place and spread a bed for the Prophet in the shade and said to him, &#8216;Lie down, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8217; So the Prophet lay down and I went out, looking around to see if there was any person pursuing us. Suddenly I saw a shepherd driving his sheep towards the rock, seeking what we had already sought from it. I asked him, &#8216;To whom do you belong, O boy?&#8217; He said, &#8216;I belong to a man from Quraish.&#8217; He named the man and I recognized him. I asked him, &#8216;Is there any milk with your sheep?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Will you then milk (some) for us?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Then I asked him to tie the legs of one of the sheep and clean its udder, and then ordered him to clean his hands from dust. Then the shepherd cleaned his hands by striking his hands against one another. After doing so, he milked a small amount of milk. I used to keep for Allah&#8217;s Apostle a leather water-container, the mouth of which was covered with a piece of cloth. I poured water on the milk container till its lower part was cold. Then I took the milk to the Prophet whom I found awake. I said to him, &#8216;Drink, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8217; So he drank till I became pleased. Then I said, &#8216;It is time for us to move, O Allahs Apostle!&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; So we set out while the people (i.e. Quraish pagans) were searching for us, but none found us except Suraiqa bin Malik bin Jushum who was riding his horse. I said, &#8216;These are our pursuers who have found us. O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8217; He said, &#8216;Do not grieve, for Allah is with us.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 5:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to the Prophet while I was in the Cave. &#8220;If any of them should look under his feet, he would see us.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! What do you think of two (persons) the third of whom is Allah?&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 6:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle addressed the people saying, &#8220;Allah has given option to a slave to choose this world or what is with Him. The slave has chosen what is with Allah.&#8221; Abu Bakr wept, and we were astonished at his weeping caused by what the Prophet mentioned as to a Slave ( of Allah) who had been offered a choice, (we learned later on) that Allah&#8217;s Apostle himself was the person who was given the choice, and that Abu Bakr knew best of all of us. Allah&#8217;s Apostle added, &#8220;The person who has favored me most of all both with his company and wealth, is Abu Bakr. If I were to take a Khalil other than my Lord, I would have taken Abu Bakr as such, but (what relates us) is the Islamic brotherhood and friendliness. All the gates of the Mosque should be closed except the gate of Abu Bakr.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 7:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We used to compare the people as to who was better during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle . We used to regard Abu Bakr as the best, then &#8216;Umar, and then &#8216;Uthman .</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 8:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;If I were to take a Khalil, I would have taken Abu Bakr, but he is my brother and my companion (in Islam).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 9:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aiyub:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;If I were to take a Khalil, I would have taken him (i.e. Abu Bakr) as a Khalil, but the Islamic brotherhood is better.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 10:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Abi Mulaika:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of Kufa sent a letter to Ibn Az-Zubair, asking about (the inheritance of) (paternal) grandfather. He replied that the right of the inheritance of (paternal) grandfather is the same as that of father if the father is dead) and added, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216; If I were to take a Khalil from this nation, I would have taken him (i.e. Abu Bakr).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 11:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jubair bin Mutim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A woman came to the Prophet who ordered her to return to him again. She said, &#8220;What if I came and did not find you?&#8221; as if she wanted to say, &#8220;If I found you dead?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;If you should not find me, go to Abu Bakr.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 12:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ammar:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Ad-Darda:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While I was sitting with the Prophet, Abu Bakr came, lifting up one corner of h is garment uncovering h is knee. The Prophet said, &#8220;Your companion has had a quarrel.&#8221; Abu Bakr greeted (the Prophet ) and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! There was something (i.e. quarrel) between me and the Son of Al-Khattab. I talked to him harshly and then regretted that, and requested him to forgive me, but he refused. This is why I have come to you.&#8221; The Prophet said thrice, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! May Allah forgive you.&#8221; In the meanwhile, &#8216;Umar regretted (his refusal of Abu Bakr&#8217;s excuse) and went to Abu Bakr&#8217;s house and asked if Abu Bakr was there. They replied in the negative. So he came to the Prophet and greeted him, but signs of displeasure appeared on the face of the Prophet till Abu Bakr pitied (&#8216;Umar), so he knelt and said twice, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! By Allah! I was more unjust to him (than he to me).&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah sent me (as a Prophet) to you (people) but you said (to me), &#8216;You are telling a lie,&#8217; while Abu Bakr said, &#8216;He has said the truth,&#8217; and consoled me with himself and his money.&#8221; He then said twice, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you then give up harming my companion?&#8221; After that nobody harmed Abu Bakr.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;While a shepherd was amongst his sheep, a wolf attacked them and took away one sheep. When the shepherd chased the wolf, the wolf turned towards him and said, &#8216;Who will be its guard on the day of wild animals when nobody except I will be its shepherd. And while a man was driving a cow with a load on it, it turned towards him and spoke to him saying, &#8216;I have not been created for this purpose, but for ploughing.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;Glorified be Allah.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;But I believe in it and so does Abu Bakr end &#8216;Umar.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;While I was sleeping, I saw myself standing at a well, on it there was a bucket. I drew water from the well as much as Allah wished. Then Ibn Abi Quhafa (i.e. Abu Bakr) took the bucket from me and brought out one or two buckets (of water) and there was weakness in his drawing the water. May Allah forgive his weakness for him. Then the bucket turned into a very big one and Ibn Al-Khattab took it over and I had never seen such a mighty person amongst the people as him in performing such hard work, till the people drank to their satisfaction and watered their camels that knelt down there.&#8221;</p>

This is good.&#8217; He who is amongst those who pray will be called from the gate of the prayer (in Paradise) and he who is from the people of Jihad will be called from the gate of Jihad, and he who is from those&#8217; who give in charity (i.e. Zakat) will be called from the gate of charity, and he who is amongst those who observe fast will be called from the gate of fasting, the gate of Raiyan.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;He who is called from all those gates will need nothing,&#8221; He added, &#8220;Will anyone be called from all those gates, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, and I hope you will be among those, O Abu Bakr.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 19:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) Allah&#8217;s Apostle died while Abu Bakr was at a place called As-Sunah (Al-&#8216;Aliya) &#8216;Umar stood up and said, &#8220;By Allah! Allah&#8217;s Apostle is not dead!&#8221; &#8216;Umar (later on) said, &#8220;By Allah! Nothing occurred to my mind except that.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Verily! Allah will resurrect him and he will cut the hands and legs of some men.&#8221; Then Abu Bakr came and uncovered the face of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, kissed him and said, &#8220;Let my mother and father be sacrificed for you, (O Allah&#8217;s Apostle), you are good in life and in death. By Allah in Whose Hands my life is, Allah will never make you taste death twice.&#8221; Then he went out and said, &#8220;O oath-taker! Don&#8217;t be hasty.&#8221; When Abu Bakr spoke, &#8216;Umar sat down. Abu Bakr praised and glorified Allah and said, No doubt! Whoever worshipped Muhammad, then Muhammad is dead, but whoever worshipped Allah, then Allah is Alive and shall never die.&#8221; Then he recited Allah&#8217;s Statement.:&#8211; &#8220;(O Muhammad) Verily you will die, and they also will die.&#8221; (39.30) He also recited:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Muhammad is no more than an Apostle; and indeed many Apostles have passed away, before him, If he dies Or is killed, will you then Turn back on your heels? And he who turns back On his heels, not the least Harm will he do to Allah And Allah will give reward to those Who are grateful.&#8221; (3.144)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people wept loudly, and the Ansar were assembled with Sad bin &#8216;Ubada in the shed of Bani Saida. They said (to the emigrants). &#8220;There should be one &#8216;Amir from us and one from you.&#8221; Then Abu Bakr, Umar bin Al-Khattab and Abu &#8216;baida bin Al-Jarrah went to them. &#8216;Umar wanted to speak but Abu Bakr stopped him. &#8216;Umar later on used to say, &#8220;By Allah, I intended only to say something that appealed to me and I was afraid that Abu Bakr would not speak so well. Then Abu Bakr spoke and his speech was very eloquent. He said in his statement, &#8220;We are the rulers and you (Ansars) are the ministers (i.e. advisers),&#8221; Hubab bin Al-Mundhir said, &#8220;No, by Allah we won&#8217;t accept this. But there must be a ruler from us and a ruler from you.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;No, we will be the rulers and you will be the ministers, for they (i.e. Quarish) are the best family amongst the &#8216;Arabs and of best origin. So you should elect either &#8216;Umar or Abu &#8216;Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah as your ruler.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said (to Abu Bakr), &#8220;No but we elect you, for you are our chief and the best amongst us and the most beloved of all of us to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; So &#8216;Umar took Abu Bakr&#8217;s hand and gave the pledge of allegiance and the people too gave the pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr. Someone said, &#8220;You have killed Sad bin Ubada.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Allah has killed him.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said (in another narration), (&#8220;When the Prophet was on his death-bed) he looked up and said thrice, (Amongst) the Highest Companion (See Qur&#8217;an 4.69)&#8217; Aisha said, Allah benefited the people by their two speeches. &#8216;Umar frightened the people some of whom were hypocrites whom Allah caused to abandon Islam because of &#8216;Umar&#8217;s speech. Then Abu Bakr led the people to True Guidance and acquainted them with the right path they were to follow so that they went out reciting:&#8211; &#8220;Muhammad is no more than an Apostle and indeed many Apostles have passed away before him..&#8221; (3.144)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">We went out with Allah&#8217;s Apostle on one of his journeys till we reached Al-Baida or Dhatul-Jaish where my necklace got broken (and lost). Allah&#8217;s Apostle stopped to search for it and the people too stopped with him. There was no water at that place and they had no water with them. So they went to Abu Bakr and said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see what &#8216;Aisha has done? She has made Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the people stop where there is no water and they have no water with them. Abu Bakr came while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was sleeping with his head on my thigh and said, &#8220;You detained Allah Apostle and the people where there is no water and they have no water.&#8221; He then admonished me and said what Allah wished and pinched me at my flanks with his hands, but I did not move because the head of Allah&#8217;s Apostle was on my thigh .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle kept on sleeping till be got up in the morning and found no water. Then Allah revealed the Divine Verse of Tayammum, and the people performed Tayammum. Usaid bin AlHudair said. &#8220;O family of Abu Bakr! This is not the first blessings of yours.&#8221; We urged the camel on which I was sitting to get up from its place and the necklace was found under it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ashari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I performed ablution in my house and then went out and said, &#8220;Today I shall stick to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and stay with him all this day of mine (in his service).&#8221; I went to the Mosque and asked about the Prophet . They said, &#8220;He had gone in this direction.&#8221; So I followed his way, asking about him till he entered a place called Bir Aris. I sat at its gate that was made of date-palm leaves till the Prophet finished answering the call of nature and performed ablution. Then I went up to him to see him sitting at the well of Aris at the middle of its edge with his legs uncovered, hanging in the well. I greeted him and went back and sat at the gate. I said, &#8220;Today I will be the gatekeeper of the Prophet.&#8221; Abu Bakr came and pushed the gate. I asked, &#8220;Who is it?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Abu Bakr.&#8221; I told him to wait, went in and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Abu Bakr asks for permission to enter.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Admit him and give him the glad tidings that he will be in Paradise.&#8221; So I went out and said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;Come in, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle gives you the glad tidings that you will be in Paradise&#8221; Abu Bakr entered and sat on the right side of Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the built edge of the well and hung his legs n the well as the Prophet did and uncovered his legs. I then returned and sat (at the gate). I had left my brother performing ablution and he intended to follow me. So I said (to myself). &#8220;If Allah wants good for so-and-so (i.e. my brother) He will bring him here.&#8221; Suddenly somebody moved the door. I asked, &#8220;Who is it?&#8221; He said, &#8220;&#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab.&#8221; I asked him to wait, went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, greeted him and said, &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks the permission to enter.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Admit him, and give him the glad tidings that he will be in Paradise.&#8221; I went to &#8220;Umar and said &#8220;Come in, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle, gives you the glad tidings that you will be in Paradise.&#8221; So he entered and sat beside Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the built edge of the well on the left side and hung his legs in the well. I returned and sat (at the gate) and said, (to myself), &#8220;If Allah wants good for so-and-so, He will bring him here.&#8221; Somebody came and moved the door. I asked &#8220;Who is it?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Uthman bin Affan.&#8221; I asked him to wait and went to the Prophet and informed him. He said, &#8220;Admit him, and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise, I asked him to wait and went to the Prophet and informed him. He said, &#8220;Admit him, and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise after a calamity that will befall him.&#8221; So I went up to him and said to him, &#8220;Come in; Allah&#8217;s Apostle gives you the glad tidings of entering Paradise after a calamity that will befall you. &#8220;Uthman then came in and found that the built edge of the well was occupied, so he sat opposite to the Prophet on the other side. Said bin Al-Musaiyab said, &#8220;I interpret this (narration) in terms of their graves.&#8221;</p>

I always hoped that Allah will keep you with your two companions, for I often heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;I, Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar were (somewhere).

Abu Bakr came and pulled &#8216;Uqba away from the Prophet and said, &#8220;Do you intend to kill a man just because he says: &#8216;My Lord is Allah, and he has brought forth to you the Evident Signs from your Lord?&#8221;</p>

The shepherd chased it and got that sheep freed from the wolf. The wolf turned towards the shepherd and said, &#8216;Who will guard the sheep on the day of wild animals when it will have no shepherd except myself?&#8221; The people said, &#8220;Glorified be Allah.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;But I believe in it and so do Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar although Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar were not present there (at the place of the event).</p>

They were wearing shirts, some of which were merely covering their (chests). and some were a bit longer. &#8216;Umar was presented before me and his shirt was so long that he was dragging it.&#8221; They asked, &#8220;How have you interpreted it, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Religion.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">When &#8216;Umar was stabbed, he showed signs of agony. Ibn &#8216;Abbas, as if intending to encourage &#8216;Umar, said to him, &#8220;O Chief of the believers! Never mind what has happened to you, for you have been in the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and you kept good relations with him and you parted with him while he was pleased with you. Then you were in the company of Abu Bakr and kept good relations with him and you parted with him (i.e. he died) while he was pleased with you. Then you were in the company of the Muslims, and you kept good relations with them, and if you leave them, you will leave them while they are pleased with you.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, (to Ibn &#8220;Abbas), &#8220;As for what you have said about the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his being pleased with me, it is a favor, Allah did to me; and as for what you have said about the company of Abu Bakr and his being pleased with me, it is a favor Allah did to me; and concerning my impatience which you see, is because of you and your companions. By Allah! If (at all) I had gold equal to the earth, I would have ransomed myself with it from the Punishment of Allah before I meet Him.&#8221;</p>

The Prophet said to me, &#8220;Open the gate for him and give him the glad tidings that he will enter Paradise.&#8221; I opened (the gate) for him, and behold! It was Abu Bakr. I informed him of the glad tidings the Prophet had said, and he praised Allah. Then another man came and asked me to open the gate. The Prophet said to me &#8220;Open (the gate) and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise.&#8221; I opened (the gate) for him, and behold! It was &#8216;Umar. I informed him of what the Prophet had said, and he praised Allah. Then another man came and asked me to open the gate. The Prophet said to me. &#8220;Open (the gate) for him and inform him of the glad tidings, of entering Paradise with a calamity which will befall him. &#8221; Behold ! It was &#8216;Uthman, I informed him of what Allah&#8217;s Apostle had said. He praised Allah and said, &#8220;I seek Allah&#8217;s Aid.&#8221;</p>

It was &#8216;Uthman bin &#8216;Affan. &#8216;Asim, in another narration, said that the Prophet was sitting in a place where there was water, and he was uncovering both his knees or his knee, and when &#8216;Uthman entered, he covered them (or it).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ubaid-ullah bin &#8216;Adi bin Al-Khiyar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Miswar bin Makhrama and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Aswad bin &#8216;Abu Yaghuth said (to me), &#8220;What forbids you to talk to &#8216;Uthman about his brother Al-Walid because people have talked much about him?&#8221; So I went to &#8216;Uthman and when he went out for prayer I said (to him), &#8220;I have something to say to you and it is a piece of advice for you &#8221; &#8216;Uthman said, &#8220;O man, from you.&#8221; (Umar said: I see that he said, &#8220;I seek Refuge with Allah from you.&#8221;) So I left him and went to them. Then the messenger of Uthman came and I went to him (i.e. &#8216;Uthman), &#8216;Uthman asked, &#8220;What is your advice?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Allah sent Muhammad with the Truth, and revealed the Divine Book (i.e. Quran) to him; and you were amongst those who followed Allah and His Apostle, and you participated in the two migrations (to Ethiopia and to Medina) and enjoyed the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and saw his way. No doubt, the people are talking much about Al-Walid.&#8221; &#8216;Uthman said, &#8220;Did you receive your knowledge directly from Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; I said, &#8220;No, but his knowledge did reach me and it reached (even) to a virgin in her seclusion.&#8221; &#8216;Uthman said, &#8220;And then Allah sent Muhammad with the Truth and I was amongst those who followed Allah and His Apostle and I believed in what ever he (i.e. the Prophet) was sent with, and participated in two migrations, as you have said, and I enjoyed the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and gave the pledge of allegiance him. By Allah! I never disobeyed him, nor did I cheat him till Allah took him unto Him. Then I treated Abu Bakr and then &#8216;Umar similarly and then I was made Caliph. So, don&#8217;t I have rights similar to theirs?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Then what are these talks reaching me from you people? Now, concerning what you mentioned about the question of Al-Walid, Allah willing, I shall deal with him according to what is right.&#8221; Then he called &#8216;Ali and ordered him to flog him, and &#8216;Ali flogged him (i.e. Al-Walid) eighty lashes.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">During the lifetime of the Prophet we considered Abu Bakr as peerless and then &#8216;Umar and then &#8216;Uthman (coming next to him in superiority) and then we used not to differentiate between the companions of the Prophet</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Uthman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the son of Muhib) An Egyptian who came and performed the Hajj to the Kaba saw some people sitting. He enquire, &#8220;Who are these people?&#8221; Somebody said, &#8220;They are the tribe of Quraish.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Who is the old man sitting amongst them?&#8221; The people replied, &#8220;He is &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Ibn Umar! I want to ask you about something; please tell me about it. Do you know that &#8216;Uthman fled away on the day (of the battle) of Uhud?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The (Egyptian) man said, &#8220;Do you know that &#8216;Uthman was absent on the day (of the battle) of Badr and did not join it?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;Do you know that he failed to attend the Ar Ridwan pledge and did not witness it (i.e. Hudaibiya pledge of allegiance)?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;Allahu Akbar!&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Let me explain to you (all these three things). As for his flight on the day of Uhud, I testify that Allah has excused him and forgiven him; and as for his absence from the battle of Badr, it was due to the fact that the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle was his wife and she was sick then. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to him, &#8220;You will receive the same reward and share (of the booty) as anyone of those who participated in the battle of Badr (if you stay with her).&#8217; As for his absence from the Ar-Ridwan pledge of allegiance, had there been any person in Mecca more respectable than &#8216;Uthman (to be sent as a representative). Allah&#8217;s Apostle would have sent him instead of him. No doubt, Allah&#8217;s Apostle had sent him, and the incident of the Ar-Ridwan pledge of Allegiance happened after &#8216;Uthman had gone to Mecca. Allah&#8217;s Apostle held out his right hand saying, &#8216;This is &#8216;Uthman&#8217;s hand.&#8217; He stroke his (other) hand with it saying, &#8216;This (pledge of allegiance) is on the behalf of &#8216;Uthman.&#8217; Then Ibn &#8216;Umar said to the man, &#8216;Bear (these) excuses in mind with you.&#8217;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet ascended the mountain of Uhud and Abu Bakr, &#8216;Umar and &#8216;Uthman were accompanying him. The mountain gave a shake (i.e. trembled underneath them) . The Prophet said, &#8220;O Uhud ! Be calm.&#8221; I think that the Prophet hit it with his foot, adding, &#8220;For upon you there are none but a Prophet, a Siddiq and two martyrs.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 50:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amr bin Maimun:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I saw &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab a few days before he was stabbed in Medina. He was standing with Hudhaifa bin Al-Yaman and &#8216;Uthman bin Hunaif to whom he said, &#8220;What have you done? Do you think that you have imposed more taxation on the land (of As-Swad i.e. &#8216;Iraq) than it can bear?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;We have imposed on it what it can bear because of its great yield.&#8221; &#8216;Umar again said, &#8220;Check whether you have imposed on the land what it can not bear.&#8221; They said, &#8220;No, (we haven&#8217;t).&#8221; &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;If Allah should keep me alive I will let the widows of Iraq need no men to support them after me.&#8221; But only four days had elapsed when he was stabbed (to death ). The day he was stabbed, I was standing and there was nobody between me and him (i.e. Umar) except Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas. Whenever Umar passed between the two rows, he would say, &#8220;Stand in straight lines.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he saw no defect (in the rows), he would go forward and start the prayer with Takbir. He would recite Surat Yusuf or An-Nahl or the like in the first Rak&#8217;a so that the people may have the time to Join the prayer. As soon as he said Takbir, I heard him saying, &#8220;The dog has killed or eaten me,&#8221; at the time he (i.e. the murderer) stabbed him. A non-Arab infidel proceeded on carrying a double-edged knife and stabbing all the persons he passed by on the right and left (till) he stabbed thirteen persons out of whom seven died. When one of the Muslims saw that, he threw a cloak on him. Realizing that he had been captured, the non-Arab infidel killed himself, &#8216;Umar held the hand of &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Auf and let him lead the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who were standing by the side of &#8216;Umar saw what I saw, but the people who were in the other parts of the Mosque did not see anything, but they lost the voice of &#8216;Umar and they were saying, &#8220;Subhan Allah! Subhan Allah! (i.e. Glorified be Allah).&#8221; Abdur-Rahman bin Auf led the people a short prayer. When they finished the prayer, &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Ibn &#8216;Abbas! Find out who attacked me.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas kept on looking here and there for a short time and came to say. &#8220;The slave of Al Mughira.&#8221; On that &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;The craftsman?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;May Allah curse him. I did not treat him unjustly. All the Praises are for Allah Who has not caused me to die at the hand of a man who claims himself to be a Muslim. No doubt, you and your father (Abbas) used to love to have more non-Arab infidels in Medina.&#8221; Al-Abbas had the greatest number of slaves. Ibn &#8216;Abbas said to &#8216;Umar. &#8220;If you wish, we will do.&#8221; He meant, &#8220;If you wish we will kill them.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;You are mistaken (for you can&#8217;t kill them) after they have spoken your language, prayed towards your Qibla, and performed Hajj like yours.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Umar was carried to his house, and we went along with him, and the people were as if they had never suffered a calamity before. Some said, &#8220;Do not worry (he will be Alright soon).&#8221; Some said, &#8220;We are afraid (that he will die).&#8221; Then an infusion of dates was brought to him and he drank it but it came out (of the wound) of his belly. Then milk was brought to him and he drank it, and it also came out of his belly. The people realized that he would die. We went to him, and the people came, praising him. A young man came saying, &#8220;O chief of the believers! Receive the glad tidings from Allah to you due to your company with Allah&#8217;s Apostle and your superiority in Islam which you know. Then you became the ruler (i.e. Caliph) and you ruled with justice and finally you have been martyred.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I wish that all these privileges will counterbalance (my shortcomings) so that I will neither lose nor gain anything.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the young man turned back to leave, his clothes seemed to be touching the ground. &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Call the young man back to me.&#8221; (When he came back) &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O son of my brother! Lift your clothes, for this will keep your clothes clean and save you from the Punishment of your Lord.&#8221; &#8216;Umar further said, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar! See how much I am in debt to others.&#8221; When the debt was checked, it amounted to approximately eighty-six thousand. &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;If the property of &#8216;Umar&#8217;s family covers the debt, then pay the debt thereof; otherwise request it from Bani &#8216;Adi bin Ka&#8217;b, and if that too is not sufficient, ask for it from Quraish tribe, and do not ask for it from any one else, and pay this debt on my behalf.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umar then said (to &#8216;Abdullah), &#8220;Go to &#8216;Aisha (the mother of the believers) and say: &#8220;Umar is paying his salutation to you. But don&#8217;t say: &#8216;The chief of the believers,&#8217; because today I am not the chief of the believers. And say: &#8220;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks the permission to be buried with his two companions (i.e. the Prophet, and Abu Bakr).&#8221; Abdullah greeted &#8216;Aisha and asked for the permission for entering, and then entered to her and found her sitting and weeping. He said to her, &#8220;&#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab is paying his salutations to you, and asks the permission to be buried with his two companions.&#8221; She said, &#8220;I had the idea of having this place for myself, but today I prefer Umar to myself.&#8221; When he returned it was said (to &#8216;Umar), &#8220;&#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar has come.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Make me sit up.&#8221; Somebody supported him against his body and &#8216;Umar asked (&#8216;Abdullah), &#8220;What news do you have?&#8221; He said, &#8220;O chief of the believers! It is as you wish. She has given the permission.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Praise be to Allah, there was nothing more important to me than this. So when I die, take me, and greet &#8216;Aisha and say: &#8220;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks the permission (to be buried with the Prophet ), and if she gives the permission, bury me there, and if she refuses, then take me to the grave-yard of the Muslims.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Hafsa (the mother of the believers) came with many other women walking with her. When we saw her, we went away. She went in (to &#8216;Umar) and wept there for sometime. When the men asked for permission to enter, she went into another place, and we heard her weeping inside. The people said (to &#8216;Umar), &#8220;O chief of the believers! Appoint a successor.&#8221; Umar said, &#8220;I do not find anyone more suitable for the job than the following persons or group whom Allah&#8217;s Apostle had been pleased with before he died.&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar mentioned &#8216;Ali, &#8216;Uthman, AzZubair, Talha, Sad and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman (bin Auf) and said, &#8220;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar will be a witness to you, but he will have no share in the rule. His being a witness will compensate him for not sharing the right of ruling. If Sad becomes the ruler, it will be alright: otherwise, whoever becomes the ruler should seek his help, as I have not dismissed him because of disability or dishonesty.&#8221; &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;I recommend that my successor takes care of the early emigrants; to know their rights and protect their honor and sacred things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also recommend that he be kind to the Ansar who had lived in Medina before the emigrants and Belief had entered their hearts before them. I recommend that the (ruler) should accept the good of the righteous among them and excuse their wrong-doers, and I recommend that he should do good to all the people of the towns (Al-Ansar), as they are the protectors of Islam and the source of wealth and the source of annoyance to the enemy. I also recommend that nothing be taken from them except from their surplus with their consent. I also recommend that he do good to the &#8216;Arab bedouin, as they are the origin of the &#8216;Arabs and the material of Islam. He should take from what is inferior, amongst their properties and distribute that to the poor amongst them. I also recommend him concerning Allah&#8217;s and His Apostle&#8217;s protectees (i.e. Dhimmis) to fulfill their contracts and to fight for them and not to overburden them with what is beyond their ability.&#8221; So when &#8216;Umar expired, we carried him out and set out walking. &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar greeted (&#8216;Aisha) and said, &#8220;&#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks for the permission.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;Bring him in.&#8221; He was brought in and buried beside his two companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he was buried, the group (recommended by &#8216;Umar) held a meeting. Then &#8216;Abdur-Rahman said, &#8221; Reduce the candidates for rulership to three of you.&#8221; Az-Zubair said, &#8220;I give up my right to Ali.&#8221; Talha said, &#8220;I give up my right to &#8216;Uthman,&#8221; Sad, &#8216;I give up my right to &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf.&#8221; &#8216;Abdur-Rahman then said (to &#8216;Uthman and &#8216;Ali), &#8220;Now which of you is willing to give up his right of candidacy to that he may choose the better of the (remaining) two, bearing in mind that Allah and Islam will be his witnesses.&#8221; So both the sheiks (i.e. &#8216;Uthman and &#8216;Ali) kept silent. &#8216;Abdur-Rahman said, &#8220;Will you both leave this matter to me, and I take Allah as my Witness that I will not choose but the better of you?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; So &#8216;Abdur-Rahman took the hand of one of them (i.e. &#8216;Ali) and said, &#8220;You are related to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and one of the earliest Muslims as you know well. So I ask you by Allah to promise that if I select you as a ruler you will do justice, and if I select &#8216;Uthman as a ruler you will listen to him and obey him.&#8221; Then he took the other (i.e. &#8216;Uthman) aside and said the same to him. When &#8216;Abdur-Rahman secured (their agreement to) this covenant, he said, &#8220;O &#8216;Uthman! Raise your hand.&#8221; So he (i.e. &#8216;Abdur-Rahman) gave him (i.e. &#8216;Uthman) the solemn pledge, and then &#8216;Ali gave him the pledge of allegiance and then all the (Medina) people gave him the pledge of allegiance.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 51:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sahl bin Sad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Tomorrow I will give the flag to a man with whose leadership Allah will grant (the Muslim) victory.&#8221; So the people kept on thinking the whole night as to who would be given the flag. The next morning the people went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and every one of them hoped that he would be given the flag. The Prophet said, &#8220;Where is Ali bin Abi Talib?&#8221; The people replied, &#8220;He is suffering from eye trouble, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Send for him and bring him to me.&#8221; So when &#8216;Ali came, the Prophet spat in his eyes and invoked good on him, and he became alright as if he had no ailment. The Prophet then gave him the flag. &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall I fight them (i.e. enemy) till they become like us?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Proceed to them steadily till you approach near to them and then invite them to Islam and inform them of their duties towards Allah which Islam prescribes for them, for by Allah, if one man is guided on the right path (i.e. converted to Islam) through you, it would be better for you than (a great number of) red camels.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ali happened to stay behind the Prophet and (did not join him) during the battle of Khaibar for he was having eye trouble. Then he said, &#8220;How could I remain behind Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; So &#8216;Ali set out following the Prophet , When it was the eve of the day in the morning of which Allah helped (the Muslims) to conquer it, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;I will give the flag (to a man), or tomorrow a man whom Allah and His Apostle love will take the flag,&#8221; or said, &#8220;A man who loves Allah and His Apostle; and Allah will grant victory under his leadership.&#8221; Suddenly came &#8216;Ali whom we did not expect. The people said, &#8220;This is &#8216;Ali.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave him the flag and Allah granted victory under his leadership.</p>

How (was this name given to &#8216;Ali)?&#8221; Sahl said, &#8220;&#8216;Ali went to Fatima and then came out and slept in the Mosque. The Prophet asked Fatima, &#8220;Where is your cousin?&#8221; She said, &#8220;In the Mosque.&#8221; The Prophet went to him and found that his (i.e. Ali&#8217;s) covering sheet had slipped of his back and dust had soiled his back.

I ate no leavened bread and dressed no decorated striped clothes, and never did a man or a woman serve me, and I often used to press my belly against gravel because of hunger, and I used to ask a man to recite a Quranic Verse to me although I knew it, so that he would take me to his home and feed me. And the most generous of all the people to the poor was Ja&#8217;far bin Abi Talib. He used to take us to his home and offer us what was available therein. He would even offer us an empty folded leather container (of butter) which we would split and lick whatever was in it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatima sent somebody to Abu Bakr asking him to give her her inheritance from the Prophet from what Allah had given to His Apostle through Fai (i.e. booty gained without fighting). She asked for the Sadaqa (i.e. wealth assigned for charitable purposes) of the Prophet at Medina, and Fadak, and what remained of the Khumus (i.e., one-fifth) of the Khaibar booty. Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;We (Prophets), our property is not inherited, and whatever we leave is Sadaqa, but Muhammad&#8217;s Family can eat from this property, i.e. Allah&#8217;s property, but they have no right to take more than the food they need.&#8217; By Allah! I will not bring any change in dealing with the Sadaqa of the Prophet (and will keep them) as they used to be observed in his (i.e. the Prophet&#8217;s) life-time, and I will dispose with it as Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to do,&#8221; Then &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and that Muhammad is His Apostle,&#8221; and added, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! We acknowledge your superiority.&#8221; Then he (i.e. &#8216;Ali) mentioned their own relationship to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and their right. Abu Bakr then spoke saying, &#8220;By Allah in Whose Hands my life is. I love to do good to the relatives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle rather than to my own relatives&#8221; Abu Bark added: Look at Muhammad through his family (i.e. if you are no good to his family you are not good to him).</p>

Fatima heard of this and went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Your people think that you do not become angry for the sake of your daughters as &#8216;Ali is now going to marry the daughter of Abu Jahl. &#8220;On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up and after his recitation of Tashah-hud. I heard him saying, &#8220;Then after! I married one of my daughters to Abu Al-&#8216;As bin Al-Rabi&#8217; (the husband of Zainab, the daughter of the Prophet ) before Islam and he proved truthful in whatever he said to me. No doubt, Fatima is a part of me, I hate to see her being troubled.

The Prophet said, &#8216;If a reputable man amongst the children of Bani Israel committed a theft, they used to forgive him, but if a poor man committed a theft, they would cut his hand.

By Allah, the people choose to send presents on the day of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s turn and we too, love the good (i.e. presents etc.) as &#8216;Aisha does. You should tell Allah&#8217;s Apostle to tell the people to send their presents to him wherever he may be, or wherever his turn may be.&#8221; Um Salama said that to the Prophet and he turned away from her, and when the Prophet returned to her (i.e. Um Salama), she repeated the same, and the Prophet again turned away, and when she told him the same for the third time, the Prophet said, &#8220;O Um Salama! Don&#8217;t trouble me by harming &#8216;Aisha, for by Allah, the Divine Inspiration never came to me while I was under the blanket of any woman amongst you except her.&#8221;</p>
