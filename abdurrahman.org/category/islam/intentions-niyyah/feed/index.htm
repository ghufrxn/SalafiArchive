<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The First Hadeeth</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After this introduction, the first hadeeth concerns the intention. This is the hadeeth of ‘Umar ibn al Khataab (<em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu</em>), the leader of the believers and the second khalifah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ameerul-Mu’mineen, Abi Hafs (may Allaah be pleased with him) said that: “The Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(The value of)<strong> an action depends on the intention behind it. A man will be rewarded only for what he intended. The emigration of one who emigrates for the sake of Allaah and His Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) is for the sake of Allaah and His Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>) ; and the emigration of one who emigrates for gaining a worldly advantage or for marrying a woman is for what he has emigrated.”</strong></span> [Sahih Muslim, Book 020, Number 4692]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Narrator</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Umar ibn al Khataab (<em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu</em>), the second khalifah, was from the notables of Quraysh. He accepted Islaam in the fifth or sixth year after the advent of Prophet Muhammad’s (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam</em>) message, and in his acceptance of Islaam there was a might for the Muslims. He attended all the battlefields and took the line after Abu Bakr’s (<em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu</em>) covenant to him and he established the Khilafah in the best way after Abu Bakr. In the 23rd year (after Hijrah), four nights before the end of the month of Dhul Hijjah, he was stabbed by a magian after he made the <em>takbeer</em> for Salaatul-Fajr. He was carried to his home and he died three nights later. He was buried with the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam</em>), and Abu Bakr in the apartment of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her). And his Khilafah lasted ten years six months and a few days. May Allaah be pleased with him and with all the companions.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Subject and Overall Explanation</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The subject of the hadeeth is making clear the rank of the intention vis-a-vis the actions. This is a great and comprehensive hadeeth, making clear that the intention is comprehensive, covering all actions such that there is no action without intention. And therefore, the actions correctness or corruption, the reward upon it or the punishment, is dependent upon the intention. And each person shall have but that which he intended, whether it is a noble objective or a lowly, despicable one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam</em>), made that clear in order to incite the doer to aim high in his intention seeking Allaah’s Face and the Final Abode and to keep away from the lowly intentions and base ranks. So if the intention is correct, intending the Face of Allaah (<em>subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa</em>), then it is acceptable and if otherwise then it will not be (acceptable) because Allaah (<em>subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa</em>) is Most Sufficient and in no need of partners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam</em>) gave a similitude in migration so that it may be reference for the rest of actions. So those who migrate have different intentions and thus the reward will vary to a great extent, even though the action is one (and that is the migration). So whoever migrates to Allaah and His Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam</em>), seeking the reward of Allaah and the victory for the Deen and giving help to the Deen then he is the sincere <em>Muhaajir</em> (immigrant), who attained in his intention the highest and most noble objectives. And whoever migrates seeking this lowly life and its vanishing enjoyments is the one who went base in his intention and therefore of the Hereafter he shall have no share. The one who migrates from the land of shirk seeking the reward of Allaah and the protection of His Deen and the support of the Deen and seeking to learn the Shari’ah, so his <em>hijrah</em> (migration) is <em>fee sabeelillaah</em> and Allaah will keep him steadfast on that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the intention distinguishes the worship from the habit. Take for example <em>al-ghusl</em> (taking a bath): If it is done intending to lift the <em>janabah</em> (the sexual defilement) then it is ‘<em>Ibaadah</em> (worship). And if it is done for cleansing or to cool off then it is <em>&#8216;aadah</em> (a habit).</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>From the Benefits of this Hadeeth</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Emphasizing the importance of the <em>Niyyah</em> (intention) concerning the actions. And that the correctness of deeds and the recompense is in accordance with the intention.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Inciting to have sincerity in the intention and making clear the merit of that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Warning from seeking and intending this lowly life in our actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Showing that people differ concerning their intentions and that each will have that which is in accordance with his own intention. (A man will be rewarded only for what he intended.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. <em>At-Taharatu minal `amal</em> (purification is from actions), and therefore it cannot be established without a <em>Niyyah</em> (intention). Everyone who performs the purification, then his purification is in accordance with his intention (and this is the point of evidence in this hadeeth which fell under the chapter of purification).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. The excellence in teaching by the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam</em>), and his perfect eloquence and clarification where he mentions the foundations and the principles foundations then he explains them by examples.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth is evidence for the intentions place is the heart and utterance of it is an innovation. Also, it is a must to be careful concerning <em>ar-Riyaa</em> (showoff and seeking fame for the sake of this life). And that the <em>hijrah</em> (the migration) from the land of shirk to the land of Islam is from the most meritorious of deeds if the Face of Allaah is intended in that. This is in summary the points relevant to this matter.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">The Questions for this Hadeeth</span></strong></h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THE THIRD FOUNDATION:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sincerity in seeking knowledge is a condition that is continuous and not just preliminary:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What this means is that the student of knowledge should continually strive to implement sincerity in himself, and that he should not refrain from his studies due to the claim that he did not achieve sincerity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some scholars have provided the following definition for sincerity (ikhlaas): Ibn Jamaa’ah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“It means that one has a good intention when seeking knowledge, by intending through his studies to please Allaah, to act in accordance with what he learns, to revive the Sharee’ah (Islamic legislation), to illuminate his heart, to elucidate its (i.e. knowledge’s) hidden meanings; to get near to Allaah on the Day of Judgement, and to subject oneself to what Allaah has prepared for those who possess it, such as His Contentment and great virtue.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyaan Ath-Thawree, may Allaah have mercy on him, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“I did not try to rectify anything that was more difficult upon me than my intention.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should not intend, by his search for knowledge, to fulfil some worldly goal such as assuming leadership, gaining status and wealth, competing with colleagues, having people extol him, taking the front seat in a gathering, and so on, since he will be exchanging that which is better for that which is lower.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Yoosuf, may Allaah have mercy on him, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Intend Allaah through your (search for) knowledge, for indeed I never sat in a gathering of people in which I made it my intention to humble myself except that I didn’t leave from it until I had surpassed them. And I never sat in a gathering of people in which I made it my intention to surpass them, except that I didn’t leave from it until I was disgraced.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Knowledge is one of the many acts of worship and one of the many ways of gaining nearness to Allaah. So if one purifies his intention while seeking it, his deed will be accepted and purified. And its blessing will become complete. However, if he intends other than the sake of Allaah when seeking knowledge, his deed becomes nullified and wasted and his transaction is lost. Perhaps he may even miss out on these (worldly) objectives and never achieve any of them. So in this case, he will have failed in his objective and at the same time wasted his efforts.” [11]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* This principle entails several matters, the most important of which is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Devil enters into the hearts of some people desiring to turn them away from knowledge based on the argument that one should leave off seeking knowledge until he first purifies his intention. This is a plot, scheme and deception of the Devil. Rather, it is upon a Muslim to continue and persevere in his search for knowledge, and to constantly re-evaluate his intention, as Sufyaan Ath-Thawree said: “I did not try to rectify anything that was more difficult upon me than my intention.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is Sufyaan we are talking about, so it applies even more so for those other than him!! Therefore, one should not make this into something that diverts him away from seeking knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Hishaam Ad-Dustawaa’ee, may Allaah have mercy on him, said;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“By Allaah, I cannot (honestly) say that I ever went out one day to seek hadeeth for the sake of Allaah”, Adh- Dhahabee, may Allaah have mercy on him, commented on this saying: “By Allaah, me either!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Salaf would seek knowledge for the sake of Allaah, and so they became dignified and went on to become Imaams that were followed and looked up to by the people. And there were other people from among them who did not seek knowledge for the sake of Allaah at first, but yet they still attained the knowledge, then they woke up and examined themselves. And so the knowledge led them to have sincerity while on their path (of seeking knowledge). This becomes clearer in what was stated by Mujaahid and others: “We sought this knowledge while not having a big intention concerning it. Then Allaah granted us the intention (for it) afterward.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Others would say: “We sought this knowledge for other than the sake of Allaah. But the knowledge refused that it should be sought except for the sake of Allaah.” So this is also good.Then, afterwards, they went on to spread the knowledge with righteous intentions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there were other people that sought knowledge with corrupt intentions – for the sake of the worldly life and so that they could be praised by the people. So they got what they intended.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (Sall Allaahu alaihi wa Sallam) said: “<span style="color:#008000;">Whoever fights in battle with the intention of (getting) war booty, he will have what he intends.</span>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You will find this type of people not being illuminated by the light of knowledge. The knowledge has no impact on their souls nor does it produce a noticeable result in their actions. Rather, the one with knowledge is only he who fears Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there were other people that attained knowledge and achieved positions due to it, but they oppressed people and abandoned the requisites of knowledge, thus embarking on committing major sins and lewd acts!! So woe be to them – these people are not scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some other people do not fear Allaah with regard to their knowledge, but rather engage in schemes, issuing verdicts permitting prohibited matters and reporting unauthentic and irregular narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Other people show audacity before Allaah and fabricate ahaadeeth, so Allaah exposed them and their knowledge left them. So their preparation became only for the Hellfire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of these types of people took in a large portion of knowledge, and they excelled in it, in the general sense. Then they were succeeded by later generations that had deficiency in knowledge and action. Then there followed a people after that who ascribed themselves to knowledge outwardly but were not well-versed in it, with the exception of a few among them who thought that because of that they had become noble scholars. However, it did not cross their minds that they were gaining nearness to Allaah through it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason for this is because they did not experience any teacher that was taken as a role model with regard to knowledge. So they became like savage barbarians. The biggest aim of one of their teachers was to obtain and amass costly books which they could look into on any given day. So they would misinterpret what was stated therein and not agree with it. We ask Allaah for salvation and pardon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of them have stated: “I am not a scholar, nor have I seen a scholar.” [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This third foundation is from amongst the important principles – and it is that a student strives to make his intention purely for the sake of Allaah when seeking knowledge. Achieving sincerity is something necessary. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَمَا أُمِرُوا إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ الدِّينَ<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">“And they were commanded not except to worship Allaah sincerely, making the worship purely for His sake.”</span> [Surah Al-Bayyinah: 5}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As we mentioned before, seeking the religious knowledge that is required in order to properly worship Allaah is itself an act of worship and part of the implementation of Laa Ilaaha IllaaAllaah. So in summary, seeking knowledge is an act of worship that one must strive to have sincerity in whilst performing it. The Messenger of Allaah (Sall Allaahu alaihi wa Sallam) said: “Verily, actions are based on intentions. And verily, every man will have what he intends.” [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Based on this, we say: A student of knowledge must continuously strive to correct his intention and to make it purely for the sake of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Someone may say: “Does this mean that I should not seek knowledge until I (first) correct my intention?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: No. Rather, you should seek knowledge. But while you are seeking knowledge, you should examine yourself and rectify yourself by way of correcting your intention. If this person continues, saying: “I want to leave off seeking knowledge until I (first) correct my<br />
intention!!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I will reply by saying: This is a trap from the Devil. He has opened up for you one of the doors of good intending by that to turn you away from that which is better and greater. So therefore, you should continue and be perseverant in your search for knowledge. And you should continuously rectify yourself, for indeed your knowledge – Allaah-willing – will guide you to make your intention sincerely for the sake of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Salaf would say: “We sought this knowledge for other than the sake of Allaah. But the knowledge refused that it should be sought except for the sake of Allaah.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Nasirud-Din al-Albani<span style="line-height:1.5em;"> &#8211; al-Hijra magazine (vol.4 no.2)<br />
</span>Al-Ibaanah Magazine Issue No.1 &#8211; Dhul-Qa’dah 1415H / April 1995</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>What Benefits the Dead</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abû Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> “The likeness of wealth, family and the actions of the son of Âdam is of a man who has three companions. One of the man’s companions says: I am with you as long as you live; when you die, you have taken your share of yourself and you have taken your share of me &#8211; this is his wealth. The second companion says: I am with you until you reach that tree; you have had your share of yourself and your share of me &#8211; this is his family. The third companion says: I am with you in life and in death.”</i> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above authentic hadîth is in fact like the following hadîth in meaning and in subject matter. Anas said that the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> “The dead person is followed (to his grave) by three: His family, his wealth and his actions. Two of them return and only one remains. His family and wealth return, but his actions remain.”</i> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These two ahâdîth show that actions alone endure and enter the grave with their doers. Both these ahâdîth also affirm the fact that anything other than actions &#8211; such as wealth, servants or relatives &#8211; are of no benefit at all. Rather, they all return (to this world). His wealth becomes the property of his inheritor, whilst his relatives and family do not grant him anything from Allâh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These ahâdîth intend to direct Muslims to be concerned with actions which will stay with them forever; and not to strive for wealth and position for the sake of relatives, family and servants. Apparently, the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> wanted to show us the value of good actions when he related these ahâdîth to us, (which can be found) in the books of <i>Zuhd</i> (renouncement of the world). He pointed out to us that because actions will last rather than wealth, you have to make your actions righteous. Part of making ones actions righteous is through good wealth that is earned lawfully and spent in a good manner. Then one gains the rewards of <i>’amalus-sâlih</i> (a righteous action).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Acceptable Action</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, in these ahâdîth, the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> encouraged us to make our actions righteous, whether gaining wealth or other things. However, we must remember a certain fact about this action, a fact that many people neglect. The explanation of this fact should actually be a complete lesson in itself; and it is that only a <i>righteous action</i> is beneficial, not just any action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what are the conditions that a Muslim must fulfill in order for the action to be righteous? This is shown in the statement of Allâh &#8211; <i>the Exalted and Sublime</i>: <b>“Say (O Muhammad): Verily I am only a man like yourselves, but revelation has been revealed to me that the One whom you should worship is only One Deity. And whoever hopes to meet his Lord, let him do righteous actions; and in the worship of your Lord, do not associate anyone along with Him.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Two Important Conditions</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Scholars of <i>Tafsîr</i> have said that the end of this verse is an indication that there are two conditions for an action to be righteous and acceptable: [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>Firstly</i></b>: That the action must be in accordance with the Sunnah. Therefore, if the action is done as an act of worship, but is not in accordance with the Sunnah, it is not a righteous action. The reason is that compliance with the Sunnah is one of the conditions for the action’s righteousness. The proofs of this are many, but it is enough to state one: The hadîth of the Prophet <i>sallallâhu </i> <i>’alayhi wa sallam</i> in which he said: <i> “Whoever innovates in this matter of ours what is not upon it, it shall be rejected.” </i>[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, any action that was not part of Islâm when Allâh revealed it upon the heart of the Prophet Muhammad <i>sallallâhu </i> <i>’alayhi wa sallam</i> is not a righteous action. About this, Allâh &#8211; the Most High &#8211; says: <b> “This day I have perfected your Dîn for you and completed My favour upon you and I have chosen Islâm as your Dîn.”</b> [7] It must be remembered that <i>Bid’ah</i> (innovation) [8] is not divided into five categories, as some Scholars say. A proof for this is that the Prophet <i>sallallâhu </i> <i>’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> “Every innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance is in the Hellfire.”</i> [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>Secondly</i></b>: That after being in accordance with the Sunnah, the action has to be sincere, purely seeking the Face of Allâh &#8211; <i>the Most High</i> &#8211; because Allâh says at the end of the aforementioned verse: <b> “And in the worship of your Lord, do not associate anyone along with Him.”</b> This means that the person seeks, by his righteous action, only the Face of Allâh &#8211; <i> the Exalted and Sublime</i>. However, if he seeks other than Allâh, then he has setup partners with Allâh (made shirk with Allâh), therefore his action is rejected.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is confirmed by Allâh in an authentic hadîth Qudsî: <i>“I am so self-sufficient that I am in no need of having any partners. Thus, whosoever does an action for the sake of someone else as well as Me, will have that action rejected by Me, to him whom he associated with Me.” </i>[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consequently, if the action is righteous but not sincere for the sake of Allâh’s Face, it is rejected. Moreover, if the action is purely for the sake of Allâh’s Face, but not in accordance with the Sunnah, it is likewise not accepted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Worthless and Sinful Action</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these arc the two conditions for every action to be a righteous action. If one of these conditions is not present, the action does not become a righteous action, rather, it becomes an evil one. Had the person not done this action, it would have been better for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a man prays two <i> rak’ât </i> of prayer at night, while others sleep, then even if he prays them according to the Sunnah &#8211; without addition or deletion &#8211; but he does this so that people may talk about him and say: “This Person is a righteous man. He prays at night when the people are asleep,” then his action becomes <i> bâtil</i> (null and void), since he did not sincerely seek the Face of Allâh alone, but rather he sought the praises of people, thus becoming sinful by associating partners with Allâh in his action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if his action only became null and void, then the following hadîth would apply to him; and he would not be punished for this action: <i>“How many fasting people obtain nothing from their fasting except hunger and thirst. And how many people who stay up at night (praying), obtain nothing from their being awake except sleeplessness and tiredness.”</i> [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But this is not the case, for this person’s action has changed into a sin. The two <i> rak’ât</i> that this person performed without intending to seek only the Face of Allâh &#8211; <i>the Exalted and Sublime</i> &#8211; are the same as if he had disobeyed Him, that is to say: He will be punished for these two <i> rak’ât </i> because he associated others along with Allâh &#8211; <i> the Exalted and Sublime</i> &#8211; in his action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a man prays eleven <i> rak’ât</i> at night with the intention, in this worship, that his brothers would say about him: “This man is correctly following the Prophet; he does not add to the Sunnah,” his action becomes null and void; and his action changes to a sin against him. Rather, he must pray according to the Sunnah but sincerely seeking only the Face of Allâh &#8211; the Most High. He must be absolutely free of seeking the pleasure of others along with Him in this worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This has been but a summary about the action that does not leave the person but enters the grave with him &#8211; whether the action was good or bad &#8211; and that what is of benefit is the person’s righteous action. What is a righteous action and what are its conditions? The two conditions are:- <i><b>Muwwâfaqah</b></i> (compliance) with the Sunnah; and <i><b>Ikhlâs</b></i> (sincerity and purity of intention) to Allâh. Therefore, one must remember these two conditions and act upon them so that one may become righteous and pious.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Safeguarding against Insincerity</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many people unfortunately neglect the first condition (complying with the Sunnah) because they are astray and believe that <i> bid’ah</i> (innovation) is good in the religion.[12] But there are those upon whom Allâh has granted His favour, by guiding them to the Sunnah of the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>. They are those who know the reality of this condition and adhere to it the best they can. Yet they must pay attention to the second condition, which either group may fail to fulfill, and that is <i>riyâ’</i> (insincerity and showing-off). No one is exempt from <i>riyâ’</i> and all people are susceptible to it in their actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This matter is a very serious one and must be stressed here, so that we may know that we are in need of making our actions correct and purely for the Face of Allâh &#8211; <i> the Exalted and Sublime</i>. Part of this is that we are tested even while making <i> Da’wah</i> to the Qur‘ân and the Sunnah, for trials are not only in evil matters, but also in the good matters:<b> “And We test you with evil and good, by way of <i>fitnah</i> (trial).”</b> [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <i>da’wah</i> has been neglected by Muslims throughout the world so that the <i>du’ât</i> (the callers) have become strangers. Not only are they strangers in foreign countries, but they are strangers even in their own countries; amongst their relatives and brothers. This makes them praiseworthy, but they must not stand up to be praised for this <i>da’wah</i>. This is the reality, for the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>“Verily Islâm started as something strange and it will return as something strange, so Tûbâ is for the Strangers.”</i> [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Tûbâ and the Strangers</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of <i>Tûbâ</i> in the Arabic language is: “Praise and thanks.” The meaning according to the <i>Sharî’ah</i> refers to a tree in Paradise, which would take a rider a hundred years to traverse its shade. [15] This hadîth gives glad tidings to the newcomers of Paradise in which there is: <i>“What no eye has never seen, no ear has ever heard, and no heart has ever imagined.”</i> [16] This tree is mentioned in the Qur’ân in the statement of Allâh: <b>“<i>Tûbâ</i> is for them, and the best abode.”</b> [17] Therefore, <i>Tûbâ</i> is for the Ghurabâ (the Strangers), but who are they? The answer to this is in the reply of the Prophet: <i>“Those who correct [themselves and others], when the people have become corrupt.”</i> [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Need for Care</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These Strangers call the people to the revival of the Sunnah and eradication of all that differs from it. However, they must still pay attention to the second condition of the righteous action: To be sincere in their <i>da’wah</i>. They must neither seek fame, pride, nor arguments from their <i>da’wah</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They must not seek anything that <i>an-Nafs ul-Amârata bis-Sû’</i> (the soul that calls them to evil) orders them to do. Whatever they call to is as a result of Allâh &#8211; <i>the Most High </i> &#8211; having ordered them to make <i> da’wah</i> to the Qur’ân and the Sunnah and to make<i> da’wah</i> to what the Muslims have neglected. They must take care of this <i>da’wah</i>. However, they stand in danger. It can happen that one may say a word seeking only to have fingers of praise pointed at him, not sincerely advising the people and desiring to guide them. Rather, to do that for fame.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here we mention a saying of some <i>Sûfîs</i>, who have some wise sayings that can not be denied: “The love of fame breaks backs.” Therefore, I insist, that we who make <i> Da’wah</i> to the Sunnah be sincere in our actions so that when our actions enter the grave with us, it will help us to answer correctly when we are asked: “Who is your Lord? Who is your Prophet? What is your religion?” If the deed is evil, when the person enters the grave, he will deny it. His deed will come to him in the worst of forms. He will ask it: “Who are you?” It will say: “I am your deed.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Wealth &#8211; its Reality and Purpose</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The next Hadîth is also authentic. Abû Hurayrah said that the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>“The servant says: My wealth! My wealth! However, he gets from his wealth three things: What he eats and finishes. What he wears and makes shabby; and what he gives away and pleases others with. Whatever else is besides this, goes and is left for the people.”</i> [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Hadîth also emphasises the subject of the previous ahâdîth. It shows us the care taken by people in amassing wealth. Allâh pointed this out in the Qur‘ân by His statement: <b>“And for the love of good he is strong.”</b> [20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet depicted the nature of mankind for us in his saying: <i>“The servant says: My wealth! My wealth!”</i> Nevertheless, what is the amount that remains left over for him from his wealth? Is all his wealth for him? No! He gains from his wealth only the examples that the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> specified. The first is defined by the Prophet’s statement: <i>“What he eats and finishes.”</i> From his wealth is that which is necessary for him to survive and that which enables him to accomplish the rights of Allâh. These rights are the rights of His <i> Tawhîd</i> (singling out Allâh alone for worship), as Allâh said: <b> “And I have not created the jinn and mankind except to worship Me.”</b> [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second is what a person wears until it becomes shabby. Add to this that which he volunteers and does good with, which is mentioned in the statement of the Prophet: <i>“Or what he gives away and pleases others with.”</i> He got rid of his wealth by giving it away to another in charity. Therefore, the wealth that is for the servant is the amount that he eats and the amount that he wears in order to survive. However this is not an end in itself. Rather, one exists solely to accomplish the obligation of worship, as we pointed out previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third kind of wealth that returns with a benefit is not only the obligatory charity, but it also includes non-obligatory charities. Then the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> explained what is left after these categories. He said: <i>“And other than that is gone, and is left, for the people.”</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The relation of this Hadîth with the previous one is: Why do people exhaust themselves in amassing wealth, when this is the reality of wealth? They do not benefit from there wealth except the amount that they eat, drink and with which they help other people. All else will be left and it will remain for the people who inherit it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following Hadîth is also <i>Sahîh</i> (authentic). Abdullâh ibn ash-Shikhkhîr said: I came to the Prophet whilst he was reciting: <b>“Seeking increase diverted you.” </b> The Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said:<i> “The son of Âdam say My wealth! My wealth! What do you obtain, O son of Âdam, from your wealth except that which you eat and consume, or wear until it becomes shabby, or what you give as charity and accomplish.”</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadîth is also similar in meaning to the previous one, though some of its words are different; and was recorded by Muslim, at-Tirmidhî and an-Nasâ‘î. This hadîth is clear in its wording, however, the statement of the Prophet at the end of the hadîth: <i>“or what you give as charity and accomplish.”</i> may not be clear to some people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Generosity and Miserliness</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This statement aims at drawing one’s attention to the fact that what is intended for charity is that which he actually gives away. It is not sufficient that a person should just make out a will, that he should give such and such to the poor, or such and such for a specific masjid. However, the Prophet calls our attention to the fact that benefit is in that wealth which a person actually gave away during his lifetime, since he did not really know what would happen with his wealth after he died, if he had made a will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">with this word, the Prophet points to a hadîth in the <i> Sahîh</i> of al-Bukhârî &#8211; the meaning of which is that the miser is one who when death comes to him makes a will and says: “Give so and so such amount and for so and so such and such amount.” The Prophet said: <i>“This was already for so and so and so and so.”</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> meant was that the deceased did not own anything anymore. He had left this <i>dunya</i> (life of this world ) and had entered into the <i>Âkhirah</i> (the Hereafter) and his inheritance will remain for those people who are still alive. Then should not the person have made his will earlier? Should he not have given charity whilst he was strong, hoping to be rich and fearing poverty?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the nature of the people today, they say: “Hoard your white Dirham for your black day.” They hoard this money for themselves for when they become old. They are covetous of this wealth. The generous person is the one who gives away his own wealth when his own soul is attached to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who is on the brink of death and who says: “Give so and so such and such amount,” he is a miser and is not generous. Rather, a truly generous person is one who gives charity whilst he holds onto his life and also whilst he loves this wealth very much.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Insignificance of this World</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The next hadîth is narrated by Jâbir ibn ’Abdullâh: The Messenger of Allâh <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> passed by the market place coming from the direction of ‘Âliyah and people were around him. He passed by a dead kid goat (i.e. a baby goat) which had very short ears. He held it by its ears and said: <i>“Who amongst you would like to have this for a dirham?”</i> They (the Companions) said: We would not want it even for less than that! What can we do with it? He said: <i>“Do you wish to have it (for any price)?”</i> They said: By Allâh, even if it were alive it (we would not want it), as it has very short ears, let alone now when it is also dead! The Messenger of Allâh <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> “By Allâh, this world is more insignificant to Allâh than this (goat) is to you all.”</i> [23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let us return to the hadîth. He passed by the market place <i> “and the people were around him.”</i> Here I would like to pause a little in order to remind people about some of the guidance of the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> that most of the Shaykhs of today have neglected.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykhs of today walk with their students behind them. This was not the way of the Messenger of Allâh <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>. The ahâdîth describing this are many and the following is from them: “He used to walk side by side with Abû Bakr and side by side with Abû Hurayrah; and they all walked with each other.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, it is authentically proven that the Messenger of Allâh <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> used to say to his Companions <i>radiallâhu ’anhum</i>, when he used to walk with them: <i> “Walk in<br />
front of me and leave my back for the angels.”</i> [24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here he highlights two matters from one saying. People do not see angels, they see only people. Therefore, if anyone saw the Messenger <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> walking, they would only see people walking in front of him. The Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said in the authentic hadîth: <i> “He who humbles himself for the sake of Allâh, Allâh will raise him.” </i>[25] His humbleness raised him to a degree whereby the angels walked behind him. Therefore, is a noble person one behind whom people &#8211; good or bad &#8211; walk; or is he the one who is followed by those described by Allâh in the following verse: <b> “They do not disobey what Allâh ordered them to do and do precisely what they are commanded.”</b> The nobility of the Prophet manifested itself in a visible and an invisible side. The visible side is that the Companions used to walk in front of the Prophet and not behind him. The invisible side is that the angels walked behind him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Of course, the first phenomenon is the one in which we are ordered not to act proudly with our companions and our brothers in faith, even those who may be less than us in knowledge, morals, worship and righteousness. This is enough for us, because Allâh says: “Do not sanctify yourself. He knows best the ones who are pious.” [26] It is sufficient for us at least, to walk with people side by side. Whosoever intentionally goes against this Sunnah, without doubt, does not truly love the Messenger of Allâh <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>. This is because one’s degree of love from him, is based upon following him. This is established in the Qur’ân by the statement of Allâh: <b> “Say (O Muhammad): If you do love Allâh then follow me; Allâh will love you and forgive you your sins.”</b> [27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if this was the case with the Prophet who was infallible and protected from the whispering of the <i>Shaytân</i> and this was an indication of the level with his Companions, then what can we say about ourselves? We are not infallible and are not protected from the <i>Shaytân</i>. We must adhere to this Sunnah as if it were obligatory. It is better for us to walk with people around us than to walk looking with our eyes at the backs of their shoulders. The statement of the Prophet, at the end of the hadîth: <i>“By Allâh, this world is more insignificant to Allâh than this (goat) is to you all,”</i> is to be reflected upon by people of intellect!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The next authentic hadîth is similar to the previous hadîth. Ibn ’Abbâs said: The Prophet passed by a dead goat that had been thrown away by its owners. He said: <i>“By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, this world is more insignificant to Allâh than this is to its owner.”</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sahl ibn Sa’d said that the Messenger of Allâh <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>“If this world was worth as much to Allâh as the wing of a mosquito, He would not have given a disbeliever even a sip of water.” </i>[28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Salmân said: Some people came to the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> and he asked them: <i>“Do you have food?”</i> They said: Yes. He asked: <i>“Do you have drink?”</i> They said: Yes. He said: <i>“Verily their outcome is like the outcome of this world, one of you stands behind his house holding his nose from their bad smell.”</i> This is the similitude of this world. What is the eventual outcome of food and drink? They change to stool and urine. Therefore, a person hates the smell for himself. This is the similitude of the outcome of this World.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following hadîth has the same meaning. Ubayy ibn Ka’b said that the Messenger of Allâh <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>“Indeed the food of the son of Âdam is like the example of the world. Even if he puts spices and season into it, see what becomes of it.” </i>[29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is the eventual outcome of spices and seasoning in his food? Look at what it becomes! Likewise, this world becomes a similar thing except that which is for Allâh. The next hadîth explains this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abû Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> “The world and all that it contains is cursed, except for the remembrance of Allâh and what supports it; or a Scholar and a student.” </i>[30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>In Conclusion</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the reality of this world in the <i> Sharî’ah</i>, it has no value. The similitude of this world is like good food and drink: its outcome is decay. The exceptions arc those things which are done for Allâh whether remembrance of Allâh, knowledge or even food because it helps to support the worship of Allâh. These things are among the deeds of man that endure in this fleeting life. The goal behind these <i> ahâdîth</i> is that a person should not be overly concerned about this world, except with which is sufficient to keep him alive and strong; and sufficient enough to be able to accomplish the worship of his Lord. For if his wealth is greater than this, it will only benefit him by the amount of good that he does by helping others; otherwise, he is going to leave this wealth behind and it will not benefit him at all. However, what will benefit him are the righteous actions that he has done.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allâh not to put love of this world in our hearts, but to guide us to earn in this life what helps us to worship and obey Him. And all praise is for Allâh, Lord of the Worlds.</p>

Where is the proper place of the intention?  Is it on the tongue or in the heart?  Listen and find out. And you&#8217;ll also hear of a piece of advice from Sheikh ibn al-Uthaymeen for a person when he intends to do something good and then is affected by whisperings of the shaytaan regarding his intention.</p>

The Sheikh explains that the hadith &#8220;Indeed actions are but by intentions&#8230;.&#8221; is a mizaan (scale) for the hidden actions.  Listen to find out why this is and also to find out which hadith is a mizaan for the apparent actions.</p>

In this class we begin with the hadith narrated by Sa&#8217;d ibn abee Waqqas (one of the 10 promised paradise) that the Messenger, sallallahu alaihi wasallam, visited him in his illness and instructed him not to bequeath more than 1/3 of his wealth, and that even that was a lot.</p>

In this class we study the 14 benefits that our sheikh ibn al-Uthaymeen brought regarding the hadith narrated by Sa&#8217;d ibn abee Waqqas (one of the 10 promised paradise) when the Messenger, sallallahu alaihi wasallam, visited him in his illness.</p>

</strong> sources: silsilat ul-hudaa wa nnoor, 340/8 &amp; nudhum al-fawaaid, 21<br />
<em>asaheeha translations<br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~ Explanation of the <em>hadeeth</em>: ‘Actions are only judged by intentions’ [Saheeh al-Bukhaari #1] ~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaani (rahimahullaah):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This <em>hadeeth</em> means that<strong> righteous actions are only (sound/accepted/rewarded) by sincere intentions</strong>,<em><strong> not</strong></em> <strong>that actions opposing the Legislation turn into righteous legislated actions due to coupling them with righteous intentions.</strong> No one will say that except someone ignorant or pursuing his own interests!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many people know this <em>hadeeth</em> in wording but don’t understand its meaning. Why? Because oftentimes we turn (to some people) and say: ‘<em>Yaa akhi</em>, this action that you are doing, or this statement that you are uttering, is not a righteous action.’ What is the answer? ‘<em>Yaa akhi</em>, the Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: ‘Actions are only judged by intentions’ and my intention is good! My intention is righteous!’</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is the meaning of the <em>hadeeth</em>? Does the <em>hadeeth</em> mean that evil actions are only (sound/accepted/rewarded) by righteous intentions? Or does it mean that righteous actions are only (sound/accepted/rewarded) by righteous intentions? This latter statement is the meaning. As for if one’s actions are not righteous but intention is righteous – this is not enough. Likewise it is also not enough if it is vice versa: i.e. if one’s actions are righteous but intention is not righteous. So the <em>hadeeth</em> gives us two opposites: just like it is a condition for righteous action that there be righteous intention,<strong> it is likewise a condition for righteous intention that there be righteous action</strong>. So either one is not enough without the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You hear many people nowadays swearing by their fathers for example, saying: ‘.’ Sometimes you may find a person coming to a grave and praying there – a grave of a prophet or righteous person or the like – then when they are prohibited from that, he tells you: ‘My intention is not to worship him, my intention is to seek nearness to Allaah (<em>tawassul</em>) through him.’ Ok, your coming to this grave – granted that the intention is righteous – is an action, so is this a righteous action? The answer is no, because the Messenger (<em>‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) used to say: ‘Don’t sit on the graves nor pray toward them.’ And <em>du’aa</em> is part of prayer, in fact <em>du’aa</em> is worship as he (<em>‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) said. Hence turning to the grave with <em>du’aa</em> is like turning to it with prayer: it is an action that is not righteous, and this unrighteous action is not justified by the intention being righteous, <em>if</em> we grant that the intention is righteous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, <strong>for our actions to be righteous, they must be in agreement with the Legislation</strong>. This is what our Lord (<em>‘azza wa jal</em>) pointed to with His Statement in the Noble Qur’aan: {<span style="color:#008000;">whoever hopes for the meeting with his Lord, let him do righteous work and not associate any partner in the worship of his Lord</span>}.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">Here are some Fawa&#8217;id about the obsessive thoughts that some brothers/sisters might get when trying to perform acts of worship. I hope they make things easier for you in Shâ&#8217; Allâh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>1.</strong><strong>The intention:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn-ul-Qayyim:</strong> The one who sits down in order to make ablution, has intended the ablution (!!!). The one who arises in order to pray, has intended the prayer. The sensible one hardly performs an act of worship but that he has already intended it. The fact is that if Allah had obliged us an act without intention, then it would have been impossible. (al-Islah, p. 67)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn-ul-Qayyim</strong>: To doubt the intention of one’s action is a type of madness. (Ibid, p.67)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>2. The verbal intention.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn-ul-Qayyim:</strong> The devil has made the verbal intention into a battlefield for those with whispters (wiswas). He imprisons them by it and punishes them with it. You see how they strive in order to utter it correctly – and it has nothing to do with the prayer. (Ibid, p.67)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>3. Where do they come from?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn-ul-Qayyim:</strong> al-Ghazali said that whispers (waswasah) either spring from ignorance about the religion or also from a madness and both belong to the greatest deficiencies (Ibid, p.69)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>4. Free time and work:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen:</strong> Free time is deadly. The one who is not busied by knowledge or work gets these obsessive thoughts. (al-Liqa ash-Shahri 45)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>5. Perhaps a drop of urine exited?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen:</strong> There are those who, after having urinated, feel something down there and (they) drop the pants in order to look. Do not do that. Ignore it. (al-Liqa ash-Shahri 46)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Shaykh al-Fawzân also said in one of his tapes that this (these obsessive thoughts regarding drops etc) should be ignored)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen:</strong> After urinating and that the last drop has went out, one should just wash the glans and nothing more. (al-Liqa ash-Shahri 46)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>6. Shaking it and pressing from&#8230;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen:</strong> There are people who, after having urinated, press their penises from the anal to the glans and some shake them. This is an <strong>INNOVATION.</strong> (al-Liqa ash-Shahri 46)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>7. Two doubt their Wudhu</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen:</strong> Two kinds of persons always doubt their ablution: the one with obsessive thouhts and the one with constant gases. The person with the obsessive thoughts should wean himself from it and ignore them and the person with the gases goes with that which is convincing until he hears or feels something. (al-Liqa ash-Shahri 61)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>8. Jumping into a river for Ghusl and then doubting it?!</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen:</strong> Obsessive thoughts (Wiswas) are dangerous. A man came to a Shaykh<strong>1</strong> and said: I bath in the flood Tigris after orgasm. I then pray and persuade myself to [think that] I am not clean. The Shaykh then said: Do not pray. The prophet said that the mad one is not responsible for his deeds until he becomes normal and you are mad. (al-Liqa ash-Shahri 23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1.</strong> (The shaykh mentions in his FHM tape 5 that the shaykh was Ibn &#8216;aqil al-Hanbali)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>9. To BREAK the wudhu in order to be sure of one&#8217;s next wudhu?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen:</strong> An example of these obsessive thoughts is to doubt whether one is clean or not and in order to be sure, one BREAKS THE ABLUTION. (al-Liqa ash-Shahri 23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Please note:</strong> Some people who know that they are clean, but to be “<em>sure</em>”, they break the wudhu by touching the penis or farting etc, look at this stupidness, they BREAK THE WUDHU to be sure? And then they remake the wudhu not realising that they were already convinced of the former wudhu, they would otherwise not BREAK IT, you can&#8217;t break something that is not there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>10. What do they lead to?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen:</strong> Obsessive thoughts lead to madness. (FHM 5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>11. The preseminal fluid issue</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn ‘Uthaymeen:</strong> There are people who imagine that they they got preseminal fluid as soon as they think. These are the whispers of the devil and should be ignored. (Sharh-ul-Bulugh 1/421)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>12. Why do jews not get whispers when they pray?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn-ul-Qayyim:</strong> Ibn ‘Abbas was asked why the jews not get whispers when they pray. He said: What should the devil do with a ruined heart? (al-Wabil, p.52)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just a quick note: I will in Shâ&#8217; Allâh gather some Fawâ&#8217;id in regards to other kinds of Wiswas (such as &#8216;Aqîdah, belief etc). These were more leaning towards Taharah and the intention. Bârak Allâhu fîkum.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: alkhawf wa rrajaa &#8211; fear and hope (of Allaah) &#8211; tape no. 1, asaheeha translations</p>
<p><strong>shaykh al-albaani (rahimahullaah)</strong> begins with the khutbat ul-haajah maa shaa Allaah, and the first part of his talk revolves around the meaning of the hadeeth below:</p>
<p>Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><em><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Allaah says [to the angels], &#8216;If My slave intends to do a bad deed then do not write it against him until he does it; if he does it, then write it as it is, but if he leaves it for My sake, then write it as a good deed for him. And if he intends to go a good deed, but does not do it, then write it as a good deed for him; and if he does it, then write it for him as ten good deeds up to seven-hundred times as much up to many more times&#8221;</span></em> &#8211; [Saheeh al-Bukhaari]</p>
<p>The shaykh comments and speaks on the many favors of Allaah upon His believing slave:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;&#8230;First, if he does a good deed it [the count of the deeds] is multiplied &#8211; as for a bad deed, then it [the count of the deeds] is not multiplied.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Second, if he did not do a bad deed, and had intended to do it, nothing is written against him, as opposed to [gaining a] good deed: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">if he intended to do (a bad deed), then did not do it, a good deed is written for him. Why? &#8211; because he left it fearing Allaah &#8216;azza wa jal. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">And the [understanding of] this is that if he intends to do a bad deed, then leaves it and does not act upon it for some reason, and it is not (because of) his fear of Allaah, the Blessed and Most High, then nothing is written upon him, neither a bad deed nor a good deed.</span> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">As for if his motive for leaving this bad deed was his fear of Allaah &#8216;azza wa jal, then this bad deed, because of his leaving it, turns into a good deed. Hence, fearing Allaah &#8216;azza wa jal pushes its possessor (the possessor of the quality of fearing Allaah) to have many good deeds. Every time he intends to do a bad deed and he leaves it fearing Allaah, the bad intention turns into a good deed.&#8221;</span></p>

<div>Your life in the present moment is in between the past and the future.</div>
<div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what has preceded can be rectified by tawbah (repentance), nadam (regret) and istighfar (seeking Allaah’s forgiveness). And this is something that will neither tire you, nor cause you to toil as you would with strenuous labour. Rather it is an action of the heart.Then as regards the future (then it can be corrected) by withholding yourself from sins. And this abandonment is merely the leaving of something and to be at ease from it. This also is not action of the limbs, which requires you to strive and toil. Rather this is a firm resolve and intention of the heart – which will give rest to your body, heart and thoughts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So as for what has preceded, then you rectify it with repentance. And as for the future – then you rectify it with firm resolve and intention. Neither of these involves any hardship or exertion of the limbs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But then your attention must be directed to your life in the present &#8211; the time between two times. If you waste it, then you have wasted the opportunity to be of the fortunate and saved ones. If you look after it, having rectified the two times – what is before and after it, as we have said – then you will be successful and achieve rest, delight and ever-lasting bliss. However, looking after it is harder than that which comes before and after it, since guarding it involves keeping to that which is most befitting and beneficial for your soul, and that which will bring it success and well-being.</p>
