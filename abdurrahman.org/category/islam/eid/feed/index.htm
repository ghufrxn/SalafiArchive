										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Is it permissible for the one who misses the ‘Eid prayer to make it up? And if so how is it to be made up?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>The Permanent Committee</strong> for Scientific Research and Fatwa of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia headed by Ibn Baaz as stated in ‘Al-Fataawa’, vol. 8, pg. 306-307, nos. 2328 and 4517:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The individual who misses the ‘Eid prayer and wants to make it up, then it is recommended for him to do so and he is to pray it according to its normal manner without being followed by a khutbah and this is what was stated by Maalik, ash-Shaafi’ee, Ahmad, an-Nakha’ee and other scholars.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The foundation for this is the statement of the Prophet صلّى اﻟﻠﻪَُّ عليه وسلّم :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘If you come to the prayer, then approach it with tranquility and composure. Whatever you have caught from the prayer, then pray it and what has preceded you, then complete it.’</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, what was narrated about Anas رضي اﻟﻠﻪّ عنه that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘If he missed the ‘Eid prayer with the Imaam, he would gather his family and servants, then ‘Abdullah Ibn Abi ‘Utbah, his servant, would lead them in prayer of two rak’ahs which he would make the takbeer in.’</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And regarding the individual who arrives at the ‘Eid prayer while the Imaam is giving the khutbah, he is to listen to the khutbah then make up the prayer after. This is so that he gets the benefit of both (listening to the khutbah and making up the prayer as opposed to making up the prayer first and missing the khutbah).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Permanent Committee also stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Whoever reaches the prayer and catches only the tashahhud with the Imaam of the two ‘Eid prayers, then he is to pray two rak’ahs after the Imaam gives the salaam and he does exactly what the Imaam does regarding the takbeer, recitation, rukoo’ and sujood.”</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, there is great and profound wisdom behind this Sunnah – i.e. the Sunnah of praying in an open area of land (i.e. the musallaa). And it is that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">The Muslims will have two days out of the year where all the people of every city can gather together – whether men, women or children – and turn towards Allaah with their hearts in unity, praying behind one Imaam, making the takbeer and the tahleel and supplicating to Allaah sincerely together, as if they were united upon the heart of one man, happy and joyous about the blessing Allaah has bestowed on them. So the ‘Eid will truly be an occasion of celebration for them.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم ordered the women to go out to pray ‘Eid along with the people, and he did not make an exception for any of them. This is even to the point that he made no excuses for those women who did not have a garment by which they could veil themselves when coming out, as instead he commanded them to borrow garments from other women. And this is even to the point that he صلى الله عليه وسلم commanded those women who had a reason that prevented them from praying (i.e. menses) to go out to the musallaa, so that they may “witness the good and the supplication of the Muslims.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, and then his Khaleefahs (successors) after him, and the delegated leaders in the cities would lead the people in prayer. Then they would give them a sermon saying that which would admonish them. And they would teach them what would be of benefit to them in this world and in the Hereafter. And they would order them to give in charity in that gathering. So the rich person would show affection towards the poor person. And the poor would find joy in what Allaah has given them from His Bounty during this blessed assembly, which Allaah’s Mercy and Contentment descends upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is only proper for the Muslims to respond to following the Sunnah of their Prophet and reviving the rites of their Religion, which is the point of their resolution and success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“O you who believe! Respond to Allaah and to the Messenger when He calls you to that which will revive you.”</span></strong> [Surah Al-Anfaal: 24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaikh Waliyullaah Ad-Dihlawee said in Hujjatullaah-il-Baalighah under the heading “The Two ‘Eids” (2/30-32):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The foundation with regard to them is that every nation has a day in which they beautify themselves and go out from their city with their adornment. This is a custom, which no group amongst the Arabs and non-Arabs have stopped practicing. When the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم came to Madeenah, he found that the people had two days in which they would go out and enjoy themselves, so he said: ‘Allaah has replaced these two days with something that is better than them – the Day of Adhaa and the Day of Fitr.’ [20] It was said that these two (prior) days of celebration were: <strong>An-Nayrooz</strong> and <strong>Al-Mahrajaan</strong>. These two days were only replaced because there is no ‘Eid for a group of people except that the reason for its existence is to elevate the rites of a Religion or to comply with the founders of a particular way or something that resembles that. So the Prophet feared that if he were to leave them with their custom, there would remain this elevating of the rites of Jaahiliyyah (i.e. the Days of Ignorance) or the propagating of the (false) ways of the ancestors. So he صلى الله عليه وسلم replaced them with two days in which there was found an elevating of the rites of the pure and upright Religion (of Islaam). And along with adorning oneself for the occasion, he صلى الله عليه وسلم included the remembrance of Allaah as well as various acts of obedience, so that the gathering of the Muslims won’t just be for pure play and enjoyment, and so that no gathering from them will be void of raising Allaah’s Word.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first of these two days is ‘Eid-ul-Fitr, the day when they end their fasting and give a certain type of their Zakaat. So they experience this ‘natural joy’ that is caused by their withdrawing from conditions that were difficult upon them (i.e. the fast). And the poor person experiences joy at taking his charity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ‘intellectual joy’ they experience is due to the delight of knowing that Allaah has blessed them with the ability to complete what He made obligatory upon them (i.e. the fast)…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second is the day when Ibraaheem (intended to) sacrifice his son Ismaa’eel, may Allaah be pleased with both of them. But Allaah blessed them both by replacing him with the great sacrifice (i.e. a ram). This is since on this day, one can be reminded and take heed of the condition of the ancestors of this noble and upright religion, by sacrificing one’s soul and wealth in obeying Allaah, and having firm patience. In this, there is a similarity to those performing Hajj, where one tries to emulate them and longs to be in the state they are in. This is why it is legislated to make the Takbeer in it, which is found in Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘And so that you may magnify Allaah (by making Takbeer) for having guided you and so that you may be grateful.’</strong></span> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 185; Surah Al-Hajj: 37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means: Give thanks to Him for granting you the ability to fast. This is why performing the sacrifice and saying the takbeer out loud were legislated on the Days of Minaa. And this is why it is recommended for those who intend to offer the sacrifice to abandon shaving (the body hair). [21] And this is also why the Prayer and the Khutbah (sermon) were prescribed – so that no part of their gathering could be void of the remembrance of Allaah and the elevating of the rites of the Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another objective from the objectives of the Pure Legislation is included in this, which is that: Every nation must have some presentation, in which its people gather together during it to display their strength and to show their numbers. This is why it is recommended for everyone to go out (to the musallaa) – even the children, the women, the young girls and the menstruating women. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>However, they (i.e. menstruating women) must not join the musallaa (i.e. the prayer) but rather witness the supplication of the Muslims.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is also why the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم would vary in the roads he took when going and coming from the musallaa, so that the people in each of the roads would see the strength of the Muslims. And since the origin of ‘Eid was to decorate and adorn oneself, it is recommended to wear one’s best garment, to enjoy oneself (taqlees), [22] to take different routes when going and coming and to go out to the musallaa.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">[End Quote]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[20] I say: Ahmad and others reported it with an authentic chain of narration. I have referenced it in as-Saheehah (no.2021).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[21] I say: He is indicating the Prophet’s statement: “<strong>When the Hilaal (crescent) for Dhul-Hijjah is sighted and one of you wants to offer a sacrifice, then he must refrain from cutting his hair and nails</strong>.” And in one narration: “<strong>…then let him not cut any part of his hair or nails until he offers the sacrifice.</strong>” [See Mukhtasar Saheeh Muslim (no. 1251) and others] I say: It is apparent from the hadeeth that anyone who is determined to perform the sacrifice is obligated not to cut his hair and nails until he offers the sacrifice. So this type of cutting mentioned above is forbidden. Imaam Ahmad and others held this view. So let those who are tested with shaving their beards take note of this, for indeed, there are three sinful matters in their shaving of their beards for the day of ‘Eid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: The shaving itself, for it is a feminine trait, an imitation of the disbelievers, and an alteration of Allaah’s creation, as I have explained in my book “Adaab az-Zafaaf fis-Sunnah al-Mutahharah (Sixth Edition, pg. 118).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: Adorning oneself for the day of ‘Eid by disobeying Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: What is derived from this hadeeth of the forbiddance of cutting the hair for the one who intends to offer the sacrifice. In reality, there are very few people that are saved from committing this (sin), even some of the people of knowledge (do it)! We ask Allaah to protect us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[22] Shaikh Ad-Dihlawee said in his footnote: “Taqlees (Enjoying oneself) means beating the duff and playing when the kings arrive, in order to welcome them.” I say: He is indicating the hadeeth that has been reported by Ibn Maajah (1/391) and others with two chains of narration. In one of them is Shareek, who is Ibn ‘Abdillaah Al-Qaadee – he had bad memory. And in the other chain is found Abu Ishaaq, who is As-Subay’ee – he would mix up his narrations. At-Tahaawee weakened it in his Mushkil-ul-Athaar (2/209-210) based on two angles, so refer to it if you wish.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant you good. The questioner from Yemen, Hasan Saalih asks, &#8216;Regarding the day of &#8216;Eid, Eid al Fitr or &#8216;Eid al Adha, if it coincides with the day of al Jumu&#8217;ah, what are the legislative rulings concerning this?</p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Muhammad bin Saalih Al-‘Uthaymeen:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the &#8216;Eid coincides with al-Jumu&#8217;ah, whether it be &#8216;Eid al Fitr or Eid al Adha, then it is obligatory that the &#8216;Eid prayer is prayed and that Jumu&#8217;ah is prayed. Then it is said to whoever prayed &#8216;Eid prayer and was not the imam, if he wishes he may pray Jumu&#8217;ah or if he wishes he may pray Dhuhr in his home instead. This is the summary of the issue.</p>

<h3 align="center">The Two Festivals (Eids)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.015.069"></a>Volume 2, Book 15, Number 69:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar bought a silk cloak from the market, took it to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Take it and adorn yourself with it during the &#8216;Id and when the delegations visit you.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) replied, &#8220;This dress is for those who have no share (in the Hereafter).&#8221; After a long period Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) sent to Umar a cloak of silk brocade. Umar came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) with the cloak and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! You said that this dress was for those who had no share (in the Hereafter); yet you have sent me this cloak.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to him, &#8220;Sell it and fulfill your needs by it.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 70:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) came to my house while two girls were singing beside me the songs of Buath (a story about the war between the two tribes of the Ansar, the Khazraj and the Aus, before Islam). The Prophet (p.b.u.h) lay down and turned his face to the other side. Then Abu Bakr came and spoke to me harshly saying, &#8220;Musical instruments of Satan near the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) turned his face towards him and said, &#8220;Leave them.&#8221; When Abu Bakr became inattentive, I signalled to those girls to go out and they left. It was the day of &#8216;Id, and the Black people were playing with shields and spears; so either I requested the Prophet (p.b.u.h) or he asked me whether I would like to see the display. I replied in the affirmative. Then the Prophet (p.b.u.h) made me stand behind him and my cheek was touching his cheek and he was saying, &#8220;Carry on! O Bani Arfida,&#8221; till I got tired. The Prophet (p.b.u.h) asked me, &#8220;Are you satisfied (Is that sufficient for you)?&#8221; I replied in the affirmative and he told me to leave.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 71:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard the Prophet (p.b.u.h) delivering a Khutba saying, &#8220;The first thing to be done on this day (first day of &#8216;Id ul Adha) is to pray; and after returning from the prayer we slaughter our sacrifices (in the name of Allah) and whoever does so, he acted according to our Sunna (traditions).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 72:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr came to my house while two small Ansari girls were singing beside me the stories of the Ansar concerning the Day of Buath. And they were not singers. Abu Bakr said protestingly, &#8220;Musical instruments of Satan in the house of Allah&#8217;s Apostle !&#8221; It happened on the &#8216;Id day and Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! There is an &#8216;Id for every nation and this is our &#8216;Id.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 73:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik,:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle never proceeded (for the prayer) on the Day of &#8216;Id-ul-Fitr unless he had eaten some dates. Anas also narrated: The Prophet used to eat odd number of dates.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 74:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever slaughtered (his sacrifice) before the &#8216;Id prayer, should slaughter again.&#8221; A man stood up and said, &#8220;This is the day on which one has desire for meat,&#8221; and he mentioned something about his neighbors. It seemed that the Prophet I believed him. Then the same man added, &#8220;I have a young she-goat which is dearer to me than the meat of two sheep.&#8221; The Prophet permitted him to slaughter it as a sacrifice. I do not know whether that permission was valid only for him or for others as well.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 75:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara&#8217; bin &#8216;Azib:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet delivered the Khutba after offering the prayer on the Day of Nahr and said, &#8220;Whoever offers the prayer like us and slaughters like us then his Nusuk (sacrifice) will be accepted by Allah. And whoever slaughters his sacrifice before the &#8216;Id prayer then he has not done the sacrifice.&#8221; Abi Burda bin Niyar, the uncle of Al-Bara&#8217; said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have slaughtered my sheep before the &#8216;Id prayer and I thought today as a day of eating and drinking (not alcoholic drinks), and I liked that my sheep should be the first to be slaughtered in my house. So slaughtered my sheep and took my food before coming for the prayer.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;The sheep which you have slaughtered is just mutton (not a Nusuk).&#8221; He (Abu Burda) said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have a young she-goat which is dearer to me than two sheep. Will that be sufficient as a Nusuk on my behalf? &#8220;The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;Yes, it will be sufficient for you but it will not be sufficient (as a Nusuk) for anyone else after you.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 76:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to proceed to the Musalla on the days of Id-ul-Fitr and Id-ul-Adha; the first thing to begin with was the prayer and after that he would stand in front of the people and the people would keep sitting in their rows. Then he would preach to them, advise them and give them orders, (i.e. Khutba). And after that if he wished to send an army for an expedition, he would do so; or if he wanted to give and order, he would do so, and then depart. The people followed this tradition till I went out with Marwan, the Governor of Medina, for the prayer of Id-ul-Adha or Id-ul-Fitr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When we reached the Musalla, there was a pulpit made by Kathir bin As-Salt. Marwan wanted to get up on that pulpit before the prayer. I got hold of his clothes but he pulled them and ascended the pulpit and delivered the Khutba before the prayer. I said to him, &#8220;By Allah, you have changed (the Prophet&#8217;s tradition).&#8221; He replied, &#8220;O Abu Sa&#8217;id! Gone is that which you know.&#8221; I said, &#8220;By Allah! What I know is better than what I do not know.&#8221; Marwan said, &#8220;People do not sit to listen to our Khutba after the prayer, so I delivered the Khutba before the prayer.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 77:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to offer the prayer of &#8216;Id-ul-Adha and &#8216;Id-ul-Fitr and then deliver the Khutba after the prayer.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 78:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Juraij:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Ata&#8217; said, &#8220;Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah said, &#8216;The Prophet went out on the Day of &#8216;Id-ul-Fitr and offered the prayer before delivering the Khutba, Ata told me that during the early days of IbnAz-Zubair, Ibn Abbas had sent a message to him telling him that the Adhan for the &#8216;Id Prayer was never pronounced (in the life time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle) and the Khutba used to be delivered after the prayer. Ata told me that Ibn Abbas and Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah, had said, ú- where was no Adhan for the prayer of &#8216;7d-ul-Fitr and &#8216;Id-ul-Aqha.&#8221; &#8216;At a&#8217; said, &#8220;I heard Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah saying, &#8216;The Prophet stood up and started with the prayer, and after it he delivered the Khutba. When the Prophet of Allah (p.b.u.h) finished (the Khutba), he went to the women and preached to them, while he was leaning on Bilal&#8217;s hand. Bilal was spreading his garment and the ladies were putting alms in it.&#8217; &#8221; I said to Ata, &#8220;Do you think it incumbent upon an Imam to go to the women and preach to them after finishing the prayer and Khutba?&#8221; &#8216;Ata&#8217; said, &#8220;No doubt it is incumbent on Imams to do so, and why should they not do so?&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 79:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I offered the &#8216;Id prayer with Allah&#8217;s Apostle, Abu Bakr, Umar and &#8216;Uthman and all of them offered the prayer before delivering the Khutba.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 80:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle, Abu Bakr and Umar! used to offer the two &#8216;Id prayers before delivering the Khutba.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 81:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet offered a two Rakat prayer on the Day of Id ul Fitr and he did not pray before or after it. Then he went towards women along with Bilal and ordered them to pay alms and so they started giving their earrings and necklaces (in charity).</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 82:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara&#8217; bin &#8216;Azib:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;The first thing that we should do on this day of ours is to pray and then return to slaughter the sacrifice. So anyone who does so, he acted according to our Sunna (tradition), and whoever slaughtered the sacrifice before the prayer, it was just meat which he presented to his family and would not be considered as Nusuk.&#8221; A person from the Ansar named Abu Burda bin Niyyar said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I slaughtered the Nusuk (before the prayer) but I have a young she-goat which is better than an older sheep.&#8221; The Prophet I said, &#8220;Sacrifice it in lieu of the first, but it will be not sufficient (as a sacrifice) for anybody else after you.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 83:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said bin Jubair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was with Ibn Umar when a spear head pierced the sole of his foot and his foot stuck to the paddle of the saddle and I got down and pulled his foot out, and that happened in Mina. Al-Hajjaj got the news and came to enquire about his health and said, &#8220;Alas! If we could only know the man who wounded you!&#8221; Ibn Umar said, &#8220;You are the one who wounded me.&#8221; Al-Hajjaj said, &#8220;How is that?&#8221; Ibn Umar said, &#8220;You have allowed the arms to be carried on a day on which nobody used to carry them and you allowed arms to be carried in the Haram even though it was not allowed before.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 84:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said bin &#8216;Amr bin Said bin Al-&#8216;Aas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hajjaj went to Ibn Umar while I was present there. Al-Hajjaj asked Ibn Umar, &#8220;How are you?&#8221; Ibn Umar replied, &#8220;I am all right,&#8221; Al-Hajjaj asked, &#8220;Who wounded you?&#8221; Ibn Umar replied, &#8220;The person who allowed arms to be carried on the day on which it was forbidden to carry them (he meant Al-Hajjaj)&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 85:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet delivered the Khutba on the day of Nahr (&#8216;Id-ul-Adha) and said, &#8220;The first thing we should do on this day of ours is to pray and then return and slaughter (our sacrifices). So anyone who does so he acted according to our Sunna; and whoever slaughtered before the prayer then it was just meat that he offered to his family and would not be considered as a sacrifice in any way. My uncle Abu Burda bin Niyyar got up and said, &#8220;O, Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I slaughtered the sacrifice before the prayer but I have a young she-goat which is better than an older sheep.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Slaughter it in lieu of the first and such a goat will not be considered as a sacrifice for anybody else after you.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 86:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;No good deeds done on other days are superior to those done on these (first ten days of Dhul Hijja).&#8221; Then some companions of the Prophet said, &#8220;Not even Jihad?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Not even Jihad, except that of a man who does it by putting himself and his property in danger (for Allah&#8217;s sake) and does not return with any of those things.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 87:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Muhammad bin Abi Bakr Al-Thaqafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While we were going from Mina to &#8216;Arafat, I asked Anas bin Malik, about Talbiya, &#8220;How did you use to say Talbiya in the company of the Prophet?&#8221; Anas said: &#8220;People used to say Talbiya and their saying was not objected to and they used to say Takbir and that was not objected to either. &#8220;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 88:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Um &#8216;Atiya:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We used to be ordered to come out on the Day of &#8216;Id and even bring out the virgin girls from their houses and menstruating women so that they might stand behind the men and say Takbir along with them and invoke Allah along with them and hope for the blessings of that day and for purification from sins.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 89:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Umar: On the day of &#8216;Id-ul-Fitr and &#8216;Id-ul-Adha a spear used to be planted in front of the Prophet I (as a Sutra for the prayer) and then he would pray.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 90:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to proceed to the Musalla and an &#8216;Anaza used to be carried before him and planted in the Musalla in front of him and he would pray facing it (as a Sutra).</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 91:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Muhammad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Um &#8216;Atiyya said: &#8220;Our Prophet ordered us to come out (on &#8216;Id day) with the mature girls and the virgins staying in seclusion.&#8221; Hafsa narrated the above mentioned Hadith and added, &#8220;The mature girls or virgins staying in seclusion but the menstruating women had to keep away from the Musalla.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 92:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (in my boyhood) went out with the Prophet on the day of &#8216;Id ul Fitr or Id-ul-Adha. The Prophet prayed and then delivered the Khutba and then went towards the women, preached and advised them and ordered them to give alms.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 93:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet went towards Al-Baqi (the grave-yard at Medina) on the day of Id-ul-Adha and offered a two-Rakat prayer (of &#8216;Id-ul-Adha) and then faced us and said, &#8220;On this day of ours, our first act of worship is the offering of prayer and then we will return and slaughter the sacrifice, and whoever does this concords with our Sunna; and whoever slaughtered his sacrifice before that (i.e. before the prayer) then that was a thing which he prepared earlier for his family and it would not be considered as a Nusuk (sacrifice.)&#8221; A man stood up and said, &#8220;O, Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I slaughtered (the animal before the prayer) but I have a young she-goat which is better than an older sheep.&#8221; The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said to him, &#8220;Slaughter it. But a similar sacrifice will not be sufficient for anybody else after you.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 94:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin &#8216;Abis:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abbas was asked whether he had joined the Prophet in the &#8216;Id prayer. He said, &#8220;Yes. And I could not have joined him had I not been young. (The Prophet came out) till he reached the mark which was near the house of Kathir bin As-Salt, offered the prayer, delivered the Khutba and then went towards the women. Bilal was accompanying him. He preached to them and advised them and ordered them to give alms. I saw the women putting their ornaments with their outstretched hands into Bilal&#8217;s garment. Then the Prophet along with Bilal returned home.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 95:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Juraij:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Ata&#8217; told me that he had heard Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah saying, &#8220;The Prophet stood up to offer the prayer of the &#8216;Id ul Fitr. He first offered the prayer and then delivered the Khutba. After finishing it he got down (from the pulpit) and went towards the women and advised them while he was leaning on Bilal&#8217;s hand. Bilal was spreading out his garment where the women were putting their alms.&#8221; I asked &#8216;Ata&#8217; whether it was the Zakat of &#8216;Id ul Fitr. He said, &#8220;No, it was just alms given at that time. Some lady put her finger ring and the others would do the same.&#8221; I said, (to &#8216;Ata&#8217;), &#8220;Do you think that it is incumbent upon the Imam to give advice to the women (on &#8216;Id day)?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No doubt, it is incumbent upon the Imams to do so and why should they not do so?&#8221; Al-Hasan bin Muslim told me that Ibn Abbas had said, &#8220;I join the Prophet, Abu Bakr, Umar and &#8216;Uthman in the &#8216;Id ul Fitr prayers. They used to offer the prayer before the Khutba and then they used to deliver the Khutba afterwards. Once the Prophet I came out (for the &#8216;Id prayer) as if I were just observing him waving to the people to sit down. He, then accompanied by Bilal, came crossing the rows till he reached the women. He recited the following verse: &#8216;O Prophet! When the believing women come to you to take the oath of fealty to you . . . (to the end of the verse) (60.12).&#8217; After finishing the recitation he said, &#8220;O ladies! Are you fulfilling your covenant?&#8221; None except one woman said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Hasan did not know who was that woman. The Prophet said, &#8220;Then give alms.&#8221; Bilal spread his garment and said, &#8220;Keep on giving alms. Let my father and mother sacrifice their lives for you (ladies).&#8221; So the ladies kept on putting their Fatkhs (big rings) and other kinds of rings in Bilal&#8217;s garment.&#8221; Abdur-Razaq said, &#8221; &#8216;Fatkhs&#8217; is a big ring which used to be worn in the (Pre-lslamic) period of ignorance.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 96:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aiyub:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hafsa bint Sirin said, &#8220;On Id we used to forbid our girls to go out for &#8216;Id prayer. A lady came and stayed at the palace of Bani Khalaf and I went to her. She said, &#8216;The husband of my sister took part in twelve holy battles along with the Prophet and my sister was with her husband in six of them. My sister said that they used to nurse the sick and treat the wounded. Once she asked, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! If a woman has no veil, is there any harm if she does not come out (on &#8216;Id day)?&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;Her companion should let her share her veil with her, and the women should participate in the good deeds and in the religious gatherings of the believers.&#8217; &#8221; Hafsa added, &#8220;When Um-&#8216;Atiya came, I went to her and asked her, &#8216;Did you hear anything about so-and-so?&#8217; Um-&#8216;Atlya said, &#8216;Yes, let my father be sacrificed for the Prophet (p.b.u.h). (And whenever she mentioned the name of the Prophet she always used to say, &#8216;Let my father be&#8217; sacrificed for him). He said, &#8216;Virgin mature girls staying often screened (or said, &#8216;Mature girls and virgins staying often screened&#8211;Aiyub is not sure as which was right) and menstruating women should come out (on the &#8216;Id day). But the menstruating women should keep away from the Musalla. And all the women should participate in the good deeds and in the religious gatherings of the believers&#8217;.&#8221; Hafsa said, &#8220;On that I said to Um-&#8216;Atiya, &#8216;Also those who are menstruating?&#8217; &#8221; Um-&#8216;Atiya replied, &#8220;Yes. Do they not present themselves at &#8216;Arafat and elsewhere?&#8221;.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 97:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Um-&#8216;Atiya:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were ordered to go out (for &#8216;Id) and also to take along with us the menstruating women, mature girls and virgins staying in seclusion. (Ibn &#8216;Aun said, &#8220;Or mature virgins staying in seclusion).&#8221; The menstruating women could present themselves at the religious gathering and invocation of Muslims but should keep away from their Musalla.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 98:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (p.b.u.h) used to Nahr or slaughter sacrifices at the Musalla (on &#8216;Id-ul-Adha).</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 99:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara&#8217; bin &#8216;Azib:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the day of Nahr Allah&#8217;s Apostle delivered the Khutba after the &#8216;Id prayer and said, &#8220;Anyone who prayed like us and slaughtered the sacrifice like we did then he acted according to our (Nusuk) tradition of sacrificing, and whoever slaughtered the sacrifice before the prayer, then that was just mutton (i.e. not sacrifice).&#8221; Abu Burda bin Naiyar stood up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! By Allah, I slaughtered my sacrifice before I offered the (Id) prayer and thought that today was the day of eating and drinking (non-alcoholic drinks) and so I made haste (in slaughtering) and ate and also fed my family and neighbors.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;That was just mutton (not a sacrifice).&#8221; Then Abu Burda said, &#8220;I have a young she-goat and no doubt, it is better than two sheep. Will that be sufficient as a sacrifice for me?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Yes. But it will not be sufficient for anyone else (as a sacrifice), after you.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 100:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle .~ offered the prayer on the day of Nahr and then delivered the Khutba and ordered that whoever had slaughtered his sacrifice before the prayer should repeat it, that is, should slaughter another sacrifice. Then a person from the Ansar stood up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! because of my neighbors (he described them as being very needy or poor) I slaughtered before the prayer. I have a young she-goat which, in my opinion, is better than two sheep.&#8221; The Prophet gave him the permission for slaughtering it as a sacrifice.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 101:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jundab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the day of Nahr the Prophet offered the prayer and delivered the Khutba and then slaughtered the sacrifice and said, &#8220;Anybody who slaughtered (his sacrifice) before the prayer should slaughter another animal in lieu of it, and the one who has not yet slaughtered should slaughter the sacrifice mentioning Allah&#8217;s name on it.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 102:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the Day of &#8216;Id the Prophet used to return (after offering the &#8216;Id prayer) through a way different from that by which he went.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 103:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Urwa on the authority of &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the days of Mina, (11th, 12th, and 13th of Dhul-Hijjah) Abu Bakr came to her while two young girls were beating the tambourine and the Prophet was lying covered with his clothes. Abu Bakr scolded them and the Prophet uncovered his face and said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;Leave them, for these days are the days of &#8216;Id and the days of Mina.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha further said, &#8220;Once the Prophet was screening me and I was watching the display of black slaves in the Mosque and (&#8216;Umar) scolded them. The Prophet said, &#8216;Leave them. O Bani Arfida! (carry on), you are safe (protected)&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 15, Number 104:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet went out and offered a two Rakat prayer on the Day of &#8216;Id ul Fitr and did not offer any other prayer before or after it and at that time Bilal was accompanying him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">See <em>Fataawa Arkaan al-Islam</em> by Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy o­n him), p. 398; <em>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah</em>, 8/300-316).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Eid prayer is o­ne where the imam attends and leads the people in praying two rak’ahs. ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “The prayer of al-Fitr is two rak’ahs and the prayer of al-Adha is two rak’ahs, complete and not shortened, o­n the tongue of your Prophet, and the o­ne who fabricates lies is doomed.” Narrated by al-Nasaa’i, 1420 and Ibn Khuzaymah. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <em>Saheeh al-Nasaa’i</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was narrated that Abu Sa’eed said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to come out o­n the day of al-Fitr and al-Adha to the prayer place, and the first thing he would do was to offer the prayer. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 956</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In the first rak’ah he should say Takbeerat al-ihraam (say “Allaahu akbar” to start the prayer), after which he should say six or seven more takbeers, because of the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), “The takbeer of al-Fitr and al-Adha is seven takbeers in the first rak’ah and five takbeers in the second, apart from the takbeer of rukoo’.” Narrated by Abu Dawood and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <em>Irwa’ al-Ghaleel</em>, 639. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he should recite al-Faatihah, and recite Soorat Qaf in the first rak’ah. In the second rak’ah he should stand up saying takbeer, and when he has stood up completely he should say takbeer five times, and recite Soorat al-Faatihah then Soorat al-Qamr. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to recite these two soorahs during the two Eids. Or if he wishes he can recite Soorat al-A’la in the first rak’ah and Soorat al-Ghaashiyah in the second, because it was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to recite al-A’la and al-Ghaashiyah in the Eid prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The imam should revive the Sunnah be reciting these soorahs so that the Muslims will become familiar with the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the prayer, the imam should address the people. Part of the khutbah should be addressed specifically to the women, telling them of the things that they should do and warning them against the things that they should avoid, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to do.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">الشيخ صالح بن فوزان الفوزان</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Respected Shaykh, may Allah give you success: on the days following Eid, some people organize gatherings for women where the simple hand drum (al-duff) is used and there is dancing and singing. [The women] say these are the days of Eid and it is allowed to use al-duff, dance and sing without using [other] musical instruments; how correct is this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Brother, the day of Eid is one day, not a number of days. The days of Eid Al-Ad-ha and Eid Al-Fitr are a one day for each. The Days of Tashriq that follow the day of Eid Al-Ad-ha are not days of Eid, they are not called Days of Eid; these are the Days of Tashriq. These people [being asked about] want to revive drums, musical instruments and singing, they call them the Days of Eid. This is a lie about the Shariah; this behaviour is not allowed not for men and not for women.</p>

<a class="yt-uix-redirect-link" title="http://www.alfawzan.ws/AlFawzan/sounds.aspx?url=/AlFawzan/sounds/00076-39.ra" href="http://www.alfawzan.ws/AlFawzan/sounds.aspx?url=/AlFawzan/sounds/00076-39.ra" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.alfawzan.ws/AlFawzan/sound&#8230;</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">May Allahs benevolence be upon you, respected Shaykh, the enquirer asks: In the tape shops there are tapes where there are recordings of al-duff being played accompanied by young women / teenage girls saying nashids. Teenage girls and women listen to these tapes on Eid with the excuse that al-duff is allowed on the Day of Eid. What is the ruling on this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ruling is that this is not allowed. This [activity] teaches young women false frivolity and singing it spoils young Muslim women and makes them become silly. Accordingly, these tapes must be destroyed, they must be destroyed. Singing on Eid was not allowed by the Prophet Allahs praise and peace be upon him except for young girls; minors who were not legally liable for their actions. [They were] young girls, not females who were legally bound by Islamic law (i.e. those who had reached puberty). Women who are grown up and legally bound by the commandments of Islam are not permitted to sing or behave frivolously.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">May Allahs benevolence be upon you, respected Shaykh, this enquirer asks about a practice that has emerged in the mosques/places of prayer on Eid: the distribution of dates before Eid prayer, so that people can get the virtue (of practicing the Sunnah) of eating some dates [before Eid Al-Fitr prayer]. Is this action a Sunnah, or is it a novel introduction?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the practice of some young Muslims Allah guide them. This was not done amongst the Salaf; we do not know that they used to distribute dates at the Eid prayer place (musalla). What is confirmed from Allahs Messenger praise and peace of Allah be upon him is that he used to eat before leaving home [on Eid Al-Fitr], he would eat a few dates before leaving his house. So, whoever wants to practice the Sunnah should eat when he leaves his house not at the mosque or prayer place.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Respected Shaykh, what is the ruling on giving presents at Eid?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no harm in this. Spending more and giving more food, drink, gifts and visiting others, all of this is desired, because it involves keeping in touch with Muslims and brings about love between them. So, there is no harm in [giving gifts].</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our <strong>Shaykh ‘Ubayd al-Jaabiree</strong> (hafidhahullaah) started off by making du’a that Allaah, The Lord of The Mighty Throne complete this month for us, keep us upon the Straight Path and keep us upon rushing to do what is good and racing one another in all permissible actions for as long as we live.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Though short, the Shaykh’s talk was full of much benefit. He spoke about the virtues of the last ten of Ramadhaan and the superiority of the last ten nights in particular. He went on to mention some benefits from the tafseer of Suraat al-Qadr, encouraging us to seek out that precious night i.e Laylatul Qadr and narrated to us that due to the eminence of this night, some of the salaf would make ghusl, wear their best clothing and perfume themselves in anticipation of it</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Next he touched on some of the intricacies of Zakaatul Fitr and went on to explain the reasons for its various names. The Shaykh also addressed the important issue of giving Zakaatul Fitr in the form of money and its ruling according to the Shari&#8217;ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The lecture continued with the Shaykh explaining the matters of the etiquettes of ‘Eid and Zakaatul Fitr.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Taken from &#8220;Ad-Dawah illallaah Magazine&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is true to say that although much information has reached us about Fasting and Ramadaan &#8211; authentic or otherwise, we know very little about the etiquettes of &#8216;Eid: what we are recommended to do in this day and what is obligatory for us to do. Below is a brief list of some of the prescribed practices of &#8216;Eid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>SUNAN AL-&#8216;EID</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. It is established from the Companion Ibn &#8216;Umar, that he used to bath on the morning of &#8216;Eid. The tabi&#8217;ee, Sa&#8217;eed ibn al Musayyib said: &#8220;The sunnah of the fitr is three: walking to the Prayer ground, eating before going out and taking a bath.&#8221; [Saheeh &#8211; Al Firyaabee &amp; al-Irwaa (2/104)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. It is known that the companion Ibn &#8216;Umar would also dressed in his best clothes for the two &#8216;Eids as reported by Ibn Hajr in his Fathul-Baaree (2/439).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. It is compulsory on all adult sane Muslims to pray the &#8216;Eid prayer. The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam and his Companions never ceased doing it and he sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam commanded everyone including women, children and the elderly to attend. Even menstruating women should go to the place of congregation so that they may partake in the blessings .[Bukharee and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. It is Sunnah to eat dates before we leave for Al-&#8216;Eid prayer to show openly that we are not fasting on this day. The Prophet, sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, used not to leave for Al-Eid [al- Fitr] prayer except after eating some dates. [Reported by Anas bin Maalik &amp; collected in Saheeh al-Bukhaaree (Eng. trans. vol.2 p.40 no.73) &amp; Ahmad.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. It is Sunnah to say takbeer loudly when leaving our homes to go to &#8216;Eid prayer and repeat these till the prayer starts. [Silsilatal- Ahaadeeth-Saheehah (no 171).]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. It is preferable to pray the &#8216;Eid prayer on open ground and not at the masjid if possible. [Bukharee and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. Neither Adhaan nor Iqaamah are said for &#8216;Eid prayer. [Reported by Ibn &#8216;Abbaas and Jaabir ibn &#8216;Abdullah &amp; collected in Saheeh al- Bukhaaree (Eng. trans. vol.2 p.40)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. It is Sunnah to say the extra takbeers i.e. say &#8216;Allaahu Akbar&#8217; seven times in the first rak&#8217;ah and five times in the second. [Aboo Daawood, Ahmad &amp; others.] It is preferable to only raise the hands to the shoulders after the first takbeer and then fold them upon the chest. However, it is authentically reported from Ibn &#8216;Umar radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu that he would raise his hands with every takbeer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. It is Sunnah to take different routes to and from the prayer ground, preferably walking if possible. Jaabir reported that the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam used to come back from the &#8216;Eid prayer on a path other than the one used in going to it. [Bukharee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>WHAT TO SAY ON THE DAY OF &#8216;Eid</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam would say takbeer loudly when travelling to go to the &#8216;Eid prayer. Ahadeeth have not reached us telling us exactly what he used to say, but Ibn Abee Shayhah narrated that Ibn Mas&#8217;ood, radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu used to say the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaahu Akbar, Allaahu Akbar, Laa eelaahaa ilallaah<br />
Allaahu Akbar, Allaahu Akbar, wa lillaahil-hamd</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is Great, Allaah is Great, there is none worthy of worship except He.<br />
Allaah is Great, Allaah is Great, and to Him belongs all Praise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, who never spoke of his own desire, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Three supplications are answered: the supplication of the fasting person, the supplication of the one who is oppressed and the supplication of the traveller&#8221; . [Saheeh &#8211; Reported by al-&#8216;Uqailee in ad -Du&#8217;afaa.].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, in this month of Ramadaan, there is for you a supplication which will be answered. So seize this opportunity and call profusely upon Allaah during this month, and in particular at the time of breaking the fast (iftar), since the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam said: &#8220;Indeed there is for the fasting person when he breaks his fast, a supplication which is not rejected.&#8221; [Reported in Ibn Maajah &amp; others. Declared saheeh by al-Boosairee.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And be sure in your heart that your du&#8217;aa will be answered and know that Allaah does not respond to a heedless and inattentive heart. Call upon Him with supplications for anything good and hopefully you will attain the good of this life and the Hereafter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The number of Takbirs during Salat-ul-‘Eid is seven in the first Rak‘ah (unit of Prayer), including the opening Takbirat-ul-Ihram (saying: &#8220;Allahu Akbar [Allah is the Greatest]&#8221; upon starting the Prayer), and five in the second Rak‘ah, not including the Takbir said upon rising from Sujud (prostration) to offer the second Rak‘ah. The positions of saying Takbir: in the first Rak‘ah after Takbirat-ul-Ihram, and in the second: after the Takbir said upon standing up from Sujud for offering the second Rak‘ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">From: <a href="http://alifta.com/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Page&amp;PageID=2857&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://alifta.com/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Page&amp;PageID=2857&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=7</a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>RECOMMENDED READING</strong> – <a href="http://alifta.com/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Tree&amp;NodeID=2366&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fataawa related to Salaatul ‘Eidayn (The Two Eid Prayers)</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>What to do if ‘Eid falls on a Friday</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Question:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If ”Eid Al-/ Fitr or Eid Al-Adha fell on Friday, . In this case what should be done? Should we pray Zuhr if we dont offer the Friday prayer, or is there no requirement for it if we do not perform the Friday prayer?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Answer:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever prayed the Eid prayer on Friday, it is permitted for him not to attend the Friday prayer on that day, except for the Imam, for he is obliged to perform it for whoever wishes to attend it -be they from among those who attended the Eid prayer , or those who did not attend it . If no one attends the Friday prayer , he is relieved of its obligation and he should offer the Zhur prayer. In saying this, the scholars cite as evidence the narration of Abu Dawud in his Sunan, on the authority of Iyyas bin Abi Ramlah Ash-Shami, who said : I witnessed Mu’awiyyah bin Abi Sufyan, may Allah be pleased with him , asking Zaid bin Arqam: Did you witness two Eids falling on the same day with the Messenger of Allah sallallahu alayhe was salaam ? He said : Yes . He asked : ” And what did he do ? He replied : ” He offered the Eid prayer , then he gave permission for those who wished, to perform the Friday prayer , saying : <strong>Whoever wants to pray, then let him pray</strong> . (Abu Dawud no . 1070)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also cited as evidence is the narration of Abu Dawud in his Sunan, on the authority of Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him, from the Messenger of Allah sallallahu alayhe was salaam , which states that he said : <strong>Two Eids have fallen on this day, so whoever wished, it will suffice him instead of the Friday prayer; and we are offering the Friday prayer</strong>.( Abu Dawud no 1074)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This proves that it is allowed on Fridays for those who have attended the Eid prayer not to perform the Friday prayer , but that the Imam is not excused, because he sallallahu alayhe was salaam said : <strong>And we are offering the Friday prayer</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also cited as evidence is the narration of Muslim, on the authority of An-Nu’man bin Bashir, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Prophet sallallahu alayhe was salaam used to recite Surah Al-A’la and Surah Al-Ghashiyah in the Eid prayers and the Friday prayers and he might have prayed both of them one day and recited them in both prayers ( Muslim no 878) So whoever does not attend the Friday prayer from among those who have prayed the Eid prayer, he must pray it as Zhur , in accordance with the evidences which prove that it is obligatory to offer the Zhur prayer for those who do not attend the Friday Prayer .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And may peace and blessings be upon our Prophet, Muhammad and upon his family and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align:center;">Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Quotes from the Book:</strong> “If we assume that the Prophet’s Masjid wasn’t big enough for them, then surely they would have been able to pray in these other masaajid that existed (at the Prophet’s time), as the people do today. So their abandoning praying in these masaajid in favor of praying in the musallaa is a clear proof that the Sunnah is praying in the musallaa and not in the masjid. So the actual intent has been established and what they desired from negating (of this Sunnah) has been annulled.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So let’s say if we were to agree with them that the Prophet’s masjid was not big enough for the men and women, then this is the same case with our present-day masaajid in that not one of them is capable of holding all of those intending prayer. So what remains valid is the legality of going out to perform the prayer in the musallaa. This is the required outcome (from that argument). Furthermore, if according to them<span style="background-color:#ccccff;"> it is not correct for the menstruating women to attend the masjid, then this is an acknowledgement on their part that it is correct for them to attend the musallaa. So when they require that the ’Eid Prayer be performed in the masaajid, then this means that they are preventing these (menstruating) women from </span><strong>‘witnessing the good and the supplication of the Muslims!’</strong> This is contrary to the command of Allaah’s Messenger found in the hadeeth, which they attributed to Al-Bukhaaree, for the hadeeth is one of our proofs that indicate that the ‘Eid Prayer should be held in the musallaa and not in the masjid. This is because the masjid, no matter how big it is, is incapable of accommodating the attendance of all of the men and women in it, according to their own acknowledgement.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“What further supports what we have stated above is that: If praying the two ‘Eids in the masjid were better than praying them in the musallaa, but the masjid was too small, the Prophet would have taken the necessary steps to expand it, just as some of the Khaleefahs after him did, for he has more right to expand it than them. So if the masjid wasn’t ample enough for it, but yet the Prophet left off expanding it, it is not possible to imagine this (i.e. that the masjid wasn’t ample enough), along with the view that praying in the masjid is superior to the musallaa. This is unless someone claims that there was something that prevented him from expanding it. But I don’t think a person of knowledge would have the nerve to make such a claim.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Muslims today, with regard to this prayer, have split up into numerous jamaa’aat (congregations), in contradiction to the Sunnah, as has been stated previously. So when we desire to unite them into one congregation, then there is no way possible for us to do this unless we go out to the open area of land, which is ample enough to accommodate all of those praying – both men and women. They can take this land as a musallaa, wherein they can perform this great act of worship [the ‘Eid Prayer]. This is what the Sunnah orders. So how can it be said after this: “Implementing this Sunnah will cause division to the Jamaa’ah?!” Yes. Indeed from the things in which there is no doubt is that reviving this Sunnah requires the creation of a new jamaa’ah (congregation), which will be separate from those other jamaa’aat (congregations) that are divided up in several masaajid. However, since the goal of this new jamaa’ah is to gather together those other jamaa’aat into one unified congregation, as the way it used to be during the time of Allaah’s Messenger and his rightly-guided Khaleefahs, there must exist this Jamaa’ah. This is since the one unified Jamaa’ah will never be established in a single bound, and it will never be established unless through them (i.e. those who break away and pray in the musallaa).”</p>
