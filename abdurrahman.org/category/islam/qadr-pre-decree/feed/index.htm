<p><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory to have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in pre-ordainment and pre-decree. And that everything which occurs in this creation then it does not occur by chance randomly. Rather, it is something which has been decreed and written in the preserved tablet; <em>Al-Law<u>h</u> Al-Ma<u>h</u>fu<u>dh</u></em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, knew it and He wrote it in the preserved tablet then He ordained it. Then He created it and He brought it into existence and willed it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nothing is found in this creation without its having been preceded by Allaah’s pre-ordainment and pre-decree. <strong>Everything</strong> has been pre-ordained and from that is good and evil. The good which occurs to mankind is by the pre-ordainment and pre-decree of Allaah. And the evil which occurs for them then it is by the pre-ordainment of Allaah and His pre-decree. And disbelief &amp; true faith and sickness &amp; health and hunger &amp; being full and wealth &amp; poverty; all of this is by the pre-ordainment and pre-decree of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">From the fundamentals of <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) and from the pillars of <em>eemaan</em> is to have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in pre-ordainment and pre-decree. And al-Qadaa w’al Qadr (pre-ordainment and pre-decree) refers to the events that will occur that Allaah has pre-decreed and pre-ordained since eternity. And everything which occurs then it does not happen by chance, randomly or without having been pre-decreed by Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. Rather, Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, knew whatever was, whatever has been in the past and whatever will be in the future. Then He wrote that in <em>al-Law<u>h</u> al-Ma<u>h</u>fudh</em> (preserved tablet). The saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The first thing that Allaah created was the pen. He said to it, “Write whatever is going to occur until the Day of Resurrection&#8221;. So, the pen wrote whatever was going to occur until the Day of Resurrection.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the creation of the pen was before the creation of the heavens and the earth by fifty-thousand years and the Throne of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, was upon the water.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, here there has been a problematic point for the scholars, was the throne created before the pen or was the pen created before the `<em>Arsh</em> (Throne)? And what is correct is that the `<em>Arsh</em> (throne) was created before the pen<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> because at the time when Allaah created the pen and commanded it to write whatever it was going to be then His throne was upon the water and this is why the <em>Allaamah</em>; the great scholar Ibn ul-Qayyim <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah </em>said:<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><em>“And the people differ with regard to the pen with which the decreed matters were written by the Great Recompense r(Ad-Dayyaan), Allaah, the Most High, </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><em>Was it before the Throne or after it?</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><em>There are two sayings mentioned by Aboo `Alaa al-Hamathaanee,</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><em>And the truth is that the Throne was before because it was there before the writing, </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><em>Before the writing, it stood upon its supports, </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><em>And the writing of the honourable pen came afterwards,</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><em>After it was brought into existence without any time between.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And speech with regard to pre-decree has already preceded. However, what is intended now is the <strong>prohibition of delving into it.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And speech and argumentation and disputing with regard to <em>Qadr </em>(pre-decree) is specifically forbidden,” </strong></span>We already have known that <em>eemaan</em> in pre-decree and pre-ordainment with its levels is a pillar from the pillars of <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, whoever does not believe in pre-decree and preordainment, he is not a <em>mu&#8217;min</em> (believer) because he has denied a pillar from the pillars of <em>eemaan</em>. And likewise, it is not permissible to argue about pre-decree and pre-ordainment to say <span style="color:#800080;">&#8220;Why will Allaah punish like that? Why does Allaah do such and such?&#8221;</span> as has preceded. It cannot be said why and how? So, no objections, no queries are to be made with regard to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. And you are not to enter into pre-ordainment and pre-decree with argumentation for you will not reach any <em>nateejah</em> (result or conclusion).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is upon you is to submit and to have <em>eemaan</em> and that you do not enter into any affair from the affairs of Allaah. This (pre-decree)  will not be known except by Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, and you will not reach any results and therefore it is said, “<strong>Pre-decree is Allaah’s secret.</strong>”<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah’s secret cannot be reached and cannot be encompassed so therefore don’t try to enter into it. It is upon you to have <em>eemaan</em> (believe) in whatever occurs in the texts of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah and that you stop at that. And that you turn your attention to performing righteous deeds and to leaving off sins and acts of disobedience and that you do not say, <span style="color:#808080;">“If Allaah has decreed for me that I am from the People of Paradise then I’ll be from the People of Paradise even if I don’t do any action and if Allaah has decreed for me that I am to be from the People of the Fire then I’ll certainly be from the People of the Fire.”</span> So this is false and futile speech, he should not say the like of that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is not permissible to enter into these affairs because this is not the business of the servant, this is Allaah’s affair. Your business is to act, this is what is required from you. As for entering into pre-ordainment and pre-decree then it is to enter into a maze or a labyrinth from which the servant will never emerge.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“This is prohibited with all of the sects because the pre-decree is Allaah’s secret,” </strong></span>With all nations because pre-decree is the secret of Allaah and a secret cannot be encompassed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Majestic and Most High says:</p>
<p><strong>وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلَّا بِمَا شَاءَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they cannot encompass anything from Allaah’s knowledge except what He wishes. </strong></span>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah</em> 255)</p>
<p><strong> وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِهِ عِلْمًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they cannot encompass Allaah with their knowledge.</span><br />
</strong><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Soorah </span><u style="font-size:1rem;">T</u><span style="font-size:1rem;">aa Haa (20), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah </em><span style="font-size:1rem;">110)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not try to enter into the affairs of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, stick to your own affairs, stick to righteous deeds and leaving off sins and performing repentance from them, set your own record in order whilst you are still alive, occupy yourself with yourself. As for occupying yourself with pre-decree and pre-ordainment and &#8220;<em>why did such and such occur</em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em>If Allaah has decreed all things then  in that case I don’t need to act</em>&#8220;. All of this is false and futile speech, there is no value to it and when the companions said to the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Should we not just rely upon what has been decreed for us? He said, “Rather act for everyone will have that which he was created for made easy for him.&#8221; </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, sent down:</p>
<p><strong>إِنَّ سَعْيَكُمْ لَشَتَّىٰ &#8211; 92:4</strong></p>
<p><strong>فَأَمَّا مَنْ أَعْطَىٰ وَاتَّقَىٰ &#8211; 92:5</strong></p>
<p><strong>وَصَدَّقَ بِالْحُسْنَىٰ &#8211; 92:6</strong></p>
<p><strong>فَسَنُيَسِّرُهُ لِلْيُسْرَىٰ &#8211; 92:7</strong></p>
<p><strong>وَأَمَّا مَن بَخِلَ وَاسْتَغْنَىٰ &#8211; 92:8</strong></p>
<p><strong>وَكَذَّبَ بِالْحُسْنَىٰ &#8211; 92:9</strong></p>
<p><strong>فَسَنُيَسِّرُهُ لِلْعُسْرَىٰ &#8211; 92:10</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Your deeds are diverse so as for the one who gives in charity and is dutiful to Allaah and believes in Allaah’s reward then We will make easy for him acts which are pleasing to Allaah. And as for the one who is miserly and thinks himself to be self-sufficient and denies Allaah’s reward then We will make easy for Him actions, which Allaah hates</strong>.<strong>”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8] </a>(Sooratul-Layl (92), <em>aayah </em>4-10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So you should carry out the <em>sabab</em> (means), either for the salvation of your own soul or for its destruction by your actions, which you perform by your own choice and your own will. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“All the people go out in the morning and the person then either sets his soul free or he destroys it.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And, the Lord, the Majestic, the Most High, forbade the prophets from speech with regard to pre-decree,”</span> </strong>Allaah forbade the creation; the prophets and other than them from speaking about pre-decree. And it is not mentioned from the prophets that they ever raised any objection to pre-decree because they knew the tremendousness of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, and His wisdom and they submitted and they adopted correct manners with respect to Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, and they had not used to ask about anything, which did not contain a point of welfare for them or a benefit, so the prophets would not ask about it. Likewise, the followers of the prophets would never ask about it. Rather, the prophets and their followers used to turn themselves towards action and give attention to it. They did not used to ask about pre-decree and pre-ordainment except from the aspect of belief and having <em>eemaan</em> in it. And having <em>eemaan</em> in pre-decree and pre-ordainment, if you have <em>eemaan</em> in it, it renders you at peace from doubts and from false ideas and from grief. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“You should know that whatever befalls you was never going to miss you and whatever misses you was never going to befall you.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So do not say: “If only I had done such and such then such and such would have been the case but rather, you should say, “<em>Qadr Allaah wa maa shaa·a fa`al</em> (it was the decree of Allaah and whatever He wishes He does.)”<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> forbade disputing about pre-decree and the companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam;</em> <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhum,</em> they detested it and the <em>taabi`een</em>, they detested it and the scholars and the people of piety detested it, arguing about pre-decree.” </strong></span>When the Qadariyyah (those people who denied pre-decree) appeared at the end of the time of the companions, the companions strongly rebuked and refuted them and warned against them and made it clear that a servant, what is upon him is to have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) that whatever befalls him was not going to miss him and whatever misses him was never going to come to him and that whoever does not believe this then Allaah will burn Him in the Fire.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a> So upon this, their sayings were united when the sect of the Qadariyyah appeared in their time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So upon you is to submit and to affirm and to have <em>eemaan</em>,”</strong></span> this is what is obligatory upon you with regard to pre-decree and pre-ordainment; submission to the pre-ordainment of Allaah and His pre-decree and not to raise objections to it and that you believe as your `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) that Allaah does not do anything except for a wise purpose and that He does not punish anyone except on account of his deeds. So, any deficiencies are from you so instead of blaming pre-decree, you should blame yourself and you should repent to Allaah. So, no-one can prevent repentance (<em>tawbah)</em> and Allaah accepts repentance from those who repent. So, why do you then occupy yourself with something, which will have no benefit for you? So, upon you is to submit and to yield and comply and not to enter into that which is not your concern, There occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> that he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“From the excellence of a person’s Islaam is that he leaves off that which is not his concern.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And believing whatever Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said about all matters and be silent about whatever is besides that,” </strong></span>Meaning believe whatever the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said, the one who does not speak from his own desires and do not make accusations against the a<u>h</u>aadeeth or raise doubts about them. As long as they are established from the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> then they are not an arena for hesitation.</p>
<p><strong>فَلَا وَرَبِّكَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ حَتَّىٰ يُحَكِّمُوكَ فِيمَا شَجَرَ بَيْنَهُمْ ثُمَّ لَا يَجِدُوا فِي أَنفُسِهِمْ حَرَجًا مِّمَّا قَضَيْتَ وَيُسَلِّمُوا تَسْلِيمًا &#8211;</strong> 4:65</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So know by your Lord they will not be believers until they make you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Muhammad</span><span style="color:#008000;"><em><u> s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam)</em></span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> judge in whatever disputes occur between them then they do not find any difficulty in themselves from the judgement you have passed, rather they accept with full submission.</span>  </strong>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), <em>aayah </em>65)</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا كَانَ لِمُؤْمِنٍ وَلَا مُؤْمِنَةٍ إِذَا قَضَى اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ أَمْرًا أَن يَكُونَ لَهُمُ الْخِيَرَةُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِمْ ۗ وَمَن يَعْصِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلَالًا مُّبِينًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And it is not right for any believing man or any believing woman that when Allaah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they have any other choice in their affair and whoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger then he has strayed far away.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-A<u>h</u>zaab (33), <em>aayah </em>36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the like of these <em>aayahs</em>. So, what is obligatory upon you is to follow and to submit and to yield and comply. With regard to matters; meaning in all matters, the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> conveyed from Allaah everything, which the people need from the matters in their religion and he made it clear and Allaah completed the religion through him and there is no good except that he guided his nation to it and there is no evil except that he warned them from it and he left them upon the clear white path, its night is just the same as its day, no-one strays away from it except one who is destroyed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And stay silent upon whatever is other than that.”</span> </strong>This is just as has occurred in the <u>h</u>adeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Allaah has made certain duties obligatory upon you so do not neglect them and He has made certain things forbidden for you so do not commit them and He has remained silent about some things as a mercy upon you, not forgetting so do not ask about them.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should not ask about anything except something which you need in your religion or your worldly life. And from the excellence of a person’s Islaam is his leaving off that which is not his concern. As for that which you do not have need of then asking about it is from the superfluous matters; extra unnecessary matters :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> forbade qeel wa qaal </strong>(loose conveying of useless speech) <strong>and asking too much and wasting wealth.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So your questions should be in accordance with the level of your need and do not ask about that which you do not have a need of.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Translator’s side point: In some wordings; <strong>“He whose name is Majestic” </strong>or in some of the narrations; <strong>“The Exalted and Most High.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Reported by Aboo Daawood in his <em>Sunan </em>and by a list of others; Imaam A<u>h</u>mad, at-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee and by others besides.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s side point: This <u>h</u>adeeth is declared <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (authentic) by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy and it’s a narration of the companion `Ubaadah ibn as-<u>S</u>aamit <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> That’s also been taken from the authentic <u>h</u>adeeth where they mention in a footnote that Muslim reported in his <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> from `Abdullaah ibn `Amr ibn al-Aa<u>s</u> <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa </em>who said that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Allaah, the Most High, wrote the pre-decreed measures of all the created things fifty-thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth and His `Arsh (Throne) was upon the water.”</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> This is the saying of the majority of the scholars and you can refer to the book <em>Bughyat ul-Murtaad</em> of Shaykh ul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah and likewise <em>al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah</em> of al-<u>H</u>aafidh ibn-Katheer, (right at the start of <em>al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah</em>) and in that reference al-Haafidh ibn-Katheer mentions that, “The saying that the pen was created first was the saying of some people and he mentioned it was the saying of the famous <em>mufassir</em>; Ibn Jareer a<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>abariyy and it was the saying of Ibn al- Jawzee and others besides them and as for the saying that the Throne was created first then the pen then this as he mentioned is the saying of the majority of the scholars, <em>W`Allaahu A`lam</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> From the famous scholars of these days who said that the Throne was created first before the pen was Shaykh ibn `Uthaymeen <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> and from those scholars who said that the pen was created before the Throne then Shaykh al-Albaaniyy <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>. Then there is some difference amongst the people of the Sunnah with regard to which of those two were created first <em>Allaahu A`lam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5">[5]</a> From the famous poem <em>Nooniyyah</em> of Ibn ul-Qayyim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref6" name="_ftn6">[6]</a> Ibn `Abdul Barr said in his book <em>al-Istidhkaar</em>, “The scholars said and the wise people from olden times said, “Pre-decree is Allaah’s secret thing so do not look into it.””</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref7" name="_ftn7">[7]</a> <strong>Translator&#8217;s Side Point:</strong> Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> in his explanation something that is very commonly brought by people with regard to pre-decree,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">“The intellect may say &#8211; &#8220;Allaah has decreed all the decrees of the creation and He has made some of the people; People of Bliss (People of Paradise) and some of them wretched people; People of the Fire. So, the wretched people are therefore not able to be People of Bliss&#8221;, then the intellect becomes bewildered. Therefore, it is obligatory to withhold and to have <em>eemaan</em> that Allaah does not oppress anyone from His creation and He does not punish anyone from them except with the proof being established.<em> </em></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref11" name="_ftn11">[11]</a>Taken directly from the <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The strong believer is better and  more beloved to Allaah than the weak believer and there is good in all of them, be eager upon that which can benefit you and seek the aid of Allaah and don’t be incapable and if something befalls you then do not say if only I had done such and such then such and such would’ve happened but rather you should say, Qadr Allaah, it was the decree of Allaah and whatever He wishes He does because saying ‘if only’, this opens up the door to the action of Satan.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Muslim (2,664).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref12" name="_ftn12">[12]</a> From `Abdullaah ibn Fayrooz ad-Daylami who said, “Something occurred in myself regarding this matter of pre-decree and I feared that it would corrupt for me my religion and my affair so therefore, I went to Ubayy ibn Ka`b and I said, <em>‘O Aboo Mundhir, something has occurred in myself with regard to this matter of pre-decree so I feared for my religion and my affair, so tell me something about that so that hopefully Allaah will benefit me through it.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he said, <em>‘If Allaah were to punish all the inhabitants of the heavens and the people of His earth then He would be punishing them and He would not be being unjust to them. And if He were to be merciful to them then His mercy would be better for them than their deeds.

And there will be nothing wrong for you to go to my brother `Abdullaah ibn Mas`ood and ask him.’</em><em style="font-size:1rem;"> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, ‘So, I went to `Abdullaah and I asked him so he mentioned the like of what was mentioned by Ubayy and he said to me’, <em>‘There will be no harm if you go to <u>H</u>u<u>t</u>hayfah.’</em><em style="font-size:1rem;"> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I went to <u>H</u>u<u>t</u>hayfah and I asked him so he said the same as the two of them had said and he said,<em> “Go to Zayd ibn Thaabit and ask him.’ </em>So I went to Zayd ibn Thaabit and I asked him so he said,<em> ‘I heard Allaah’s Messenger <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam say</em>:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> There is some speech with regard to the scholars about the authenticity of this <u>h</u>adeeth, some of them don’t accept the <u>h</u>adeeth being authentic from the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and as for Shaykh al-Albaaniyy <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> then he declared the <u>h</u>adeeth <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> in his checking of Tirmithee, <u>h</u>adeeth being <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam,</em> <em>W`Allaahu A`lam</em>.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 39 : Points 57-58</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[57] And you should know that whatever befalls you was never going to miss you and whatever missed you was never going to come to you.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[58] And there is no creator along with Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F377740142&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/know-that-whatever-befalls-you-was-never-going-to-miss-you" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the text of the <u>h</u>adeeth just as the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said to Ibn Abbaas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“And know that whatever befalls you was not going to miss you and whatever comes to you was never going to miss you.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whatever strikes you was never going to miss you; whatever misses you was never going to come to you. Even if you eagerly sought after it and want it but it missed you then you should know that Allaah did not decree it for you and whatever came upon you was never going to miss you. So, do not say, “If only I had done such and such this wouldn’t have befallen me.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying <strong>“And there is no creator along with Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic,” </strong>this follows on from the levels of preordainment and predecree. It contains a refutation of whoever says that the person creates his own actions. So, Allaah, He is the one Who is alone in creating, He, the Majestic and Most High. No-one can create along with Him. So, it is all from the creation of Allaah alone, He, the Perfect and Most High. And therefore, He, the Majestic and Most High says:</p>
<p><strong>قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُم مَّا تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَرُونِي مَاذَا خَلَقُوا مِنَ الْأَرْضِ أَمْ لَهُمْ شِرْكٌ فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ ۖ ائْتُونِي بِكِتَابٍ مِّن قَبْلِ هَٰذَا أَوْ أَثَارَةٍ مِّنْ عِلْمٍ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “Do you see whatever you invoke besides Allaah, show me what they have created in the earth or do they have any share with Allaah in the heavens? Bring me any scripture, which came from Allaah before this Qur&#8217;aan, which states this or any remnant of knowledge, which proves it, if you are truthful.”</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Ahqaaf (46), <em>aayah </em>4)</p>
<p><strong>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ لَن يَخْلُقُوا ذُبَابًا وَلَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا لَهُ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Those whom they worship besides Allaah can never create even a fly even if they all gather together to do it.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Hajj (22), <em>aayah </em>73)</p>
<p><strong>أَمْ جَعَلُوا لِلَّهِ شُرَكَاءَ خَلَقُوا كَخَلْقِهِ فَتَشَابَهَ الْخَلْقُ عَلَيْهِمْ ۚ قُلِ اللَّهُ خَالِقُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَهُوَ الْوَاحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Or do they set up partners for Allaah who can create just as He creates such that the creation is confused for them. Say, Allaah is the Creator of everything and He is the one, All-Powerful Subduer.</span> </strong>(Sooratur-Ra`ad (13), <em>aayah </em>16)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore, Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, described those who make images in His saying: (as part of Hadeeth Qudsi)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“So who is a greater wrong-doer than someone who tries to create like My creation.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning that he tries to produce the outward form of that which Allaah has created.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of the narration mentions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“.. let them then create a single grain of corn or let them create a single barley corn.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or in one narration:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“.. or let them create the tiniest ant.” </strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No-one is able to do this and if someone is able to fashion the outward form (<em><u>s</u>oorah),</em> he is not able to produce life in it. The life is from the creation of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, no-one is able to do it even if he can make a precise image and form or something, he is not able to breathe a soul into it and to put life into it. This is the creation of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High and therefore, it would be said to those people who make images on the Day of Resurrection:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Give life to that which you created.” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In order to manifest their inability and as a punishment for them.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 39 : Points 54-56</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[54] And to have patience with the judgement of Allaah. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[55] And to have <em>eemaan</em> in all the decrees of Allaah, the good and the bad, the sweet and the bitter. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[56] Aand to have <em>eemaan</em> in whatever Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, has said. Allaah knew whatever the servants were going to do and where they were heading to, they do not escape from the knowledge of Allaah and there is nothing in the earth or in the heavens except that which is known by Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A mention of this has already preceded at the beginning of the levels of <em>eemaan</em> in <em>Al-Qa<u>d</u>aa W’al Qadr</em> (preordainment and predecree). And using predecree and preordainment as an evidence when calamities strike, which a person <strong>does not have a choice about</strong>, is something praiseworthy because this shows his being satisfied and his submitting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَبَشِّرِ الصَّابِرِينَ</strong> &#8211; 2:155</p>
<p><strong>الَّذِينَ إِذَا أَصَابَتْهُم مُّصِيبَةٌ قَالُوا إِنَّا لِلَّهِ وَإِنَّا إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُونَ</strong> &#8211; 2:156</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And give glad tidings to those who have patience, those who when they are struck by calamity, they say “Indeed we belong to Allaah and to Him we shall return.” </strong></span>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah</em> 155-156)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for using predecree and preordainment as a proof for <strong>evil deeds</strong>, which they <strong>commit and do by choice</strong> then they have no argument in predecree for that. Rather, they are punished for their deeds and they are falling short and the gate to repentance is open instead of arguing with Allaah saying: “Why did You decree this upon me?” while you have abandoned the repentance. This is from blameworthy inabilities. Rather, hasten to repentance and seek forgiveness and blame yourself. So, this is what is required from the servant that he should look at his own deeds.</p>
<p><strong> وَلْتَنظُرْ نَفْسٌ مَّا قَدَّمَتْ لِغَدٍ ۖ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ</strong> &#8211; 59:18</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And let each soul look and see what deeds it puts forward for the Day of Judgement.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Hashr (59), <em>aayah</em> 18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look at your deeds, it is possible for you to change them and to repent from them and to seek forgiveness. As for preordainment and predecree then that is the affair for Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, it is not your matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And they will not exit from the Knowledge of Allaah,” </strong>everything Allaah has full knowledge of it and He, the Perfect and Most High fully encompasses it. He knows the disbelief of the disbeliever and the sin of the sinful person and the oppression of the oppressor. It is not hidden from Him. He knows the obedience of the obedient person and the actions of the obedient person. He knows this and that. However, He gives them some respite, gives them some time perhaps they will repent, perhaps they will return back. So if they repent, well and good otherwise in front of them is the reckoning; the <em>hisaab</em>. So, Allaah does not neglect them at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And there is not in the earth nor in the heavens except that which is known by Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic,” </strong>this is just as has preceded, everything is known by Allaah, whatever was in the past and whatever will be in the future, all of it Allaah has encompassed it with His Knowledge, nothing whatsoever is hidden from Him, He, the Perfect and Most High. He knew it and He decreed it and He wrote it and He wished it and willed it and He created it.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lessons 38 : Point 53</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to be pleased and satisfied with the decree of Allaah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F377268440&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/to-be-pleased-and-satisfied-with-the-decree-of-allaah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in <em>al-Qa<u>d</u>aa w’al Qadr</em> (Allaah’s preordainment and predecree). This is a <em>rukn</em> (pillar) from the six pillars of <em>eemaan</em>, which are mentioned by Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">You have eemaan (true faith) in Allaah, and in His angels, and His books, and in His Messengers, the Last Day and that you have true faith in al-Qadr (predecree), the good of it and the bad of it</span><em>.</em></strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is that you believe that Allaah has preordained all things and predecreed them always and He, the Perfect and Most High, has written them in the preserved tablet and He created it and brought it into existence by His wish, He, the Perfect and Most High. And having <em>eemaan</em> in predecree and preordainment covers <strong>FOUR</strong> levels:</p>
<p><strong>The First Level:</strong> Level of <em>al-`ilm</em> (knowledge), which is that Allaah knew by His Eternal Knowledge all things before they came into existence.</p>
<p><strong>The Second Level:</strong> To have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) that Allaah wrote all things down in the preserved tablet before they existed. He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>مَا أَصَابَ مِن مُّصِيبَةٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَلَا فِي أَنفُسِكُمْ إِلَّا فِي كِتَابٍ مِّن قَبْلِ أَن نَّبْرَأَهَا ۚ إِنَّ ذَٰلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ &#8211; 57:22</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>No calamity befalls upon the earth nor in yourselves except that it was written in a book before We brought it about. Indeed that is easy for Allaah. </strong></span>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>adeed (57), <em>aayah </em>22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Third Level: </strong>To have <em>`eemaan</em> (true faith) that Allaah willed and wished these newly occurring events. Disbelief and true faith, obedience and disobedience, righteousness and wickedness, good and evil; all of that was willed and wished by Allaah, by His will relating to the creation, His <em>Iraadah al-Kowniyyah</em>. So, nothing occurs within His Sovereignty except that which He wills. However, He willed the good and He willed `<em>eemaan</em> and He willed evil for a <em><u>h</u>ikmah</em> (wise) purpose as a trial and as a test. So, Allaah willed that which is good and He loves it and is pleased with it and He willed that which is evil but He does not love it and He is not pleased with it. However, He willed it to occur for a wise purpose and in order to test and to try. And if there nothing except good then there would be no distinction for anybody and there would be no test and no trial, all of the people would be people of good. And if there were nothing except evil then there would be no distinction for anyone in performing righteous deeds. So, this gives the result that Allaah tries the servant to make clear the good from the foul and the believer from the disbeliever and it is a trial and a test, which He, the Perfect and Most High brings about for them and He did not create these things without purpose.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>The Fourth Level:</strong><em> Al-Khalq w’al eejaad</em> (creation and bringing into existence); whatever happens Allaah is the one who created it and brought it into existence. And everything that occurs then Allaah is its Creator. And the actions of the people are created by Allaah and they are actions done by the servant. Allaah, the Majestic and Most High says:</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>اللَّهُ خَالِقُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ ۖ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَكِيلٌ</strong> &#8211; 39:62</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah is the Creator of everything and He is the Trustworthy Disposer of all affairs.</span> </strong>(Sooratuz-Zumar (39), <em>aayah </em>62)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Perfect and Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <strong>وَهُوَ الْخَلَّاقُ الْعَلِيمُ</strong> &#8211; 36:81</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He, Allaah is the All-Knowing Creator Who creates repeatedly.<br />
</strong></span>(Soorah Yaaseen (36), <em>aayah </em>81)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَاللَّهُ خَلَقَكُمْ وَمَا تَعْمَلُونَ</strong> &#8211; 37:96</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And Allaah created you and whatever deeds you do.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratu<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>aafaat (37), <em>aayah </em>96)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, they are things created by Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, meaning people’s deeds, good or evil and they are actions done by the servants and things earned by the servants by their own choice and will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the true believer believes in these four levels; (1) <em>al-`ilm, (2) w’al kitaabah, (3) w’al mashee&#8217;ah w’al iraadah, (4) al-khalq w’al eejaad.</em>These four levels with regard to predecree, the believer believes in them; the level of knowledge, the level of writing and the level of wish and will and the level of creation and bringing into existence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>And the believer is pleased and satisfied with predecree and preordainment. When calamities occur, he does not become annoyed and does not become vexed. He withholds himself from annoyance and he withholds his tongue from complaining to other than Allaah and he withholds his hand from striking the cheeks and tearing the openings of the garment. So this is being pleased and satisfied with the preordainment and predecree</strong>.</span> And it is that you know that whatever befalls you was never going to miss you and whatever misses you was never going to happen to you just as the Prophet said, and `<em>eemaan</em> will not be completed except with this.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Muslim (Hadith No.8) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of `Umar ibn al-Khattaab <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu </em>and this is a part of the famous <u>h</u>adeeth of Jibreel where Jibreel `alayhissalaam came to the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in the form of a man and asked him about `<em>eemaan</em> and <em>Islaam</em> and <em>I<u>h</u>saan</em> and the signs of the Hour, this was the answer the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> gave when he was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“What is `eemaan? And he replied that it is that your truly believe in Allaah and in His angels and in His Books and in His Messengers and in the Last Day and that you truly believe in predecree; the good of it and the bad of it.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Part of the famous <u>h</u>adeeth, reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad in the <em>Musnad</em> and Aboo Daawood in his <em>Sunan</em> and Ibn Maajah in his <em>Sunan</em> from a <u>h</u>adeeth of `Ubaadah ibn a<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>aamit <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>. Declared authentic by Ibn <u>H</u>ibbaan by Shaykh al-Islaam Muhammad ibn `Abdul Wahhaab in his book At-Taw<u>h</u>eed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Also declared <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (authentic) by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy likewise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad An-Najmee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said, </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Being pleased and satisfied with that which Allaah has decreed should occur&#8221; &#8211; This is a tremendous level and what is meant by &#8216;<em>what is ordained should occur</em>&#8216; here? It is that it means which a person has no actions himself in bringing about such as illness and health, being rich or being poor and death and all of the calamities that occur, that which strike the person.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the people are divided into <strong>two categories</strong> with regard to them or it is to be said the servant here, there are two states that he can have in this case; one of them is higher than the other:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>The first of them is <em>ar-ri<u>d</u>aa</em></strong> (being pleased and satisfied) with that and it is the highest condition such that he is pleased whatever Allaah has decreed to occur, Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic and whatever provision He has given you a share of and with whatever calamities He has preordained for you. So, being pleased and satisfied with these decrees, which strike the servant from Allaah these are things, which come purely from His decree. Neither the person himself nor anyone else can repel them and being pleased with these decrees is a tremendous level and it is an honourable state of the soul such that the servant is hoping for the reward that will come about as a result of the calamity after it strikes him such that if he were to be given a choice between receiving the reward for it or that calamity not occurring he would choose the reward instead. You have the first and the highest level.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>So if he is not from the people of <em>ri<u>d</u>aa</em>, those who are actually pleased with it then at least let him be from the <strong>People of <em><u>S</u>abr</em> (have patience)</strong> upon it. This is the 2<sup>nd </sup> level So, he still has patience when that is decreed to happen to him. So, he bears it hoping for reward for it and in submission to the decree and the ordainment, Allah, the Mighty and Majestic said:</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> وَالضَّرَّاءِ وَحِينَ الْبَأْسِ ۗ أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ صَدَقُوا ۖ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُتَّقُونَ &#8211; 2:177</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Those believers who have patience upon extreme poverty and illnesses and at the time of fighting. They are the ones who are true and they are the ones who are dutiful to Allaah.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>177)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth:<strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“If Allaah loves a people, He puts them to trial. Whoever is pleased, then Allaah’s pleasure is for him and whoever is angry then there is anger for him.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah is the one who grants success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by At-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee and Ibn Maajah from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Anas and Imaam A<u>h</u>mad. Also, reported as a <u>h</u>adeeth of Mahmood ibn Labeed, slightly different wording. Shaykh al-Albaaniyy authenticates the <u>h</u>adeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>A point of note from Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad An-Najmee:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible to be pleased and happy with sins nor to use predecree as an excuse for them. Rather, it is obligatory to strive to remove them and Allaah, the Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>كُنتُمْ خَيْرَ أُمَّةٍ أُخْرِجَتْ لِلنَّاسِ تَأْمُرُونَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَتَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ الْمُنكَرِ وَتُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">You are the best nation brought out for mankind, you command the good and you forbid the evil and you truly believe in Allaah.</span> </strong>(Soorah-Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">Whoever amongst you see an evil, let him change it with his hand and if he is not able then with his tongue and if he is not able then with his heart for that is the weakest of <em>eemaan</em></span></strong>. [Reported by Muslim.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if it can be imagined that the disbelievers occupy a land from the lands of the muslims, is it permissible that we just say that this is a matter of predecree and leave it as that and not strive to remove this evil until we free the muslims in their lands so that they are at peace from being overcome by the diebeleivers? The answer is that it is not permissible for us to just be silent about that nor should we be pleased and happy with it nor just have patience upon that and Allaah is the one who grants success.</p>

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Explanation – Point [105]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This follows on from what preceded from the speech about Pre-ordainment and Pre-decree. And it has already preceded that from the levels of having <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in Pre-ordainment and Pre-decree is having <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in whatever He wrote in <em>Al-Law<u>h</u> Al-Ma<u>h</u>foo<u>z</u></em> (the Inscribed or Preserved Tablet).  And that is, that Allaah created the creation and the first thing that He created was the Pen (<em>Qalam</em>) and He said to it, “Write!” So it replied, “What should I write?” So He said, “Write whatever is going to happen until the Day of Resurrection.” So the Pen wrote down, by the command of Allaah for it to write down, whatever was going to happen until the Day of Resurrection, as occurs in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And no one knows how the Preserved Tablet (<em>Al-Law<u>h</u></em>) is, and how the Pen is, except Allaah. And they are two created things from the things which Allaah the Mighty and Majestic has created; we have <em>eemaan</em> in that. And so, therefore, the author said: <strong>“We have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in the Preserved Record and in the Pen, and in whatever has been inscribed in it.” </strong>Meaning: <em>Al-Law<u>h</u> Al-Mahfoo<u>z</u></em> (The Preserved Tablet) and the writing that is in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is the second level from the levels of <em>eemaan</em> in Pre-ordainment and Pre-decree, and it is: <em>eemaan</em> in the writing in the Preserved Tablet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [105][2]<span style="font-size:13.3333px;">[3]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] This is a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Aboo Daawood and At-Tirmi<u>dh</u>ee and Aboo Ya`laa from the statement of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, and it is also reported by Al-Bayhaqee as a statement of the Companion, which carries the ruling of being from the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. It was declared <em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Translator’s Side Point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Mu<u>h</u>ammad ibn `Abdul `Azeez ibn Manee`, made a note on this point: <strong>We have eemaan in the Preserved Tablet</strong>; he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah, the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Indeed, it is a Praiseworthy Qur·aan contained in a Preserved Tablet.<br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Burooj (85), <em>aayaat </em>21-22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the Noble Qur·aan is written down in the Preserved Tablet, just as Allaah, the Perfect, mentioned. And Jibreel <em>`alayhis-salaam</em> heard it from Allaah and conveyed it to our Prophet Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em>`alayhi<u>s</u> <u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>. So it was sent down from your Lord in truth, and He did not say ‘from the Preserved Tablet’. And there is no contradiction between its being in the Preserved Tablet and between its being sent down from Allaah, as was clarified by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah. And <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>ul-Islaam said also, that the Preserved Tablet is above the heavens and there occurs in a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> that no one looks into it except Allaah, the Mighty and the Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: So this shows the misguidance of those who state that the soul of a person can see what is contained in the Preserved Tablet. This is just a statement from the philosophers and from the people of superstitious stories from the worshippers – whether righteous or unrighteous, as is their firm belief. So beware of it because it is a lie.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Pen which is mentioned, then it is what Allaah created; and it wrote the measure of everything in the Preserved Tablet just as occurs in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Ubaadah ibn A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>aamit reported by Aboo Daawood from the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The first thing that Allaah created was the Pen and He said to it, “Write!” So it said, “O my Lord, and what shall I write?” He said, “Write down the decreed measure of everything right until the Hour is established.”’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the scholars disagree – was the Pen the very first thing that was created or was it the <em>`Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Allaah’s Throne)? They have two sayings in that regard. Ibn Al-Qayyim mentions both of them in his Nooniyyah and he preferred the view that the Pen was created after the <em>`Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne).”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Translator’s Side Point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah, </em>he said on this point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I say, with regard to the Preserved Tablet, it is what is mentioned in the saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed, it is a Praiseworthy Qur·aan contained in a Preserved Tablet.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Burooj (85), <em>aayaat </em>21-22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that is from the <em><u>Gh</u>ayb</em> (Hidden and Unseen) which it is obligatory that we have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) in it. And its true reality is not known except to Allaah. And the belief that some righteous people can look into what’s contained in it – this belief is <em>kufr</em> (unbelief) in the <em>aayaat</em> and <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> which clearly state that no one knows the <em><u>Gh</u>ayb</em> (Hidden and Unseen) except Allaah, the Most High.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s Side Point:</strong> With regard to the point about which was created first: the Pen or the Throne, <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>)<em>, </em>he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The explainer (Ibn Abil-`Izz in his explanation of A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>a<u>h</u>aawiyyah), he explained here, that the scholars differed whether the Pen was the very first thing created or the Throne (`<em>Ar<u>sh</u></em><u>)</u>. The scholars had two sayings in that regard and there is no third (saying). (Some of the scholars of the <em>Sunnah</em> said that Allaah’s Throne was first and then the Pen was created and some said that the Pen was created and then after that, Allaah’s Throne was created, and there is no third saying).”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And in my view the most preferable one is the first (that the Pen was the very first thing created) as is clearly stated in my note (that he made for A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>a<u>h</u>aawiyyah). And I say now, whether what is most correct is this or that, then this difference shows that the scholars are agreed that there was a first created thing. And the idea that created things came into creation and there is always something before it, they are contrary to this agreement (of the scholars).”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">[86]  And Allaah, the Most High, has always known the number of those who will enter into Paradise, and the number of those who will enter the Fire, altogether. So, that number will not be increased, nor will it be decreased.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [86][1]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This speech and that which follows it from the speech of the <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>, <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah, </em>all of it refers to the topic of <em>Al-Qa<u>d</u>aa· wal-Qadr</em> (القضاء والقدر – Ordainment and Pre-decree).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And having <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in Ordainment and Pre-decree is one of the six pillars of <em>eemaan</em>, just as he, <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>, said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Eemaan (true faith) is that you truly believe in Allaah and in His angels and in His Books and in His Messengers and in the Last Day, and that you truly believe in the Pre-decree – the good of it and the bad of it.” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the Qur·aan there occurs the saying of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We have created everything with a pre-decreed measure </strong></span><br />
(Sooratul-Qamar (54), <em>aayah </em>49)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">He (Allaah) created everything and gave it a pre-decreed measure</span></strong><br />
(Sooratul-Furqaan (25), <em>aayah </em>2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, there is nothing without a pre-decreed measure, or nothing which randomly occurs, or nothing that just happens unexpectedly; rather, everything which happens, does so in accordance with a pre-decreed measure and having been written.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And having <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in <em>Al-Qa<u>d</u>aa· wal-Qadr</em> (Pre-ordainment and Pre-decree) includes four (4) levels and we will abridge them as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First Level</strong>: To have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in Allaah’s comprehensive Knowledge (<em>Al-`Ilm</em> &#8211; العلم) which covers everything, and that Allaah has known all things, always. He knew whatever happened and whatever was going to happen and whatever was not going to happen and if it had happened, how it would have been. Nothing whatsoever is hidden from His Knowledge, He, the One free of all imperfections and the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second Level</strong>: (<em>Al-Kitaabah</em>) That Allaah the Majestic and the Most High, He wrote in <em>Al-Law<u>h</u> Al-Ma<u>h</u>foo<u>z</u></em> (The Preserved Tablet) the pre-decreed measures of every created thing, after having known them, He the Perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is the Universal and all-inclusive Writing which covers everything. And there occurs in a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u> </em>(that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>said),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The first thing that Allaah created was the Pen. He said, ‘Write!’ It said, ‘What shall I write?’ He said, ‘Write down whatever will occur until the Day of Resurrection.’” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the Pen wrote down whatever was going to happen until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Third Level</strong>: The level of <em>Al-Ma<u>sh</u>ee·ah</em> (Allaah’s Wish and Will). So nothing occurs in this creation except by the Will and Wish of Allaah from that which is in the Preserved Tablet (<em>Al-Law<u>h</u> Al-Ma<u>h</u>foo<u>z</u></em>) and what is within His Knowledge, He the Perfect and Most High. Nothing happens without His Will and nothing occurs within His Sovereignty unless He wills it (if He doesn’t will it, it doesn’t occur), He the Perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah does whatever He wills.</span></strong><br />
(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ajj (22), <em>aayah </em>14)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Likewise, Allaah does whatever He wishes.</span></strong><br />
(Soorah Aal-`Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, everything which occurs in this creation, whether life or death, whether someone being rich or someone being poor, whether someone having <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) or being an unbeliever; all of that was in accordance with Allaah’s Wish and Will. He wished the good and He wished the evil. He wished true faith (<em>eemaan</em>) and He wished unbelief (<em>kufr</em>). So, everything enters into His <em>Al-Ma<u>sh</u>ee·ah</em> (His Universal Wish); whatever He wished to occur, occurred; and whatever He did not wish, did not occur.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Fourth Level</strong>: The level of creating and bringing into existence (<em>al-<u>kh</u>alq wal-eejaad</em> &#8211; الخلق والإيجاد). So whatever things He wished and willed, then He brought it into existence and created it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah is the Creator of everything and He is a Guardian and Disposer of Affairs over everything.</strong></span><br />
(Sooratuz-Zumar (39), <em>aayah </em>62)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The Creating and the Command are His</strong></span><br />
(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> No calamity strikes upon the earth nor in your selves, except that it is written down in a Book before We created it.</strong></span> (Sooratul-<u>H</u>adeed (57), <em>aayah </em>22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proofs of (Allaah’s) Knowledge are very many.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from that which Allaah has described Himself with, is <em>Al-`Ilm</em> (العلم &#8211; Knowledge). So He, the One free of all imperfections and the Most High, He knows the number of people who will enter into Paradise and those who will enter into the Fire, and that is in His Eternal Knowledge (He has always known that).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that whatever Allaah, the Most High had decreed, that will not be added to nor will it be decreased. And from that, is that He knows the inhabitants of Paradise and the inhabitants of the Fire, and He knows what they were going to do. We have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in that and we apply ourselves to action. We do not debate concerning Ordainment and Pre-decree, saying “how?” and “why?” and “how can a person be taken to account for something which Allaah pre-decreed?” to the rest of the foolish talk and wastage of time, and raising objections against Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is obligatory upon you, is rather, to perform the acts of obedience and to avoid the sins. It is not the business of a slave to try and investigate the Secret of Allaah, the Mighty and the Majestic, and to dispute with the Lord, the Majestic and Most High. Rather, his business is to act. So therefore, when the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>informed his Companions that there is no one from them except that his place is written down – whether it be in Paradise or it be in the Fire, they said, “O Messenger of Allaah, shall we not then depend upon what is written down for us and leave off actions?” So he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“No, act, for everyone will have that which he was created for, made easy for him.”</strong> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Your deeds are diverse. So whoever spends in Allaah’s cause and fears and is dutiful to Him, and believes in Allaah’s reward, then We will make easy for him, acts which are pleasing to Allaah.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Layl (92), <em>aayaat </em>4-7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the reason here, is from the servant himself (why Allaah will make good deeds easy for the person) – either he is a person who is fortunate or a person who is wretched.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever is miserly, withholding from spending in Allaah’s cause, and thinks himself self-sufficient and does not act in obedience to Allaah, and denies Allaah’s reward, then We will make actions which Allaah hates, easy for him.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Layl (92), <em>aayaat </em>8-10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is required from us, is performing righteous and correct actions and leaving off evil actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for using Pre-ordainment and Pre-decree as an argument, then it is not an excuse because Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, has made the good clear to us, and the evil; so therefore there is no excuse. And the people fall into problems because of their entering into affairs which they are not qualified for. So he says, “If Allaah has written for me that I will enter into Paradise, then I will enter it and if He has written for me that I will enter the Fire then I am going to enter it,” and he doesn’t perform any actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then it is to be said to him: You, yourself don’t apply this saying upon yourself. Do you just sit in your house and leave off seeking provision? And do you say, “If Allaah has written down provision for me, He will make it easy for me.” Or is it that you go out and you strive and you seek for your provision? Even the animals and the birds don’t just sit in their homes; rather, they go out and they seek for their provision. And there occurs in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>, the saying of the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“If you truly had reliance upon Allaah, then He would provide for you just as He provides for the birds. They go out hungry and they return with full bellies.”</strong> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah created them (the birds and animals) upon the inborn nature of seeking for provision and of using the necessary means; and they are animals and you are a man will intellect!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also, if someone stole something from you, would you say, “This was just something pre-decreed and ordained,” or would you make a complaint against him? Rather, indeed you would make a complaint against him and you would seek it and you would argue your case; you would not use as an argument Pre-ordainment and Pre-decree!</p>

</span><span style="color:#ff0000;">[87]  And the same applies to their deeds; He knew whatever they were going to do.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [88]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So whoever gives in Allaah’s cause and spends in obedience to Allaah, and fears Him and is dutiful to Him and believes in His reward, then We will make easy for him actions which are pleasing to Allaah. And whoever is miserly, and withholds from giving in Allaah’s cause, and thinks of himself as being self-sufficient and does not act in obedience to Allaah, and who denies His reward, then We will make actions which Allaah hates and is not pleased with, easy for him. </span></strong>(Sooratul-Layl (92), <em>aayaat </em>5-10)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Footnotes:</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s Side Point: The author, <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, moves on to a few points connected to <em>Qadr</em> (Pre-decree) and we already had something with regard to Pre-decree in the book, that being points number 28-37 where the author, <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“He created the creation whilst having full Knowledge (of them). And He decreed fixed limits for them. And He laid down fixed time-spans for them. And nothing was hidden from Him before He created them. And He knew whatever they were going to do, before He created them. And He commanded them to obey Him and He forbade them from disobeying Him. And everything occurs in accordance with His Pre-decree. And His Will is enacted, not the will of the servants except what He wills for them. So whatever He willed for them occurs, and whatever He did not will for them does not occur. He guides whomever He wishes, and protects and keeps safe as a favor upon them; and He misguides whomever He wishes and humiliates and puts to trial from (His) Justice. All of them vary within His Will, between His Favor and His Justice.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] <em><u>H</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree (no. 50) and by Muslim in his Book of <em>Eemaan</em> (no. 10) as the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] This <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> is reported by Aboo Ya`laa from the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and it was declared <em><u>S</u></em><em>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (Authentic) by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee in A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah (no. 133). Also reported by Al-Bayhaqee in his book As-Sunan Al-Kubraa as being <em>mawqoof</em> from (the statement of the Companion) Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>. Also reported by Aboo Daawood and At-Tirmi<u>dh</u>ee from the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Ubaadah ibn A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>aamit <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em> and declared <em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (Authentic) by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] <em><u>H</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree (no. 6605) and likewise by Muslim. It is from a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Alee <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Reported by A<u>h</u>mad in his Musnad, and by `Abd ibn <u>H</u>umayd, and by At-Tirmi<u>dh</u>ee and Ibn Maajah, and At-Tirmi<u>dh</u>ee said it is <em><u>H</u>asan-<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em>. And it was declared authentic by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> A<u>h</u>mad <u>Sh</u>aakir in his checking of the Musnad. Likewise, it was declared <em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah.</em> It is from a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s Side Point: This is a <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> that sometimes the Sufis beggars try and use to say that they are not begging but they are depending and relying upon Allaah. But as the scholars say, they are just begging from the people and they try to use this <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> as it mentions, “If only you had reliance upon Allaah, then He would provide for you just as He provides for the birds.” The scholars and explainers say that the last part of this hadeeth is a refutation of them because it mentions that the birds “go out hungry and they return with full bellies.” So, they go out and look for food and when they’ve found it, they come back with their bellies full.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] Translator’s Side Point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) said regarding this point: “The author <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> is indicating the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Abdullaah ibn `Amr <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em> who said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Allaah’s Messenger <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam came out to us and in his hand he had two books and he said, “Do you know what these two books are?” So we said, “No, O Messenger of Allaah, not unless you inform us.”  So he said about the book in his right hand, “This is a book from the Lord of the whole of the creation. It contains the names of the inhabitants of Paradise and the names of their fathers and their tribes, and then their total number is mentioned; it will not be added to and it will not be taken away from, ever.” Then he said about the book in his left hand, “This is a book from the Lord of the whole of the creation, containing the names of the inhabitants of the Fire and the names of their fathers and their tribes, and then He mentioned their total number; so it will not be added to, nor will it be decreased, ever.” So his Companions said, “Then on what basis is there to be any action if the affair has been finished?” So he said, “Strive to act correctly and to be justly balanced because the person of Paradise will have his actions sealed for him with the actions of the people of Paradise, no matter what he may have done; and the person of the Fire will have his actions sealed for him with the actions of the people of the Fire, no matter what he may have done.” Then Allaah’s Messenger <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said motioning with his hands and he threw them (the two books) away. Then he said, “Your Lord has finished with regards to the servants,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>A group in Paradise and another group in the Fire.</strong></span><br />
(Sooratu<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>Sh</u>ooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>7)”’</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> was reported by At-Tirmi<u>dh</u>ee and he declared it authentic, and others as well. And I have researched it in my book A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah as <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> no. 848.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, in his checking of At-Tirmi<u>dh</u>ee, <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee declared it <em><u>H</u>asan</em> (good).</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Points discussed in this excerpt include:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Having <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in Ordainment and Pre-decree (القضاء والقدر) is one of the six pillars of <em>eemaan</em></li>
<li>There is nothing without a pre-decreed measure, or which randomly occurs, or that just happens unexpectedly</li>
<li>The four (4) levels of <em>eemaan</em> in <em>Al-Qadaa</em><em> wal-Qadr: Al-`Ilm, Al-Kitaabah, Al-Mashee</em><em>·</em><em>ah </em>and <em>Al-<u>Kh</u>alq</em></li>
<li>Obligation upon a person to perform acts of obedience and avoid sins</li>
<li>Pre-ordainment and Pre-decree is not to be used as an argument/excuse</li>
<li>Allaah knows those who will enter the Paradise and the Fire, their total number and their deeds</li>
<li>Everyone will have what he was created for, made easy for him</li>

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong> The Explanation – Point [89]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And deeds will be in accordance with conclusions</strong>: So a person should not allow himself to be fooled by his own deeds, even if he is the most righteous of the righteous people. Rather, he should fear that he may have an evil end (conclusion). And judgment is not passed upon anyone that he is from the people of the Fire based upon his actions because the person does not know what he will be given as is concluding deeds. And this is clarified by a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, from a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Ibn Mas`ood (<em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em>, that the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إن أحدكم يجمع خلقه في بطن أمه أربعين يوماً نطفةً، ثم يكون علقة مثل ذلك، ثم يكون مضغةً مثل ذلك، ثم يرسل إليه الملك، فينفخ فيه الروح، ويؤمر بأربع كلمات‏:‏ بكتب رزقه، وأجله، وعمله، وشقي أو سعيد‏.‏ وإن أحدكم ليعمل بعمل أهل الجنة حتى ما يكون بينه وبينها إلا ذراع، فيسبق عليه الكتاب، فيعمل بعمل أهل النار فيدخلها، وإن أحدكم ليعمل بعلم أهل النار حتى ما يكون بينه وبينها إلا ذراع، فيعمل بعمل أهل الجنة فيدخلها‏</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“The creation of each one of you is brought together in his mother’s womb for forty days as a drop of fluid; then he becomes a clot for a similar period; then a piece of flesh for a similar period; and then the angel is sent to him and the soul is breathed into him.  And he (the angel) is commanded to write four things: to write his provision and his life span and his actions and whether he would be a wretched person (a person of the Hellfire) or a fortunate person (a person of Paradise). And one of you performs the actions of the people of Paradise until there is nothing between him and it except a cubit and then the writing overcomes him and he acts with the actions of the people of the Hellfire and so he enters it.  And one of you may act with the actions of the people of the Fire until there is nothing between him and it except for a cubit (a forearm’s span) and then he acts with the actions of the people of Paradise, and so he enters it.”</span></em> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, therefore, a person fears having an evil end (conclusion). And judgment of having an evil conclusion is not passed upon someone since the person does not know the conclusion that will be given to him, because <em>tawbah</em> (repentance) wipes away whatever came before it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Say to the unbelievers, “If they desist (from their unbelief), then whatever came before will be forgiven for them.”</span></em> (Sooratul-Anfaal (8), <em>aayah </em>38)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, actions are in accordance with their conclusions (that which is final from them).  However, from the subtle kindness of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, towards His servants, is that <strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">whoever lives upon good, then He gives him a good conclusion; and whoever lives upon evil, then He gives him an evil conclusion</span></strong>. So therefore, a person should act and apply the necessary means and should have good thoughts concerning Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And some people say, “<strong>I will repent before I die</strong>.” Then we say to him, “<strong>And do you know when you are going to die?</strong>” It is possible that you could die in a sudden moment such that you are not able to repent; and also, you do not know whether your repentance will be acceptable or not because repentance has conditions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] <em><u>H</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree (no. 3208) and by Muslim (no. 2643).

<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Translator’s Side Point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) said in his notes to A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>a<u>h</u>aawiyyah with regard to this point: “This phrase is part of a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Sahl ibn Sa`ad as-Saa`idee, reported by A<u>h</u>mad and Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree.” He mentions that he has verified it in his checking of the book As-Sunnah of Ibn Abee `Aa<u>s</u>im. The wording of this <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> in Bu<u>kh</u>aaree (no. 6493) is part of a longer <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>; and the relevant wording here is that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إِنَّ الْعَبْدَ لَيَعْمَلُ فِيمَا يَرَى النَّاسُ عَمَلَ أَهْل الْجَنَّةِ، وَإِنَّهُ لَمِنْ أَهْلِ النَّارِ، وَيَعْمَلُ فِيمَا يَرَى النَّاسُ عَمَلَ أَهْل النَّارِ وَهْوَ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، وَإِنَّمَا الأَعْمَالُ بِخَوَاتِيمِهَا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“A servant may act with regard to what the people see with the actions of the people of Paradise, but in reality he is from the people of the Fire; and he may act with regard to what the people see with the actions of the people of the Fire, when he is actually from the people of Paradise. And indeed, actions are in accordance with their conclusions.”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In an earlier lesson, we mentioned that this was an explanation given by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Ibn `U<u>th</u>aymeen <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah,</em> to the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u> </em>of Ibn Mas`ood that we had before.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>[8]</strong> <strong>ولا يكون إلا ما يريد‏.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[8] <span style="color:#000000;"><strong> And nothing occurs except what He (Allaah) wills.</strong></span></p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F319065738&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe><br />
—</p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [8]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This contains an affirmation of <em>al-Qadr </em>(القدر &#8211; pre-decree) and an affirmation of <em>al-Iraadah</em> (الإرادة &#8211; Allaah’s Will).  So nothing exists within His kingdom and nothing occurs within His creation whether events or things except that Allaah willed it to occur, He the Perfect and Most High – willing it with His <em>Iraadah al-Kawniyyah</em> (Universal Will):</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And His Affair, when He wills something, is just that He says to it, &#8220;Be!&#8221; and it is!</span></em><br />
(Soorah YaaSeen (36), <em>aayah </em>82)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, every good and every evil occurs by Allaah’s Universal Will; so nothing escapes from His Will.  And this contains a refutation of the <em>Qadariyyah</em> – those who deny <em>al-Qadr</em> (pre-decree) and who claim that the person himself, he is the one who creates his own actions and produces his own actions; and Highly Exalted is Allaah above that which they say.  Because this (saying of theirs) is a declaration of Allaah’s being unable and (it is a statement) that there are things in His creation which He the Perfect and Most High does not Will.  So this is to describe Him with deficiency because everything which occurs within the creation – whether good or evil, then it occurs by His Will.  Rather, He creates good for a wise purpose and He creates that which is evil for a wise purpose.  So from the aspect of its creation, then it is not an evil because it is created for a tremendous wisdom and a tremendous goal which is to test and to try, and to distinguish that which is foul from that which is good, and in order to reward the people upon their righteous deeds and to recompense the people for their evil deeds.  And He was Wise in that, He, the Perfect and Most High; He did not create anything without purpose.</p>
<p>End of explanation of point [8][1]</p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s side point: Ibn Abil-`Izz <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, in his famous explanation of A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>a<u>ha</u>awiyyah, says: “<strong>And nothing exists except what He (Allaah) wills</strong>.” This contains a refutation of the saying of the <em>Qadariyyah</em> and the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> because they say, “Allaah willed <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) from all of the people but the unbeliever is the one who willed unbelief for himself.” And this saying of theirs is corrupt and is rejected since it contrary to the Book and the Sunnah and to correct intellect and it is the well-known matter of <em>al-Qadr</em> (pre-decree) and something in explanation of that will follow <em>inshaa Allaahu ta`aalaa</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they (these people who deny pre-decree) are called the <em>Qadariyyah</em> because they denied pre-decree; and likewise the <em>Jabariyyah</em> (who say that the people have no free will and are forced to do whatever they do) are also called the people of pre-decree (<em>Qadariyyah</em>).  This name (<em>al-Qadariyyah</em>) is mostly used for the first group (those who deny the pre-decree).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the people of the Sunnah, then they say that even though Allaah willed that sins would occur, however, He does not love them and He is not pleased with them and He did not command them.  Rather, He hates them and is angry with them and He forbade them.  This is the saying of all of the <em>Salaf</em> – those who say, “Whatever Allaah willed occurs and whatever He did not will, does not occur.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[…]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the verifiers from the people of the Sunnah say, “‘Will’ in the Book of Allaah is of two types: Allaah’s Will referring to His pre-decree (His Universal Will – الإرادة الكونية) and His Legislational Will (الإرادة الشرعية) which comprises His Love and His Pleasure.</p>

<p><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Chapter 16: The Creation Of The Slaves Actions</strong></span></p>
<p>[106] And from the sayings <em>Ahl-us-Sunnah wal Jamaa&#8217;ah</em> about the deeds of the slaves, is that they are created by Allah, The Most High. They do not have any doubt in that. They do not regard anyone who rejects and negated this statements ( belief) as being from the people of guidance and religion of truth. [118]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[7] Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Allaah says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَجَعَلْنَا عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ أَكِنَّةً أَن يَفْقَهُوهُ وَفِي آذَانِهِمْ وَقْرًا<br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> <strong>“And We placed veils upon their hearts – so that they understand it not – and deafness in their ears.”</strong> [Surah Al-An’aam: 25]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Some people perceive this ayah to contain a sense of coercion in it (on the part of Allaah). So what is your opinion with regards to this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[7] Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“placing”</strong> </span>is an existential (<em>kawnee</em>) type of placing. In order to understand this, we must explain the meaning of Allaah’s Divine Desire (<em>Iraadah</em>). Divine Desire is divided into two categories.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Shar’ee</em> (Legislative) Desire and the <em>Kawnee</em> (Existential) Desire</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Legislative Desire is everything that Allaah has legislated for His servants and incited them to do, such as acts of worship and obedience, regardless of their rulings, whether obligatory or recommended. Allaah desires and loves these acts of worship and obedience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Existential Desire, it may at times be something that Allaah did not legislate but yet preordained. This type of Desire is only called “Existential Desire” since its term was derived from Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">إِنَّمَا أَمْرُهُ إِذَا أَرَادَ شَيْئًا أَن يَقُولَ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Verily, His Command – when He desires something – is only that He says to it ‘Be’ and it is.”</strong> </span>[Surah YaaSeen: 82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word <strong>“something”</strong> here is an indefinite noun which consists of everything, whether acts of obedience or acts of disobedience. Such things come into existence by Allaah’s saying to it: “Be.” Meaning: It occurs through His Will, Ordainment, and Pre- Decree. So if we come to realize this Existential Desire, which includes everything regardless if it is an act of obedience or an act of disobedience, it will definitely lead us back to the subject of Al-Qadaa wal-Qadar (Allaah’s Divine Ordainment and Pre- Decree, since Allaah’s statement: <strong>“Verily, His Command – when He desires something – is only that He says to it ‘Be’ and it is”</strong> means that the thing to which He said “Be” is something He decreed, which will definitely come into existence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everything, according to Allaah, is decreed – it either consists of good or it consists of evil. However, that which applies from it to us – the two species of mankind and jinn who have been ordered by Allaah and are accountable for our actions – is that we look at what we do. The things we do either occur purely from our desire and free choice or they occur in spite of what we desire. Acts of obedience or disobedience do not apply to this second category and the end result of it is not Paradise or Hellfire. It is only the first category that the religious laws revolve around. And it is based on this that a person will be rewarded with either Paradise or the Hellfire. This means that whatever a person does based on his own desire and whatever he chases after through His actions and free choice, this is what he will be held accountable for. If it is good, then he will have good and if it is bad, then he will have bad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fact that a person has a free choice in a large portion of his actions is a fact that cannot be argued with whether religiously or intellectually.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for religiously, there are numerous texts from the Qur’aan and Sunnah that confirm that a person may choose to do what he is ordered to do and abandon what he is forbidden from doing. These texts are too numerous to mention.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for intellectually, it is clear to every person that is void of whims and desires that whenever he speaks or walks or eats or drinks or does anything that involves his free will, he is choosing on his own to do that action and not being forced to do that at all. For example, if I wish to speak right now, there is naturally no one that can force me to do that. However, this speech (of mine) is pre-decreed. What is meant by my speaking these words in spite of it being pre-decreed is that it is pre-ordained along with my free choice of what I will say and talk about. However, I have the ability to remain silent to make clear – to those doubtful about what I’m saying – that I have a free choice in the matter of speaking.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, the fact that a person has a free choice and a free will is something that cannot be disputed or argued against. And as for one who does argue against such a fact, then this person is only arguing philosophically and casting doubts on self-evident intuitions. And when a person reaches this stage, he can no longer be talked to (logically).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the actions of a human being are divided into two categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Those that are done out of his choice and free will<br />
2. Those that are done as a result of him being forced and coerced to</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have nothing to say about the actions that are done due to coercion – not from a religious perspective or from a real-life perspective. The religion is only concerned with the matters of free choice and free will. This is the truth of the matter. If we implant this into our minds, we will be able to understand the afore-mentioned ayah: <strong>“And We placed veils upon their hearts.”</strong> This refers to the Existential Placing. We must remember that the afore-mentioned ayah: <strong>“Verily, His Command – when He desires something”</strong> refers to the Existential Desire. However, it is not done against the will and choice of this person whom Allaah has placed veils over his heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here is an example of this from an actual perspective: When a human being is created, he is formed while his flesh is still soft and tender. Then as he gets older and older, his flesh becomes harder and his bones become stronger. However, not all people are the same in this regard. So lets say for example this person is devoted to (learning) some type of study or science. What part of the body will grow strong in this person? His mind will strengthen. His brain will become stronger in the field that he preoccupies it with and applies all of its abilities on. However, from a physical standpoint, his body will not strengthen nor will his muscles develop.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The opposite of this is exactly true as well, for there may be a person that completely applies himself physically. So everyday he engages in sports and physical training – as we say today. Such a person’s muscles and body will progress and become strong. And he will acquire an image just like those that we see sometimes in real-life and sometimes in pictures in which for example the bodies of these athletes have become all muscle. Was this person created this way? Or did he earn and acquire for himself this strong physique loaded with muscles? This is something that he has attained based on his own actions and free choice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">This is the same example as someone who lingers in his misguidance, rejection, disbelief and denial and as a result attains this condition of these veils being placed by Allaah over his heart, not because Allaah compelled and forced this upon him but rather due to his actions and free choice.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So this is the existential placing which these disbelieving people have acquired (for themselves). They have gotten themselves to this point, which the ignorant think they were forced into, when in reality, such a fate was not obliged upon them, but rather came about due to what their own hands earned. And Allaah does not oppress His servants.</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">O Brothers, know that the Muslim ummah is divided into three groups with respect to Allaah’s Pre-Decree:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The First Group:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They went <strong>overboard</strong> in their affirmation of Allaah’s Pre-Decree, denying that the human being has any ability or choice in the matter. They hold that “<strong>A person has no ability or choice – he is controlled and has no free will, just like a tree when it is blown by the wind</strong>.” They do not distinguish between a person’s action that occur as a result of his choice and an action of his that occurs without him choosing so. No doubt, these people are astray, because what is known from the Religion by necessity, and from the intellect and customs, is that a human being knows the difference between an action he chooses to do and an action he is forced into doing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Second Group:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They went to <strong>extremes in their affirmation of a person’s ability and choice</strong>, such that they negated Allaah having any part in Willing or Choosing or Creating what action a person does. And they claimed that a person is independently responsible for producing his action. This is such that a group amongst them went too far, saying: “<strong>Allaah does not know what actions His servants will do until after it occurs from them</strong>.” These people have also gone to extremes and shown great radicalism in affirming a human being’s ability and choice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Third Group:</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the ones who truly believe, and so Allaah has guided them concerning that which is disagreed upon from the truth. They are Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah. They have treaded the moderate path and the middle course, which is based on religious and logical proofs and evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they say: The actions that Allaah introduces into existence are divided into two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: The actions from Allaah that He causes to occur in His Creation. No one has any choice in regard to these actions, and they are such as when rain descends, when the earth produces vegetation, when life or death occurs, when health or sickness befalls and so on and so forth – from the many things that can be observed occurring within the creation. Without doubt, no one has any part in choosing or willing for these things to transpire, but rather it is only Allaah who wills that to happen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: The actions that the creation, i.e. all of the various types of creatures that possess a willingness, do. These actions occur as a result their choosing and wanting to do them, since Allaah gave them the ability to do that, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“To whoever amongst you wills to go straight.”</strong> [Surah At-Takweer: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Among you is he who desires the worldly life and among you is he who desires the Hereafter.”</strong> [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 152]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“So whoever wishes, then let him believe, and whoever wishes then let him disbelieve.”</strong> [Surah Al-Kahf: 29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A human being knows the difference between what occurs from him as a result of his own free will and what occurs from him as a result of being compelled and forced. So for example, when a human being climbs a ladder to get to the roof of a house, he ascends the ladder out of his own free will, and while knowing that he freely chose to do so. But when he trips and falls down from the roof, he knows that he did not choose to do that. So he can tell the difference between these two actions – that he freely chose to do the former, while he was compelled to do the latter. Every human being knows this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, when a person is stricken with a sickness in which his urine constantly flows out, this urine comes out from him without his desiring or choosing that. But when he is in a healthy state and free from this sickness, the urine comes out from him when he wills and chooses. So he knows the difference between this and that. No one can deny the difference between the two.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the same goes with everything else that occurs to a person – he can tell the difference between what occurs due to his free will and what occurs due to his being coerced and forced. As a matter of fact, due to Allaah’s Mercy there are some actions a person may do on his own free will, yet not be held accountable for any of them, as is the case with a person when he sleeps or forgets. In the story of the people of the Cave, Allaah tells us:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And you would have thought them to be awake whereas they were asleep. And We turned them on their right and on their left sides.”</strong> [Surah Al-Kahf: 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They were the ones who turned around in their sleep, yet Allaah ascribes the action to Himself. This is because when a person sleeps, he has no choice or free will in his actions, and he will not be held accountable for actions done in this state, so the act is attributed to Allaah. The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>“Whoever forgets while fasting, and eats or drinks, then he should complete his fast because it was only Allaah who fed him and gave him to drink.”</strong> [2] So he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) attributed this act of feeding and quenching thirst to Allaah, because the action occurred from the individual without him being aware of it, so it is as if it happened without him choosing to do it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of us know the difference between when a person experiences pain or joy within himself at times without choosing so, and not knowing the reason why and between him experiencing these pains or these joys as a result of an act that he did himself. This matter, all praise be to Allaah is clear and there is no confusion over it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brothers: If we were to take the view of the first group (i.e. the Jabariyyah) who went to extremes in affirming the Divine Pre-Decree, the Religion would be invalidated from its very foundation. This is since the belief that a person has no choice or free will in his actions necessitates that he not be praised for a praiseworthy act or that he be blamed for a blameworthy act, since in reality they were not done by his choice or free will. So then this would mean that Allaah, may He be far removed from it, is oppressing those who sin when He punishes and recompenses them for their acts because He has punished them for something they had no free choice or free will in! This no doubt clearly contradicts the Qur’aan. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And his companion (angel) will say: ‘Here is (his record) ready with me!’ (Allaah will say to the angels): ‘Both of you, throw into the Hellfire every stubborn disbeliever, hinderer of good, transgressor, doubter, he who set up another god with Allaah. So both of you cast him into the Severe Torment.’ His (devil) companion will say: ‘Our Lord! I did not push him to transgress, but rather it was he himself who was in error, far astray. Allaah will say: ‘Do not dispute in front of Me, I had already sent the threat to you in advance. The Word (Ordainment) that comes from Me cannot be changed, and I am not unjust to the slaves.’”</strong> [Surah Qaaf: 23-29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah clarifies that this punishment is not oppression from Him, but rather that it is complete justice since He had previously given them a warning and clarified to them the various paths and explained the truth and falsehood to them, but they chose for themselves the path of falsehood. So there didn’t remain any proof for them before Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if we were to take this false view, it would invalidate Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Messengers, bearing glad tidings and warning in order that mankind would not have any argument (i.e. proof) against Allaah after the (coming of) Messengers.”</strong> [Surah An-Nisaa: 165]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah denies that mankind should have any excuses after the sending of Messengers because the proof has been established against them with that. So if the Divine PreDecree was an excuse for them, this excuse would be infinite even after the advent of the messengers since Allaah’s Pre-Decree did not cease and will not cease to exist before and after the sending of messengers. So therefore, this view is invalidated by the religious texts, and it is invalidated by reality, as we have explained in the previous examples.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who hold the second view, then the religious texts and reality also refute them since the texts clearly state that a person’s will is subject to Allaah’s Will:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“To whoever amongst you wills to go straight. However, you cannot will unless Allaah, Lord of the Universe, wills.”</strong> [Surah At-Takweer: 28-29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And your Lord creates whatever He wills and chooses.”</strong> [Surah Al-Qasas: 68]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> “And Allaah calls (you) to the Abode of Peace, and guides whomever He wills to the Straight Path.”</strong> [Surah Yoonus: 25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who hold this view (i.e. the Qadariyyah) are in reality invalidating one of the aspects of Allaah’s Lordship, and they are also claiming that there can be found in Allaah’s dominion that which Allaah did not will or create, when in fact Allaah wills everything, creates everything and has pre-decreed everything. They also contradict that which is known by necessity, which is that everything that is created belongs to Allaah, their essence as well as their attributes, there being no distinction between the attribute and the essence. Therefore, everything belongs to Allaah so it is not possible for there to be anything in His dominion that He did not desire. So what path should a person take and what is his solution if Allaah has pre-decreed that He go astray and not be guided?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We say: The answer to this is that Allaah only guides those who deserve to be guided, and He leads astray only those who deserve to be led astray. Allaah says:<strong> “So when they turned away, Allaah turned their hearts away.”</strong> [Surah As-Saff: 5] And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“So because they breached their covenant, We cursed them and made their hearts grow hard. They change the words from their (right) places and have abandoned a good part of the Message that was sent to them.”</strong> [Surah AlMaa’idah: 13] So Allaah clarified that what caused the person to go astray was himself. A person, as we have explained previously, doesn’t know what Allaah has pre-decreed for him since he doesn’t know what has been pre-decreed until after it occurs. So he doesn’t know if Allaah has decreed for him to be astray or guided. So if this is the case, how can he take the path of misguidance, then use as an excuse the argument that this is what Allaah willed for him? Wouldn’t it be more befitting for him to tread the path of guidance and then say that Allah has guided me to the Straight Path?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it right for him to be a Jabaree, i.e. claim that he is forced, when he is misguided, and a Qadaree, i.e. that Allaah has no part in his deeds, when he obeys?! Never! II does not befit a person to claim that he was forced when he finds himself upon misguidance and sin. So when he goes astray and disobeys Allaah, he says: “This is something that has been written and pre-decreed for me, and I am not able to remove myself from what Allaah has ordained for me.” Yet when he does good deeds and Allaah grants him obedience and guidance, he claims that this came solely from himself, saying: “I attained this by myself.” So he becomes a Qadaree when it comes to guidance and a Jabaree when it comes to disobedience. This is not possible ever. So in reality, a person has ability and will. The door to guidance is not any more hidden than the door to sustenance and the door to seeking knowledge. A person, as is well known to everybody, has pre-decreed for him whatever he has from sustenance. But yet in spite of this, he strives for the means of sustenance in his country and outside of it, on the right and on the left. He doesn’t just sit at home and say: “Provision has been pre-decreed for me and it will come to me.” On the contrary, he strives for the means of sustenance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet sustenance itself goes hand and hand with actions/works, as has been authentically reported on the Prophet, in the narration of Ibn Mas’ood, who said that he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said:<strong> “Verily, the creation of each of you is brought together in his mother’s womb for forty days in the form of a seed. Then he becomes a clot of blood for the same amount of time, then a morsel of flesh for the same amount of time. Then an angel is sent to him and commanded with four things: to record his sustenance, his lifespan, his actions, and whether he will be miserable or happy.”</strong> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this sustenance is written just as the good and evil actions are written. So how is it that you can go here and there, traversing land and sea, seeking the sustenance of the world and yet you don’t perform any righteous deed seeking the sustenance of the Hereafter or the success of Paradise? Indeed, these two aspects are one and the same. There is no difference between the two of them. So likewise, you strive for your sustenance and you strive for your livelihood and to prolong your lifespan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But when you become ill with a sickness, you travel through all the regions of the world looking for a skilled doctor who will cure your sickness. This is even though whatever has been pre-decreed for you as your lifespan will come to be and it will not increase or decrease. Yet you do not rely on this and say: “I will remain sick and bedridden at home, and if Allaah has decreed that my lifespan will be prolonged, then it will be prolonged.” Rather, we will find you striving with all of your might and energy to find a doctor whom you regard will be the best one at whose hands Allaah will ordain your recovery. So why don’t you do acts for the Hereafter and righteous deeds the same way you do acts for this worldly life?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We stated previously that: The Divine Pre-Ordainment is a hidden secret, you have no way of finding out about it. So right now, you are between two paths – a path that will take you to salvation and success, and a path that will take you to destruction and regret. So right now, you are standing between these two paths with a free choice. There is no one in front of you preventing you from taking the right path or the left path. If you wish, you can go here, and if you wish, you can go there. So how can you take the left path and say: “This has been pre-decreed for me!” Isn’t it more befitting for you to take the right path and say: “This has been pre-decreed for me?!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if you want to go on a journey to some other country and before you lies two roads, one of which is paved, short and safe, while the other is unpaved, long and dangerous, we would find you choosing the short, paved and safe road and not the other one. So this figurative road is similar to it and doesn’t differ from it at all. However, it is the souls and desires that sometimes govern and take over the mind. The believer must take over and control his desires. And when his mind judges, the mind, according to its correct meaning, should prevent a person from what harms it and lead it to what benefits and pleases it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With this it becomes clear that people have a free choice when it comes to their actions, and that they are not coerced. And just as he has a free choice in the acts of his worldly affairs, if he wills he will put out this product or make that his business, then likewise he has a free choice with regard to the affairs of the Hereafter. In fact, the paths of the Hereafter are clearer by far than the paths of this worldly life, because the One who clarifies the paths of the Hereafter is Allaah, in His Book and upon the tongue of His Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam). So the paths of the Hereafter are clearer and more lucid than the paths of the worldly life. But in spite of this, people still tread the paths of the worldly life, which have no guaranteed results and abandon the paths of the Hereafter, whose results are guaranteed and known since they are affirmed by Allaah’s promise, and Allaah does not break His promises.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having said this, we say that Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah affirm all of this and make it their Creed and Belief that: A person acts on his own free will and says what he wants. However, his desire and choosing are subject to Allaah’s Will and Desire. Furthermore, Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah believe that Allaah’s Will is subject to His Wisdom, and that it is not a pure and absolute Will, but rather a will that is dependent on His Wisdom. This is because one of Allaah’s Names is Al-Hakeem (The MostWise), and the Most-Wise is the One who judges matters precisely realistically and religiously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And based on His Wisdom, He decrees guidance for the one who desires it and for the one whom He knows wants the truth and whose heart is upon steadfastness. And He decrees misguidance for the one who is not like this – the one who when Islaam is presented to him, his heart becomes constricted as if he were being forced to ascend to the sky. So Allaah’s Wisdom refuses to let this person be from among the guided, unless Allaah renews his determination for him and changes his desire to another desire. And Allaah is Able to do all things. However, Allaah’s Wisdom insists that the causes be closely linked to the effects.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ghamm</strong> Occurs Due To Misfortunes that happened in the past while <strong>hamm</strong> occurs due to an expected misfortune in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When someone has the feeling of grief in regard to his past sins, his grief will benefit him, because he is rewarded for it. Whoever worries about a good deed he wishes to do, his worry will benefit him as well. However if someone grieves for something that he missed from this world, then [he should know] that the missed thing will not return and that grief harms, so practically he is adding harm to harm, as I have mentioned in the previous chapter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A resolute person should protect himself from what brings about grief, and that is losing an object he loves. Therefore, whoever has many objects that he loves, his grief increases, and whoever decreases his objects of love his grief decreases accordingly. Someone may say, when I have no objects of love I also still have grief, we affirm this but we say to him; your grief over not having a loved one is not even a tenth of the grief experienced by the one who has lost a loved one. Have you not noticed that the one who does not have a child lives in grief but not as much as the one who lost his child?! Moreover when a person becomes accustomed to what he loves and enjoys it for a long period of time, it takes over his heart, therefore when he loses it he will feel the bitterness of his loss which will be greater than all the satisfaction he had during his lifetime. This is because the loved one is corresponding to the self just as health corresponds to it, which causes the self not to find satisfaction except in it, for its absence disturbs it. This is why the self grieves for its loss much more than it rejoices in its presence, because the inner self believes that what it had was its given right to possess. Therefore a wise person should monitor the closeness between himself, his beloved to ensure it remains moderately balanced, however if he requires that which brings about grief [i.e. loving some object or person], this causes grief then the cure is first to believe in predestination and that whatever Allah predestines is going to happen. He should then know that life is founded on distress, all constructed buildings shall eventually be ruined, all gatherings shall eventually depart, and whoever wants the lasting of what does not last is like he who wants what does not exist to exist. Therefore he should not ask of life what it was not created for.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A poet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>It [worldly life] is founded on distress yet you want it, Free of harm and distress </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should imagine that what befell him is multiplied, for this is when what he suffers will be easier on him. It is a habit of smart porters to put something heavy on top of what they are carrying, and then after taking a few steps, to remove the heavy object as that makes what they are carrying feel lighter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should also wait, in times of prosperity for an attack of tribulation, so that if any tribulation befalls him, he should think of what remains instead of what he has lost so that when part of that befalls him it becomes very easy on him. Such as when some- one loses some money so he counts what remains, and then considers the remaining as a profit. Or if someone imagines that he loses his eyesight, so that when he has ophthalmia, it becomes easy on him to bear this illness, likewise with the rest of harmful matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A poet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The prudent imagines in himself,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>his tribulations before they befall him.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>If they suddenly befall him,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>they do not surprise him because he had already imagined them.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And the ignorant trusts the days,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>and he forgets the demise of those who came before him.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So when trials of times surprise him,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>with some trials he becomes lost</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Though if he was strict in his affairs,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>patience would have taught him boldness</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A member of the righteous predecessors said, &#8220;I saw a woman, whose youthfulness surprised me, I said, &#8216;[There is no doubt] This face has never suffered from sorrow or sadness.&#8217; She said, Do not say that! For I do not know anyone who has suffered from what I have suffered. I had a husband who bought a sacrificial animal and slaughtered it, and we had two sons. The eldest told the one younger than him, &#8216;Come and I will show you how our father slaughtered the ewe/ So he slaughtered his brother. When we started to look for him, he ran away and my husband died while looking for him/ I said, &#8216;So how are you handling your sorrow?&#8217; She said, &#8216;If I could find aid in sorrow I would have employed it.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Section One: Treating Sorrow, Sadness and Grief</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sorrow, sadness and grief may befalls one due the prevalence of blackness, which should be treated with what will remove this blackness; which are the things that bring about joy. Grief freezes the blood while happiness heats it until its intrinsic heat is raised, both of them (happiness and grief) can harm, and may lead to death, if they are not immediately kept within moderate levels.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The poet Abul-Qaasim Ash-Shaabee wrote: &#8220;<em>If the people one day want revival, then Al-Qadar (Divine Predestination) has no choice but to answer</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a direct form of <strong>disbelief</strong>. And it indicates that the people have gone far away from the knowledge. So they are not aware of what is permissible and what is not permissible for Allaah alone, as well as what is not permitted for those other than Him. This is due to neglectfulness – and it is from the factors that have made this poet say such a thing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And some <strong>Arab radio broadcasts</strong> have even adopted this saying as a <strong>hymn of Arab nationalism!</strong> This poetry states: &#8220;If the people one day want revival, then Al-Qadar (Divine Predestination) has no choice but to answer.&#8221; So this means that Al-Qadar is under the Will of the people! And this is in opposition to Allaah&#8217;s saying: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And you will not will until Allaah, Lord of the worlds, has willed”</span> [Surah At-Takweer: 29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah, guide us with those You have guided. And do not cause our hearts to deviate after having guided us. And grant us mercy from Yourself, indeed, You are the Grantor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">It is for someone to say: If my action is Pre-decreed by Allaah ( عز و جل), then why should I be punished on committing a sin when it is something already Pre-decreed by Allaah?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The response to this is to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You have no proof in using Allaah’s Pre-decree as an excuse for the sin you committed, because Allaah ( عز و جل) did not compel you to commit such sin; and that when you embark on committing it, you do not have the knowledge that it is Pre-ordained upon you, because man does not know of what was Pre-decreed except after it is manifested. So before committing the sin, why did you not take into consideration that Allaah has Pre-decreed obedience on you and therefore you obey Him?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as in your worldly affairs you strive to take care of that which you consider good, and you turn away from that which you see as evil, then why do you not treat yourself accordingly in affairs pertaining to the Hereafter?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I believe that there is nobody after being told that there are two roads that lead to Makkah, one is safe and facilitated and the other is dangerous and difficult, would take the dreadful and difficult road and then say that: “this has been Pre-decreed for me”! He will certainly take the safe and easy road. Consequently, there is no difference if you are told that there is a road to Paradise and another to the Fire. So, if you take the road to the Fire, then you are like the one who took the dreadful and rough road to Makkah. Yourself will criticize this man who took such a road. So, why do you accept for yourself to take the road to the Fire of Hell and turn away from the road to bliss? And if man has a proof in Pre-decree for committing sins, then it would not be removed by sending the Messengers. [47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[47] Since their sinful acts after the sending of the Messengers would still be according to the Pre-decree of Allaah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">There remains a brief statement regarding al-Qadar, and it pertains to the fact that belief in Pre-decree produces magnificent fruits affecting the conduct and the heart of man.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because if you believe that everything occurs by the Pre-decree of Allaah, then <strong>at times of delight you will give thanks to Allaah</strong>, The Mighty and Majestic, and <strong>you do not become amazed with your own self</strong>. You do not also think that this matter occurred by your own power and strength. You do, however, believe that it is just a cause– in case you have done the necessary mean by which you have attained that which delights you–and that all the good is in the Hand of Allaah. So you will be more thankful for the blessing granted by Allaah, The One free of all imperfection, The Most High. This will motivate you to carry on the obedience to Allaah in accordance with that which He commanded you, and that you do not regard your own self having a favor upon Allaah. Rather, you see that the favor is His, The One free of all imperfection, The Most High. He, The Exalted, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They regard as favor upon you (O Muhammad Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) that they have embraced Islaam. Say: “Count not your Islaam as a favor upon me. Nay, but Allaah has conferred a favor upon you, that He has Guided you to the faith, if you indeed are true.&#8221;</strong></span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-Hujuraat (49): 17].</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Similarly, if a calamity befalls you, you believe in Allaah and submit without being regretful or afflicted with grief on that.</strong> Have you not given thought to the saying of the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“A strong believer is better and is more lovable to Allaah than a weak believer, and there is good in every one of them. Cherish that which gives you benefit and seek help from Allaah and do not lose heart, and if anything (in the form of trouble) comes to you, do not say: If I had not done that, it would have not happened so and so, but say: Allaah did that which He had Pre-decreed, and He does whatever He Wills, and that “if” opens the way for the acting of Shaytan [<em>by casting opposition to Allaah’s Pre-decree in the heart</em>].”</span> [48]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, in the belief in the Pre-decree there is rest to the soul and heart and absence of grief at that which escaped, and of worry and distress at that which is to come. Allaah, The Most High, Says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>No calamity befalls on the earth or in yourselves but it is inscribed in the Book of Decrees (al-Lawh al-Mahfooth) before we bring it into existence. Verily, that is easy for Allaah. In order that you may not grieve at the things that you fail to get, not to rejoice over things which has been given to you.”</strong> </span>[Qur’aan, soorat al-Hadeed (57): 22-23].</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As to the one who does not believe in al-Qadar, there is no doubt that he will grieve and regret at times of calamities, and the Shaytaan will open up for him every new way or possibility [to confuse him and keep him dissatisfied]. And That he will be pleased and become proud and deluded if prosperity befalls him. The Eemaan in the Pre-decree, however, prevents all of this.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Point of clarification based on the hadeeth</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“The creation of everyone of you is collected for the first forty days in his mother’s womb in the form of a Nutfah after which it turns into a Alaqa for an equal period.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AUTHOR: Imaam Muhammad bin Saalih Al-&#8216;Uthaimeen<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah.Com<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p><strong>About the Book:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a small booklet called &#8220;Al-Qadaa wal-Qadar (The Divine Pre-Decree and Ordainment of Allaah), which is a lecture from Imam Muhammad bin Saalih Al-Uthaimeen that was later transcribed and published. The current translation came from the Maktabat-ul-&#8216;llm edition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this treatise, Shaikh Ibn Al Uthaimeen clarifies the correct belief of Ahlus-Sunnah with regard to the Divine Pre-Decree, while refuting the false notions of some groups who deviated with regard to this issue such as the <strong>Qadariyyah</strong>, who believe that Allaah has no part in a person&#8217;s actions, and the <strong>Jabariyyah</strong>, who believe that a person is forced to do perform his sayings an actions by Allaah. He then lists and discusses the four levels for believing in Allaah&#8217;s Divine Pre-Decree, which are: Knowledge, Recording, Will and Creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By presenting this treatise, we hope to provide a basic and easy guide for beginning and intermediate students to learn and understand this fundamental aspect of the Religion, which is also one of the Six Pillars of Faith.</p>

By the Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘<em>Al-Qadr</em> &amp; the hadeeth that Allaah will take two Handfuls of people is true.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>46 &#8211;</strong> Ibn Umar narrates that the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said about these two Handfuls:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘These people are for this (Paradise) and these are for that (Hellfire).’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Umar continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The people went away and they did not differ regarding <em>Qadr</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by al-Mukhalis in ‘al-Fawaid al Muntaqa’, Bazaar and by Tabaraanee in ‘Al-Mu’jam as-Sagheer.  Its isnaad is saheeh according to the conditions of Imaam Muslim.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>47</strong> – Anas narrates from the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed Allaah – Azza wa Jall- took a Handful and said; In Paradise, by My Mercy and took another Handful and said: In the Fire and I am not troubled.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Abu Ya’laa in his ‘Musnad’, al-Uqaylee in ‘Du’afah’, Ibn Adee in ‘al-Kaamil’ and ad-Dulabee in ‘Al-Asma wal-kuna’. The hadeeth is saheeh.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>48</strong> – AbdurRahmaan bin Qatada as-Sulami narrates from the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed Allaah – Azza wa Jall – created Adam then took out the rest of creation from his back and said: These are for Paradise and I am not troubled and these are for the Hellfire and I am not troubled.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a person said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah! How should we perform our actions?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> answered,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As and when <em>Qadr</em> happens.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ahmad, Ibn Sa’d in ‘at-Tabaqaat’, Ibn Hibbaan in his ‘Saheeh’ and al-Haakim.  Al-Haakim said it was saheeh, ath-Dhahabi agreed and it is as they said.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jarir collected an additional wording in his ‘Tafseer’ as did al-Aajurree in ‘Ash-Sharee’ah’ as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And Allaah made the people testify regarding their own selves.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>49</strong> – Abu Darda narrates from the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Allaah created Adam and when He did, He hit Adam’s right shoulder and extracted offspring who were white, as though they were ears of corn.  He hit Adam’s left shoulder and extracted offspring who were black, as though they were charcoal, He said to those from Adam’s right shoulder: To Paradise and I am not troubled and He said to those from Aadam’s left shoulder to Hellfire and I am not troubled.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ahmad and his son in ‘Zawaid al Musnad’, Bazaar and ibn Asaakir in ‘Tareekh Damishq.  I say, its isnaad is saheeh.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>50</strong> – Abu Nadrah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man from the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>became sick.  His friends came to visit him and he began to cry so it was said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘What makes you cry Abu Abdullaah?  Didn’t the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> say to you:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Take from your portion and be settled with that until you meet me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man answered: ‘Of course, but I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed Allaah, -Tabaraka wa Ta’ala- took a Handful with His right and said: These are for this [Paradise], and I am not troubled and He took another Handful i.e. with His Other Hand and said: These are for this [Hell-Fire] and I am not troubled.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man said: ‘I do not know in which of the two Handfuls I am in.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ahmad and Bazaar and its isnaad is saheeh.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Many people presume from these <em>Ahadeeth</em> – and there are many ahaadeeth like these – that a person is forced to do the actions he chooses to do, especially since it had been destined for him from old when he was created for either Paradise or Hellfire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are others who might presume that the issue is chaotic or by chance i.e. that whoever fell in amongst the Right Handful is from the people of bliss and whoever fell in the other Handful is from the people of misery.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is necessary that all of these people together know that concerning Allaah, He is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;There is nothing like unto Him and He is The All-Hearing, The All-Seeing&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ash-Shura (42):11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">not in His Essence nor in His Attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, if Allaah takes a Handful, then it is with His Knowledge, His Justice and His Wisdom.  So Allaah Ta’ala took a Handful with the Right – those whom He knew would obey Him when He commanded them with obedience to Him – and He took another Handful with the others – of whom His knowledge, of their disobedience to Him preceded them when He commanded them to obey Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is impossible, keeping in mind Allaah’s Justice, that the Handful of the Right could be from those deserving of being from the people of the other Handful and vice-versa.  How could that be when Allaah, Azza wa Jall, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Then will We treat the Muslims like the criminals? What is [the matter] with you? How do you judge?&gt;&gt; [Qalam: 35-36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed there is none from each of the two Handfuls from the two different Handfuls who is forced to be from the people of Paradise or the people of Hellfire. Rather this aspect of being from the two different Handfuls is a judgement from Allaah &#8211;<em>Tabaraka</em><em>wa</em> <em>Ta’ala</em>, this judgment is of what will arise from themselves either of <em>Eemaan</em> which necessitates Paradise, or disbelief which entails the Hell-Fire, and Allaah Ta’ala’s refuge is sought from the Hell-Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Both matters of <em>Eemaan</em> and <em>Kufr</em> (disbelief) are matters of choice, Allaah &#8211;<em>Tabaraka</em><em>wa</em> <em>Ta’ala</em>&#8211; does not force any single individual from his creation to anyone of these two mattes (<em>Eemaan</em> and <em>Kufr</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Then whosoever wills, let him believe; and whosoever wills, let him disbelieve&gt;&gt; [Khaf: 29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and this is something which can be testified to, and by necessity it is well-known.  If there was no freedom to choose, then reward and punishment would be frivolous, and Allaah is far removed from frivolity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Truly with great regret we hear from many of the people – and sometimes even from Shaykhs – openly saying that humans are forced and do not have a choice!  By saying this they impose upon themselves the statement that Allaah allows Himself to oppress the people! Even though Allaah Ta’ala clearly mentions that He does not oppress the people even the weight of an atom, with although He has announced that He –Ta’ala- is capable of oppression, but He –Ta’ala- has far removed Himself from oppression, as it occurs in the well-known Hadeeth <em>Qudsi</em>: ‘O my servant! Indeed I have made oppression haram (prohibited) upon Myself . . . . .’  [Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When they were confronted by this reality of the truth, they hastened to use the saying of Allaah Ta’ala: &lt;&lt;He cannot be questioned as to what He does&gt;&gt; [Anbiya: 23] They say explicitly that Allaah Ta’ala may oppress, but He cannot be asked about it!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is far removed from the great falsehood the oppressors say!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What escapes them is that this <em>Ayaah</em> is actually an evidence against them; because the meaning of the <em>Ayaah</em> is, as was researched by the great scholar Ibn al-Qayyim in his book ‘Shifa’ al-Aleel’ and by other scholars, that due to Allaah’s wisdom and His Justice in His rulings it is not allowed for anyone to ask Allaah why He does what He does; because all of Allaah Ta’ala’s rulings are clearly just, so there is no need to question.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are a few quick words regarding the previous Ahadeeth. We tried to remove the doubts of some of the people regarding this issue, if we were successful in this, then this is a blessing, otherwise we refer the reader to extensive research of this dangerous topic, to the likes of the previous book by Ibn Qayyim, and to the books of his Shaykh Ibn Taymeeyah which are comprehensive regarding this important topic.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 33:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="center"><em>The Book of Destiny (Kitab-ul-Qadr) </em></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whether the fate of man is predestined or he himself is the architect of it, is a question which has been very often discussed by scholars of all times. This problem is significantly important as no sensible man. not even the man in the street, can afford to ignore it. Faith in Taqdir (Destiny) has a very deep impact upon our lives and we always find our lives oscillating between determinism and freewill. As a man looks around himself and looks to his own self and within himself, he finds that there are hundred and one things in shaping and reshaping of which he has no hand, e. g. in determining the climate of the land in which he is born, in canalising the courses of rivers which flow therein and in determining the nature of the soil thereof. He finds himself absolutely powerless. As he looks to himself he finds that there are so many things In him which are beyond his control, viz. the measure of intellect he has been endowed with, the shape and form of his physical structure with which he has been sent to this world, and the inclinations and so many other qualities of head and heart which are embedded in his very nature. In all these aspects of life he finds himself helpless before the Great and Mighty Power that created him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, there are so many things in which man finds himself quite empowered. As he looks to the marvellous achievements of man despite all odds, he finds it difficult to believe that he is a mere puppet in the mighty hand of Nature. This problem of predestination and freewill, in which man finds his life hanging, has been adequately solved by the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah. We give below a brief summary of their elucidations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first principle which Islam lays down in regard to Taqdir is that man is neither completely the master of his fate nor is he bound to the blind law of predestination. So far as the sovereignty of Allah&#8217;s Will is concerned, it is all-pervading and nothing falls outside its orbit. Not even a leaf, therefore, stirs without His Will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is His Will that prevails everywhere. To God belongs the sovereignty of Heavens and the Earth. He created what He pleaseth, giving to whom He pleaseth females and to whom He pleaseth males or conjoining them males and females, and He maketh whom He pleaseth barren, verify He hath knowledge and power (xlii. 48).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Men are, therefore, completely subordinate to the overruling power of God, they cannot do anything unless God wills so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; Whom God guideth he is the rightly-guided. Whom he sendeth stray, thou wilt not find a patron to set him right (xviii. 16).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His mighty grasp is, therefore, over everything. The Almighty Lord, Who has created everything and has determined its nature and course, has in His infinite wisdom and mercy conferred upon man a limited autonomy according to which a man is free to do or not to do a certain thing. It is because of this autonomy enjoyed by man that he is hold accountable for his deeds. The concept of human responsibility and that of his answerability for his deeds and misdeeds becomes meaningless if he is supposed to be deprived of this autonomy. There are, a large number of verses in the Holy Qur&#8217;an which make a pointed reference to the autonomy conferred upon man.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Man shall have nothing but that what he strives for (liii. 39).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah does not change the condition of a people until they change it themselves (viii. 53; xiii. 11).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who strive in His path, are guided in the right path, while those who persist in denial and sinful livifig have their hearts sealed against faith (ii. 7, 26; iv. 155; v;. i. 102).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah does not compel belief and leaves the people free to believe or disbelieve (vi. 35, 150; xvi-. 9).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever has done an atorn&#8217;s weight of good shall meet with its reward and whoever has done an atom&#8217;s weight of evil shall meet with its consequences (xcix. 7-8).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It should be borne in mind in this connection that the word Taqdir used in the Qur&#8217;an does not always signify something predestined. It at times implies a measure or the latent potentialities or possibilities with which Allali created man and all things of Nature. For example: He created everything for its Destiny (or its Measure) (xxv. 2). In Sura 54, verse 9 (the words are): We created everything according to a Measure or Destiny. In both these verses Destiny impiies the inward reach of things, their latent potentialities or possibilities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The idea of Destiny as we find in the hadith that God wrote down the decrees regarding the created world fifty thousand years before He created the Heavens and the Earth does not in any way mean that God created a block Universe, finished off and complete, bound to the iron formulae of Nature. Here the idea behind Taqdir is that the creation of this universe is not accidental but something preplanned and pre-conceived and it was shaped according to the Grand Design of the Greatest Designer. There is no element of chance in the creation of this Universe. Everything is well-set and well-planned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The idea that Allah has a foreknowledge of everything that He created and the events unfold themselves exactly according to it, does not imply that human beings have been completely deprived of the freedom of action. The foreknowledge of God is an acknowledged fact, but it should not be interpreter in the sense of predestination, for if we do so we shall have to conceive of eternity as a storehouse of ready-made events, from which they drop one by one like particles of sand in a glass hour. If we take the foreknowledge to be a reflecting mirror we shall have to deprive the Creator and the Controller of the Universe of His Creative activity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dr Muhammad Iqbal has shed a good deal of light over this problem. He says:&#8221; Divine knowledge must be conceived as a living creative activity to which the objects that appear to exist in their own right are organically related. By conceiving God&#8217;s knowledge as a kind of reflecting mirror, we no doubt save His fore-knowledge of future events, but it is obvious that we do so at the expense of His freedom. The future certainly pre-exists in the organic whole of God&#8217;s creative life, but it pre-exists as an open possibility, not as a fixed order of events with definite outlines.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We should bear in mind that the idea of put, present and future is something relative and is conceived by the inite wind of man. It is. however, a great now in the eye of the All-Seeing God. The whole expanse of eternity lies before Him in the shape of now. Knowledge is, therefore, an act of creative activity and not the mere reflection of it. When He decrees a thing it happens and He knows it before it happens. God in Islam is not, therefore, a prisoner of necenity. He is a free Creator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The concept of predestination in Islam, therefore, does not in any way mean helpless abandonment of oneself to otherwise unwelcome fate. It means rather co-operation with God, studying His will and bringing oneself into unison with His Planning Will. Destiny as conceived by Islam is, thus, by no stretch of imagination, fatal to the freedom of conduct and unfoldment of one&#8217;s inherent possibilities; it is a source of inspiration and encouragement and opens up vast fields of human activity. It is not a message of despondency and despair, but a source of solace, comfort and inspiration and a powerful means of evoking a sense of piety and humility and self-surrender to the Will of God. It does not inculcate in mind frustration and pessimism, making his life dark and dreary, devoid of hope and promise for the future, but it teaches him to put his heart and soul in the sublime work as assigned to him by his Master.</p>

The constituents of one of you are collected for forty days in his mother&#8217;s womb in the form of blood, after which it becomes a clot of blood in another period of forty days. Then it becomes a lump of flesh and forty days later Allah sends His angel to it with instructions concerning four things, so the angel writes down his livelihood, his death, his deeds, his fortune and misfortune. By Him, besides Whom there is no god, that one amongst you acts like the people deserving Paradise until between him and Paradise there remains but the distance of a cubit, when suddenly the writing of destiny overcomes him and he begins to act like the denizens of Hell and thus enters Hell, and another one acts in the way of the denizens of Hell, until there remains between him and Hell a distance of a cubit that the writing of destiny overcomes him and then he begins to act like the people of Paradise and enters Paradise.</p>

The narrator came to a person from amongst the Companion of Allah&#8217;s Me ssenger (may peace be upon him) who was called Hudhaifa b. Usaid Ghifari and said: How can a person be an evil one without (cornmittilng an evil) deed? Thereupon the person said to him: You are surprised at this, whereas I have heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saving: When forty nights pass after the semen gets into the womb, Allah sends the angel and gives him the shape. Then he creates his sense of hearing, sense of sight, his skin, his flesh, his bones, and then says: My Lord, would he be male or female? And your Lord decides as He desires and the angel then puts down that also and then says: My Lord, what about his age? And your Lord decides as He likes it and the angel puts it down. Then he says: My Lord, what about his livelihood? And then the Lord decides as He likes and the angel writes it down, and then the angel gets out with his scroll of destiny in his hand and nothing is added to it and nothing is subtracted from it.</p>

I said: Of course, it is something which is predetermined for them and preordained for them. He (further) said: Then, would it not be an injustice (to punish them)?

Thereupon, he said: Of course, it happens as it is decreed by Destiny and preordained for them, and this view is confirmed by this verse of the Book of Allah, the Exalted and Glorious:&#8221; Consider the soul and Him Who made it perfect, then breathed into it its sin and its piety&#8221; (xci. 8).</p>

The adultery of the eye is the lustful look, and the adultery of the tongue is the licentious speech, the heart desires and yearns, which the parts may or may not put into effect.</p>

There would be no escape from it. The adultery of the eye is the lustful look and the adultery of the ears is listening to voluptuous (song or talk) and the adultery of the tongue is licentious speech and the adultery of the hand is the lustful grip (embrace) and the adultery of the feet is to walk (to the place) where he intends to commit adultery and the heart yearns and desires which he may or may not put into effect.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle was asked about the offspring of the  pagans. He said, &#8220;Allah knows what they would have done (were they to live).&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;No child  is born but has the Islamic Faith, but its parents turn it into a Jew or a Christian. It  is as you help the animals give birth. Do you find among their offspring a mutilated one  before you mutilate them yourself?&#8221; The people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What do  you think about those (of them) who die young?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah knows  what they would have done (were they to live).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;No woman should ask for the  divorce of her sister (Muslim) so as to take her place, but she should marry the man  (without compelling him to divorce his other wife), for she will have nothing but what  Allah has written for her.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Usama: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once while I was with the Prophet and Sa&#8217;d, Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b  and Mu&#8217;adh were also sitting with him, there came to him a messenger from one of his  daughters, telling him that her child was on the verge of death. The Prophet told the  messenger to tell her, &#8220;It is for Allah what He takes, and it is for Allah what He  gives, and everything has its fixed time (limit). So (she should) be patient and look for  Allah&#8217;s reward.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 600: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That while he was sitting with the Prophet a man from the  Ansar came and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We get slave girls from the war captives and  we love property; what do you think about coitus interruptus?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said,  &#8220;Do you do that? It is better for you not to do it, for there is no soul which Allah  has ordained to come into existence but will be created.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 601: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Hudhaifa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet once delivered a speech in front of us wherein  he left nothing but mentioned (about) everything that would happen till the Hour. Some of  us stored that our minds and some forgot it. (After that speech) I used to see events  taking place (which had been referred to in that speech) but I had forgotten them (before  their occurrence). Then I would recognize such events as a man recognizes another man who  has been absent and then sees and recognizes him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 602: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ali: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While we were sitting with the Prophet who had a stick with  which he was scraping the earth, he lowered his head and said, &#8220;There is none of you  but has his place assigned either in the Fire or in Paradise.&#8221; Thereupon a man from  the people said, &#8220;Shall we not depend upon this, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;No, but carry on and do your deeds, for everybody finds it easy to do such  deeds (as will lead him to his place).&#8221; The Prophet then recited the Verse: &#8216;As for  him who gives (in charity) and keeps his duty to Allah..&#8217; (92.5) </font></p>
<hr />
<p></a><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.077.603"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 603: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We witnessed along with Allah&#8217;s Apostle the Khaibar  (campaign). Allah&#8217;s Apostle told his companions about a man who claimed to be a Muslim,  &#8220;This man is from the people of the Fire.&#8221; When the battle started, the man  fought very bravely and received a great number of wounds and got crippled. On that, a man  from among the companions of the Prophet came and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Do you  know what the man you described as of the people of the Fire has done? He has fought very  bravely for Allah&#8217;s Cause and he has received many wounds.&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;But he is indeed one of the people of the Fire.&#8221; Some of the Muslims were about  to have some doubt about that statement. So while the man was in that state, the pain  caused by the wounds troubled him so much that he put his hand into his quiver and took  out an arrow and committed suicide with it. Off went some men from among the Muslims to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah has made your statement true.  So-and-so has committed suicide.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Bilal! Get up and  announce in public: None will enter Paradise but a believer, and Allah may support this  religion (Islam) with a wicked man.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr />
<p></a><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.077.604"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 604: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl bin Sa&#8217;d: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>There was a man who fought most bravely of all the Muslims  on behalf of the Muslims in a battle (Ghazwa) in the company of the Prophet. The Prophet  looked at him and said. &#8220;If anyone would like to see a man from the people of the  Fire, let him look at this (brave man).&#8221; On that, a man from the People (Muslims)  followed him, and he was in that state i.e., fighting fiercely against the pagans till he  was wounded, and then he hastened to end his life by placing his sword between his breasts  (and pressed it with great force) till it came out between his shoulders. Then the man  (who was watching that person) went quickly to the Prophet and said, &#8220;I testify that  you are Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The Prophet asked him, &#8220;Why do you say that?&#8221; He  said, &#8220;You said about so-and-so, &#8216;If anyone would like to see a man from the people  of the Fire, he should look at him.&#8217; He fought most bravely of all of us on behalf of the  Muslims and I knew that he would not die as a Muslim (Martyr). So when he got wounded, he  hastened to die and committed suicide.&#8221; There-upon the Prophet said, &#8220;A man may  do the deeds of the people of the Fire while in fact he is one of the people of Paradise,  and he may do the deeds of the people of Paradise while in fact he belongs to the people  of Fire, and verily, (the rewards of) the deeds are decided by the last actions  (deeds)&#8221;. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet forbade vowing and said, &#8220;In fact, vowing  does not prevent anything, but it makes a miser to spend his property.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said (that Allah said), &#8220;Vowing does not  bring to the son of Adam anything I have not already written in his fate, but vowing is  imposed on him by way of fore ordainment. Through vowing I make a miser spend of his  wealth.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 607: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Musa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While we were with Allah&#8217;s Apostle in a holy battle, we  never went up a hill or reached its peak or went down a valley but raised our voices with  Takbir. Allah&#8217;s Apostle came close to us and said, &#8220;O people! Don&#8217;t exert yourselves,  for you do not call a deaf or an absent one, but you call the All-Listener, the  All-Seer.&#8221; The Prophet then said, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdullah bin Qais! Shall I teach you a  sentence which is from the treasures of Paradise? ( It is): &#8216;La haula wala quwata illa  billah. (There is neither might nor power except with Allah).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That the Prophet said, &#8220;No Caliph is appointed but has  two groups of advisors: One group advises him to do good and urges him to adopt it, and  the other group advises him to do bad and urges him to adopt it; and the protected is the  one whom Allah protects.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 609: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I did not see anything so resembling minor sins as what Abu  Huraira said from the Prophet, who said, &#8220;Allah has written for the son of Adam his  inevitable share of adultery whether he is aware of it or not: The adultery of the eye is  the looking (at something which is sinful to look at), and the adultery of the tongue is  to utter (what it is unlawful to utter), and the innerself wishes and longs for (adultery)  and the private parts turn that into reality or refrain from submitting to the  temptation.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr />
<p></a><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.077.610"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 610: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(regarding the Verse) &#8220;And We granted the vision  (Ascension to the heavens &#8220;Miraj&#8221;) which We showed you (O Muhammad as an actual  eye witness) but as a trial for mankind.&#8217; (17.60): Allah&#8217;s Apostle actually saw with his  own eyes the vision (all the things which were shown to him) on the night of his Night  Journey to Jerusalem (and then to the heavens). The cursed tree which is mentioned in the  Qur&#8217;an is the tree of Az-Zaqqum. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Adam and Moses argued with each  other. Moses said to Adam. &#8216;O Adam! You are our father who disappointed us and turned us  out of Paradise.&#8217; Then Adam said to him, &#8216;O Moses! Allah favored you with His talk (talked  to you directly) and He wrote (the Torah) for you with His Own Hand. Do you blame me for  action which Allah had written in my fate forty years before my creation?&#8217; So Adam  confuted Moses, Adam confuted Moses,&#8221; the Prophet added, repeating the Statement  three times. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(the freed slave of Al-Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba) Muawiya wrote to  Mughira. &#8216;Write to me what you heard the Prophet saying after his prayer.&#8217; So Al-Mughira  dictated to me and said, &#8220;I heard the Prophet saying after the prayer, &#8216;None has the  right to be worshipped but Allah Alone Who has no partner. O Allah! No-one can withhold  what You give, and none can give what You withhold, and the fortune of a man of means is  useless before You (i.e., only good deeds are of value).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When taking an oath, the Prophet very often used to say,  &#8220;No, by Him Who turns the hearts.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said to Ibn Saiyad, &#8220;I have kept for you a  secret.&#8221; Ibn Saiyad said, &#8220;Ad-Dukh.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Keep quiet,  for you cannot go beyond your limits (or you cannot exceed what has been foreordained for  you).&#8221; On that, &#8216;Umar said (to the Prophet ), &#8220;Allow me to chop off his  neck!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Leave him, for if he is he (i.e., Ad-Dajjal), then you  will not be able to overcome him, and if he is not, then you gain no good by killing  him.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about the plague. He said,  &#8220;That was a means of torture which Allah used to send upon whom-so-ever He wished,  but He made it a source of mercy for the believers, for anyone who is residing in a town  in which this disease is present, and remains there and does not leave that town, but has  patience and hopes for Allah&#8217;s reward, and knows that nothing will befall him except what  Allah has written for him, then he will get such reward as that of a martyr.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 617: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara&#8217; bin &#8216;Azib: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I saw the Prophet on the Day of (the battle of) Al-Khandaq,  carrying earth with us and saying, &#8220;By Allah, without Allah we would not have been  guided, neither would we have fasted, nor would we have prayed. O Allah! Send down Sakina  (calmness) upon us and make our feet firm when we meet (the enemy). The pagans have  rebelled against us, but if they want to put us in affliction (i.e., fight us) we refuse  (to flee).&#8221; (See Hadith No. 430, Vol. 5). </font></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Imaam Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyyah<br />
</span>Source:His monumental book Ad-Daa wad-Dawaa [The Sickness and the Cure] (pg.22 -23)</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;">al-ibaanah Publications</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here there occurs a <strong>very popular question</strong> and it is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">If the thing that is being supplicated for is already decreed for the servant, then there is no doubt that it is going to come to pass for him, regardless of whether he supplicates for it or not. And if it has not been decreed for him, then it will not come to pass, regardless of whether he asks Allaah for it or not.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">There is one group that perceives this question to be valid and so they have abandoned the supplication and are of the view that there is no benefit in doing it. These people, along with their excessive ignorance and misguidance are in clear contradiction, for if we were to follow their opinion, it would require us to reject all the different means for attaining something (desired).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it can be said to one of them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If satisfying your appetite and quenching your thirst were already decreed for you, then there is no doubt that they are going to come to pass, whether you eat and drink or you don&#8217;t. And if they were not decreed for you, they will not come to pass, whether you eat and drink or you don’t.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, if a child were decreed for you, then you will definitely receive it, whether you have sexual intercourse with your wife or you don&#8217;t. And if that was not decreed for you, then it will not come to pass. Thus there is no need for marrying, having sexual relations and so on and so forth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who says such a statement? Is it one possessing common sense or a beast? Rather, even the animal has a natural inclination (fitrah) towards seeking the means of attaining something (desired), which (for example) will give it sustenance and livelihood. So the animals have more common sense and possess more understanding than these types of people who are like cattle – nay, far worse!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Some of them try to be clever and say:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Preoccupying oneself with supplication falls into the realm of worship solely – Allaah will reward the one supplicating, without that having an effect on what he is asking for in any way. According to this type of person, there is no difference between supplicating and refraining from supplicating by heart and tongue, with regard to that having an effect on attaining what is being asked for. And according to them, the relation of the supplication to it (what is being asked for) is like its relation with silence. There is no difference between them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Another group, more slick than this one says:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, the supplication is a sign, which Allaah displays as a symbol that a matter has been carried out. So when Allaah grants his servant the ability to supplicate, it is a sign and a symbol that the matter he was requesting has been carried out. This is just as if one were to see a frigid black cloud during the winter season. It is a sign and an implication that it will rain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They say: Similarly is enacting good deeds with respect to reward, and committing disbelief and sins with respect to punishment – they are pure signs for the occurrence of (either) reward or punishment – not means (by which the result will be attained).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, according to them, with the matters of breaking, kindling and destroying – none of these things serves as a means for the occurrence (result) of a wreck, fire and death, respectively. Nor is there any connection between those things and what results from them, other than the fact that they are normally paired together – not that one is caused due to the means of the other!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They have contradicted perceptual observation and common sense with this opinion, as well as revelation and fitrah (natural inclination), not to mention all of the other intellectual groups. Rather, those with intellects laugh at them!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The correct view:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a third category, apart from those mentioned by the questioner. And it is that <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>the decreed result is preordained along with its proper means, which lead to its occurrence. One of these means is the supplication</strong></span>. It is not preordained just like that, without any means (leading to its occurrence), rather it is preordained along with its proper means (which will ensure its occurrence). So when a person comes across the means, the decreed matter will come to pass. And if he does not come across those means, the decreed matter is denied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So satisfying one’s appetite and quenching one’s thirst are preordained with (the means of) eating and drinking. Children are preordained with (the means of) sexual intercourse. Harvesting crops is preordained with (the means of) planting and, the withdrawal of the soul from an animal is decreed with slaughter. Likewise, entrance into Paradise is preordained with (good) deeds, while entrance into the Hellfire is preordained with (bad) deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This category is the true one. And it is the one that the questioner has been deprived of and not granted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p><span style="color:#ffffff;">Tags: dua can change destiny hadith, dua can change taqdeer hadith, can dua change destiny of marriage, nothing can change the divine decree except dua, can dua change qadr islamqa, nothing can change qadr except dua</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">If someone asks how is it that Allah wants something yet He dislikes it?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How one can understand such concept?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We all know that there are many drug prescriptions disliked and hated for their smell and taste, yet when it is known that there is a cure in them, we take them and we love them for that! Traveling a long and difficult journey to achieve something desired and loved is another example. If it is known that a surgical removal of a diseased part of the body would save the rest of it, it is disliked and hated from one side and liked from another. So, it is not contradictory to have love and hate combined in addressing one matter. This is true with the created being, so what about Allah the Creator Whom there is nothing hidden from Him and to Whom belongs the Perfect Wisdom? He, the Exalted, hates a matter in itself and, on the other hand, wants it because of its link to yet another matter, or because it is a means that leads to something He loves. In all of His actions, Allah has the Perfect Wisdom. We may recognize part of His Wisdom, or the general aspects of it, but not its complete details. One vivid case about this subject, is the Creation of Iblees, who is the sponsor of every corruption and evil in this world. He is hated from one side, yet Allah wanted his creation because he is a means for many beloved things to Allah, and that there is great wisdom behind his creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, there is wisdom behind the creation of calamities, sufferings, hardships, etc. that speak about the Favors of Allah, His Justice, and His Mercy. Some of this wisdom includes[1].</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Tests for the believers.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Training and strengthening of the believer’s faith.</li>
<li>An evidence for the weakness of man and his need for his Rabb, and that he has no success unless he humbles himself to his Creator.</li>
<li>A way to expiate sins and an elevation to higher degrees in the Sight of Allah.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There is nothing (in the form of trouble) that touches the believer, even the pricking of a thorn, except that Allah decrees a good for him or effaces one of his sins because of that.” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a means for receiving reward for both, the ill Muslim and the Muslim doctor in charge.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Witnessing the occurrence of favors and blessings after calamities and hardships, has more profound effects and generates a meaningful and proper appreciation of Allah’s Power, Wisdom, Mercy and Justice. He, the Exalted, is to be Praised on all of His Decrees.</li>
<li>An appreciation for good health and the well-being of one’s self.</li>
<li>A reminder about what is more devastating, Hell. A lesson to remember and a build up of eagerness for Paradise.</li>
<li>&#8230;And many more wisdoms of which we may know or we may not know. We cannot say: How did Allah allow this and prevent that? Nor how did He create this, and how come He did not create that? …Nothing escapes His Ability, and nothing occurs in His Kingdom except that He had willed it; He owes us nothing; if He gives, then its His Favor and if He prevents, then it is His Justice.</li>
</ul>
<p>“If Allah (Subhana wa ta&#8217;aala) puts a person under certain tests and trials and the person recognizes that He must resort to Allah alone seeking His help, then this is a good sign for him; the trials turn to purification and mercy. If, on the other hand, he rejects, complains, and turns away from Allah and resorts to human beings like him, then this is a bad sign for him; the trials turn to punishment and misery upon him”[3].</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: AL-FAWAID: A Collection of Wise Sayings</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Almighty says,which means,<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you. Allah knows but you do not know.&#8221;</span> (AI-Baqarah, 2:216)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this Qur&#8217;anic Verse, there are several judgments, meanings and benefits for the servant.    If the    servant knows    that misfortune can produce a desirable thing, and that the desirable thing can produce a misfortune, he would not feel secure against the harm that can come from delight, and he would not lose hope of delight to come from harm, for he does not know the outcomes of things. Verily, it is Allah Who knows about that which the servant does not know, and in this context the following issues must be noted:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nothing is more beneficial for him than abiding by the judgments of Allah, even if it is difficult for him at the beginning, because all its outcomes are good, delightful, and pleasurable. In the same way, nothing is more harmful for him than committing what is forbidden, even if he loves it. All its outcomes are pain, grief, evil and misfortune.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the mind bears little pain in comparison to the great pleasure and abundant good that it will experience, and likewise man is expected to avoid little in exchange for great rewards and preventing great pain and long term evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this way, we can see that the perception of the ignorant does not go beyond the basics of life; his perception does not reach the goals, but the intelligent person always keeps his eye on the goals behind his actions in life.<br />
<span style="color:#339966;"><br />
<strong>The intelligent person perceives forbidden things like delicious food, which contain fatal poison. Whenever its pleasure arouses his interest, the reality of the poison would push him away from it. Also, he perceives the orders of Allah as bitter medicine that leads to good health and recovery. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever its bitterness urges him not to take it, the reality of its usefulness leads him to comply. This requires knowledge that is more than the rudiments of the religion in order to understand the essential goals. It also requires strong patience to adjust oneself to it, in order to bear the difficulties that will be encountered for the sake of the goal. So if he loses certainty and patience, it would be difficult to achieve the goal, and on the other hand if his certainty and patience is strong, every difficulty would be rendered easy for him for the sake of permanent good and eternal pleasure.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are other meanings of this verse. It also requires the servant to leave all his affairs in the Hands of the One Who knows the outcomes of all things, and to be pleased with whatever He chooses for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"><span style="color:#993300;">Also, the meanings of the verse include the fact that he should not propose or choose for his Lord, and should not ask Him for that which he has no knowledge of, for his harm and ruin may be in it and yet he does not know. He should simply ask his Lord to choose good for him and make him pleased with His choice, for that indeed would be the best ending. Also when he  leaves all his affairs to his Lord, and is satisfied with His choice for him, Allah will support him by providing him with ability, determination and patience. He, the Almighty would also keep him away from the evil that the servant would have encountered if he had chosen for himself. He would show him some of the positive outcomes of His Choice, which he would not have attained if he had chosen for himself.</span><br />
</span><br />
Such thinking relieves him of the burdens of trying to choose for himself as Allah frees his heart from estimations and arrangements, which fluctuate in difficulty. And in spite of this, the servant would always be surrounded by what was initially preordained for him. If he is pleased with the Choice of Allah, the preordainment would grant him what is praiseworthy, worthy of thanks and worthy of Allah&#8217;s Mercy. Otherwise, the preordainment would incur on him all that is dispraised and unworthy of Allah&#8217;s Mercy, because it was his own choice. When he truly leaves his affairs to Allah and truly becomes pleased with that, he would be surrounded by kindness and care in the preordainment, and he would be under the care and kindness of Allah. His Kindness protects him from that which he fears and His Care makes it easy for him to bear that<br />
which He preordained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the pre-ordainment is implemented upon the servant, the greatest cause of its implementation would be his trying to avoid it. Therefore, there is nothing more beneficial for him than submission.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Complaint Of The Ignorant Person<br />
[From ‘al-Fawaa·id’ (p.114) of Imaam Ibnul-Qayyim -rahimahullaah]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The ignorant person complains about Allaah to the people, and this is the limit of ignorance of the One complained about and the one complained to; for if he had known his Lord he would not have complained concerning Him, and if knew the people he would not complain to them.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the Salaf saw a man complaining to another man about his poverty and need, so he said: ‘O person! By Allaah! You have not done anything more than complain about One Who is Merciful to you, to one who is not merciful to you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In that regard it has been said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘If you make a complaint to the son of Aadam, </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>then you are only complaining about the Merciful One to someone who is not merciful.’</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the one who is truly aware complains to Allaah alone; and the one who is the most aware, from those who are truly aware, is the one who makes his complaints to Allaah about himself, not about the people; so he is therefore complaining about the reasons which cause the people to overwhelm him. So he is looking to His Saying -He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#008000;">And whatever misfortune befalls you, then it is because of the sins that your hands have committed</span>.] [Sooratush-Shooraa (42):30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#008000;">Whatever good reaches you, is from Allaah; but whatever evil befalls you, then it is on account of yourself.</span>] [Sooratun-Nisaa· (4):79]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#008000;">Why is it that when a single disaster struck you, even though you had struck the enemy with one twice as great, you said: ‘From where is this?’ Say: ‘It is on account of yourselves.’</span>] [Soorah Aal `Imraan (3):165]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So the levels are three</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>the lowest/most despicable of them is that you complain about Allaah to His creation; and </strong></span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>the highest of them is that you complain about yourself to Him; and </strong></span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>the middle one is that you complain about His creation to Him.&#8221;</strong></span></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
