<p>The Prophet (ﷺ) stated, </p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>“Ahead of you are days of patience, when holding onto the religion will be like holding onto hot coals, and whomsoever holds onto His religion in that time, then his reward will be the reward of fifty men.” The Companions said, “O Messenger of Allah, fifty times the worth of their reward?” He said, “Rather fifty from you.”</strong> </p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Collected by Abu Dawood, At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Mājah, Al-Hākim who declared it authentic, Adh-Dhahabi agreed and Al-Albāni declared it Saheeh in As-Saheehah (no. 494).</p>

<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color" style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First Point:</strong></p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">It should not be understood that “Saheeh al-Bukhaaree” and “Saheeh Muslim” encompass every authentically reported statement of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم). Rather, there are many authentic Hadeeth collected by other scholars that neither one of them (al-Bukhaaree &amp; Muslim) recorded in their collections.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>an-Nawawee said:</strong></p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">“The intent of both al-Bukhaaree and Muslim was only to collect a large number of authentic Hadeeth just as a book of Fiqh [2] may collect texts pertaining to many different issues, not encompass every possible issue. However, if there is a Hadeeth having an authentic chain of narration that one of them may have left out, or even both of them, then they would have had a reason to do so or they may have recorded a similar Hadeeth in its place. From what is well-known from them, it may be assumed that perhaps they felt it better not to record it, or perhaps they even forgot. They also may have left certain Hadeeth out in order not to make their collections even longer than they are, or they felt what they have recorded was sufficient pertaining to a certain topic. They may have had other reasons as well.”</p>



<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color" style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second Point:</strong></p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Scholars unanimously agree and consider “Saheeh al-Bukhaaree” and “Saheeh Muslim” to be the most authentic written works of Hadeeth. Regarding this, the famous scholar, Ibn Taymiyyah, said, “There is no Hadeeth they both agree to be authentic except that it is undoubtedly authentic.” He also said, “The vast majority of their narrations, the scholars of Hadeeth know with certainty that the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) actually said them.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left"><strong>[7:16 minutes]</strong><br /><strong>Sharh-ul-Usool-ith-Thalaathah : Lesson 07 &#8211; Part B</strong><br /><strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>



<p><strong>Previous Class</strong>:<br /> <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2018/04/07/allaah-created-us-and-gave-us-provision-and-did-not-leave-us-without-purpose/">The first matter is that Allaah created us and gave us provision and did not leave us without purpose</a></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Rather He sent a Messenger to us</strong></span>.<sup>4</sup></p>

<p>[4]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih Al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation</strong></p>



<p>Since it is the case that we may not carry out worship based upon what we think is good nor upon <em>taqleed</em> (blindly following) so-and-so and so-and-so from the people, then therefore Allaah sent to us Messengers to make clear to us how we are to worship him, because acts of worship are <em>tawqeefiyyah</em> (dependent upon text) it is not permissible that Allaah be worshipped except with that which He has legislated.</p>



<p>So acts of worship are <em>tawqeefiyyah</em> – restricted to text, to that which the Messengers <em>‘alaihimu<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> came with. So the wisdom behind sending the Messengers is that they should make clear to the people how they are to worship their Lord, and for them to forbid them from <em>shirk</em> (association of others along with Allaah) and from <em>kufr</em> (disbelief) in Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. This is the duty of the Messengers <em>‘alaihimu<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam. </em>And therefore he <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> said:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;">من عمل عم لا ليس عليه أمرنا فهو رد</span></h3>



<p><strong>“Whoever does an action which our affair is not in accordance with, then it will be rejected”.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>So worship is <em>tawqeefiyyah</em> (dependent upon text), and <em>bid‘a</em> (innovations) are rejected, and baseless superstitions and ideas are rejected and blind following is rejected. Acts of worship are not taken except from the <em>sharee‘ah </em>(revealed law) which the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu alaihi wa sallaam</em> came with.</p>



<p>His saying, “<strong>Rather He sent to us a Messenger</strong>”: he is Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallaam </em>the seal, the last one of the Prophets. He sent him to make clear to us why we were created, and to make clear to us how we are to worship Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and to forbid us from <em>shirk </em>and <em>kufr</em> (unbelief) and from sins. This was the duty of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallaam, </em>and he clearly conveyed the message and he fulfilled the trust which was given to him, and he gave sincere advice to the nation <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam, </em>and he explained fully and made clear, and he left us upon a clear white ground, its night is just the same as its day, no-one deviates away from it except one who is destroyed, and this is just as is in His saying, He the Most High:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;">الْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِي وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ الْإِسْلَامَ دِينًا</span></h3>



<p><strong><span style="color:#008000;">This day have I completed your religion for you and perfected my favour upon you and are pleased for you with Islaam as your religion</span>.</strong> [5:3]</p>



<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p>



<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Its checking has preceded. (Mentioned by al-Bukhaaree in disconnected form as <u>h</u>adeeth 7350 in the Book of clinging to the Book and the Sunnah Chapter 20. And the <em><u>H</u>adeeth</em> is reported by Muslim with a fully connected chain as a <u>h</u>adeeth of ‘Aa’ishah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu ‘anhaa.</em>)</p>

<strong> Shaykh Ahmad Najmee | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong>135</strong>]<span style="color:#993300;"><strong> If you hear a man attacking the narrations (<em>athaar</em>) or rejecting the narrations or desiring some thing other than the narrations then have doubt about his Islam. And do not doubt that he is the person of Desires and Innovator.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong>136</strong>] <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that Ruler&#8217;s oppression does not reduce or remove anything that Allaah has made obligatory upon the tongue of his prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). His oppression will be upon himself and your acts of obedience along with him will be complete if Allaah,the Most High,wills. Meaning, the congregational prayer and the <em>jumu&#8217;ah</em> prayer along with them and fighting <em>jihaad</em> along with them. And all acts of obedience accompany them in that , for you will have your intention.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 62 : Point 107</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>He who limits himself to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa salam</em>) and that which his Companions and the Jamaa’ah were upon is successful and triumphs over all the people of innovation and his body is relaxed and his religion is safe, if Allah wills, since the Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said, “<span style="color:#800000;">My Ummah will split…</span>” and the Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) told us which would be the saved sect, saying, “<span style="color:#800000;">That which I and my Companions are upon</span>” </strong></span>[1]<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>. This is the cure, the explanation, the clear affair and the straight and distinct road. The Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said, “Beware of going to extremes and harshness. Beware of exaggeration and cling to the ancient religion” </strong></span>[2].</p>
<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Reported by at-Tirmidhee (no.2643) and others and it is hasan, as has preceded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] This is not a hadeeth of the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>), but is a saying of Ibn Mas’ood (<em>radiallaahu anhu</em>) as reported by ad-Daarimee in his Sunan (1/50/nos.144. 145), ‘Abdur-Razzaaq in his Musannaf (10/252) and Ibn Nasr in as-Sunnah (no.85) and others and is saheeh as such.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Abbaas (<em>radiallaahu anhu</em>) reports that the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said, <strong>“Beware of exaggeration in the religion for, indeed, those before you were destroyed due to exaggeration in the religion.”</strong> Reported by Ahmad, an-Nasaa’ee and Ibn Maajah and it is saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas’ood (<em>radiallaahu anhu</em>) reports that the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said, <strong>“ Those who go to extremes are destroyed.”</strong> Reported by Ahmad, Muslim and Abu Daawood (Eng. trans. 3/1294/no.4591) and it is saheeh</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 47: Point 76</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And it is not permissible to withhold <em>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah </em>(sincere advice) from anyone from the Muslims, whether righteous or sinful in matters of the religion.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> So, whoever withholds it then he has acted deceitfully towards the Muslims and whoever acts deceitfully towards the Muslims then he has acted deceitfully towards the religion, and whoever acts deceitfully towards the religion then he has shown treachery towards Allaah, His Messenger and the believers.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/ad-deenu-an-naseehah-the-religion-is-sincerity" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying,<span style="color:#993300;"> “<strong>And it is not permissible for you to withhold <em>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincere advice) from anyone from the Muslims whether they be righteous or sinful,” </strong></span><em>An-<strong>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</strong></em> (sincerity) is to be pure and free of <strong><em>ghish</em> </strong>(deceit) and a thing that is <em>naa<u>s</u>i<u>h</u></em>; a thing that has its quality of <em>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em>, it is a thing that is <em>khaali<u>s</u></em> (pure). So, the believer, it is obligatory that he should be <em>naa<u>s</u>i<u>h</u></em> (sincere); meaning that he should be pure and free of hypocrisy; <em>nifaaq</em> and he should be pure and free of <em>ghish</em> (deceptiveness) and he should be pure and free of <em>khadee`ah</em> (cheating). His outward aspect and his inward aspect should be just the same with regard to truthfulness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity) is the religion just as the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The religion is an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</strong> <strong>(sincerity), the religion is sincerity, the religion is sincerity; an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah. We said, ‘Towards whom O Messenger of Allaah?’ So he said, ‘Towards Allaah and towards His Book and towards His Messenger and towards the rulers of the Muslims and their common folk.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what is meant by it (<em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em>) here is that a person is free of every blameworthy characteristic and that he adorns himself with all the noble and virtuous manners and characteristics. So, the man who is <em>naa<u>s</u>i<u>h</u></em> (has this quality of sincerity) is the one who is not deceptive, does not have any <em>ghish</em> (deceptive) towards anyone. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever deceives us is not from us.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the opposite of <em>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity) is <strong><em>al-ghish</em></strong> (deceptiveness). And the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> repeated his saying <em>ad-deenun</em> <em>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (the religion is sincerity) three times for emphasis and to stress its importance and he limited the religion; all of it to being <em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>An-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity) towards Allaah</strong> and His Messenger; this is with regard to <em>`aqeedah</em> (creed and belief). So, a person will not be a Muslim unless his `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) is sound and is free of <em>shirk</em> and his actions are free of innovations (<em>bid`ah)</em> and he is one who is following the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So, this person, he is the one who is <strong><em>an-naa<u>s</u>i<u>h</u></em></strong> (one who is sincere) towards Allaah and His Messenger, i.e the one whose deeds are free of <em>shirk</em> and free of innovations.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sincerity towards the Messenger</strong> <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is to truly believe; to have <em>eemaan</em> in his Messengership, and to love him, and to respect, and honour him <em>`alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam,</em> and to take him as an example to follow, and to give precedence to his saying over the saying of everyone, and to leave off innovations and new introductions, which are something that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> warned against, and to believe him regarding whatever he informed about regarding things of the unseen of the past and the future, and to avoid whatever he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> forbade. This is sincerity towards the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His (<em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saying, <strong><em>“…and towards His Book…”</em></strong> the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, it is the Qur&#8217;aan such that you have <em>eemaan</em> that it is the speech of Allaah sent down; not created, it is not the speech of anyone else as is said by the people of misguidance; and that you learn it, and teach it, and that you act upon it, and that you acquire understanding of its meanings, and that you reflect upon it. This is sincerity towards the Book of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High; learning, and teaching, and understanding, and acquiring knowledge of it, and acting upon it. And likewise, from sincerity towards the Book of Allaah is to be plentiful in its recitation and not to be neglectful with regard to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity)<strong><em> “…towards the rulers of the Muslims…”</em></strong> they are those who are in charge of the affairs, those in authority, that you obey them in that which is not disobedience to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. And that you do not remove your hand from obedience, and that you do not rebel against them, and that you do not seek out their mistakes and their hidden faults and expose them to the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from sincerity (<em>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah)</em> towards them is that if you have knowledge (`<em>ilm)</em> and you have the ability to sincerely advise them that you do so personally between yourself and them; you cause the advice to reach them and inform them about mistakes, which occur from them or from their subjects, you let them know about that but you do not speak about them in gatherings, for this will be a case of <em>ghish</em> (treachery). So, <em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity) is that you convey sincere advice from yourself to them. This is from sincerity towards the person in authority.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, from sincerity towards the person in authority is to carry out the duty that he puts you in charge of carrying out, whether it is a <em>wa<u>z</u>eefah</em> (duty or a post) or being placed in charge of something or other than that from the affairs of the religion and the worldly life, that you carry the duty out which the one in authority has entrusted you with in the best manner and that you do not miss anything of it out and if you see any deficiencies then you inform the one in authority between yourself and him. You inform him of the deficiencies so that he can remedy it. This is sincerity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from sincerity towards those in authority is to make <em>du`a</em> (supplication) for them that they be rectified since if they are sound and rectified, the subjects will be sound and rectified and that you make <em>du`a</em> (supplication) for them. So, if you see a man who is a student of knowledge who does not make supplication for them or who criticises making supplication for them then you should know that he is treacherous (<em>ghaash)</em> and he is not one who is sincere towards the person in authority.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And sincerity<strong><em> “…towards the common Muslims,” </em></strong>is that you direct them to what is correct; and you warn them against errors, and that you command the good and forbid the evil, and that you teach the one who is ignorant, and that you remind the person who is heedless, and that you love for him the good that you love for yourself, and to have compassion for the poor person, and you give charity (<em><u>s</u>adaqah)</em> for the needy. This is <em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, that he gives good advice to the person who consults him and he guards secrets for one who trusts him regarding something and to safeguard things which are entrusted with you. He should be sincere from all aspects. And sincerity is with regard to buying and selling such that he does not deceive and does not trick.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is <em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity) in brief. So, whoever is not like that then he is treacherous and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever deceives us then he is not from us.”</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by al-Bukhaariyy in disconnected form; meaning in a chapter heading, you’ll find it there in the <em>Book of Eemaan</em>; the 2<sup>nd</sup> book, chapter 42.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it’s reported in connected form by Imaam Muslim (55) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Tameem ad-Daari <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and Imaam Muslim does not have the repetition of his saying (<em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>): <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Ad-deenun na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</strong> (the religion is sincerity)…</span><strong>”. </strong>Meaning; there in <u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> Muslim, it only occurs once that he said: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Ad-deenun na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</strong> (the religion is sincerity)</span>.<strong>”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, that occurs being reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad and Aboo Daawood and at-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee and others and at-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee said it is <em><u>h</u>a<u>s</u>an, <u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (good, authentic).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s side point: Shaykh al-Albaaniyy, likewise, declared it with the addition there as being <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (authentic).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Reported by Muslim (101) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and also reported by Muslim (102 ) with the wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever deceives then he is not from me.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The 1<sup>st</sup> wording in Muslim is:<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">The 2<sup>nd</sup> wording reported by Muslim is:<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> <strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong> <em><u>h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said with regard to this first part of the <u>h</u>adeeth:<strong> </strong>“Ad-deenun na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah (the religion is sincerity) and then when they asked, “To whom, oh Messenger of Allaah?” He said, “firstly, lillaah (towards Allaah).”<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, “By obedience to Him and not disobeying Him and by implementing `<em>Uboodiyyalahum</em> (servitude towards Him) and by establishing His Tawheed with regard to His <em>Ruboobiyyah</em> (Lordship) and with regard to His `<em>Uloohiyyah</em> (His sole right to all worship) and with regard to His names and attributes and that you seek by performance of your deeds His face &amp; that you are sincere in your deeds, which you carry out. So, you are sincere in them and true in them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> <strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong> <em><u>h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> mentioned more or less the same point. He added a point also, he had a no. of points, from them was,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Having love for the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and also making supplication for; <em><u>s</u>alaat</em> and <em>salaam</em> upon Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. </em>And not writing just it&#8217;s abbreviated forms like  SAW, SAAW, or SAAS. We seeks Allaah’s refuge from this abridging  of <em><u>s</u>alaat</em> and <em>salaam</em> upon Allaah’s Messenger,  as this is from the <em>Raafi<u>d</u>ah Shi`a</em>.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 42 : Point 66</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And if you hear a man speaking against the narrations and not accepting them or denying anything from the narrations of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam,</em> then doubt his Islaam since he is a person having a despicable opinion and saying. No attack may be made upon Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> nor upon his companions since we have only come to know of Allaah and His Messenger and the Qur&#8217;aan and what is good and what is bad in this world and the Hereafter by way of the narrations. So, the Qur&#8217;aan needs the Sunnah more than the Sunnah needs the Qur&#8217;aan.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/do-not-deny-or-speak-against-the-narrations-of-the-messenger-of-allaah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And if you hear a man speaking against the narrations and not accepting them or denying anything from the narrations of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> then doubt his Islaam,”</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> Since from the meaning of the testification that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah is to obey him with regard to whatever he commanded and to believe him regarding whatever he informed of and to avoid whatever he forbade and prohibited and that Allaah is not worshipped except with that which He legislated. This is the meaning of the testification that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا آتَاكُمُ الرَّسُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَاكُمْ عَنْهُ فَانتَهُوا ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whatever the Messenger gives you then accept it and take it and whatever he forbids you from then keep away from it.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ashr (59), <em>aayah</em> 7)</p>
<p><strong>يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَطِيعُوا اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُوا الرَّسُولَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe, obey Allaah and obey the Messenger.</span><br />
</strong><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratun-Nisaa· 4, </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> 59)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is obligatory upon the Muslim is that he complies with whatever occurs in the a<u>h</u>aadeeth from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> since they are the second revelation after the Qur&#8217;aan. Because the fundamental evidences in Islaam upon which there is agreement are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly,</strong> the Qur&#8217;aan;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly,</strong> the Prophetic Sunnah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And thirdly,</strong> consensus; <em>Al-Ijmaa`.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These evidences, it is not permissible for a person to say, “I will not accept as evidence except the Qur&#8217;aan alone and I will not accept the Sunnah as evidence,” as is said by the Khawaarij and whoever follows their way and they say that the Qur&#8217;aan is <em>mutawaatir</em> (reported by huge numbers of people at every level of transmission so huge that they cannot be gathered together upon a lie) so they say, “the Qur&#8217;aan is <em>mutawaatir</em> and is rendered secure from deficiencies but as for the Sunnah then it is what is narrated by narrators and is therefore open to deficiencies.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is to accuse the whole <em>Ummah</em> (nation) and its scholars and the companions and the <em>taabi`een</em> (those who conveyed the narrations) in lacking in reliability and of lacking in trustworthiness whereas the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed about those people in his saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“It will soon occur that a man who is full (belly) will be reclining upon his couch and will say &#8220;<em>Between us and you is the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. So, whatever we find in it to be permissible then we will take it to be permissible and whatever we find in it to be forbidden then we will take it as being forbidden</em>.” Then He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said, “Indeed, I have been given the Qur&#8217;aan and the like of it along with it.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em>`alayhissalaatu wassalaam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“May Allaah make bright the face of a person who hears my saying and he retains it and he coveys it just as he heard it or sometimes one who has something conveyed to him may better comprehend it than one who actually heard it.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em>`alayhissalaatu wassalaam</em> said when he gave the <em>khu<u>t</u>bah</em> (address) in Arafah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Let the one who witnesses amongst you convey to the one who is absent.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the one who heard conveys from the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. This is a trust; <em>amaanah</em>, which was established by the narrators of <u>h</u>adeeth and by the men of <u>h</u>adeeth, may Allaah reward them with good, Aameen. And they protected the Prophetic Sunnah from foreign things and from lies and they conveyed it pure and clear just as it came from the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> faithfully and this is from the miracles of this Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.</em> So, the Sunnah is not an arena for withholding or for making accusations. Rather, it is obligatory to believe it and it is obligatory to act upon it just as it is obligatory to act upon the Qur&#8217;aan because it is <em>wa<u>h</u>iyy</em> (revelation) from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said with regard to the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا يَنطِقُ عَنِ الْهَوَىٰ</strong> &#8211; 53:3</p>
<p><strong>إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا وَحْيٌ يُوحَىٰ</strong> &#8211; 53:4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He </strong>(the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>)<strong> does not speak from his desires, it is just revelation inspired. </strong></span>(Sooratun-Najm (53), <em>aayah </em>3-4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the <em>a<u>h</u>aadeeth</em> are revelation from Allaah even though their wordings are from the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. As for the Qur&#8217;aan then its wording and meaning is from Allaah, the Majestic and Most High and as for the Sunnah and the Prophetic <em>a<u>h</u>aadeeth</em> then their meanings is from Allaah and their wordings are from the speech of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> who does not speak from his own desires. So, his <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> wordings are preserved from error and are true and are not open to doubt. So, whoever denies the Sunnah then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) because he has discontinued the second fundamental. And the Qur&#8217;aan must have the Sunnah because it explains it and clarifies the meaning of the Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p><strong> وَأَنزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ الذِّكْرَ لِتُبَيِّنَ لِلنَّاسِ مَا نُزِّلَ إِلَيْهِمْ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We have sent down to you the reminder </strong>(the Qur&#8217;aan)<strong> for you to then explain to the people that which was sent down to them. </strong></span>(Sooratun-Nahl (16), <em>aayah </em>44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the Sunnah clarifies the Qur&#8217;aan and explains the Qur&#8217;aan because the Qur&#8217;aan comes with some things, which are <em>mujmalah</em> (unspecified) such as the prayer (<u>S</u>alaah) and the Zakaah and the Hajj and <u>S</u>iyyaam (fasting), the command for these is in the Qur&#8217;aan but how to perform them is not mentioned in the Qur&#8217;aan. So, the Qur&#8217;aan comes with some things, which are unspecified such as the prayer and the Zakaah and the Hajj and fasting, the Sunnah explains them and clarifies them. It explains the Zakaat and its amounts and fasting when it is to begin and when it is to end and the rights of Hajj; how a person should perform Hajj. So, he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Take your rights of Hajj from me.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Pray just as you have seen me praying.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High said:</p>
<p><strong>لَّقَدْ كَانَ لَكُمْ فِي رَسُولِ اللَّهِ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ  </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is indeed for you in Allaah’s Messenger a fine pattern of conduct to follow.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-A<u>h</u>zaab (33), <em>aayah </em>21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Sunnah therefore explains the Qur&#8217;aan and clarifies it and indicates it and the person who says, “I will act upon the Qur&#8217;aan but I will not act upon the Sunnah” he is a <em>ka<u>th</u>aab</em> (liar) for he has not acted upon the Qur&#8217;aan because the Qur&#8217;aan has within it:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا آتَاكُمُ الرَّسُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَاكُمْ عَنْهُ فَانتَهُوا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whatever the Messenger gives you then take it and whatever he forbids you from then desist.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ashr (59), <em>aayah</em> 7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is within it:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا يَنطِقُ عَنِ الْهَوَىٰ</strong> &#8211; 53:3</p>
<p><strong>إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا وَحْيٌ يُوحَىٰ</strong> &#8211; 53:4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And he </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the Messenger </span><span style="color:#008000;"><em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em></span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> does not speak from his desires, it is just revelation inspired.</span> </strong>(Sooratun-Najm (53), <em>aayah </em>3-4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur&#8217;aan, it is stated that the Sunnah clarifies it.</p>
<p><strong> وَأَنزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ الذِّكْرَ لِتُبَيِّنَ لِلنَّاسِ مَا نُزِّلَ إِلَيْهِمْ  </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We sent down to you </strong>(Prophet Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>)<strong> the reminder </strong>(Qur&#8217;aan)<strong> so that you should clarify to the people what has been sent down to them. </strong></span>(Sooratun-Na<u>h</u>l (16), <em>aayah </em>44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when he leaves off acting upon the Sunnah then he has not acted upon the Qur&#8217;aan, which he claims that he acts upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the people are some who make a distinction between the a<u>h</u>aadeeth and who say &#8211; &#8220;<span style="color:#993366;">the <u>h</u>adeeth which is <em>mutawaatir</em> (<u>h</u>adeeth which has so many narrators at every level of transmission that it is impossible they could have got together and invented it) brings about knowledge (<em>ilm</em>) but the <u>h</u>adeeth which are <em>aa<u>h</u>aad</em> (which doesn’t reach that level), it only amounts to <u>dh</u>ann (surmise/uncerainity)&#8221;</span>. And this is <em>baa<u>t</u>il</em> (false and futile) because everything which is authentic from the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and which is established, it brings about `<em>ilm</em> (knowledge) whether it’s <em>mutawaatir</em> or <em>aahaad</em>. So, there is no distinction to be made between the level of proof of the <u>h</u>adeeth which is authentic. It is obligatory to comply with all of it and to act upon it without any distinction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Soofees also do not act upon the Sunnah, indeed not even upon the Qur&#8217;aan. They only act upon their own tastes and their own feelings and they say, <span style="color:#993366;">“We take from Allaah directly and we do not take by way of the Messenger because we have reached Allaah so therefore, we have no need of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And the Messenger is just for the common folk, those who have not yet reached Allaah.”</span> And this is from the most baseless falsehood and the most open disbelief and Allaah’s refuge is sought. Aameen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Or he denies anything,” </strong>whoever denies the Sunnah in general and says, “<span style="color:#993366;">The Sunnah is not to be acted upon, only the Qur&#8217;aan is to be acted upon&#8221;</span> or who denies a part of the Sunnah, which are the authentic a<u>h</u>aadeeth and says, “<span style="color:#993366;">They are not to be acted upon</span>” and some of them say, “<span style="color:#993366;">Hadeeth is not acted upon except with the condition that it conforms to the Qur&#8217;aan</span>” and this is <em>baatil</em> (false and futile) and is an accusation against the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> that he may bring something which contradicts the Qur&#8217;aan. So, this saying is not permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> sometimes came with things, which were not in the Qur&#8217;aan such as the prohibition of being married to a woman along with her paternal aunt and her maternal aunt. The Qur&#8217;aan contains the prohibition of being married to two sisters, whereas, the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“A man may not combine a woman and her paternal aunt nor between a woman and her maternal aunt.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is obligatory to act upon whatever the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And if you see a person doing any of this; rejecting the authentic narrations from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> or denying anything from them then accuse his Islaam for he is a man who is despicable in his position and his saying.” </strong>The person who says this, either he will be from the Khawaarij or he will be from the Jahmiyyah and the Mu’tazilah or he will be from the Soofees; those who claim that they have no need of the a<u>h</u>aadeeth because they have reached Allaah and they take from Allaah directly and they say, “<em>You people take your religion from someone who is dead but we take from the Everliving One Who never dies</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And no accusation may be made against Allaah’s Messenger<em><u> s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> nor against his companions,” </strong>No accusation may be made against Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> because he is rendered secure from error by Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. So, the person who accuses the Messenger or attacks him and says that he follows his desires or that he behaves unjustly or that he oppresses and the like of that then this one is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise the person who makes an attack upon the companions of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> because Allaah is pleased with them and has praised them and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was pleased with them and praised them and repeated words of praise upon them and they were the best of generations. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The best of you are my generation…”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em>alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Do not abuse my companions for by the one in Whose hand is my soul, if one of you were to spend the like of U<u>h</u>ud in gold, it would not reach even a handsful amount of one of them nor even a half of it.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَالسَّابِقُونَ الْأَوَّلُونَ مِنَ الْمُهَاجِرِينَ وَالْأَنصَارِ وَالَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوهُم بِإِحْسَانٍ رَّضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُوا عَنْهُ وَأَعَدَّ لَهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي تَحْتَهَا الْأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا أَبَدًا ۚ ذَٰلِكَ الْفَوْزُ الْعَظِيمُ</strong> &#8211; 9:100</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And the First and Foremost ones from the Muhaajireen and the An<u>s</u>aar and those who followed them upon good, Allaah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him and He has prepared for them gardens of Paradise beneath which rivers flow, they will remain forever therein, that is the tremendous success.</span> </strong>(Sooratut–Towbah (9), <em>aayah </em>100)</p>
<p><strong>لَّقَدْ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ إِذْ يُبَايِعُونَكَ تَحْتَ الشَّجَرَةِ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah was pleased with the believers when they gave you the pledge beneath the tree.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fat<u>h</u> (48), <em>aayah </em>18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tree is the tree where the pledge; <em>bay</em>`<em>ah</em> was given at <u>H</u>udaybiyyah; the pledge that the companions gave to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in the 6<sup>th</sup> year after the Hijrah, pledge of <u>H</u>udaybiyyah, <em>Bay’atu</em> <em>Ri<u>d</u>waan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> فَعَلِمَ مَا فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ فَأَنزَلَ السَّكِينَةَ عَلَيْهِمْ وَأَثَابَهُمْ فَتْحًا قَرِيبًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So, He knew what was in their hearts and He sent down tranquillity upon them and He rewarded them with a victory close at hand.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fat<u>h</u> (48), <em>aayah </em>18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said at the end of the Soorah:</p>
<p><strong>مُّحَمَّدٌ رَّسُولُ اللَّهِ ۚ وَالَّذِينَ مَعَهُ أَشِدَّاءُ عَلَى الْكُفَّارِ رُحَمَاءُ بَيْنَهُمْ ۖ تَرَاهُمْ رُكَّعًا سُجَّدًا يَبْتَغُونَ فَضْلًا مِّنَ اللَّهِ وَرِضْوَانًا ۖ سِيمَاهُمْ فِي وُجُوهِهِم مِّنْ أَثَرِ السُّجُودِ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ مَثَلُهُمْ فِي التَّوْرَاةِ ۚ وَمَثَلُهُمْ فِي الْإِنجِيلِ كَزَرْعٍ أَخْرَجَ شَطْأَهُ فَآزَرَهُ فَاسْتَغْلَظَ فَاسْتَوَىٰ عَلَىٰ سُوقِهِ يُعْجِبُ الزُّرَّاعَ لِيَغِيظَ بِهِمُ الْكُفَّارَ ۗ وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ مِنْهُم مَّغْفِرَةً وَأَجْرًا عَظِيمًا</strong> &#8211; 48:29</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah and those who are with him…</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Fat<u>h </u>(48), <em>aayah 29</em>)<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning the companions (<em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>aabah</em>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>…those who are with the Messenger (the companions) are stern against the disbelievers, merciful amongst themselves, you will see them bowing and prostrating seeking the bounty of Allaah and His pleasure. Their sign will be upon their faces from the trace of prostration, that is their description in the Towraat… </strong></span>(Sooratul-Fath (48), <em>aayah </em>29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, their description, which is mentioned in the Towraat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">…and their description in the Injeel.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fath (48), <em>aayah </em>29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning their description in the Injeel, which was sent down to ‘Eesaa is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They are like a plant, which sends out a side shoot, which strengthens it and it becomes firm and stands straight upon its stalk, the sowers are pleased at it so that the disbelievers should become enraged at them.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fath (48), <em>aayah </em>29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this <em>aayah</em> is an example about the description of the companions. So, this shows that the person that becomes enraged at the companions or who hates them, he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) as is shown by the end of the <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">…so that the disbelievers should become enraged at them.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Fath (48), <em>aayah </em>29)<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Because we have only come to know of Allaah and we have come to know of His Messenger and we have come to know of the Qur&#8217;aan and we know of good and evil in this world and the Hereafter by way of the <em>aathaar</em> (narrations).” </strong>By way of the narrations, which they narrated and they are the a<u>h</u>aadeeth, which they reported from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So, whoever makes an attack upon the narrations is making an attack upon the Islamic legislation because it was narrated in that case by narrators who were liars and who are not trustworthy and this is the intent of the Jews and the Magians to plot against the Muslims. So, a group of them abuse the companions and their intent is to abolish the <em>sharee</em>`<em>ah</em> (Islamic legislation) for if they can abolish its carriers and its narrators and they can attack the best ones of this nation then their attacking other than the companions is even more likely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“For indeed the Qur&#8217;aan has more need of the Sunnah than the Sunnah has for the Qur&#8217;aan.” </strong>The Qur&#8217;aan has more need of the Sunnah as we have mentioned because the Sunnah explains and gives explanation of the Qur&#8217;aan. So, there are some things left unexplained in the Qur&#8217;aan, which have been explained in the Sunnah. So, Allaah has commanded the prayer but He has not made clear the number of its rak`ahs and He has not made clear the description of the prayer and this was made clear by the Messenger<em><u> s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Pray as you have seen me praying.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <u>H</u>ajj comes in the Qur&#8217;aan <em>mujmalan</em> (unexplained) and its explanation was left to the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So, he performed <u>H</u>ajj with the Muslims in the Farewell <u>H</u>ajj and he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Take your rights of <u>H</u>ajj from me.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, learn from my actions and my sayings what will enable you to carry out your rights of pilgrimage and Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<p><strong>لَّقَدْ كَانَ لَكُمْ فِي رَسُولِ اللَّهِ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ لِّمَن كَانَ يَرْجُو اللَّهَ وَالْيَوْمَ الْآخِرَ وَذَكَرَ اللَّهَ كَثِيرًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is for you in Allaah’s Messenger a fine example for whomever has hope in Allaah and in the Last Day and who makes mention of Allaah a great deal.</span> </strong></span>(Sooratul-A<u>h</u>zaab (33), <em>aayah </em>21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the Qur&#8217;aan has need of the Sunnah for it to clarify it. So, the person who accepts Qur&#8217;aan only then he will cut off the Qur&#8217;aan from that which explains and clarifies it and this is the goal of the people of misguidance and those who have deviation in their hearts. Because the people of deviation accept one part of the evidences and they leave the other part which explains it and clarifies it off and they take one part of the evidences, which are unclear and they leave the clear and decisive part, which clarifies it and explains it. This is the way of the people of deviation and the way of those who pretend to have knowledge and the ignorant ones; those who claim knowledge and those who do not know the correct way of deriving evidence nor the principles of establishing proof. So, they make forbidden and declare things lawful without any insight and Allaah’s refuge is sought, <em>aameen,</em> because they have not followed <em>al-manhaj al-`ilm</em> (the correct knowledge based methodology). Rather, they have just learned by themselves or from their own books or with those who are ignorant like themselves.</p>

<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-people-do-not-introduce-an-innovation-except-that-they-lose-its-like-from-the-sunnah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a tremendous point of wisdom and it is something reported as a saying from the Salaf, that they said, <strong>“The people do not introduce an innovation, except that they lose its like from the Sunnah.”</strong> [01] Because the Sunnah and innovation cannot be combined, except that one of them will expel the other, so a person cannot be an innovator and a person of Sunnah. Rather either he will be an innovator or a person of the Sunnah, they cannot both be combined in him. So one of them will necessarily expel the other, and this is from the harmful effects of innovation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this point of wisdom narrated is confirmed by experience, and the witness for this and its proof is, that you will find the people of innovation having hatred for the authentic ahaadeeth [02], and having hatred for the matters of the Sunnah (sunan). And the worst enemy to them and the most hateful thing that they can hear, is that it is said, “Such and such hadeeth prohibits such and such.” or, “It forbids such and such.” They do not want to hear the hadeeth and the sunan which contradict what they are upon. So this is a sign that the Sunnah and innovation cannot come together.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the person who is upon the Sunnah, then if he hears a hadeeth from Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam then he becomes happy with that. And he adds something good to the good which he already possesses. And he adds knowledge to his knowledge. The person of Sunnah he is happy with the ahaadeeth of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. Whereas the person of innovation he has aversion for the ahaadeeth of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. This is something very clear in the innovators. And they wage war in the matters from the Sunnah, because these things put an end to the innovations which they are upon. And this is a deterrent against innovation, and that they also cause matters of the Sunnah to pass away, and they cause love of matters of the Sunnah to pass away from the hearts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“So beware of forbidden matters.”</strong> Because forbidden matters have no good in them, whether these forbidden matters relate to shirk [03] or kufr [04] or matters of sin, because Allaah will not forbid something and there is good in it. He will only forbid something which is purely evil, or something which the evil of it outweighs the good or an evil which is equal. So if good and evil come together in something, then if the evil is more or equal then you should avoid it, and if the good is more then there is no harm in taking hold of it. And a slight evil found in it along with the greater good is excused.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying,<strong> “For every new introduction is a bid`ah (an innovation) and every innovation is misguidance.”</strong> &#8211; this is the textual wording of the hadeeth of al-`Irbaad ibn Saariyah radiyAllaahu `anhu who said, “Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam gave us an admonition from which the hearts trembled and the eyes shed tears, so therefore we said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, it is as if it is the admonition given by one who is departing (a farewell admonition), so therefore advise us.’ So he, sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, said, <span style="color:#333300;">‘<strong>I council you with being dutiful to (having taqwaa/ being fearful of) Allaah, and with hearing and obeying, even if a slave is appointed over you.’”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in one narration, <span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“an Abyssinian slave whose head is as if it is a raisin.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“`For whoever lives long amongst you, then he will see very great differing. So adhere to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly guided orthodox Khulafaa after me. Cling onto it and bite onto it with your premolar teeth. And beware of newly introduced affairs.’”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a warning, “iyyaaka”, “beware of”. It is a word of warning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“`Beware of newly introduced affairs, for every newly introduced affair is a bid`ah (an innovation) and every innovation is misguidance.””</strong></span> [05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in one narration there occurs the wording,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“and every misguidance will be in the Hellfire.”</strong></span> [06]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every newly introduced affair is a bid`ah, an innovation, and what is meant by a newly introduced affair is: in the Religion. As for newly introduced affairs with regards to customs/everyday habits and with regard to worldly benefits and with regard to types of food and drinks and clothing, then these are innovations in the language sense. They are not innovations in the legislated sense, but rather newly introduced affairs in the Religion, they are the forbidden innovations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this contains a refutation of those who divide innovations into categories, dividing them into good innovations and bad innovations, and permissible innovations. And they say that they fall under the five rulings [07]; then this is a mistake, because innovations, bida`, in the Religion, all of them are misguidance, by the textual statement of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, that he said, <span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“For every new introduction is an innovation and every innovation is misguidance.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I think that what they have done is to enter those things which are an innovation with regards to the language, and they call these things good innovations. And innovations in the linguistic sense are permissible, for example, building schools and building accommodation buildings for students of knowledge and such as putting vowel points on the mus.hafs, (the written copy of the Qur·aan) and the like of that. They call these good innovations, but these are not innovations, these are matters that follow on from the sunnahs and are revival of the sunnahs. So building schools and building accommodation buildings for students of knowledge and printing the mus.hafs and putting vowel points on them, all of these are an aid upon knowledge, so they are something good and they are sunnahs. So these people are either taking good practices and calling them innovations, or they are calling matters of custom innovations when they do not enter into the Religion, because they are from the affairs of this world, so they do not enter into the Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And misguidance and its people will be in the Fire.”</strong> &#8211; as occurs in the hadeeth, “and all misguidance will be in the Fire.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as occurs in the hadeeth of the different sects (that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said), <span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“And this nation will split into seventy-three sects, all of them in the Fire except for one.”</strong></span> [08]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a proof that the people of innovation will be in the Fire and they vary in level. From them are those who will be in the Fire because of their disbelief, and some of them will be in the Fire because of his sin and from them will be those who remain in the Fire forever, and from them will be those who do not remain forever in it; but rather the ruling of such a person will be the same as the ruling of the people of the major sins.

</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] It has already preceded that this was the saying of Hassaan ibn `Attiyah rahimahullaah&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> As for this report, that it is reported from him that he said, “No people introduce an innovation in their Religion except that Allaah removes from their Sunnah its like, then He does not return it to them until the Day of Resurrection.” This report is mentioned as the saying of Hassaan ibn `Attiyyah, reported by ad-Daarimee and al-Laalikaa·ee and declared authentic by Shaykh al-Albaanee in his checking of al-Mishkaat. Shaykh Al-Albaanee said in al-Mishkaat (no. 188), “And it is also related as being a saying of Aboo Hurayrah reported by Abul-`Abbaas al-Asam in a hadeeth.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Refer to the continuation of the footnote in the Maktabatur-Rushd edition of this book for a quote from Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah on this point with regard to the people of innovation).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] Editor’s note: plural of the Arabic word ‘hadeeth’<br />
[03] Editor’s note: polytheism<br />
[04] Editor’s note: disbelief</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[05] This (hadeeth of al-`Irbaad ibn Saariyah) has preceded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> It was reported by Imaam Ahmad and Aboo Daawood and At-Tirmithee and Ibn Maajah. This hadeeth was declared saheeh (authentic) by Shaykh Al-Albaanee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[06] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> This particular wording occurs in a hadeeth of Jaabir ibn `Abdillaah radiyAllaahu `anhumaa reported by an-Nasaa·ee as hadeeth 1578, in the Book of the Two `Eed prayers, Chapter 22, How The Khutbah is Given; also reported by Ibn Khuzaymah, where he mentioned Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam used to give a khutbah (an address) and he would praise Allaah and repeat words of praise upon Him as He deserves, and then he would say,<strong><span style="color:#008080;"><span style="color:#333300;"> “Whomever Allaah guides then none can misguide him, and whomever He misguides, then none can guide him. And the truest speech is the Book of Allaah, and the best way is the Way of Muhammad. And the worst of affairs are the newly introduced affairs, and every newly introduced affair is an innovation, and every innovation is misguidance, and all misguidance is in the Fire.</span>” </span></strong>Shaykh alAlbaanee declared that narration saheeh (authentic) also.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[07]<strong> Translator’s side point:</strong> What they meant was the five rulings of Islaam, the five rulings of all affairs, meaning: 1. those things which are obligatory, 2. those things which are recommended, 3. those things which are permissible 4. those things which are disliked and 5. those things which are forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[08] The checking for this has preceded.<br />
<strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Reported by at-Tirmithee and al-Haakim, and declared hasan (good) by Shaykh al-Albaanee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[09] Translator’s side point abridged from the explanation of Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee rahimahullah on the same point as the author,<strong> “And know that the people do not introduce innovation until they leave its like from the Sunnah”</strong>: He mentions the seriousness of this matter of introducing innovations, that when a person does that, he does two forbidden things. A person introduces an innovation into his Religion, then he has introduced an innovation which is forbidden and he will have abandoned a matter of the Sunnah which is also something forbidden. Then he gives some evidences for that; some aayahs from Sooratul-Anfaal the 24th and 25th aayahs; Sooratun-Noor, the 24th soorah, aayahs 48-50; and Sooratun-Nisaa·, aayah 115; and he explains those aayahs. Then he says at the end of the discussion,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So there is a threat upon the person who abandons matters of the Sunnah and introduces innovations, there is a tremendous threat away from it&#8230;” And he mentions more of these aayahs. “&#8230;And likewise as occurs in His Saying, He the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And whoever contends with the Messenger after the Guidance has been made clear to him, and follows others than the way of the Believers, then We will land him in the path he has chosen and We will burn him in the Fire of Hell, and what an evil destination.</strong></span>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), aayah 115)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And just as occurs in the saying of the Prophet sallAllaahu alayhi wa salaam,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>‘All of my nation will enter Paradise, except for those who refuse.’ So they said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah and who would refuse?’ So he said, ‘Whoever obeys me he will enter Paradise, and whoever disobeys me then he has refused.’ </strong></span>(Hadeeth reported by al-Bukhaaree, no. 7280)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The person of innovation is one who is disobedient to Allaah and his Messenger. He is following his desires, venerating his own self, claiming by his condition that his opinion and his desires are better than that which the Messenger sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam came with. So therefore beware from being from those people, such that you will have the threat of the Fire upon you, and Allaah&#8217;s refuge is sought. And Allaah is the One who grants success.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Irshaadus-Saaree fee Sharhis-Sunnati lil-Barbahaaree, pp 50-52)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee hafizahullaah mentioned in his explanation the famous saying of Imaam Sufyaan Ath-Thowree rahimahullaah, <span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“Innovation is more beloved to Iblees (the devil) than sin, because a person may repent from sin, but a person does not repent from innovation.”</strong> </span>(Reported by al-Laalikaa·ee in Sharh Usool I`tiqaad Ahlis-Sunnah).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And that is because the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah have firmly established all of the Religion, and it has become clear to the people. So it is upon the people to comply and to follow.”</strong></span></p>

<p><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-sunnah-the-jamaaah-have-firmly-established-all-of-the-religion" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, may Allah have mercy upon him, said, <strong>“That is because the Sunnah and the Jamaa&#8217;ah have firmly established all of the Religion.”</strong> “That” indicating what has preceded with regard to the encouragement upon adhering to the way of the People of the Sunnah and the Jamaa&#8217;ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it has preceded that what is meant by Ahlus-Sunnah (the People of the Sunnah), are those who adhere to the Sunnah of the Messenger sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam and to his way. They are the people of the Sunnah. And the Jamaa&#8217;ah, they are those who come together upon the Truth and they do not split.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the evidence for this:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And cling all of you together to the Rope of Allaah and do not separate. </strong></span>(Soorah Aal `Imraan (3), aayah 103)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they gathered upon the Truth and they do not separate away from it. And they do not disagree and differ concerning it. They are the people of the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for: <strong>Those who split up their religion, and they are sects&#8230;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah the Majestic and Most High says to His Prophet:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;then you have nothing to do with them at all. Their affair is for Allaah; then He will inform them of what they used to do.”</span></strong> (Sooratul- An&#8217;aam (6), aayah 159)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And that is because the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah have firmly established (ahkamaa),”</strong> meaning they have precisely established; so ihkaam means precision; they have precisely established the whole of the affair of the Religion. All of it is contained within the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah. Just as He sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008080;"><strong>“Whoever lives long from amongst you, then he will see very great differing so adhere to my Sunnah.”</strong></span> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nothing will protect from the evil of this differing except adherence to/clinging onto the Sunnah of the Messenger sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam. And it is what the Messenger sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam and his Companions were upon in `aqeedah (creed and belief) and in `ibaadah (worship) and in dealings and in behaviour and in manners. And they are the Saved Sect, from amongst the 73 sects; all of them will be in the Fire except for one. They said, “Which it is, O Messenger of Allaah?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this one which is exempted from amongst these sects, it is a distinctive group; who is it? He sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam said in explanation of it,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Whoever is upon the like of what I am upon and my Companions.”</strong></span> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That which the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and his Companions were upon is the Sunnah. So whoever adheres to it will be saved; and therefore they are called ‘The Saved Sect’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And it has become clear to the people. So therefore it is upon the people to do ittibaa` (to comply and follow).”</strong> It has become clear to the people, that the affair of the Religion, all of it, lies in adherence to the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah. So no one will oppose what the people of the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah were upon except for the people of misguidance:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So what is there after the Truth, except for misguidance. </span></strong>(Soorah Yoonus (10), aayah 32)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever leaves off the Truth he will fall into misguidance; and the Truth is what the people of the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah are upon to the exclusion of others besides them.[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[01]</strong> This is a part of the hadeeth of al-`Irbaad ibn Saariyah, radiyAllaahu`anhu and its checking has already preceded (page 46).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> It is a hadeeth which is declared saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaanee rahimahullaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[02]</strong> Reported by at-Tirmithee in his Sunan and Ibn Nasr al-Marwazee in as-Sunnah and al-Haakim in alMustadrak and al-Aajurree in ash-Sharee`ah and al-Laalikaa·ee in Sharh Usool I`tiqaad Ahlis-Sunnah&#8230; (and many others). At-Tirmithee said the hadeeth is hasan ghareeb mufassar, a hadeeth which is hasan with a singular chain which explains the other narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh al-Albaanee discussed this hadeeth and declared (it) hasan. It has enough supporting witnesses to support the hadeeth, that it is declared hasan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[03]</strong> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee rahimahullaah said on this point (point 3), “He, may Allah have mercy upon him, said, “And that is because the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah have firmly established the whole affair of the Religion, and it has become clear to the people. So what is upon the people is to follow/comply”. I say, the `aqeedah of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah is clear in its source references and it is tied to the Sunnah and its people. So whomever Allaah wishes good for, then he guides him to those source books. And he makes easy for him to be a companion of the carriers of this `aqeedah, and I mean by it, carriers upon the way of the Ahlus-Sunnah wal Jamaa`ah. And whoever Allaah wishes evil for then He makes easy for him whatever he was created for.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So whoever grows up at the hands of the people of the Soofees and the people of <strong>Soofism</strong> then he will think that that is right guidance and he will go astray and lead others astray. And whoever grows up at the hands of the people of the `aqeedah of the <strong>Jahmiyyah</strong> and he lives upon it and accompanies its people, he will think that that is the Sunnah and he will go astray and lead others astray. And whoever grows up at the hands of the people of the ideas of the <strong>Mu`tazilah</strong>, he will think that that is the Sunnah and he will go astray and lead others astray. And whoever grows up at the hands of the people of the `aqeedah of the <strong>Ash`arees</strong> he will think that that is the Sunnah and he will go astray and lead others astray. And whoever grows up at the hands of the people of <strong>rafd (the Raafidah)</strong>, and the <strong>Shee`ah</strong>, those who curse and abuse the Companions of the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and belittle them, he will think that that is the Truth he will go astray and lead others astray. And whoever grows up at the hands of the <strong>Khawaarij</strong> those who declare the Muslims to be kaafirs (disbelievers), he will think that that is the Truth he will go astray and lead others astray.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“However the people of these deviant sects they must necessarily find certain gaps/flaws/faults in their `aqeedah, which should make clear to them the deficiencies in the methodology which they are upon in belief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And likewise the people of irjaa· (the <strong>Murji·ah</strong>), and likewise the people who are upon the present day calls which give attention just to virtuous acts, and they treat (matters of) `aqeedah lightly, so that the people think that they are upon the Truth, because they see them outwardly adhering; whilst they actually stay away themselves from the very foundation of `aqeedah (creed and belief) and they incite others to avoid it, which is tawheed, the tawheed of worship, (Towheed al-Uloohiyyah). They have nothing to do with it, and they keep other people away from it as well; and they treat lightly whatever infringes it or diminishes it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So what is important is that whoever wishes salvation, should adhere to the Book of Allah, then to the books of the Sunnah; and they are well known such as the Saheeh of al-Bukhaaree,and the Saheeh of Muslim and the Sunan al-Arba&#8217; (The four Sunan), the Musnad of Imam Ahmad. And what follow from that, from the books of hadeeth, and those books that gather the narrations of the Salaf such as: the Musannaf of Ibn Abee Shaybah, and the Musannaf of `Abdur-Razzaaq, and the Musannaf of Sa&#8217;eed ibn Mansoor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And the books of `aqeedah (creed and belief) such as: At-Towheed of Ibn Khuzaymah, and such as ArRadd `alal-Jahmiyyah, (The refutation of the Jahmiyyah) of Imaam Ahmad, Kitaabus-Sunnah (the Book of the Sunnah) of `Abdullaah the son of (Imaam) Ahmad, Radd `alal-Jahmiyyah (Refutation of the Jahmiyyah) by `Uthmaan ibn Sa`eed Ad-Daarimee, Sharh Usool I`tiqaad Ahlis-Sunnah of al-Laalikaa·ee, al-Ibaanatul-Kubraa of Ibn Battah, and the books of Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah, and of IbnulQayyim, and of Muhammad ibn `Abdil-Wahhaab and other than that from the books. These are the books which make the Truth clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And beware of slipping away with the hizbiyyeen, (the sectarians, the people of partisanship) of taking their books and then following their restricted path, and proceeding upon their crooked methodology. “Beware, O my brother Muslim, of taking the books of those people, because their truth is mixed with falsehood and the Sunnah which they have is mixed with bid`ah (innovation).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if you want the pure fountain with no pollution in it, then adhere to the Book of Allaah, and to the books of the Sunnah and to the books of the narrations. And follow the way of the people of the narrations (Ahlul-Athar), those who take knowledge with its chain of narration going all the way back to the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam from their Prophet salawaatullaahi wa salaamuhu `alayh. Whatever they said does not contradict the Truth which they were upon. So here you will know the saying of the author, “And that is because the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah have clearly/precisely established the affair of the Religion, all of it, and the Truth has become clear to the people, so it is upon the people to follow and to leave off innovating.” Therefore you will know that this is speech which is fully appropriate, and it is binding upon you also to abandon the books of the people of innovation if you want salvation for yourself. May Allaah guide and grant me and you that we take on board the Truth and that we abandon every falsehood; and Allaah grants success.” (Irshaadus-Saaree fee Sharhis-Sunnati lilBarbahaaree)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And the foundation which the Jamaa`ah is built upon is the Companions of Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, may Allaah have mercy upon all of them. And they are the Ahlus-Sunnah walJamaa`ah, the People of the Sunnah and the United Body upon the Truth.

<p><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And the foundation upon which the Jamaa`ah is built upon”</strong> – who are the Jamaa`ah who have this status? They are the Companions of Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and those who come after them from the Taabi`een (their successors) and from the successors of the Taabi`een, and the most excellent generations. They are the Jamaa`ah and whoever follows them from the later peoples, they are the Jamaa`ah; those whom it is obligatory upon the Muslims to be with, whatever harm comes upon him and whatever threats and whatever blame and whatever attacks &#8211; he should still have patience upon that and he should bear it, as long as he is upon the Truth. So he should not deviate away from the Truth, rather he should have patience upon whatever befalls him, otherwise he will just be a target for those people with evil intentions and the callers to evil and the callers to misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the first and foremost ones from the Muhaajireen (the Muslims who emigrated from Makkah) and the Ansaar (the Muslims of Madeenah who gave them shelter) and those who followed them upon good. Allaah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him</strong></span>.[1] (Sooratut-Towbah (9), aayah 100)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High, when He mentioned the Muhaajireen and the Ansaar in Sooratul-Hashr, He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And those who come after them they say, O our Lord forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in Eemaan and do not place any ill feeling in our hearts towards those who truly believe. O our Lord, you are Compassionate, Merciful.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Hashr (59), aayah 10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the one who comes later he follows the earlier one from the people of the Truth and good even if there is a long period of time between him and them, he adheres to what they were upon no matter what it costs him, he should have patience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“the Companions of Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam”</strong> &#8211; from the Muhaajireen and the Ansaar because they were the ones who accompanied the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and they fought jihaad along with him and they aided him and they bore the Religion and they conveyed it to us; so they are the intermediaries between us and between Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. So those people who abuse the Companions or belittle them, they only want to demolish Islaam; however they come with this ploy. So when they speak against the Companions and they devalue them, then what will remain at that time from the intermediary that is between us and the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam? Their intent is to cut off the connection with the first and foremost ones from the Muhaajireen and the Ansaar so that the nation will go astray; otherwise what else could lead them to abusing the Companions? Did they have any dispute with the Companions with regard to money or something else? Have the Companions caused them any personal harm when there are many centuries between them and the Companions?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what led them to this is hatred in the hearts, because the Companions they are the ones who bore this Religion. So they want to cut off the link between the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and his nation so that this Religion falls. This is their intent.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and they (the Companions of Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) are the People of the Sunnah and of the Jamaa`ah (the United Body of the Muslims upon the Truth).”</strong> The Companions of Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and those who came after them, those who followed them upon good, they are the People of the Sunnah, meaning the people of the correct path; and it is the ‘Sunnah’ which we have explained in this book (the Sunnah referring to the path that which the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and his Companions were upon).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they are the true Jamaa`ah; but as for the uniting of others besides them, upon false and futile matters then they are not called the Jamaa`ah even if they are many in number.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">You think that they are all together but their hearts are actually divided.</span></strong><br />
(Sooratul-Hashr 59, aayah 14)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Jamaa`ah is whoever is upon the Truth. So the person who says, “I am with such-and-such hizb (party); this group is a jamaa`ah and you people say, “Adhere to the Jamaa`ah” and they are a jamaa`ah.” So we say to them, “Who said to you that those people are the Jamaa`ah. The Jamaa`ah is those who are upon the Truth; whoever is upon the Sunnah, they are the Jamaa`ah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“So whoever does not take from them (the Companions radiyAllaahu `anhum) then he has gone astray and has innovated.”</strong> Whoever does not take his Religion from the Companions, those who are the conveyers of the Book and the Sunnah, then he is not upon the Truth. So if they are attacked and accused then what they convey is nullified, and Allaah’s refuge is sought. And the intent of the enemies of Allaah and His Messenger is indeed to nullify Islaam, however they came with this filthy trick in order to cause a separation between the later people and the early people from the Muslims, so that it will be easy for them to devour the later people and easy to chew them up. But as for if the people tie themselves to the first Jamaa`ah and to the Book and the Sunnah then that will never be easy for them to do, indeed it will be impossible for them to chew them up by the permission of Allaah. His saying, “then he has gone astray” – meaning he has strayed away from the Truth and become lost.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“and he has innovated”</strong>&#8211; Innovation is whatever is from the matters of worship or from matters of creed and beliefs or from sayings and it does not have a proof from the Book and the Sunnah (that is an innovation). He sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;"><strong>“Whoever does an action which our affair is not in accordance with, it is rejected.”</strong> </span>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in a narration,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#339966;">“Whoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it then it is rejected.”</span></strong> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;"><strong>“And beware of newly introduced matters for every newly introduced matter is a bid`ah (an innovation) and every innovation is misguidance”</strong></span> [5].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So innovation is whatever has been introduced into the Religion and it is not from it. And how can it be known that it is not from it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it does not have a daleel, a proof, then it is not from the Religion, because Allaah the Majestic and Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>This day have I completed your Religion for you</strong></span> [6]<br />
(Sooratul-Maa·idah (5), aayah 3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Religion is complete, and all praise is for Allaah; it does not accept any additions. So it is just upon us to come to know of the Religion which Allaah the Mighty and Majestic completed, and to cling to it and that we abandon whatever is besides it from additions and from things which people deem to be good introductions and from supplements and from other than that, because these things only take people farther away from Allaah the Majestic and Most High. And there will follow a clarification that: No people introduce an innovation except that its like (a like amount of it) will be taken away from the Sunnah.[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the correct and straight path, adhering to the Jamaa`ah, adhering to the Sunnah and abandoning innovations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying,<strong> “And every innovation is misguidance”</strong> – so there is no such thing as bid`ah hasanah, ‘good innovation’, as some people say. Rather all innovations are misguidance by the textual statement of the hadeeth of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam when he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#339966;">“For every newly invented matter is an innovation (bid`ah) and every innovation is misguidance.”</span></strong> [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So innovations in the Religion, there is nothing good from them at all, rather all of them are misguidance and this is the speech of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam who did not speak from desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And misguidance and its people will be in the Hell Fire”</strong> &#8211; Misguidance and the people of misguidance will be in the Fire, either on account of their disbelief or on account of sin. So innovations are not of one level only. Some of them are kufr, disbelief, such that its person will be forever in the Fire, such as seeking aid from the dead and making supplication to the dead and making sacrifice to other than Allaah and making vows to other than Allaah &#8211; so these are innovations which are disbelief, kufr. And likewise denying the Names of Allaah and His and Attributes as is said by the Jahmiyyah, those who deny the Names and Attributes. So this is kufr, disbelief, and Allaah’s refuge is sought, because they describe Allaah as not having names or attributes; so in that case He would be nonexistent! Because that which exists must have attributes and the one who has no attributes does not exist. And therefore the Imaams judged that the Jahmiyyah are disbelievers, those who said that the Qur·aan is a created thing. So they made the Qur·aan which is the Speech of Allaah and His Revelation and that which He sent down, they made it a created thing, such as the rest of the created things. And they said Allaah does not speak so therefore they likened Him to an inanimate object; and one who does not speak cannot be a god/one deserving of worship. He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the people of Moosaa in his absence made out of the jewellery of the Copts a calf in bodily form which produced a mooing sound. Do they not then see that it could not speak to them and nor could it guide them upon the way?</strong> </span>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), aayah 148)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this shows that the one who does not speak cannot be an ilaah, one deserving of worship; whereas the Jahmiyyah say Allaah does not speak, so therefore He would not be one deserving of worship, High and Exalted is Allaah above what they say. And there occurs in Soorah Taahaa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do they not see that it cannot respond to them with any saying and it does not possess any power to harm or benefit them.</strong></span> (Soorah Taahaa (20), aayah 89)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning the calf &#8211; if they were to speak to it, it could not respond to them, so therefore was it befitting that it could be one deserving of worship? [9] And Ibraaheem `alayhissalaam said to the worshippers of the idols:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So ask them if they are able to speak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You already know that they (these idols) can’t speak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So then he said to them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then will you worship besides Allaah that which cannot benefit you at all and cannot harm you. Uff (word of anger and disgust) to you and to that which you worship besides Allaah! Do you have no intellect which prevents you from this?</strong></span> (Sooratul-Anbiyaa· (21), aayahs 66-67)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Majestic and Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord said, call upon Me, I will respond to you.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah Ghaafir (40), aayah 60)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He described Himself that He says and He speaks. So the one who does not speak He is not one deserving of worship. So therefore many of the Imaams declared the heads of the Jahmiyyah to be disbelievers, but not their blind followers or those who were just followers, those to whom the Truth had not become clear, but rather they were just blindly following upon ignorance. Those people are a case for examination and the matter must be clarified to them, and then if they persist, then judgement that they are disbelievers will be passed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Foot notes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> In tafseer of this aayah ‘And the first and foremost ones’ the people of tafseer such as at-Tabaree and those who came after them like al-Baghawee, as-Sam`aanee, Ibn Katheer and others mention a number of different sayings with regard to who are those actually meant by ‘the first and foremost ones’ (from the Muslims). Amongst what at-Tabaree brings, he brings with an authentic chain of narration from the noble Taabi`ee Sa`eed ibnul-Musayyib that he said, “The first Muhaajireen (referred to here) they are the ones who prayed towards both qiblahs” meaning the ones who accepted Islaam before the qiblah was changed, so they prayed toward Jerusalem then when the qiblah was changed they prayed towards Makkah afterwards.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise the great Salafee mufassir Aboo Muzaffar as-Sam`aanee in his tafseer, he mentioned four saying in explanation of this aayah. One of the sayings, he mentioned this same saying as Sa`eed ibnul Musayyib and he mentioned it also from Ibn Sireen and a group. Then he mentioned three further saying as well with regards to who are ‘the first and foremost ones’. The first saying he mentioned was that they are the people of Badr, meaning the people who fought at Badr; they had accepted Islaam by that time, in the second year. The second saying he quotes is that they are the people of Bay`atur-Ridwaan, the people who gave the pledge at the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah in Thul-Qa`dah in the sixth year. The third saying he quoted is that the first and foremost ones from the Muhaajireen are the ones who accepted Islaam before the Hijrah, and the first and foremost ones from the Ansaar are those who gave the pledge to Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam on the night of `Aqabah just before the Hijrah, those who accepted Islaam in Madeenah and they came for the Hajj and gave the pledge of `Aqabah to Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. Shaykul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah preferred the view that they were those who accepted Islaam before the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, and as it is known that those at the treaty of Hudaybiyyah were one thousand and four hundred and more in number. Likewise Shaykh al-Fowzaan said the same thing in his explanation of al-Waasitiyyah, that ‘the first and foremost ones’ refers to those who had accepted Islaam before the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah in the eleventh month of the sixth year. An evidence for that is an aayah from Sooratul-Hadeed (57), aayah 10:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are not equal, those who spent in charity before the Conquest (meaning the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah) and who fought&#8230;(to the end of the aayah)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee hafizahullaah said in his explanation, “The author rahimahullaah explained the importance of following and of adhering to this methodology, and that the foundation of that methodology is what we have explained a short while ago, that the foundation of the Jamaa`ah is, after Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, the Companions ridwaanullaahi `alayhim ajma`een (may Allaah be pleased with them all). So whoever makes an attack upon the Companions then he has made an attack upon the whole of Islaam and whoever abuses the Companions then he has abused Islaam and whoever maligns and attacks the Companions, then he has spoken against and accused Islaam and whoever belittles the Companions then he has belittled Islaam. Why is this the case? Because they are the ones who conveyed Islaam to us so if it were not for them Islaam would not have reached us, if it were not for the Companions, Islaam would not have reached us, for Islaam only came to us by way of them. They are the ones who conveyed the Qur·aan to us and they are the ones who conveyed the Sunnah to us and therefore Allaah praised them for that&#8230; So whoever claims that they left Islaam, became apostates (the same as the Raafidah Shee`ah say) or that they changed and altered then he is the apostate and he is the one who is changing and altering and he is the one who is making a change in the Religion.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Reported by Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 1718) and reported by al-Bukhaaree in disconnected form in his Saheeh from a hadeeth of Aa`ishah radiyAllaahu `anhaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Reported by al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh (no.2 550) and by Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 1718) from Aa`ishah radiyAllaahu `anhaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] This is part of a hadeeth of al-`Irbaad ibn Saariyah radiyAllaahu `anhu, and its checking has preceded. Translator’s side point: The checking of this hadeeth is reported by Imaam Ahmad and Aboo Daawood and at-Tirmithee and Ibn Maajah and it was declared authentic by Shaykh al-Albaanee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> This aayah came down on the day of `Arafah on the 10th year of the Hijrah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(There is) a famous saying from Imaam Maalik: So whatever was not Religion on that day it will never be Religion today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] Hassaan ibn `Atiyyah (from the Taabi`een) rahimahullaah said, “A people never introduce an innovation in their Religion except that Allaah takes away from their Sunnah its like and then He does not return it to them right until the Day of Resurrection.” Reported by ad-Daarimee and Aboo Nu`aym in al-Hilyah and al-Laalikaa·ee in Sharh Usool I`tiqaad Ahlis-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> With regards to this Taabi`ee, Hassaan ibn Atiyyah, Shaykh al-Albaanee said in his notes to al-Mishkaat, “He was a great and noble Taabi`ee who died in the year 130.” Shaykh alAlbaanee said with regard to this report from him, “Its chain of narration is saheeh and its like is also reported as a saying of Aboo Hurayrah radiyAllaahu `anhu reported by Abul-`Abbaas ibn al-Assam in his hadeeth.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] This occurs in a number of ahaadeeth, from them the hadeeth of al-`Irbaad ibn Saariyah which has just preceded, also a hadeeth of Jaabir reported by an-Nasaa·ee (no. 1578) and also by Ibn Khuzaymah in his Saheeh; and the basis of this hadeeth occurs in Saheeh Muslim (no. 768).</p>

<p><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 03 : Point 02</strong><br /><strong> Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>



<p><span class="fontstyle0">The author (Imaam al-Barbahaaree) </span>rahimahullaah <span class="fontstyle0">said,</span></p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><strong>“So from the Sunnah is adhering to the Jamaa`ah. And whoever desires other than the Jamaa`ah and departs from it, then he has thrown off the yoke of Islaam from his neck, and he is astray leading others astray.”</strong></span></p>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="https://archive.org/download/sharh-us-sunnah-dawood-burbank/02.From%20the%20Sunnah%20is%20adhering%20to%20the%20Jamaa%60ah.mp3"></audio></figure>



<p><strong>[<a href="https://archive.org/download/sharh-us-sunnah-dawood-burbank/02.From%20the%20Sunnah%20is%20adhering%20to%20the%20Jamaa%60ah.mp3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><strong>The Explanation </strong></span>(Transcription of above Audio)<span style="color: #993300"><strong>:</strong></span></p>



<p>His saying, “<strong>So from the Sunnah is adhering to the Jamaa`ah’</strong> (the United Body of the Muslims upon the Truth). Since that is the case, and since Islaam is the Sunnah and the Sunnah is Islaam, then the Sunnah is of different types. So from the Sunnah is adhering to the Jamaa`ah – meaning adhering to the United Body of the Muslims, and what is meant by the Jamaa`ah here is the United Body of the Muslims who are upon the Truth [3].</p>



<p>As for the jama`aat, the groups which are not upon the Truth, then these are not called the true Jamaa`ah. Every jamaa`ah which gathers upon misguidance or upon a methodology contrary to Islaam or upon a way contrary to Islaam, then it is not called the true Jamaa`ah, that which is required and praiseworthy.</p>



<p>So the Jamaa`ah, the United Body, which is meant here, they are the people of the Truth and this does not necessitate that they must be numerous, rather even if it is a single person upon the Truth then he will be called the Jamaa`ah, the United Body.</p>



<p>So the Jamaa`ah is those who are upon the Truth, whether its people are few or whether they are many. So you adhere to whoever is upon the Truth and you do not contradict the Jamaa`ah which is upon the Truth, rather you should be with them upon the Truth. So whoever splits from the Jamaa`ah, the United Body, then explanation of this will follow.</p>



<p>And, “<strong>Adhering to the Jamaa`ah</strong>” means not departing from it and not conflicting with it. [4]</p>



<p>His saying, “<strong>And whoever desires other than the Jamaa`ah and splits from it then he has thrown off the yoke of Islaam from his neck</strong>’ – this is the text of a hadeeth:</p>



<p>“<span style="color: #008000"><strong>Whoever separates from the Jamaa`ah by the amount of a hand span then he has thrown off the yoke of Islaam from his neck</strong></span>.” [5]</p>



<p>This is a severe threat. So if the splitting away is with regard to `aqeedah (creed and belief) such that he comes to worship other than Allaah then this is kufr (disbelief). And if the splitting away is less than that then it will be misguidance. So splitting away from the Jamaa`ah, there is no good in it. And there occurs in the hadeeth: “Adhere to the Jamaa`ah for the Hand of Allaah is upon the Jamaa`ah” [6].</p>



<p>And when the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam informed Huthayfah ibn alYamaan of the trials and tribulations that would occur and the splitting that was going to occur, Huthayfah said to him, “What do you command me with if that reaches me?” So he said, “<span style="color: #008000"><strong>That you should adhere to the Jamaa`ah (United Body of the Muslims upon the Truth) and their ruler</strong></span>.” [7]</p>



<p><span style="color: #808000"><strong>So the Jamaa`ah will not be except by way of two matters:</strong></span></p>



<p><strong>The first matter:</strong> is that the person is upon the methodology, the way, of the Book and the Sunnah. Its methodology is not the math.hab (the way) of so-and-so, nor the saying of so-and-so rather the Book and the Sunnah.</p>



<p><strong>The second matter</strong>&nbsp;which comprises the Jamaa`ah: is that it has an imaam (a Muslim ruler) who leads it and to whom it refers back. It is not possible for a Jamaa`ah to unite without an imaam; there must be a ruler for it to turn back to, and therefore he said to Huthayfah, “<strong>Adhere to the Jamaa`ah of the Muslims and their ruler</strong>.” So then he (Huthayfah radiyAllaahu `anh) said, “What if they do not have a United Body nor a ruler?” Then he (sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) said, “<strong>Then avoid all of those sects.</strong>”</p>



<p>He ordered him to avoid all of the sects, so he should not be except with the United Body of the Muslims and he should not be with the jama`aat, the different groups, other than the Jamaa`ah of the Muslims, rather he should remain alone upon the Truth until death comes to him while he remains upon that.</p>



<p>So this shows that a person should not be with the jama`aat, the groups, which conflict with the true methodology and they will not be the Jamaa`ah except with two conditions; that their methodology is the Book and the Sunnah and the methodology, the way, of the Pious Predecessors and (secondly) that they have a Muslim ruler who leads them and they refer back to. So there will be no religion except with the Jamaa`ah, United Body of the Muslims, and there will be no Jamaa`ah except with the ruler and there will be no ruler except with hearing and obeying. This is the methodology of the Muslims and this is the Sunnah which he rahimahullaah explained.</p>



<p>So this contains a prohibition of isolated and irregular opinions and conflicting acts and that a person should adhere to the Jamaa`ah as long as they are not upon misguidance.</p>



<p>His saying, “<strong>then he has thrown off the yoke of Islaam from his neck</strong>” – it used to be the custom of the Arabs that they would put a cord or heavy rope upon the sheep, upon their necks so that the sheep would not become separate and become lost and become eaten by the wolves, and these ropes would be connected by a single rope which joined them together to safeguard them. So the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam likened adhering to the Jamaa`ah to this matter, for the Jamaa`ah is the rope which protects from those things which bring about destruction; just like the rope, which is upon the necks of the sheep, protects them from the wolf and from being lost.</p>



<p>His saying, “<strong>and he is misguided, misguiding others</strong>” – meaning misguided himself away from the path, misguiding other people. So he is misguided himself and misguiding other people who take him as an example and follow him. He the Most High says:</p>



<p><span style="color: #008000"><strong>And whoever contends with the Messenger after the guidance has been made clear to him and then he follows other than the way of the believers, then We will put him upon the path he has chosen and enter him into Hell Fire and what an evil destination.</strong> </span>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4),aayah 115)</p>



<p>So what is obligatory upon the Muslim is to follow the path of the Believers and not to be at variance with them and not to isolate himself away from them</p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>



<p>[3] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh al-Albaanee rahimahullaah mentioned in his notes to Mishkaat alMasaabeeh, Volume 1, page 61, the statement of `Abdullaah ibn Mas`ood radiyAllaahu `anhu in that regard, that he said, “The Jamaa`ah is whatever conforms to the Truth even you are alone.” Shaykh alAlbaanee said this is reported by Ibn Asaakir in his Taareekh Dimashq, volume 13, page 322 part number 2, with an authentic, a saheeh chain from him.</p>



<p>[4] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee hafizahullaah said on this same point, “He (alBarbahaaree) encouraged adherence to the Jamaa`ah, and the Jamaa`ah is al- Firqatun-Naajiyah, the Saved Sect, as proven by his sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam saying in the hadeeth of Mu`aawiyah radiyAllaahu `anhu when he mentioned the splitting of the Ummah that it will split into seventy-three sects, all of them being in the Fire. So they said, ‘What is it, O Messenger of Allaah?’ So he said, ‘It is the Jamaa`ah.’ This was the narration of Ibn Maajah and it is the most authentic of the narrations and it is more authentic than the narration of at-Tirmithee (when Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam was asked which one was the saved one he said) ‘That which is upon the like of what I and my Companions are upon today.’ Even though there is no difference between the two sentences with regard to the meaning, so each one of them emphasises the other one.</p>



<p>“So the Jamaa`ah is, to mention it in brief, the Companions and the Taabi`een and those who followed them upon good, those who are upon that which the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam was upon and his Companions. This is the most precise and the most excellent and the most comprehensive and all-inclusive definition that it is possible to give to the Jamaa`ah. And there are some people who limit the Jamaa`ah to the time of the Companions, or limit it to the time of the rightly guided Khulafaa·, or the like of that. This is a restriction of something very wide, which Allaah has made wide, because Allaah the Exalted and Most High says, “And the first and foremost from the Muhaajireen and the Ansaar and those who follow them upon good, Allaah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him.” So what is meant by the Jamaa`ah is: whoever is upon the methodology in any time and in any city, whoever is upon the methodology which the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and his Companions were upon in their sayings and actions and creed and belief, then he is from the Jamaa`ah and whoever splits from that and isolates himself from it, then he has split from the Jamaa`ah. And there occurs a severe threat upon those who split from the Jamaa`ah, that he has isolated himself, and whoever isolates himself will do so and be in the Fire, and whoever separates from the Jamaa`ah by a hand span then he has thrown off the yoke of Islaam from his neck.”</p>



<p>[5] Reported by Imaam Ahmad and at-Tirmithee and Ibn Khuzaymah and Ibn Hibbaan and al-Haakim and others as a hadeeth of Al-Haarith al-Ash`aree radiyAllaahu `anhu and it was declared to be saheeh by Imaam at-Tirmithee and ibn Khuzaymah and ibn Hibbaan and al-Haakim and others.</p>



<p><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> It was declared saheeh by Muhammad Naasirud-Deen al-Albaanee rahimahullaah.</p>



<p>[6] Reported by Imaam Ahmad and al-Humaydee and at-Tirmithee and an-Nasaa·ee in his Sunan alKubraa and Ibn Hibaan and al-Haakim and others besides them from the hadeeth of `Umar radiyAllaahu `anhu with wordings which are close to each other. At-Tirmithee said the hadeeth is ‘hasan saheeh ghareeb, (good, authentic, singular) with this chain here’. And it was declared saheeh, authentic, by Ibn Hibaan and al-Haakim and ath-Thahabee agreed.</p>



<p><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> It was declared authentic by Shaykh al-Albaanee.</p>



<p>[7] Reported by al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh (no. 3411) and reported by Muslim (no. 1847) as a hadeeth of Huthayfah radiyAllaahu `anh.</p>

<p><span style="color: #333300"><strong><span class="fontstyle3">“Know that Islaam is the Sunnah and the Sunnah is Islaam and one of them cannot be established without the other. “ </span></strong></span></p>

<p><strong>[<a href="https://archive.org/download/sharh-us-sunnah-dawood-burbank/01.The%20Sunnah%20is%20Islaam%20and%20Islaam%20is%20the%20Sunnah.mp3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><strong>The Explanation </strong></span>(Transcription of above Audio)<span style="color: #993300"><strong>:</strong></span></p>



<p>His saying, “<strong>Know</strong>” – this is a word used to show importance, and the meaning of ‘i`lam’, ‘know’ is ‘ta`allam’ ‘learn’. And how will you know that Islaam is the Sunnah? If you learn, then you will know that.</p>



<p>So ‘i`lam’ ‘know’ is a word which is brought to show the importance of that which comes after it, just as He the Most High said:</p>



<p><strong>So know, that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and seek forgiveness for your sin.</strong> (Soorah Muhammad (47), aayah 19)</p>



<p>Meaning: Know the meaning of ‘laa ilaaha illAllaah’ (‘none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah’) and act upon it.</p>



<p><strong>Know that Allaah is severe in punishing and that Allaah forgives extensively and shows mercy.</strong> (Sooratul- Maa·idah (5), aayah 98)</p>



<p>So the word <strong>‘i’lam’ ‘know’</strong> (a command in the singular) or i`lamoo (a command in the plural) occurs to show the importance of that which comes after it.</p>



<p>His saying, “<strong>Islaam is the Sunnah and the Sunnah is Islaam</strong>” – meaning Islaam is the way which the Messengers alayhimus-salaatu was-salaam came with. And every Messenger came with Islaam. So every Prophet called to Allaah and came with a sharee`ah, a revealed way, from Allaah, so that is Islaam. So Islaam is the worship of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, alone at every time with that which He legislated. And Allaah legislated for the Prophets ways and laws to last for appointed terms. Then He abrogated it (brought some new law and abrogated the previous one), so when that was abrogated then action came to be upon that which abrogated, that is Islaam, until all those revealed laws were abrogated by the revealed way sent to Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. Allaah the Majestic and Most High says:</p>



<p><strong>There is an appointed time span for each Book sent down by Allaah. Allaah abrogates and changes whatever He wishes and He confirms. And the foundation of the Book is with Him.</strong> (Sooratur-Ra`d (13), aayah 38-39)</p>



<p>So Islaam is that which the Messengers came with, with regard to the call and the action at every time with what was specific to it, until the sending of Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam came about; and then Islaam is whatever he came with to the exclusion of everything else. So therefore whoever remains upon the previous religious ways and does not believe in Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam then he is not a Muslim, since he has not yielded or submitted to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and he has not obeyed this Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam; because what he was upon has now ended and been abrogated, and remaining upon something abrogated (something replaced) is not a religion for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, rather acting on what abrogates (what comes later and replaces) that is the religion.[1]</p>



<p>His saying, “<strong>and the Sunnah is Islaam</strong>” – there is no difference between these two, if we explain the Sunnah to mean ‘the way’, the ‘tareeqah’, then there is no difference between it and Islaam.</p>



<p>His saying, “<strong>And one of them will not be established without the other one</strong>’ – Islaam will not be established except through the Sunnah and the Sunnah will not be established except through Islaam. So the person who claims to be upon Islaam but does not act upon the Sunnah, meaning the way of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, then he is not a Muslim; and the person who knows of the Sunnah but does not submit to Allaah, then he is not a Muslim, even if he knows about the Sunnah. So it is essential to combine both of them.[2]</p>



<p><strong><span style="color: #993300">Footnotes:</span></strong></p>



<p><strong>[1] Translator’s side point:</strong> The noble Shaykh, Saalih ibn Sa`d as-Suhaymee, hafizahullaah, (the teacher who used to be in charge of the department of `aqeedah in Madeenah) said referring to this initial part of al-Barbahaaree’s book, “He, rahimahullaah, began with the fact that the Sunnah and Islaam are inseparable. And what is meant by the Sunnah here is the Sunnah with its general meaning which is the tareeqah, the way, which the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and his Companions were upon. So this is Islaam and Islaam is the Sunnah in this sense.”</p>



<p><strong>[2] Translator’s side point:</strong> The noble Shaykh, Ahmad ibn Yahyaa an-Najmee rahimahullaah said in his explanation, Irshaadus-Saaree, page 26, on this same point that Islaam is the Sunnah and the Sunnah is Islaam and one of them will not be established without the other, “Islaam is the Sunnah and the Sunnah is Islaam. How is that the case? Meaning that true Islaam is the Sunnah, so whoever is upright upon the Sunnah and establishes it then he has established Islaam, and whoever deviates away from it (from the Sunnah) and inclines away towards the right or the left, then he has fallen short with regard to true Islaam, in accordance with his deviation. However this inclining away is of two categories. Firstly turning away totally, such that the person becomes a disbeliever and judgement is passed about him that he has exited from Islaam altogether. Secondly is a partial turning away (from the Sunnah) through which a person does not become a disbeliever and he is not judged to be an apostate or to have left Islaam however he has rendered his Islaam deficient in accordance with the level of his deviation, whether it be a small deviation or a large one.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">124. And we call those who pray towards our ‘Qiblah’ (direction of Prayer): Muslims and Believers (Mu.minoon) <span style="color:#808080;"><em>(listen this point <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/09/07/we-call-those-who-pray-towards-our-qiblah-muslims-and-believers/">Here</a>)</em></span></p>

<p><strong>Pivotal Quotes from Shaykh Fawzan:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if they reject anything that is related as being said by the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and do not acknowledge it, then they would be disbelievers, even if they believed in some of what has been related from the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If someone disbelieves in some of the authentic hadiths, on the other hand, then is also a disbeliever. If someone rejects a hadith in al-Bukahri, and the hadith is authentic. and he says, I do not believe in this hadith because it contradicts the modern science then subhaanallaah! Would you have doubts about what the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم has said and not have doubts about what people say?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>An Important Note:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obvious that after all of this we must say: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Indeed, the Sunnah that bears this importance in Legislation (i.e. making Islamic laws), only refers to the Sunnah that is authentically reported on the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم by way of the knowledge-based paths and authentic chains of narration, which are well known to the scholars of Hadeeth and Narrators</strong></span>. It does not refer to that which is contained within the various books of Tafseer and Fiqh, or the books on Targheeb and Tarheeb, or those of Raqaa’iq and Mawaa’idh, for indeed many of the weak, rejected and fabricated ahaadeeth can be found in them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of these ahaadeeth, Islaam is completely free from, such as the hadeeth about Harut and Marut, and the story on the satanic verses (gharaneeq). I wrote a specific treatise refuting this narration, which has been published.[2] I have referenced a score of them in my book, the collection: <em>Silsilat-ul-Ahaadeeth ad-Da’eefah wal-Mawdoo’ah wa Atharuhaa as-Sayy fil-Ummah</em>.” So far the number of ahaadeeth in them has reached close to four thousand.[3] And they consist of ahaadeeth that are either weak or fabricated. Only five hundred ahaadeeth from these have been published so far! So it is an obligation upon the people of knowledge, particularly those that propagate their Fiqh and verdicts to the people, to not be overconfident in using the hadeeth as proof except after becoming sure about its authenticity. This is especially since the books of Fiqh that are commonly referenced today are filled with ahaadeeth that are weak, rejected and those that have no source to them, as is well known to the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have commenced an important project in my opinion, which is beneficial for those who preoccupy themselves with Fiqh, which I call: “<strong>The Weak and Fabricated Ahaadeeth in the Major Fiqh Books</strong>.” By this I mean the following books:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <em>Al-Hidaayah</em> of Al-Margeenaani, regarding Hanafi Fiqh<br />
2. <em>Al-Mudawwanah</em> of Ibn Al-Qaasim, regarding Maalikee Fiqh<br />
3. <em>Sharh-ul-Wajeez</em> of Ar-Raafi’ee, regarding Shaafi’ee Fiqh<br />
4. <em>Al-Mughnee</em> of Ibn Qudaamah, regarding Hanbalee Fiqh<br />
5. <em>Bidaayat-ul-Mujtahid</em> of Ibn Rushd, on comparative Fiqh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unfortunately, however, I did not get the chance to complete it because the Kuwaiti magazine, <em>Al-Wa’ee Al-Islaamee</em>, that promised to publish it and that received it graciously after reviewing it, didn’t print it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since I missed that opportunity, then perhaps I will be granted the opportunity, Allaah willing, on another occasion to offer a specific knowledge-based course to my brothers that are studying Fiqh, which will assist them and which will facilitate for them the way towards knowing the grades of the Hadeeth, by returning them to the necessary sources of the books of Hadeeth. And which will explain their special and distinct characteristics, as well as what can be relied on from them. And Allaah, Most High, is the One who grants success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] The book is called: “Nasab-ul-Majaaneeq fee Nasf Qissat-il-Gharaaneeq.” [Printed by Al-Maktab-ul- Islaamee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Now the number has passed five thousand ahaadeeth, may Allaah facilitate them to be printed soon</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[2] Question:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;">Noble Shaikh! The Qur’aaniyoon [3] say: Allaah says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333333;">وَكُلَّ شَيْءٍ فَصَّلْنَاهُ تَفْصِيلًا</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>“And We have explained everything in detail with a full explanation.”<br />
</strong> [Surah Al-Israa: 12]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;">And Allaah says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333333;">مَّا فَرَّطْنَا فِي الْكِتَابِ مِن شَيْءٍ</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>“We have not neglected anything in the Book.”</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#333333;"> [Surah Al-An’aam: 38]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;">And the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <strong>“Verily this Qur’aan – part of it is in the Hand of Allaah and part of it is in your hands. So hold fast onto it, for you will never go astray nor will you ever be ruined after it.”</strong> [4]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;">We would like your comments on this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[2] Answer:</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Allaah’s saying: <strong>“We have not neglected anything in the Book”</strong>, what is meant by the word “<strong>Book</strong>” here is the Preserved Tablet and not the Noble Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for Allaah’s statement: <strong>“And We have explained everything in detail with a full explanation”</strong>, if you attach what was explained previously to the Noble Qur’aan, then it becomes certain that Allaah has indeed explained everything in detail, however with another provision. You are aware that an explanation may at times be general, such as when one places general rules under which exist many particulars the likes of which cannot be confined due to their large number. So by the Wise Legislator placing well known rules for these many particulars, the meaning of the noble ayah becomes apparent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The explanation may also be detailed, and this is what is obvious from this ayah as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“I have not left behind anything that Allaah commanded me with except that I have ordered you to do it. And I have not left behind anything that Allaah forbade me from except that I have forbidden you from it.”</strong> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the explanation may at times be with rules, which many particulars (and details) fall under. And at other times it may be in such detail in terms of the vocabulary of the acts of worship and laws that it does not require being referenced to any of these rules.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among the rules that numerous branches fall under – and which show the greatness of Islaam and the vast scope of Islaam in legislating – for example, are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet’s صلى الله عليه وسلم statement: <strong>“There is no harming (of oneself) or others.”</strong> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet’s صلى الله عليه وسلم statement: <strong>“Every intoxicant is alcohol and every alcohol is unlawful.”</strong> [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his صلى الله عليه وسلم statement: <strong>“Every innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance is in the Hellfire.”</strong> [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are rules and generalizations that do not exclude anything related to harming of one’s self or harming of one’s wealth, with respect to the first hadeeth, nor does it exclude anything related to that which intoxicates, with respect to the second hadeeth, whether the intoxicant is derived from grapes, which is the most popular form, or from corn or from any other substance. So long as the product is an intoxicant, it is unlawful (Haraam).</p>
<p><em><span style="color:#808080;">[<strong>Note</strong>: Read </span><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2016/07/16/the-need-for-the-sunnah-in-order-to-understand-the-quraan/">The Need for the Sunnah in order to Understand the Qur’aan </a><span style="color:#808080;">– Shaykh al Albaani]</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same goes for the third hadeeth – it is not possible to take into account the number of innovations due to their large amount. It is not possible to account for all of them. However in spite of this, this hadeeth – even though brief in size – states with all clarity: <strong>“Every innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance is in the Hellfire.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a detailed statement but with rules.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the laws that you are aware of, they are explained in detail by words that have been mentioned in the Sunnah in most cases and at times they are mentioned in the noble Qur’aan as is the case with the laws of inheritance, for example.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the hadeeth that was mentioned in the question, then it is an authentic hadeeth, and acting upon it is what we should try to adhere to as stated in the hadeeth in which the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <strong>“I have left two things amongst you by which you will never go astray so long as you hold steadfast onto them: The Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger.”</strong> [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So holding steadfast onto the Rope of Allaah – which is in our hands – refers to acting upon the Sunnah, which explains the noble Qur’aan.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[3] Translator’s Note: This is a name given to those who claim that the Qur’aan is sufficient for deriving rules and laws in Islaam and that there is no need to turn to the Sunnah. Some even go so far as to reject the Sunnah in its entirety and rely solely on the Qur’aan.</span><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>A Weak Hadeeth from Mu’aadh regarding Opinion, and what is Rejected from it:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Before I finish my talk, I feel that it is necessary for me to direct the attention of the brothers in attendance to a famous hadeeth, which seldom is missing from the books on the Principles of Fiqh. I will mention it because <strong>it is weak</strong>, from the perspective of its chain of narration as well as it being in contradiction with what I spoke about in this talk, which was <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>the lack of there being any distinction between the Qur’aan and the Sunnah when it comes to deriving Laws, and the obligation of accepting these two sources together</strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed it is the hadeeth of Mu’aadh bin Jabal radhi Allaahu anhu who reported that the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said to him when he sent him to Yemen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“With what will you judge by?” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>He said: “By the Book of Allaah.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>He صلى الله عليه وسلم said: “And if you don’t find (the answer in) it?” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>He said: “Then by the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>He replied: “And if you don’t find (the answer in) it?” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>He said: “I will strive to form my own opinion.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>So he صلى الله عليه وسلم said: “All praise be to Allaah who guided the messenger of Allaah’s Messenger to that which Allaah’s Messenger loves.”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the weakness of its chain, then this is not the place to discuss it now. But I clarified this exhaustively, perhaps the likes of which was not undertaken in the past, in (my book) the <strong>“Silsilah”</strong> (of weak hadeeth) I mentioned previously. [4] But suffice it to say now that the Ameer-ul-Mu’mineen in Hadeeth, Imaam Al-Bukhaaree, said about this hadeeth that it was “rejected.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">So having said this, it is now possible for me to begin explaining the contradiction it </span></strong><strong><span style="color:#993300;">poses, which I stated earlier. So I say:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth establishes a methodology of ruling for the judge, based on three stages. He is not permitted to seek a ruling from his opinion unless after he acknowledges he can’t find it in the Sunnah. Nor is he allowed to derive a ruling from the Sunnah until after he establishes he can’t find it in the Qur’aan. With respect to the opinion, this method (of deriving a ruling) is valid and correct according to all of the scholars, which is why they would say: “When the narration is mentioned, the opinion is nullified.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, with respect to the Sunnah, this method is not correct, because the Sunnah determines and explains the Book of Allaah. So it is obligatory for one to look for the ruling in the Sunnah, even if he thinks that it exists in the Qur’aan, based on what we stated previously. So the Sunnah with respect to the Qur’aan is not like the opinion with respect to the Sunnah. No, definitely not. Rather we must consider the Qur’aan and the Sunnah as one source, there being no distinction between them at all. This is as has been indicated in the sayings of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Indeed, I was given the Qur’aan and something similar to it, along with it”</span></strong> – meaning the Sunnah – and <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“They will not be separated from one another until they return to the Fountain.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this dividing them into categories, mentioned in the hadeeth, is not correct, because it necessitates that they are separate from one another. And this is false, as I have explained previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">It is unfortunate that there can be found some contemporary tafseer writers and authors that have taken the view of making permissible what has been mentioned in the last two examples <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>[1]</strong></span> , such as the permissibility of eating predatory animals and wearing gold and silk, relying upon the Qur’aan (as proof) only! In fact, there can be found in this present time a group that call themselves the <strong>Qur’aaniyoon</strong>, who interpret the Qur’aan according to their desires and intellects, without seeking assistance for that in the authentic Sunnah. Rather, the Sunnah, according to them, is subordinate to their desires. So whatever part of it conforms to their desires, they affirm it, and whatever doesn’t conform to their desires, they throw behind their backs (rejecting it).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم indicated these individuals in an authentic hadeeth, when he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Do not let any one of you sit reclining on his couch, then when something that I have commanded him to do comes to him, he says: ‘I don’t know! Whatever we find in the Book of Allaah, we will follow it.’”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by At-Tirmidhee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration, he صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“…’whatever we find in it that’s unlawful, we will declare unlawful.’ Indeed, I was sent with the Qur’aan and something equal to it along with it.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another report, he صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Indeed, whatever the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم forbade is the same as what Allaah forbade.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, what is unfortunate is that one dignified author wrote a book on the Legislation and Creed of Islaam. He stated in his introduction that he wrote the book but he had no references in it except for the Qur’aan! So this authentic hadeeth provides clear proof that the Islamic Legislation is not based on the Qur’aan only, but rather it is based on the Qur’aan and Sunnah. So whoever takes hold of one in the absence of the other, doesn’t actually take hold of any of them. This is because each one of them commands that the other one be adhered to. This is as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Whoever obeys the Messenger, has indeed obeyed Allaah.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Surah An-Nisaa: 80]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Surah An-Nisaa: 65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allaah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any choice in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger, has indeed strayed in a plain error.” </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Surah Al-Ahzaab: 36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And whatever the Messenger gives you then do it, and whatever he forbids you from, then abstain from it.”</strong></span> [Surah Al-Hashr: 7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In connection with this ayah, I am amazed at what has been authentically reported from Ibn Mas’ood radhi Allaahu anhu, which is that a woman once came to him and said: “Are you the one who said: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">‘May Allaah’s curse be on the woman that puck eyebrows and those who ask for their eyebrows to be plucked and those who tattoo…’</span></strong> He said: ‘Yes.’ She said: ‘I read the Qur’aan from its front to its back and I did not find in it that which you say!’ He responded: ‘If you had (truly) read it, you would have found it. Did you not read: ‘And whatever the Messenger gives you then take it (i.e. do it), and whatever he forbids you from, then stay away from?’ She said: ‘Of course!’ He صلى الله عليه وسلم said: ‘Then I indeed heard The Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم say: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘May Allaah’s curse be on the woman that pluck eyebrows and those who ask for their eyebrows to be plucked…’”</strong></span> [Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Need for the Sunnah in order to Understand the Qur’aan, and Examples for that:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“The male and the female thief – cut off their hands”</strong></span> [Surah Al-Maa’idah: 38] is a good example of this, for the word <strong>“thief”</strong> mentioned in it, is absolute, as is the case with the word “hand.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The verbal Sunnah explains the first of these two (words) and restricts it to mean just the thief that steals a quarter of a dinaar. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“There is no cutting off of the hand except in (cases where one steals) a quarter of a dinaar and more.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم explained the second (word) with his action or with the action of his Companions and his approving of that. This is since they would cut the hand of the thief off from the wrist, as is well known from the books of Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The verbal Sunnah also explains the <strong>“hand”</strong> that is mentioned in the verse concerning Tayammum:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Then wipe your faces and hands”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 43, Surah Al-Maa’idah: 6] in that it can also refer to the palm.<span style="line-height:1.5;">This is based on the Prophet’s saying: </span><span style="line-height:1.5;color:#000000;"><strong>“Tayammum is a tap (i.e. wipe) of the face and hands.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Reported by Ahmad, Al-Bukhaaree, Muslim and others from the narration of ‘Ammaar bin Yaasir radhi Allaahu anhu] </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Below are some other verses from the Qur’aan that cannot be understood correctly, according to what Allaah intended, unless by way of the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“It is those who believe and mix not their Faith with dhulm (wrong) – for them (only) there is security and they are the guided ones.”</strong></span> [Surah Al-An’aam: 82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Companions of Allaah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم understood the phrase <strong>“with dhulm (wrong)”</strong> according to its general sense, which includes every wrong, even if it be small. This is why they had difficulty understanding the verse and so they said: “O Messenger of Allaah! Which one of us doesn’t mix their Faith with wrong?” So the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“It doesn’t mean that. It only means Shirk (here). Didn’t you hear Luqmaan say:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Verily Shirk is a great wrong?’</strong></span> [Surah Luqmaan: 13]”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Reported by Al-Bukhaaree, Muslim and others]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Allaah’s says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And when you travel in the land, there is no sin on you if you shorten your prayer, if you fear that the disbelievers may attack you.”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 101]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The literal wording of this verse necessitates that shortening the prayer while on a journey can only be done on the condition when one is in the state of fear. This is why some of the Companions asked Allaah’s Messenger: “So then why do we shorten the prayer when we are in a state of security?” He صلى الله عليه وسلم replied: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“This is a charity that Allaah has expended to you, so take His charity.”</strong> </span>[Reported by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Forbidden to you (for food) are: al-maytatah (dead animals), blood, the flesh of swine…”</strong></span> [Surah Al-Maa’idah: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But the verbal Sunnah explains that deceased locusts and fish, as well as liver and spleen (types) of blood are lawful. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Two types of deceased animals and two types of blood have been made lawful for us: locusts and sea fish [meaning all types of fish], and the liver and the spleen.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Reported by Al- Bayhaqee and others in marfoo’ and mawqoof form. The chain of the mawqoof narration is authentic and it takes on the ruling of being marfoo’ since it cannot be stated based on one’s mere opinion.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Say (O Muhammad): ‘I find not in that which has been inspired to me anything forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it, unless it be maytah (a dead animal) or blood poured forth (by slaughtering), or the flesh of swine (pork), for that surely is impure, or impious (unlawful) meat (of an animal) which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for other than Allaah…’”</span></strong> [Surah Al-An&#8217;aam: 145]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Sunnah came and forbade other things that haven’t been mentioned in this ayah, such as the Prophet’s صلى الله عليه وسلم saying: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Every predatory animal that has fangs and every bird that has claws is unlawful (for eating).”</span></strong> There are also other ahaadeeth on this subject that forbid other animals, such as what the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said on the Day of Khaybar: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Verily Allaah and His Messenger forbid you from (eating) domesticated donkeys, for they are impure.”</span></strong> [Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Say (O Muhammad): ‘Who has forbidden the adornment with clothes given by Allaah, which He has produced for his slaves, and the good (lawful) things from provision?’”</strong></span> [Surah Al-A&#8217;raaf: 32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But the Sunnah explains that there are certain types of adornments that are forbidden. It is authentically reported that the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم went out one day to meet his Companions holding silk in one hand and gold in the other, and said:<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> “These two things are unlawful for the males of my ummah, (but) lawful for the females.”</strong></span> [Reported by Al-Haakim who authenticated it] The ahaadeeth bearing this same understanding are many, well known and can be found in the two Saheeh collections as well as other collections.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many more examples like these (above) that are known to the people who have knowledge of Hadeeth and Fiqh. So from what has been stated previously, it should become clear to us, O brothers, the importance of the Sunnah in deriving Islamic laws. For indeed if we look back again at the examples I mentioned before, not to mention those that I didn’t mention, we will have certainty that there is no way to understand the noble Qur’aan, unless we understand it along with the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In the first example,</strong> the Companions understood the word <strong>“dhulm”</strong> mentioned in the ayah according to its literal meaning. This was even though they, may Allaah be pleased with them, were as Ibn Mas’ood said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The best of this ummah, possessing the most pious of hearts, profound in learning and the least of constraints.”</strong></span> But in spite of this, they erred with regard to understanding that. So if it were not for the Prophet refuting their error and guiding them to what was correct with regard to the meaning of “dhulm” – that it in fact meant Shirk here – we would have followed them upon their error. However, Allaah, Mighty and Majestic, saved us from that due to the grace of the Prophet’s guidance and Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And in the second example:</strong> if it weren’t for the afore-mentioned hadeeth, we would have remained in doubt, to say the least, regarding shortening the prayer while on a journey in the state of security. That is to say if we wouldn’t have already taken the view of making being in the state of fear a condition, as is literally stated in the ayah. This is also just what the Companions themselves understood (about the ayah) until they saw the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم shorten his prayer, and they shortened their prayer along with him, while they were in a state of security.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In the third example:</strong> If it weren’t for the hadeeth, we would have been forbidden from foods that were made lawful for us, such as (dead) locusts and fish, and liver and spleen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In the fourth example</strong>, if it weren’t for the hadeeth, which mentions some things (not mentioned in the ayah), we would have made lawful what Allaah had made forbidden through the tongue of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, such as predatory (fanged) animals and birds with claws.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The same goes for the fifth example,</strong> if it weren’t for the ahaadeeth reported in that regard, we would have made lawful that which Allaah made unlawful upon the tongue of the Prophet, such as silk and gold. This is why some of the Salaf used to say: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“The Sunnah judges upon the Book (i.e. Qur’aan).”</span></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[3]</strong> <strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">There are some who say that if a hadeeth contradicts an ayah in the Qur’aan, it should be rejected no matter what level of authenticity it has. Then they use as an example the hadeeth: <strong>“Indeed the deceased person will be punished (in the grave) due to the crying of his family for him.”</strong>[10] They use the statement of ‘Aa’ishah in which she used Allaah’s saying to refute this hadeeth:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">وَلَا تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَى</span></strong><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another.”</strong> [Surah Faatir: 18]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">How do we respond to those who say this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[3] Answer</strong>: Rejecting this hadeeth falls under the issues related to rejecting the Sunnah by way of the Qur’aan. So this shows the deviation of this way of thinking.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the response to this hadeeth – and I am referring here particularly to those who adhere to the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah, then it is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>:<strong> From a hadeeth standpoint:</strong> There is no way to reject this hadeeth from a hadeeth standpoint due to two reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. It has been reported through an authentic chain of narration from Ibn ‘Umar radhi Allaahu anhu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Ibn ‘Umar radhi Allaahu anhu is not alone in reporting it, rather he was followed in that by ‘Umar bin Al- Khattaab radhi Allaahu anhu. Furthermore, he and his son are not alone in reporting it either, for they were also followed in that by Al-Mugheerah bin Shu’bah radhi Allaahu anhu. This is what comes to my mind at this time since the reports of all three of these Companions can be found in the two Saheeh Collections.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if a person were to conduct an exclusive research on this hadeeth, he would find other paths of narration for it. These three ahaadeeth all have authentic chains of narration so they cannot be rejected just based on the claim that they “contradict” the noble Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: <strong>From a tafseer standpoint:</strong> This is since the scholars have explained this hadeeth in two ways:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. This hadeeth only applies to a deceased person who knew during the course of his life that his family would commit oppositions to the Religion after his death and did not advise them. Nor he did direct them to not cry over him since this crying would serve as a means for his being punished in the grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The usage of the word <strong>“the”</strong> when referring to the <strong>“deceased person”</strong> is not allencompassing and inclusive. Meaning: The hadeeth does not mean that every deceased person will be punished due to the crying of his family members. Rather, the word “the” is for a specific designation, meaning it refers to only those who do not advise others to not commit what opposes the Religion after his death. So this is the type of person who will be punished by the crying of his family over him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who takes charge of advising his family and directing them with religious guidelines such as to not wail over him and to not commit the offenses that are done ,particularly in this era, then such a person will not be punished. But if he does not direct and advise (his family), he will be punished.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the detailed breakdown that we are required to understand from the first explanation, in accordance to the interpretation of many well known and famous scholars such as An-Nawawee and others. So when we come to comprehend this detailed breakdown, it becomes clear that there is in fact no contradiction between this hadeeth and Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">وَلاَ تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَى</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another.”</strong></span> [Surah Al-An’aam: 164]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A contradiction only becomes apparent if the word <strong>“the”</strong> in the word <strong>“the deceased person”</strong> is understood to be all-inclusive, meaning that it encompasses everyone who dies. This is where the hadeeth becomes obscure and contradicts the noble ayah in the Qur’aan. But if we comprehend the meaning of the hadeeth according to what was mentioned before, there would be no more contradictions or obscurities since we would understand that the one who is being punished (in the grave) is only like that because he failed to advise and direct his family members (before his death). This is the first manner in which this hadeeth has been interpreted in order to repel this so-called “contradiction.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. A second interpretation has been mentioned by Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah, may Allaah have mercy on him, in some of his writings. And it is that the punishment here does not refer to the punishment in the grave or the punishment in the Hereafter but rather, that it only refers to pain and sorrow. Meaning: When a deceased person hears the crying of his family for him, he will feel bad and sorrowful for their grief over him. This is what Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah said. If it is correct, it would eradicate the root of the misconception.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, I say: Such an explanation goes against two facts, which is why we can only rely on the first explanation of this hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First Fact:</strong> The report from Al-Mugheerah bin Shu’abah radhi Allaahu anhu that I indicated previously has an addition to it that clarifies that the punishment here does not refer to just pain and sorrow, but rather that it refers to actual punishment, i.e. punishment in the Hellfire, unless Allaah forgives him. This is clearly stated in Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">إِنَّ اللّهَ لاَ يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاء</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Verily, Allaah does not forgive that partners be associated with Him (in worship), but He forgives what is less than that to whom He wills.”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the narration of Al-Mugheerah radhi Allaahu anhu it states: <strong>“Indeed, the deceased person will be punished due to the crying of his family over him on the Day of Judgement.”</strong> So this clearly states that the deceased will be punished due to his family crying over him on the Day of Judgement and not in his grave, which is what Ibn Taimiyyah explained as meaning pain and sorrow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second Fact:</strong> When a person dies, he does not feel anything that goes on around him whether good or bad, as indicated by evidences in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, except in certain cases, which have been mentioned in some ahaadeeth either as a rule for every deceased person or for some only whom Allaah enables to hear some things that will cause them pain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So firstly there is the hadeeth reported by Al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh from Anas bin Maalik radhi Allaahu anhu in which he narrated that the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily, when a servant (of Allaah) is placed in his grave, and his companions depart from him – at the point where he can still hear their footsteps – two angels come to him.” </strong>[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This authentic hadeeth affirms a special type of hearing that a deceased person will have at the time he is buried and the people are walking away from him. Meaning: At the time that the two angels come to sit by him, his soul returns to his body and in this state of being, he is able to hear the footsteps (of his loved ones walking away).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the hadeeth does not mean on the outset that this deceased person and all deceased people will have their souls returned to them and that they will remain with the ability to hear the footsteps of the people passing by the graves up until the day that they will be resurrected. No.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a specific circumstance and a special type of hearing on the part of the deceased since his soul has returned to him. So if we were to go by the interpretation of Ibn Taimiyyah at this point, we would be forced to expand the senses of the deceased person to include everything that goes on around him whether at the time he is being transferred to his grave before his burial or after he is placed in his grave – meaning that he can hear his living family members crying over him. This requires a textual proof, which is missing. This is first.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>, some texts from the Qur’aan and the authentic Sunnah indicate that the deceased cannot hear. This is a huge topic and requires an in-depth discussion. However I will mention one hadeeth by which I will close the answer to this question. And it is the statement of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم in which he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily, Allaah has angels that roam throughout earth who convey to me the greetings (of Salaam) on behalf of my ummah.” </strong>[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is meant by <strong>“roam”</strong> is that they frequent gatherings. So every time a Muslim sends Salaat (praises) on the Prophet, there is an assigned angel that conveys this greeting from that Muslim to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم. So if the deceased could hear, the one with the most right from those deceased to hear would be our Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم due to Allaah’s favoring him and particularizing him with special qualities and attributes over all of the prophets, messengers, and rest of mankind. So if anyone had the ability to hear, it would surely be the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم. And furthermore, if the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم were able to hear anything after his death, he would hear the Salaat (praises) of his ummah) on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So here we come to understand the error, or the deviation, of those who ask assistance – not from the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم – but rather from those less than him, whether messengers, prophets or righteous people. This is since if they were to ask assistance from the Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم, he would not hear them as is clearly stated in the Qur’aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ اللّهِ عِبَادٌ أَمْثَالُكُمْ<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And those whom you call besides Allaah are servants (of Allaah) just like you.”</strong></span> [Surah Al-A’raaf: 194]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">إِن تَدْعُوهُمْ لَا يَسْمَعُوا دُعَاءآُمْ<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“If you supplicate to them, they cannot hear your supplication.”</strong></span> [Surah Faatir: 14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, after they die, the deceased cannot hear unless there is some text that applies to a particular situation – as I mentioned before – such as the deceased hearing the footsteps. This concludes the answer to this question.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Knowledge of Arabic is not sufficient for understanding the Qur’aan:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From what has been stated previously, it becomes clear that there is no way for anyone, even if he be a scholar of the Arabic Language and its disciplines, to understand the noble Qur’aan, without seeking assistance in that from the Prophet’s Sunnah in speech and action. This is since he will never be more knowledgeable of the language than the Companions of the Prophet, those who the Qur’aan was revealed to in their language. And (at that time) the language was not blemished with the errors of the non-Arabs and the slang of the common people, but in spite of that, they still erred in understanding these previously mentioned ayaat, when they relied on their knowledge of the language only.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So based on this, it is obvious that <strong>whenever a person is knowledgeable of the Sunnah, he will be more likely to understand the Qur’aan and extract rulings from it, than someone who is ignorant about it</strong>. So how about the one who doesn’t rely on it or reference it at all? This is why from the principles that have been agreed upon by the people of knowledge is: to interpret the Qur’aan with the Qur’aan and the Sunnah,1 and then the sayings of the Companions, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this, we become aware of the misguidance of the scholars of rhetoric, past and present, and their opposition to the Salaf, in their Creed, not to mention their rulings. And it is their remoteness from the Sunnah and their knowledge of it, and their making their intellects and desires as judges for themselves with regard to the verses concerning Allaah’s Attributes. What is better than what has been stated in Sharh Al- ‘Aqeedah At-Tahaawiyyah [of Ibn Abil-‘Izz Al-Hanafee] (pg. 212, 4th Edition):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“How can someone who didn’t learn from the Book and the Sunnah, but rather just learned it from the views of so and so, speak about the fundaments of the Religion! And if he claims that he is taking it from the Book of Allaah, then he is not taking the interpretation of the Book of Allaah from the ahaadeeth of the Messenger. He doesn’t look into it (i.e. the Sunnah), nor does he look at what the Companions or those who succeeded them in goodness said, which has been conveyed to us by way of reliable narrators chosen by the critics (i.e. hadeeth scholars). For indeed, they did not convey the arrangement of the Qur’aan only, but rather they conveyed the arrangement as well as the meanings. They would not learn the Qur’aan like the children do (today), rather they would learn it along with its meanings. And whoever does not follow their path, then he is speaking based on his opinion. And whoever speaks from his opinion, and from what he thinks Allaah’s Religion is, not getting that from the Book, he is in fact sinning (!), even if he may be correct. Whereas whoever takes from the Book and the Sunnah, he is rewarded even if he errs. However, if he is correct, his reward is multiplied.”</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said (pg. 217):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“So it is an obligation to completely submit to the Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم, follow his orders, and meet his reports with acceptance and firm belief, without contradicting that by false notions that we consider “reasonable” or that constitute a misconception and doubt. Or that we put before it the views of men and the rubbish held in their minds. So we must single the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم out with regard to making him the judge, submitting to him, obeying him and complying with him, just as we single out the One who sent him in worship, humility, submissiveness, repentance and reliance (to Him).”</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In summary:</strong> It is an obligation upon all of the Muslims to not differentiate between the Qur’aan and the Sunnah, with regard to the obligation of accepting both of them together and establishing Laws based on both of them. Indeed this is the guarantee that will prevent them from drifting to the right and the left, and from returning to deviation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم clearly stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“I have left two things for you, which you will never go astray so long as you adhere to them: The Book of Allaah and my Sunnah. These two will never separate from one another until they return to the Fountain.” </span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Maalik and Al-Haakim with a sound chain of narration]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] We do not say as is the custom amongst many of the people of knowledge: <strong>“We interpret the Qur’aan by the Qur’aan if there is no trace of it in the Sunnah, then we interpret it by the Sunnah.”</strong> This is due to what we will explain later on in the end of this treatise, when speaking about the (weak) hadeeth of Mu’aadh bin Jabal radhi Allaahu anhu.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="dropcap">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="bodytext">l praise is for Allaah with much praises and blessings, as our Lord loves and is pleased with and as is required for attaining the honor of His most Sublime Face.[1] And may the peace and blessings of Allaah be upon our teacher Muhammad, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, his family and his companions.</span>Imaam Muslim reported in his Saheeh from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah, <i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>, that the Prophet, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said:<b>“Islaam began as something strange and it will return to being strange as it began. So Toobaa [2] is for the strangers.”</b> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad and Ibn Maajah have also reported this hadeeth on the authority of Ibn Mas’ood, <i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>, with the addition at the end of it:<b>“It was said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah, and who are the strangers?’</b> He, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>‘The Nuzaa’ (those who extract themselves) from their families and close relatives.’</b>” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr Al-Aajuree also transmitted it and in his report there occurs: <b>&#8220;It was said: ‘Who are they, O Messenger of Allaah?’</b> He, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>‘Those who rectify (themselves/others) when the people have become corrupt.’”</b> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Others have transmitted it with the following words, in which he, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>&#8220;They are those who flee from trials (fitan) for the sake of their Religion.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At-Tirmidhee reported it from the hadeeth of Katheer Ibn &#8216;Abdillaah Al-Maznee on the authority of his father who reported from his grandfather that the Prophet, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>&#8220;Verily, this Religion began as something strange. And it will go back to being something strange. So Toobaa is for the strangers – those who rectify what the people have corrupted after me of my Sunnah.&#8221;</b> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has also been transmitted by At-Tabaraanee from the hadeeth of Jaabir, radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa, on the Prophet, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>. And in the hadeeth there occurs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;It was said: &#8216;And who are they, O Messenger of Allaah?&#8217; He said: &#8216;They are those who rectify and make corrections when the people have become corrupted.&#8221;</b> [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (At-Tabaraanee) also reported it from the hadeeth of Sahl Ibn Sa&#8217;ad, <i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>, with a similar wording.[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad also transmitted it from the hadeeth of Sa’ad Ibn Abee Waqqaas, <i>radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa</i>, on the authority of the Prophet, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>. And it is stated in the hadeeth: <b>“So Toobaa on that day will be for the strangers – when the people have become corrupt.”</b> [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration transmitted by Imaam Ahmad and At-Tabaraanee from the hadeeth of &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn &#8216;Amr, <i>radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa</i>, the Prophet,<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>“Toobaa is for the strangers.”</b> It was said: “And who are the strangers? He, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said:<b>“A righteous people surrounded by people abounding in much evil. Those who disobey them are more numerous than those who obey them.”</b> [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it has been reported on ‘Abdullaah Ibn ‘Amr, <i>radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa</i>, in marfoo’ and mawqoof [11] form in this hadeeth, that: “It was said: ‘Who are the strangers?’ He, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>‘They are the ones who flee for the sake of their Religion. Allaah, may He be Exalted, will send them with ‘Eesaa Bin Maryam’”</b> [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning his, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, statement: <b>“Islaam began as something strange”</b>, then it is referring to the people before his advent, who were upon widespread deviance. This is as the Prophet, sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, said: <b>“Indeed Allaah looked at the people of the earth and hated them, both Arabs and non-Arabs, except for some remnants that were from the People of the Book.”</b> [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when the Prophet was sent forth and began calling towards Islaam, his call was not answered at first instance except by a few from each tribe. And those that did accept his call feared from their tribes and families lest they should be subjected to extreme punishment. And they would suffer while being patient with that for sake of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to their weakness, the (first) Muslims would be frightened by every opposing force and they would flee for the sake of their Religion to far-off lands as was shown when they migrated twice &#8211; to the land of Abysinnia, and then when they migrated to Madeenah. And there was from among them, he who was tortured for the sake of Allaah and he who was killed. <b>So those who entered into the fold of Islaam, back in those days – they were the strangers.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Islaam spread after the Hijrah to Madeenah and its followers became victorious over every group. After that, the people entered into the Religion of Allaah in multitudes. And Allaah perfected the Religion for them and completed His favor upon them. Then the Messenger of Allaah died, and the Muslims were upon the utmost level due to their firm adherence to their Religion. They were powerful and dominant. And they continued to be upon this condition during the times of Abu Bakr and ‘Umar (during their Khilaafah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Shaytaan (Devil) unleashed his evil plot upon the Muslims and discord fell between them. And the trials of <b>Doubts</b> (<i>Ash-Shubuhaat</i>) and<b>Desires</b> (<i>Ash-Shahawaat</i>) became widespread. These two evils did not stop increasing at all until the plan of Shaytaan was established and the majority of the creation obeyed him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from among them were those who entered into obedience to him by way of the evil of Doubts (<i>Ash-Shubuhaat</i>). And from among them, were those who fell into the evil of Desires (<i>Ash-Shahawaat</i>). And from among them, were those who combined between them both. All of that was from what the Messenger of Allaah, sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, had warned us would occur.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>As for the evil of Doubts:</b><br />
Then it has been reported on the Prophet through many paths of narration that his ummah would divide into more than seventy sects. This is based on the differing found in the reports concerning the exact number with which they will exceed the number seventy. And it is reported on him, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, that all of these groups will be in the Hellfire, except for one group – and it is that (group) which adheres to what he and his companions were upon (during their time). [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>And as for the evil of Desires:</b><br />
It is reported in Saheeh Muslim on the authority of &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn &#8216;Amr, radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa, that the Prophet, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said:<b>“When the treasures of the Persians and the Romans are opened for you, how will your people be?”</b> ‘Abd-ur-Rahmaan Ibn ‘Awf,<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>, said: “We will say what Allaah has ordered us (to say).”[15] He, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>“Or other than that. You will compete against each other, then you will envy one another, then you will turn your backs on one another.”</b> [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree on the authority of &#8216;Amr Ibn &#8216;Awf, <i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>, the Prophet, sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, said: <b>“I swear by Allaah! It is not poverty that I fear for you. Rather, what I fear the most for you is that the pleasures of this world will be presented to you as they were presented to those before you. And you will compete against each other for it, as they competed against each other. And it will destroy you, just as it destroyed them.”</b> [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in the two Saheeh collections on the authority of &#8216;Uqbah Ibn &#8216;Aamir, <i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>, a hadeeth from the Prophet, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, with a similar meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when the treasures of Kissra (Chosroes) were opened for ‘Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab, he began to weep and said: <b>“Indeed this (treasure) did not open upon a people ever, except that Allaah placed discord between them.”</b> [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to fear these two evils (of Doubts and Desires) for his ummah as has been reported in the Musnad of Imaam Ahmad on the authority of Abu Barzah that the Prophet, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>“Indeed, I only fear for you the desires of transgression found in your stomachs and your private parts and the calamities (fitan) that lead people astray.&#8221;</b> And in another narration there occurs: <b>&#8220;&#8230;and the desires (hawaa) that lead people astray.&#8221;</b> [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when a majority of the people fell victim to either or both of these evils, they began to cut off ties with one another and they began to hate one another. This only came after them having been brothers, loving and supporting one another. Indeed the evil of <b>Desires</b> became something common and accepted amongst a majority of the creatures. And it tested people by way of the worldly life and its pleasures. So that became the goal of the people’s striving. They sought after it and became pleased with it. They became angry due to it and they hated for its sake and loved for its sake. Because of this, they would sever family relations and spill blood unlawfully. And for this purpose, they committed disobedience to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the evil of <b>Doubts</b> and vain desires that lead astray, then it was because of this that the Muslims divided and became sects, some groups declaring others as disbelievers. Thus, they became enemies, divided into groups and parties. This only happened after having been brothers. Their hearts were united upon the heart of one man. So not one of all these sects is saved, except for the one saved sect (<i>Al-Firqat-un-Naajiyah</i>). And they are the ones mentioned in the saying of the Prophet, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“There will not cease to be a group from my ummah triumphant upon the truth. Those who oppose them will not be able to harm them, nor will those who abandon them, until Allaah’s order comes about (Day of Judgment) and they are in that state.”</b>[20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They will be the strangers – the ones who have been mentioned in the previous ahaadeeth – during the Last Days. They are the ones who will correct others when the people have become corrupt. They are those who will rectify what the people have corrupted of the Sunnah. They are the ones who will flee from affliction for the sake of their Religion. They are the ones who will extract themselves from their close relatives (for Allaah’s sake).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because they are so few that you will not find any among them in an entire tribe (family), except one or two. In some tribes, you will not find any of them, just as it was when the first people entered into Islaam. This is the way the majority of the scholars have explained this hadeeth.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b class="Marker">FOOTNOTES:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="Footnotes">[1] What is meant here is the attainment of Paradise in which the people who are granted it will be able to see the Face of Allaah, as has been stated in various texts of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] It is said that Toobaa means something good. Allaah mentions this word in Surat-ur-Ra’ad of His Final Revelation: <b>“Those who believe and do righteous deeds, Toobaa is for them and a pleasant destination.”</b> According to Ibn Katheer’s Tafseer (Abridged 1/281), Ibraaheem An-Nakha’ee (rahimahullaah), the great Taabi’ee, said it means “good is for them.” Qataadah said: “When a man says Toobaa for you it means you have attained something good. ‘Ikrimah and Mujaahid said that Toobaa means Paradise. And it is also said that Toobaa refers to a tree in Paradise which the Prophet, sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, spoke of when he said: <b>“Verily, there is a tree in Paradise under the shadow of which a rider can travel for a hundred years without being able to cover (it’s distance) completely.”</b> [Saheeh Muslim] This is what seems to be indicated in the above hadeeth, due to another hadeeth reported on the Prophet, in which he said: <b>“Toobaa is a tree in Paradise. Its (shade’s) distance (in traveling) is one hundred years. And the garments of the inhabitants of Paradise will be extracted from its branches.”</b> Imaam Al-Albaanee graded it hasan in his Silsilat-ul-Ahaadeeth As-Saheehah (no. 1985).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Saheeh Muslim (1/130): See Sharh Saheeh Muslim of Imaam An-Nawawee (2/175-176)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Sunan Ibn Maajah (no. 3988), Sunan At-Tirmidhee (5/18) and he said it was authentic, Musnad Ahmad (5/296). It has also been recorded by Al-Khattaabee in his <i>Ghareeb-ul-Hadeeth</i> (1/175). Shaikh Al-Albaanee declared it weak (<i>da&#8217;eef</i>) in his collection <i>Al-Ahaadeeth As-Saheehah</i> (no. 1273)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] This hadeeth is also reported by Ahmad and At-Tabaraanee and it is saheeh as has been stated by Shaikh Saleem Al-Hilaalee in his book <i>Toobaa Lil-Ghurabaa</i> (no. 1). However the hadeeth with a different wording from the hadeeth of &#8216;Abd-ur-Rahmaan Ibn Sanah is weak. See <i>Toobaa Lil-Ghurabaa</i> (no. 10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] This hadeeth was reported by At-Tirmidhee in his Sunan (5/18) and he said it was saheeh. It was also reported by Ibn &#8216;Adiyy in <i>Al-Kaamil</i> (6/2080), At-Tabaraanee in <i>Al-Kabeer</i>(17/16), Abu Nu&#8217;aim in <i>Al-Hilyah</i> (2/10) and Al-Khateeb Al-Baghdaadee in Al-Jaami&#8217; (1/112) as well as others. In his checking to the book <i>Al-&#8216;Itisaam</i> of Imaam Ash-Shaatibee (1/22), Shaikh Saleem Al-Hilaalee said concerning At-Tirmidhee&#8217;s authentication of this hadeeth: &#8220;This is from the hadeeth that he, may Allaah have mercy on him, has overlooked. For indeed, Katheer (Ibn &#8216;Abdillaah) is very weak. Rather, Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee accused him of being a liar! And he described him with that (lying) as being one of his main supports, as occurs in<i>Manaaqib-ush-Shaafi&#8217;ee</i> of Al-Bayhaqee (1/547-548). This is a criticism (<i>jarh</i>) that reaches the highest level of severity. Thus his hadeeth are to be disregarded completely.&#8221; Therefore, the hadeeth is da&#8217;eef jiddan (very weak) as is stated in <i>Toobaa Lil-Ghurabaa</i> (no. 13) and <i>Da’eef Al-Jaami’-us-Sagheer</i> (no. 1441)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] This hadeeth has been reported by At-Tahaawee in <i>Mushkil-ul-Aathaar</i> (1/298), Al-Laalikaa&#8217;ee in Sharh Usool &#8216;Itiqaad Ahl-is-Sunnah (2/112), and Al-Bayhaqee in <i>Az-Zuhd-ul-Kabeer</i> (200). Al-Haythamee attributed it to At-Tabaraanee in his book <i>Majma&#8217;-uz-Zawaa&#8217;id</i> (7/278), saying: &#8220;In its chain is &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Saalih, the scribe of Laith, and he is weak. However, he has been declared reliable.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] At-Tabaraanee reported this hadeeth in his <i>Kabeer</i> (6/164) and his <i>Sagheer</i> (1/104). Al-Haythamee said in <i>Majma’-uz-Zawaa&#8217;id</i> (7/278): &#8220;Its narrators are all of the standards of the Saheeh (collections), except Bakr Ibn Saleem, for he is reliable. Saleem Al-Hilaalee said in his checking of <i>Al-&#8216;Itisaam</i> (1/18): &#8220;Bakr Ibn Saleem is weak. However, he is used as a support during cases when hadeeth need to be backed up and supported. Al-Haafidh (Ibn Hajr) said in <i>At-Taqreeb</i>: &#8216;He is acceptable&#8217; meaning when a hadeeth needs to be supported. And if this is not the case, then he is layyin.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] This hadeeth is recorded by Imaam Ahmad, Al-Bazaar and Abu Ya’laa. Al-Haythamee said in <i>Majma’-uz-Zawaa’id</i> (7/277): &#8220;Its narrators are the narrators of the standard of the Saheeh (collections).&#8221; Saleem Al-Hilaalee declared it saheeh in his <i>Toobaa Lil-Ghurabaa</i> (no. 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] Al-Haythamee (rahimahullaah) said in Majma’-uz-Zawaa&#8217;id (7/278): &#8220;In its chain is Ibn Lahee&#8217;ah and there is weakness in him.&#8221; The hadeeth can be found in the Musnad of Imaam Ahmad (2/177). It is authentic due to its many paths of narration. Imaam Al-Albaanee authenticated it in Saheeh Al-Jaami&#8217;-us-Sagheer (no. 3291)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] A marfoo&#8217; hadeeth is a statement that has been reported by a companion, yet &#8220;raised&#8221; to the level of being a saying of the Prophet. A mawqoof hadeeth is a statement that is reported by a companion and &#8220;stopped&#8221;, meaning it ends up being only his statement, as opposed to being raised to a saying of the Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12] This hadeeth has been narrated by Imaam Ahmad in mawqoof form, and by his son ‘Abdullaah in marfoo’ form. It can be found in <i>Az-Zuhd</i> (77149). The hadeeth is <i>da&#8217;eef</i> as has been clarified by Shaikh Saleem Al-Hilaalee in his book <i>Toobaa Lil-Ghurabaa</i> (no. 3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] Saheeh Muslim (Eng.): vol. 4, no. 6853. What is meant by the remnants of the People of the Book are those who stuck to their religion upon truth without changing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14] This hadeeth has been reported from a number of different routes. Perhaps the one most similar to what the Shaikh (Ibn Rajab) is paraphrasing here is that which has been reported by At-Tabaraanee in his <i>Mu&#8217;jam-us-Sagheer</i> (no. 724), in which the Prophet said: <b>&#8220;This ummah will split into seventy-three sects, all of which will be in the Hellfire, except for one.&#8221;</b> They asked: <b>&#8220;And which is that sect?&#8221;</b> He, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>&#8220;(The ones that adhere to) That which I and my Companions are upon today.&#8221;</b> In another narration on the authority of Anas Ibn Maalik, radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa, the Prophet,<i> sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>&#8220;Every one of them will be in the Hellfire, except one and it is the Jamaa&#8217;ah.&#8221;</b> And in another narration on the authority of Abu Sufyaan, <i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>: <b>&#8220;The Messenger of Allaah, sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, stood amongst us one day and said: &#8216;Indeed those before you from the People of the Book divided into seventy-two groups. And, indeed, this group (Muslims) will divide into seventy-three. Seventy-two groups will be in the Fire and one of them will be in Paradise. And it is the Jamaa&#8217;ah.’&#8221; </b>This latter hadeeth was reported by Ahmad, Al-Haakim, Abu Dawood and others. Al-Haakim authenticated it and Adh-Dhahabee agreed. At-Tirmidhee (no. 2641) also reported a similar hadeeth to it and graded it saheeh. Imaam Al-Albaanee listed all its paths of narrations and different wordings in his <i>Silsilat-ul-Ahaadeeth As-Saheehah</i> (no. 204) and clarified that it is an authentic hadeeth without any doubt about its authenticity. In summary, the hadeeth and its additions are hasan due to its various paths of narrations, which serve as supporting evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15] He means by this: We will praise Him, thank Him and ask Him for an increase in His Bounty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[16] Saheeh Muslim (no. 2962) and Sunan Ibn Maajah (no. 3996)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[17] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree (Eng.): vol. 5, no. 351</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[18] Refer to <i>Al-Bidaayah-wan-Nihaayah</i> (7/70) of Ibn Katheer for an account of the event. It is recorded in his book under the section of the Battle of Jaloolaa&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[19] Imaam Ahmad (4/423) and others reported this hadeeth. Al-Manaawee said that it had a good chain in his book <i>Al-Jaami’-ul-Azhar</i> (1/146). Al-Albaanee graded it saheeh in his checking of <i>At-Targheeb wat-Tarheeb</i> (no. 49)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[20] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree (4/252), Saheeh Muslim (no. 170), Sunan At-Tirmidhee (4/504), and Sunan Ibn Maajah (no. 3952)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the statement of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>Islaam began as something strange and will return to being strange, as it began</strong>&#8220;,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Imaam Al-Awzaa&#8217;ee</strong></span> (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;As for this, then it does not mean that Islaam will go away, but rather it means that the Ahl-us-Sunnah [21] will go away, up to the point that there will not remain in a land, any from them except one person.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Based on this understanding, there can be found in the statements of the Salaf much praise for the Sunnah and their describing it as being strange, and describing its adherents and followers as being few.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Al-Hasan Al-Basree (rahimahullaah)</strong> </span>used to say to his companions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Oh Ahl-us-Sunnah! Be gentle with one another and may Allaah have mercy on you. For indeed, you are from amongst the fewest of people.&#8221; [22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Yoonus Ibn &#8216;Ubayd (rahimahullaah)</strong></span> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There is not a thing more stranger than the Sunnah. And what is more stranger than it, is the one who knows it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Sufyaan Ath-Thawree (rahimahullaah)</strong></span> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Treat the Ahl-us-Sunnah kindly, for verily, they are strangers.&#8221; [23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The understanding of the term &#8220;Sunnah&#8221; to these scholars, was the way of the Prophet &#8211; that which he and his companions were upon &#8211; free from <strong>Doubts (Ash-Shubuhaat)</strong> and <strong>Desires (Ash-Shahawaat)</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this, Al-Fudayl Ibn Tyaad (rahimahullaah) used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Ahl-us-Sunnah is he who knows what is entering his stomach from the halaal&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is because the consumption of halaal is from the greatest aspects of the Sunnah, which the Prophet and his companions were upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then it remained the custom of the majority of the later scholars, from the scholars of hadeeth and other fields, that the Sunnah consisted of what was free from Doubts in regards to Creed. This was especially the case with issues such as the belief in Allaah, His angels, His books, His messengers, the Last Day, and other issues such as Al-Qadar (Divine Pre-Ordainment) and the merits of the Sahaabah. They compiled literary works concerning this knowledge and named them books of &#8220;Sunnah&#8221;. This knowledge was only labeled with the name &#8220;Sunnah&#8221;, because its significance was tremendous and all those who opposed it were on the brink of destruction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the complete Sunnah, then it is the path that is free and safe from Doubts and Desires, as has been stated by Al-Hasan, Yoonus Ibn &#8216;Ubayd, Sufyaan, Al-Fudayl and others besides them. Due to this, its adherents are described as strange because of their small number and rarity in the Last Days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why it has been mentioned in some of the previously stated reports that they are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;A righteous people surrounded by people abounding in much evil. Those who disobey them are greater in number than those who obey them.&#8221;</strong> [24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this is an indication of the smallness of their amount in number and in the amount of those who answer and accept their call. We also are made aware of the greatness in number of those who oppose them and disobey them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why it is reported in numerous ahaadeeth, praise for the one who sticks firmly to his Religion during the Last Days. And that he who does so will be like one who holds tightly onto hot pieces of coal. <strong>And that the one who acts upon it, will receive fifty times the reward more than those before him</strong>. [25] This is because he will not find any supporters in doing good deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>These strangers are of two categories</strong>: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first of them are those <strong>who rectify themselves</strong> when the people have become corrupt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second category contains those <strong>who rectify what the people have corrupted of the Sunnah</strong>. And this (latter one) is the most highest and virtuous of the two categories.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[21] What is meant by the term Ahl-us-Sunnah are all the Muslims who strictly follow the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad. They learn it, act upon it, enforce it and teach it to others. They consist of the scholars, their students and those that follow in their footsteps.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[22] This report was recorded by Al-Laalikaa&#8217;ee. Badr Al-Badr indicated its weakness in his notes to Kashf-ul- Kurbah. However, a similar narration to this one has been recorded by Ad-Daarimee (1/72) and its wording is: &#8220;For verily, Ahl-us-Sunnah are the least of people in number who have preceded, and they are the least of people in number who remain.&#8221; This narration is authentic. See Dr. Nasr Al-&#8216;Aql&#8217;s book Maflioom Ahl-is- Sunnati wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah (pg. 84)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[23] This narration was recorded by Al-Laalikaa&#8217;ee in his Sharh Usool &#8216;Itiqaad Ahl-is-Sunnah (1/64) and it was mentioned from him by Ibn Al-Jawzee in Talbees Iblees. Dr. Nasr Al-&#8216;Aql mentioned it in his book Mafhoom Ahl-is-Sunnati wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah (pg. 85)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[24] Musnad Ahmad (2/177) and its checking has been stated previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[25] This saying is based on the following hadeeth of the Prophet: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Verily, after you there will come times requiring patience. (In those days) the one who holds fast to that which you are upon will have the reward of fifty amongst you. He will receive the reward of fifty (i.e. the one holding onto the way of the companions in later times)</strong></span>.&#8221; Reported by Al-Marwazee in As-Sunnah (no. 35), At-Tabaraanee in Al-Kabeer (17/117), Abu Dawood in his Sunan (no. 3441), At-Tirmidhee (no. 3057), who declared it saheeh, and Ibn Maajah (no. 4014). Imaam Al-Albaanee authenticated it in As-Saheehah (no. 494)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Chapter 8 : An Explanation of the Obligation to Adhere to the Sunnah and to Take from the Guidance of the Messenger of Allaah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed from the greatest benefits and lessons from Hajj for the pilgrims to the House of Allaah is knowing the importance of the Sunnah and limiting oneself to it in all actions of the Hajj. The importance of knowing the Sunnah becomes apparent from the state of many pilgrims who you see gathering together in circles of knowledge and remembrance. They ask the scholars many questions regarding the description of Hajj: how to perform it, its pillars and obligatory duties and those acts that negate it. These questions are asked with precision and enthusiasm, especially by those who, in their Hajj, are conscious of the saying of the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-: ‘Take your Hajj rites from me’ [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore Hajj will not be accepted by Allaah unless the Muslim does it in the manner of the Messenger of Allaah, adhering to his guidance in the Hajj and following his Sunnah &#8211; without excess or negligence, without going to extremes or being without purpose and without adding to or taking away from it. So if a Muslim adheres to the Sunnah of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- in his Hajj and limits himself to his guidance, he benefits from the knowledge that adhering to the Sunnah and following his -sall&#8217;Allaahu alayhi wasallam- guidance is obligatory in all acts of obedience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as it is necessary to take the rites of Hajj from the Messenger, it is also necessary for all Muslims to take the guidance of the Messenger in every act of obedience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said with regards to prayer: ‘pray as you have seen me praying.’ [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said in all matters of general obedience: ‘Whoever does an action which we have not commanded then it is rejected.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration: ‘Whoever innovates in this matter of ours, that which is not from it, it will be rejected.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus all actions which are not done in accordance to the guidance of the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- will not be accepted by Allaah, as is shown by his explicit statement -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam: ‘Whoever does an action which we have not commanded then it is rejected.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed this proves that every innovation (Bida’) introduced into the religion has no foundation in the Book or Sunnah, regardless of whether it is from knowledge-based verbal innovations or practical, worship-based innovations. So whoever informs of other than that which Allaah and His Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- have informed or worships in a way that Allaah and His Messenger have not permitted then this will be returned to the one who did it and it will not be accepted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth also implies the meaning that anyone who does an action in accordance to what Allaah and His Messenger have commanded i.e. is worshipping Allaah with correct creed and righteous actions from what is obligatory and recommended, then his action will be accepted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Abu Daawood, Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and others on the authority of al-Irbaad bin Sariyyah –RadhiAllaahu anhu- who said that the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- led us in prayer that day, then turned and faced us and gave us an admonition which caused hearts to tremble and eyes to shed tears.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we said: ‘It is as if this is a farewell speech, so advise us O Messenger of Allaah!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘I advise you to hear and obey, even if a slave rules over you. Indeed whosoever from you lives will see many differences, so hold on to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Khulafaah after me, bite on to it with your molar teeth. Beware of newly invented matters, since every Bida’ is misguidance.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- saying in the hadeeth ‘All Bida’ is misguidance’ then this is from his comprehensive, eloquent speech. This statement is a great principle from the principles of the Deen and it resembles the saying of the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam: ‘Whoever innovates anything in this matter of ours that which is not from it, will be rejected.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus anyone who innovates and ascribes something to the Deen which has no foundation to which it can be referred, then it is misguidance which the Deen is free from, the one who innovates has the innovation rejected and it is not accepted from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Deen of Allaah is built upon two great, strong principles and foundations. Firstly; That we do not worship except Allaah Alone who has no partner. Secondly; That we do not worship Him except with what He legislated on the tongue of His Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-. We do not worship Allaah according to our desires or Bida’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah Ta’ala said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Then We have put you on a plain way of (Our) commandment. So follow that and do not follow the desires of those who do not know. Verily, they can avail you nothing against Allaah &gt;&gt; [Al-Jathiyah : 18-19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah Ta’ala said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Or do they have partners with Allaah (false gods), who have instituted for them a religion which Allaah has not allowed. &gt;&gt; [Shura: 21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not allowed for anyone to worship Allaah except with what His Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- legislated from obligatory and recommended actions. We do not worship Him with newly invented matters which have no foundation in the Deen nor any basis for them in the Sharia’. It is not allowed for anyone to worship anything except Allaah Alone, so no-one is allowed to pray except to Allaah, nor fast except for Allaah, nor perform the Hajj except to His house, nor rely upon anyone except Him, nor can anyone direct any aspect of worship to anyone except Him.[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah combined these two great principles in His –<br />
Subhanhu- statement :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord.&gt;&gt;[Kahf :110]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A good action is that which is in agreement with the pure Sharia’ and is sincere i.e. that which is not done, except for Allaah’s Face. These are the two pillars for acceptance of actions. So if an action is done sincerely but is not correct then it will not be accepted and if the action is correct but is not done sincerely for Allaah, then it will not be accepted unless the action is sincere and correctwhere sincere means that it is done purely for Allaah and being correct means that it is done according to the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is obligatory on every Muslim who hopes for success and happiness for himself in this world and the hereafter is that he attaches himself to the guidance of the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-, that his action conforms to his &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- Sunnah and that he is wary of deviating from his guidance, opposing his Sunnah or following other than his path; since he -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- is a guide and example for his nation, as Allaah Ta’ala said regarding him :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a good example to follow for he who hopes in (the Meeting with) Allaah and the Last Day and remembers Allaah much. &gt;&gt; [Ahzab:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;The Prophet is closer to the believers than their ownselves &gt;&gt; [Ahzab: 6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means : ‘He has more right over them in all aspects of the Deen and worldly affairs and he is of greater importance to them than their ownselves or anyone else. It is obligatory upon them to give what he determines from their wealth even if they are in need of it. It is obligatory upon them to have more love for him than for their ownselves, and it is obligatory upon them to put his rulings first, before their own rulings for their ownselves. In brief, if the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- calls them to something and they themselves call to something else then it is obligatory for them to give precedence to what he calls them to and to defer what they themselves call to. It is obligatory upon them to have obedience to him which supersedes obedience to their ownselves and that they prefer obedience to him before that which their ownselves incline to and their inner selves desire.’ [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that this necessitates that the Muslim strives to know the Sunnah and sacrifices time in the path to knowing the guidance of the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- &#8211; which is done by questioning the people of knowledge, sitting in the circles of remembrance where the rules of Halaal and Haraam are explained and also by reading beneficial books and useful works which collect these issues. So after that a Muslim can establish a path whereby he can worship correctly on a sound methodology, in agreement with the guidance of the noble Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation Of The Text In Al-Qawl-ul-Mufeed Fee Adillatit Tawheed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Benefit (Faa’idah):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>ash-Shaykh al-‘Allaamah al-Faqeeh Muhammad ibn Saalih ibn ‘Uthaymeen (rahimahullaahu ta’aalaa) said:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his valuable book ((al-Ibdaa’ fee Kamaal ash-Shara’ wa Khatar al-Ibtidaa’)) [Innovations in the Perfect Legislation and the Hazards of Innovations] pages 21 –23:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">( … Oh my brother, verily following and adherence does not become a reality until the action is in agreement with six issues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The First (al-Awwal): <strong>as-Sabab (Reason)</strong>. Like the one who prays two Raka’at for the reason of the descending of the rain (Nuzool al-Matar).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Second (ath-Thaanee): <strong>al-Jins (Type)</strong>. Like the one who brings his Zakaat al-Fitr in the form of money.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Third (ath-Thaalith): <strong>al-Qadar (Number)</strong>. Like the one who prays four Raka’at for Maghrib intentionally.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Fourth (ar-Raabi’): <strong>al-Kayfiyyah (How)</strong>. Like the one who makes Wudoo’ (ablution) and starts with his feet and ends with his face.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Fifth (al-Khaamis): <strong>az-Zamaan (Time)</strong>. Like the one who performs the ‘Udhiyah (slaughtering) in Ramadhaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sixth (as-Saadis): <strong>al-Makaan (Place)</strong>. Like the one who makes I’tikaaf in places other than the Masaajid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oh my brother: Bite unto the Sunnah of the Messenger ( صلى الله عليه و سلم) with your molar teeth (an- Nawaajidh). And tread the path of as-Salafus-Saalih (the righteous predecessors), and be on what they were upon, and see if this harms you in any way?!). End of his (rahimahullaah) speech with abbreviation (Tasarruf) and summarization (Ikhtisaar).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Explanation Of The Text By Shaykh Ahmed Al-Wasaabee (Hafidhahullaah):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above six conditions that have been mentioned, they are the conditions for which every action must be in agreement to them. And the examples that ash-Shaykh al-‘Uthaymeen has mentioned for each of the six conditions are the actions that are opposite to and do not satisfy these conditions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in regards to the first condition, and it is as-Sabab (reason), then the example mentioned, which is of the one who prays two Raka’at for the descending of the rain, then it has no Daleel (evidence) from the Kitaab or the Sunnah, and the Book and the Sunnah have not legislated and given us permission to pray two Raka’at for the reason of the descending of the rain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the second example, of the one who brings his Zakaat al-Fitr in the form of money, then this is in opposition to the Ahaadeeth of the Prophet ( صلى الله عليه و سلم) when he ordered the people that they should bring out their Zakaat at the end of Ramadhaan in the form of foodstuff, such as raisins or dates.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the third condition, which is al-Qadar (number), and the example mentioned is of the one who prays four Raka’at for Salaatul-Maghrib intentionally, and we know the number legislated for Salaatul-Maghrib is three Raka’at.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the fourth example is of the person who makes Wudoo’ and starts with his feet first and ends with his face, and this is also in opposition to the Sunnah of the Prophet ( صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So al-‘Allaamah ibn ‘Uthaymeen has mentioned the examples which oppose and go against the Sunnah in these six conditions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the sixth condition, which is al-Makaan (place), and the example mentioned is of the one who makes I’tikaaf in places other than the Masjid. So the one who makes I’tikaaf in his house, or in a cave, or in any place other than the Masjid, then his I’tikaaf is not accepted. And the best places to make I’tikaaf are the three Masaajid: Masjid al-Haraam, Masjid an- Nabawee, and Masjid al-Aqsa. And there is a Hadeeth in which we find the wording: ((<em><span style="color:#008000;">There is no I’tikaaf except in the three Masaajid</span></em>)) [Laa I’tikaaf Illaa fil-Masaajid ath-Thalaathah] [1]. And Shaykh Ahmed mentioned that this Hadeeth is weak in its chain, and the meaning of the Hadeeth is that the best and more perfect type of I’tikaaf is in these three Masaajid, even though it is allowable for a person to make I’tikaaf in other than these three Masaajid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;"><em>[1] 1 Sa’eed ibn Mansoor said in his Sunan as is stated in al-Muhallaa (5/195, issue: 633): Sufyaan ibn ‘Uyaynah narrated to us from Jaami’ ibn Abee Raashid from Shaqeeq ibn Salamah that he said: “Hudhayfah said to ‘Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood: ‘I have come to know that the Messenger of Allaah ( صلى الله عليه و سلم ) said: ((There is no I’tikaaf except in the three Masaajid)).’”</em></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><em>[You may want to read <a title="Most Distinguished Qualities of the Saved Group – Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2015/01/09/most-distinguished-qualities-of-the-saved-group-shaykh-ibn-uthaymeen/"><strong>Most Distinguished Qualities of the Saved Group – Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen</strong></a> before reading the below]</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 55</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Is there something you want to add concerning the qualities of the saved sect?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong> The truth of the matter is that there isn’t anything to add, since the four fundamental matters that we have mentioned are clear and sufficient. However, it might need some details with respect to the matter of manners. So, the most important aspect of manners is unity and agreement on the truth, the thing that Allaah (Azza wa Jal) has enjoined on us:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Your Rabb (Allaah) prescribed for Noah, and that which We revealed to you –[O Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)], and that which He prescribed for Ibraaheem, Moosaa, ‘Eesaa–that you should establish the Religion, acting upon what is prescribed, and not split into sects regarding it.</em></span> [Qur’aan, soorat ash-Shooraa (42): 13].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (Allaah Azza wa Jal) informed us that those who split their Religion into sects, Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is clear of them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, those who divided their religion and break up into sects, you Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) have no concern of them in the least.</span></em> [Qur’aan, soorat al-An’aam (6): 159].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So agreement and unity of the hearts are from the most distinguished qualities of the saved group, ahlus-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah. In case disagreement amongst them occurs due to Ijtihaad,[74] in matters where Ijtihaad is applicable, then they do not hold enmity, hatred or hostility against each other. Rather, they believe that they are brothers even if this kind of disagreement takes place amongst them. This is true to the extent that each of them would pray behind the Imaam believing that the latter is not in a state of Wudoo´ whilst the Imaam believes he does have his Wudoo’. An example for this is that each of them would pray behind someone who ate camel meat believing that it nullifies the prayer whilst this Imaam believes that it does not. Thus each of them consider that the prayer behind this Imaam is correct, even though if he would have prayed the same prayer [after eating camel meat] by himself, he would have consider it incorrect. All of this is because they consider that the difference in opinion arising from Ijtihaad, in cases where Ijtihaad is permissible, is, in reality, not a disagreement. Since each one of the disputants follows what is incumbent upon both for them to follow from the evidence that is impermissible for either one to relinquish. They see that if their brother disagrees with them regarding a certain action and does this in compliance with the evidence, then in reality he is in agreement with them. This is because they themselves call for the following of the proof wherever it may be. So if he disagrees with them based upon his conformance with what he regards as valid proof, then in reality he is in agreement with them, since he is in conformity with that which they call for and aim to, from judging by the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is well known to many scholars what took place between the companions with regard to similar matters of disagreement, even during the time of their Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم). He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not harshly denounce anyone of them. When he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) returned from the battle of al-Ahzaab, Jibreel came to him and directed him to set out for Banee Quraydhah who broke the covenant with the Muslims. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) then ordered his companions and said: “None of you should pray ‘Asr except at Banee Quraydhah.” [75] So, they left Madeenah for Banee Qurayadhah, and when the time for ‘Asr prayer arrived some of them delayed their prayer until they reached Banee Qurayadhah and therefore prayed it outside of its time. They did not pray until after sun set, since the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: “None of you should pray ‘Asr except at Banee Quraydhah.” Others prayed on time and said that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) intention was for them to make haste in setting off. [76]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those were the ones who were correct in their understanding. In spite of this, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not blame anyone of them, and none of them held any enmity or hatred against each other because of their disagreement in understanding this text. That is why I believe that it is a binding duty upon the Muslims who belong to the Sunnah that they should be one nation, and that factionalism should not occur amongst them–a person belongs to this group and another belongs to another group, and the third belongs to a third group and so on. In such a manner, they fight amongst each other with the spears of their tongues. They hate each other and take enemies out of each other because of a disagreement whose ruling is permissible to deduce by way of Ijtihaad. There is no need for me to specifically mention each group. But the sensible person would understand and the matter would be clear to him. So, I believe that it is incumbent upon ahlus-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah to unite even though they may dispute in that wherein they have been differing as a result of their understanding of what is necessitated by the texts. All praise is due to Allaah, for this is a matter in which there is ample scope for accommodation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is important is agreement and unity of the hearts. And there is no doubt that the enemies of Islaam love that the Muslims are divided, regardless whether they are enemies who openly express their hostility, or enemies who pretend to be friends of Muslims or Islaam, while in reality they are not. So, the obligatory thing is that we should be distinguished with this distinctive mark and that is we are from the saved sect that agrees to unity.</p>

Of negating faith from yourself &#8211; Shaykh ibn&#160;Uthaymeen</span></a></p>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong>بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet ( <span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">صلى الله عليه وسلم</span>‎<em>) </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<em><span style="color:#008000;">Whoever Allah wants good for, He gives him understanding of the religion</span></em>.”[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And understanding of the religion demands <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>acceptance of it</strong></span>, because every person who understands and knows the religion, he <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>accepts it, and loves it</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Exalted, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">But no, by your Lord, they have not believed, until they make you (O Muhammad <span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">صلى الله عليه وسلم</span>‎) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.</span></em> (An-Nisa 4:65).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this form of swearing stresses &#8211; by use of the statement (No!), and swearing particularly by the Rububiyyah of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, over His slaves, and it is the mention of Allah’s Rububiyyah over His Messenger &#8211; it stresses the negation of faith from Whoever does not abide by these three matters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The First:</strong></span> Judgement of the Messenger ( <span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">صلى الله عليه وسلم</span>‎) based on His saying: &#8220;<em><span style="color:#008000;">until they make you judge in all disputes between them</span></em>&#8221; meaning (by you), the Messenger ( <span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">صلى الله عليه وسلم</span>‎).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever seeks judgement from other than Allah and His Messenger, he is not a believer. He is either a disbeliever whose disbelief has brought him out of the religion, or a disbeliever whose disbelief is less than that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Second:</span></strong> The chest being open to the judgement; such way that they do not find any resistance in themselves for his decision. They rather find acceptance and openness to what the Prophet ( <span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">صلى الله عليه وسلم</span>‎) decided.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Third:</span></strong> That they submit, which is stressed; meaning with complete submission.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So beware O Muslim! Of negating faith from yourself.</strong> Let us draw an example for this: Two men were arguing about the Shari&#8217;ah ruling on an issue. One of them brought evidence from the Sunnah, while the other found difficulty and felt constricted by that. How could he abandon who he follows, so as to follow this Sunnah? This man, without a doubt, has deficient faith, because the believer, in truth, is he who, when he has a text from the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger ( <span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">صلى الله عليه وسلم</span>‎) he feels as if he has won the greatest of spoils, and he will be joyful for that, and say: &#8220;<strong>All praise is due to Allah who guided me to this</strong>.” But so-and-so, who is partisan to his opinion, and tries to turn the textual proofs upside down, so that he can make them agree with what he likes, not what Allah and His Messenger intended, then this one is in a tremendous state of danger.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">Compiled &amp; Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 – Imam Shaafi’ee (d.199 A.H.) <i>-Rahimullaah-</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The first of manners which should be followed is that which the Messenger of Allaah  <i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> did.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘al-Adab’ by al-Bayhaqi (300) / ‘Tawjee al-Muqtasid’ p.5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 – Abul Abbas bin ‘Atta said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever adheres to the manners of the Sunnah then Allaah enlightens his heart with the light of knowing his <i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> Sunnah.  There is no station/status more noble than following the beloved <i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> in his commands, actions, his manners and in following his manners in statements and actions and intentions.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: Zuhud al-Kabeer by al-Bayhaqi (287) / ‘Tawjee al-Muqtasid’ p.5-6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) <i>-Rahimullaah- </i>said:<i></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Know that it is obligatory upon every mature, intelligent person from mankind and the Jinn to testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah sent him with the guidance and the religion of the truth to make it uppermost above all religions, and Allaah is sufficient as a witness. Allaah sent him to all of creation, mankind and Jinn, the Arabs and the non-Arabs, the Persians and the Indians, the Barbars and the Romans, and all the different types of non-Arabs, black and white.  What is meant by non-Arabs is those who do not have the Arab language, amongst all their different languages.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Muhammad <i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> was sent for every single person from the humans and the Jinn, whether they are from those who follow a revealed Book or not. He was sent for every single person in relation to his Deen, from the inward matters and outward ones, regarding his beliefs, realities, methods and his legislations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there is no ‘Aqeeda/belief except the Messenger’s <i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i>‘Aqeeda, and there is no reality except his reality, and there is no method except his method, and there is no legislation/Sharia’ except his Sharia’/legislation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No one from the creation can reach to Allaah, and to His pleasure, and His Paradise, and to His Generosity, and His Guardianship except by following the Messenger <i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> inwardly and outwardly, and in sayings and actions inwardly and outwardly, in statements of the heart and its beliefs, and the conditions of the heart and its realities, and the statements of the tongue and the actions of the limbs.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Majmoo’ Fatawa’ 10/430-431]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 – Imam Abu Muthaffar Samaani (d.489 A.H.) <i>-Rahimullaah-</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed we have been ordered with following and have been recommended to it, and prohibited from innovating and rebuked for it.  The sign of the Ahl-ul-Sunnah is that they follow the Salaf as-Salih, and that they leave everything that is innovated and a novelty.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘al-Inteesar li Ahl-ul-hadeeth’ p.69]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 – Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) <i>-Rahimullaah- </i>said:<i></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for the beliefs (al-‘Iteeqad) then it is not taken from me nor from someone more senior than me, rather it is taken from Allaah and His Messenger <i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> and that which the Salaf of the Ummah were gathered upon.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Majmoo’ Fatawa’ 3/161]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 – al-Hasan al-Basari (d.110 A.H.)  said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘A statement is not correct except with action, and a statement and action are not correct except with intention, and a statement and action and intention are not correct except with the Sunnah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Sharh Asool I’teeqad’ 1/57]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7 – Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) <i>-Rahimullaah- </i>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Following the Prophet <i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> is a proof and evidence that the follower loves Allaah –Azza wa Jal – and what indicates to that is the saying of – Jala wa ‘Ulaa – : &lt;&lt;Say (O Muhammad): ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me, Allaah will love you and forgive you of your sins.&gt;&gt; [Aal’Imraan:31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Majmoo’ Fatawa’ 1/334]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8 – Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) <i>-Rahimullaah- </i>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘What is necessary to comprehend is that Allaah Subhanahu said in His Book: &lt;&lt;Say (O Muhammad): ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me, Allaah will love you and forgive you of your sins.&gt;&gt; [Aal’Imraan:31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">A group from the Salaf said: there were a people at the time of the Messenger of Allaah<i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> who claimed that they love Allaah, so Allaah revealed this Ayaah: &lt;&lt;Say (O Muhammad): ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me, Allaah will love you and forgive you of your sins.&gt;&gt; [Aal’Imraan:31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah explained that His love obligates following the Messenger <i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> which in turn obligates the love of Allaah for His slave.  Allaah tested those who claim to love Allaah by this specific love, and indeed this issue has many claimants and those who are dubious in their love for Allaah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Majmoo’ Fatawa’ 10/81]</p>

<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1.      From Yahya bin Saeed al-Qattaan (d. 198 A.H.) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Do not look at the Hadeeth, but look at the <em>Isnaad</em> to see if the <em>Isnaad</em> is <em>saheeh</em>, otherwise do not be deceived by the Hadeeth if the <em>Isnaad</em> is not authentic.’</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">‘A man came to Maalik and asked him about an issue.  So Maalik said to him: ‘The Messenger of <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said such and such’.  The man said to him ‘Do you hold that view?’ Imam Malik said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And let those who oppose the Messenger’s commandment (i.e. his <em>Sunnah) </em>(among the sects) beware, lest some <em>Fitnah</em> befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them.&gt;&gt; [Noor: 63]’</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">7.      From ar-Rabia’ who said: ‘I heard Shaafi’ee saying:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Which sky will shade me and which earth will carry me if I narrate a Hadeeth from the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> and say an opinion other than that of the Hadeeth.’ And he said: ‘If you find a Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> then follow it and do not turn to the saying of anyone.’</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">19- From al-Hasan (d.110 A.H.) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Acting upon a little of the Sunnah is better than acting upon a lot of <em>Bida’</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘Shu’ab al-Eemaan’ 7/952 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">20- From Sa’eed bin al-Musayib (d. 93 A.H.) who said that he saw a man doing a lot of<em>Ruku</em> and <em>Sujood</em> [praying a lot of optional prayers] after the <em>Fajr</em> prayer, so he prohibited him from it.  So the man said: ‘O Abu Muhammad, will Allaah punish me for the prayer?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘No, but for opposing the Sunnah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘at-Tamheed’ 20/104 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">21- From AbdurRahman bin Mahdi (d. 198 A.H.) that a group of the Ahl-ul-Bida’ were mentioned in front of him and their striving in worship, so he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Allaah will not accept except that which is upon the Deen and the Sunnah, then he recited: &lt;&lt; But the Monasticism which they invented for themselves, We did not prescribe for them&gt;&gt; [Hadeed: 27]  So Allaah did not accept that from them and he reprimanded them about it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘Hileyat Al-Awaaliyah’ 9/8 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">22- From Jafar bin Ahmed bin Sinan (d. 307 A.H.) who said: ‘I heard my father saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is not a <em>Mubtadi’</em> except that he hates the companions of Hadeeth.  And if a man innovates a <em>Bida’</em> then the sweetness of the Hadeeth is torn out from his heart.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From: ‘Siyaar ‘Alaam an-Nubala’ 12/245]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">23- From Sufyaan ibn Sa’eed ath-Thawri  (d. 161 A.H.) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<em>Bida’</em> is more beloved to Iblees (<em>Shaytaan</em>) than sinning.  One repents from sinning, and one does not repent from <em>Bida’</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘Sharh Usool I’tiqaad Ahl-us-Sunnah’ al –Laalkaee 132 ]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#666699;">By Shaykh ul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah as-Salafi <em>-Rahimullaah-<br />
</em>From his book  ‘Madarij as-Salikeen’</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah as-Salafi <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘</strong>Allaah’s slave cannot implement &lt;&lt;You (Alone) we worship&gt;&gt; except with two great principles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of which is following the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second is <em>Ikhlaas</em> (sincerity) for the One worshipped.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is then implementing &lt;&lt;You (Alone) we worship&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people are divided into four categories in relation to these two principles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first of which is the people who have <em>Ikhlaas</em> for the One worshipped and for following the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>. They are, in reality, the people of &lt;&lt; You (Alone) we worship&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So all their actions are for Allaah, their sayings are for Allaah, their giving and their prohibiting are for Allaah, their loving is for Allaah and their hating is for Allaah.  Their apparent dealings and hidden dealings are for Allaah’s Face Alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They do not want reward from the people for this or thanks, nor do they desire position with them, nor do they request praise or status in their hearts or escape from their criticisms.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather they hold the people at the same status as those who are in graves. They do not possess any harm or benefit for them, neither life or death, nor the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, action done for the sake of the people, desiring refuge and status among them and hoping for harm and benefit from them, never emanates from the one who knows the people, but rather itemanates from the one who is ignorant of their affairs and one who is ignorant of his Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who knows the people places them according to their status.  So whoever knows Allaah, then he makes his actions and sayings sincerely for Allaah, he obeys Him and prohibits for Him,loves for Him and hates for Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A person does not deal with any thing from the creation, to the exclusion of Allaah, except due to his ignorance of Allaah and his ignorance of the creation.  Otherwise, if he knew Allaah and knew the people, he would prefer his dealing with Allaah to his dealing with the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, all his actions and worship should be in agreement with the command of Allaah and with what Allaah loves and is pleased with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the only actions which Allaah accepts from the one who performs them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this, He tries His worshippers with life and death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Who has created death and life, that He may test you which of you is best in deed. &gt;&gt; [Mulk: 2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He made whatever is on the earth as beautification for it so He could test which of them is the best in action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fudayl bin ‘Aayaad said: ‘A good action is one that is sincere and correct.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘O Abu ‘Alee which one is sincere and correct?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘If the action is sincere but is not correct, then it will not be accepted and if it is correct but not sincere it will not be accepted, until it is sincere and correct.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Khaalis</em> (sincere) is that which is for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Sawaab</em> (correct) is that which is according to the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what is mentioned in the saying of Allaah <em>–Ta’ala-</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord.’  &gt;&gt; [Khaf: 110]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And who can be better in religion than one who submits his face (himself) to Allaah (i.e. follows Allaah’s Religion of Islaamic Monotheism); and he is a good-doer. &gt;&gt; [Nisa: 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah does not accept actions except those that are sincerely for His Face, following His command. Anything other than these are rejected and returned to the one who performs them– even though he is in a great need of their being accepted – them being scattered in all directions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Saheeh, from the hadeeth of ‘Aeysha, on the authority of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>: ‘Every action which we have not commanded then it is rejected.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every action without a precedent does not increase the one performing it except in distance from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Allaah <em>–Ta’ala –</em> is surely worshipped according to His commands and not by opinions and desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second category is the one who neither has <em>Ikhlaas</em> nor does he follow.  His action is then not in accordance with the <em>Sharia’</em> nor is it sincerely for the one worshipped, such as actions which are beautified for the people, those who show off hypocritically by other than what Allaah and His Messenger legislated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These people are the most evil of creation, they are the most hated to Allaah <em>–Azza wa Jal</em>.  They have a greater share in the saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Think not that those who rejoice in what they have done (or brought about), and love to be praised for what they have not done,- think not you that they are rescued from the torment, and for them is a painful torment.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[aal-Imraan:188]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They rejoice in what they have been given of <em>Bida’</em>, misguidance and<em>Shirk</em> and they love being praised for falsely following the Sunnah and <em>Ikhlaas</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many of this type – from those who ascribe themselves to knowledge, poverty and worship – from those who deviated away from the <em>Sirat al-Mustaqeem</em> (straight way).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed they perform <em>Bida’</em> and misguidance, they show off – boasting about their actions, loving to be praised for that which they have not done of <em>Ittiba</em> (following the Messenger), <em>Ikhlaas</em> (sincerity) and<em> Ilm</em> (knowledge). They are the people who have Allaah’s Anger upon them and are the people of misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third category is he who is sincere in his actions, however he is not upon path of following the command, just like the ignorant worshippers and those who ascribe themselves to paths of <em>Zuhud</em>and poverty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everyone who worships Allaah without following Allaah’s command, believing that his act of worship is a form of drawing closer to Allaah, then his condition is like this.  Such as the one who thinks that listening to whistling and the clapping of hands is a form of drawing closer to Allaah or that being in isolation – which necessitates leaving the <em>Jummah</em> prayer and the congregational prayer – is a form of drawing closer to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or the one who thinks that continuous fasting, day and night, is a form of drawing closer to Allaah or fasting the day which all the people refrain from fasting is a form of drawing closer to Allaah or other similar examples.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth category is when his actions follow Allaah’s command, but they are for other than Allaah, such as obedience to those who hypocritically show off or like a man who fights to show off, or fanatically or for bravery or performs <em>Hajj</em> so it can be said that he performs <em>Hajj</em> or reads Qur’aan so it can be said that he recites Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Outwardly, the actions of these people are righteous actions which have been commanded, however they are not righteous and so they will not be accepted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allaah, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him), and perform prayer and give the <em>Zakaat</em>: and that is the right religion &gt;&gt;[al-Bayyinah: 5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So everyone has been ordered not to worship other than Allaah except by what He has commanded, having <em>Ikhlaas</em> for Him in worship and these are the people of</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything) &gt;&gt;’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from ‘Madarij as-Salikeen’ Volume 1, p.104-106</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#666699;">Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">By the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 1095 – From Abu Rashid al-Hubraani who said: Abu Umama al-Bahili took me by the hand and said: the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> took me by my hand and said to me: ‘O Abu Umama! Indeed from the believers are those who soften (with love) their hearts towards me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ahmad]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the meaning of ‘soften their hearts towards me’ is that they are gentle and incline towards me with love and affection and Allaah knows best.  And this cannot be achieved except with <em>Ikhlaas</em> (sincerity) and following the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> more than any other human being, because Allaah Ta’ala singled that out as an evidence to prove that a person really loves Allaah –Azza wa Jal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said: &lt;&lt;Say (O Muhammad): ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me, Allaah will love you and forgive you of your sins.&gt;&gt; [Aal’Imraan:31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it not about time that those who claim to love the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> in their speech and their <em>an-Nasheed</em> (songs), that they return to adhere to the true love which will lead to the love of Allaah Ta’ala, so that they will not be from those whom, the poet said:<br />
تعصي الإله َ وأنتَ تـُظهرُ حـُـبـَّه ُ *** هذا لـَعـَمْرُكَ في القياس ِ بديع ُ<br />
لو كانَ حـُبـُّكَ صادقا ً لأطعتـــَـــه ُ *** إنَّ المـُحـِبَّ لمنْ يُحـِبُّ مـُطيع ُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You disobey your Lord and present your love *** I swear that this action is innovative</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If your love was truthful you would have obeyed Him *** Indeed the one who loves is obedient to the one whom he loves</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#666699;"><em>Narrations of the Salaf part 3<br />
</em>Following the Companions</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 -From Hudhayfah bin al-Yamaan (d. 36 A.H.) <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Follow our paths, because verily if you follow us then indeed  you have truly advanced a lot.  And if you oppose us then indeed you have become extremely misguided.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘al-Bida’ by Ibn Wadha/44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 -From Jafar bin ‘Amr (d. 207 A.H.) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘We were a group from the children of the Companions of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>, we said:  Verily our fathers have indeed preceded us with <em>Hijrah</em> and companionship of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>, so let us strive in worship in the hope that we will reach their excellence.  We came across Tameem ad-Daari (the Companion) as an old man, who could not stand nor sit due to the length of his prayer.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘Zuhud’ by Ahmad /249]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – From Salih bin Kaysaan (d. 140 A.H.) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I met up with Zuhri and we would seek knowledge( together), then we said: We should write the <em>Sunnan</em>,  we should write that which came from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>, then we should write that which came from his Companions as indeed it is the Sunnah. So I said:  It is not the Sunnah and we should not write it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continues:  So Zuhri wrote it, but I did not write it, so he was successful whereas I became lost.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘Jamia Bayyan al-Ilm’ 2/1176]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 – From Muhammad Ibn Sireen (d. 110 A.H.) who was asked about combining the Umrah into the Hajj, so he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Umar bin Khattab and Uthman bin ‘Affaan disliked it, and if it was knowledge then they are more knowledgeable than me, and if it was their opinion then their opinion is better.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘Jamia Bayyan al-Ilm’ 1/773]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5- From Sa’eed bin al-Musayib (d. 93 A.H.)that he was asked about something so he who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Companions of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> differed regarding this and I can have no opinion to place along with theirs.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘Jamia Bayyan al-Ilm’ 1/770]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 – From Mujahid (d. around 105 A.H.)who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Scholars are the Companions of Muhammad <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘Jamia Bayyan al-Ilm’ 1/770]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7 – From AbdurRahmaan bin ‘Amr al-Aawza’i (d.156 A.H.) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Knowledge is that which came from the Companions of Muhammad <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>, and that which did not come from even one of them, then it is not knowledge.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘Jamia Bayyan al-Ilm’ 1/769]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8 – From Ibrahim an-Nakha’i (d. 96 A.H.) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If it had reached me concerning them, i.e. the Companions, that they did not exceed in the <em>Wudu</em> more than a finger nail, then I would not exceed it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ash-Sharh wal-Ibaanah /161]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">Compiled by Zakareeyah bin Ghulam Qadir</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by    Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Allaah Ta’ala gave proofs in His Noble Book concerning the excellence of the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em>, and following their way, Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;And the first to embrace Islaam of the <em>Muhajirun</em> and the <em>Ansar</em> and also those who followed them exactly. Allaah is well pleased with them, as they are well pleased with Him. He has prepared for them Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise), to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme success.&gt;&gt;   [Tawbah: 100]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn Mas’ood that the Prophet  said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The best people are my generation then those who will come after them and then those after them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari &amp; Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the Companions are the example and they are the ones to follow. It is obligatory upon every Muslim to follow them in what they understood from the evidences of the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, because they were the most knowledgeable of the people and they had the most correct understanding of the <em>Sharia’</em> texts out of all the people.  Consequently, if a Muslim takes other than their understanding then he will deviate away from the straight path, since the Companions stood with insight, and they viewed everything with their perceptive knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abu Zayed al-Qayrawani said in his book ‘al-Jaama’ (117):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Submission to the <em>Sunnan</em> (plural of <em>Sunnah</em>) cannot be opposed with opinion, nor is it repelled with <em>Qiyas</em> (analogy).  As for the interpretation of the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em> then that is how we interpret, and what they acted upon is which we act upon, what they left off is what we leave.  It is sufficient to adhere to what they adhered to, and that we follow them in that what they clarified.  We take them as an example in what they extracted and viewed from the hadeeth. We do not rebel against the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em> in what they differed or what they interpreted, and everything that we have just mentioned is the stance of the <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah</em> and the Imams of the people in <em>Fiqh</em> and hadeeth.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Sama’ani said in ‘Sown al-Mantiq’ (158):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed we have been ordered to follow and been encouraged to do so.  And we have been prohibited from innovating and we have been rebuked concerning <em>Bida’</em>. The flag/sign of the <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah</em> is their following the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em>, and them leaving everything that is innovated and heresy.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The supporter of the <em>Sunnah</em> al-Asbhaani said in his book ‘al-Hujjah Fee Bayaan al-Muhajjah’ (2/437-440):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Knowledge is not having lots of narrations; rather it is following and using those narrations. It is to take the Companions and the <em>Ta’abieen</em> (the Successors of the Companions) as exemplary, even if it means having a little knowledge.  Whoever opposes the Companions and the <em>Ta’abieen</em> then he is misguided, even if he has a lot of knowledge.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Asbhaani continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And that is to clarify for the people the matter of their <em>Deen</em>, so it is upon us to follow the Companions because indeed the <em>Deen</em> came from Allaah Ta’ala and it did not come from the intellects and opinions of men, but rather the Messenger  clarified the <em>Sunnah</em>for his <em>Ummah</em>. And he explained it to his Companions.  Therefore, whoever opposed the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah  in anything from the <em>Deen</em> then he has become misguided.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Rajab said in the book ‘Fadl Ilm as-Salaf ‘ala Ilm al-Khalaf’ (72):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The beneficial knowledge from these sciences, are all precisely connected to the texts with the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, the understanding of the meaning of these sciences and their restrictions are with what has been narrated from the Companions and the Successors and those who followed them, regarding the meanings of the Qur’aan and the hadeeth.  Likewise, what has been mentioned from them of what they said regarding issues of <em>Halaal</em> and <em>Haraam</em>, as well as <em>Zuhd</em>, softening of the heart and knowledge and other issues.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymeeyah said in ‘Kitab al-Eemaan’ (p.114):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘To understand this principle of <em>al-Eemaan</em> the Murjia’ turned away from the explanation of the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, and the statements of the Companions, and the Successors who followed them in goodness. The Murjia’ relied upon their own opinions and they interpreted this principle with their own understanding of Arabic language.  This is the way of the people of <em>Bida’</em>. This is why Imam Ahmad said: ‘The people mainly make mistakes regarding interpretation and analogy.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why we find the Mu’tazilah[1], Murjia’[2], Rafidah[3] and other than them from the <em>Ahl-ul-Bida’</em> explain the Qur’aan with their own intellect, as well as what they interpreted with Arabic language.  This is why you find them not relying upon the Ahadeeth of the Prophet , the Companions, and the <em>Ta’abieen</em> and the Imams of the Muslims.  So the <em>Ahl-ul-Bida’</em> do not rely upon the Sunnah, or upon the consensus of the <em>Salaf</em> or their <em>Aathaar</em>, rather they rely upon the intellect and language, and we find that they do not rely upon the books of <em>Tafseer</em> based upon narrations, and upon hadeeth and <em>Aathaar</em> of the <em>Salaf</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Ibn Taymeeyah also said in ‘Majmoo Fatawa’ (10/362):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘So knowledge which has been legislated and the rituals of worship which have been legislated are taken from the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah , as for what came from those after them, then it is not befitting that we take that as a foundation even though they are excused for their mistakes, rather they will be rewarded for their<em>Ijtihad</em> (exertion in deriving a ruling) or due to <em>Taqleed</em> (blind acceptance).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, whoever establishes speech regarding the science of <em>Usool</em> (principles) and its branches upon the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em> and the <em>Athaar</em> narrated from the previous generations then he has achieved the Prophetic way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, whoever establishes his purpose, worship, good deeds and an understanding connected to the principles of righteous actions and its branches of circumstances of the heart and physical actions upon <em>al-Eeman</em> and the <em>Sunnah</em> and the guidance, which Muhammad  and his Companions were upon, then he has achieved the Prophetic way. And this is the way of the Imams of guidance; you find that Imam Ahmad would say when the principles of the Sunnah were mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The principles of the Sunnah are adhering to what the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah  were upon and the books of <em>Tafseer</em> which have narrations from the Prophet  and the Companions and the successors. This is what is relied upon in its knowledge based principles and its branches………………..’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, regarding <em>Zuhd</em>, <em>Raqaaiq</em> (softening of the heart) and matters of the heart since its knowledge is relied upon the book of <em>Zuhd</em> which has narrations about the Prophets <em>-salawaatAllaah alaihim-</em> from Adam to Muhammad, then upon the way of the Companions and successors and those after them were not mentioned.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">[Taken from ‘Tawdeeh Usool al-Fiqh ‘ala Manhaj Ahl-ul-Hadeeth’ p.41]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">Taken from Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">By <em>Shaykh Muhadith Nasir as-Sunnah </em>Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2823 – From AbdurRahmaan bin Jubair bin Nafeer, from his father who said: we were sitting with al-Miqdad bin al-Aswad one day, when a person passed by him and said: ‘<em>Toobah</em> (a tree in Paradise) for these two eyes which saw the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>: ‘I swear by Allaah that we wish we had seen what you have seen and witnessed what you witnessed.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Miqdad became angry, I became astonished, because they did not say anything but good. Then he turned to the man and said: ‘What makes a person wish that he was present when Allaah has made him absent.  He does not know, if he had witnessed it, how he would have been at that time? I swear by Allaah there were a people that were present at the time of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, who Allaah will throw on their nostrils in the Hell-Fire, because they did not respond to the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> nor did they believe in him. Do you not praise Allaah, for taking you out from your mothers’ wombs not knowing anything except your Lord and believing in that which your Prophet was sent with. Indeed you have been saved from trials by others being trialed instead of you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I swear by Allaah, that Allaah sent the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> in the severest time that any Prophet from among the Prophets was ever sent, in any period of time including the <em>Jahileeyah</em> time period (period of ignorance before Islaam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They would not regard any religion better than the worship of idols, then the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> came with the <em>Furqan</em> (the Criterion) he separated the truth from falsehood with this Criterion, and he separated a father from his son, so much so that a man would see his father and his son or his brother as a disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed Allaah opened the lock of his heart with <em>Eemaan</em>, and he knows if he is destroyed he enters the fire, it does not make him happy that his beloved is in the fire. And it is about those that Allaah –Azza wa Jal – said: &lt;&lt;And those who say: ‘Our Lord! Bestow on us from our wives and our offspring the comfort of eyes&gt;&gt;’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Ahmad and Al-Albaani declared the <em>Isnaad</em> to be Saheeh</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Albaani commented saying:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘(Notice): This separating mentioned in this hadeeth has a foundation in ‘Saheeh al-Bukhari’ from the hadeeth of Jaabir bin Abdullaah who said: ‘The angels came to the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> while he was sleeping, some of them said: Indeed he is asleep and some of them said: ‘Indeed the eyes are asleep but the heart is awake…’ to the end of the hadeeth, and in this hadeeth it mentions: ‘So whoever obeys Muhammad <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> then he has obeyed Allaah, and whoever disobeys Muhammad then he disobeys Allaah, and Muhammad separated/divided the people.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Albaani) say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This hadeeth is a clear proof that shows that separating/division is not blameworthy in itself. So, some of the people push the people away from the <em>Dawa’</em> to the Book and the Sunnah, and they regard warning against that which opposes the Book and the Sunnah as being from the innovated matters, or they claim that the time to call to the Book and the Sunnah has not arrived! Their claim is that the Book and the Sunnah pushes people away and divides them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is great ignorance with regard to the truthful <em>Dawa’</em> and what is associated to this<em>Dawa’</em> from differences of opinions and hostility towards this <em>Dawa’</em>, as is witnessed in every time and place.  This is the Sunnah (the way) Allaah has ordained for His creation, and you will never find a change or turning off in the Sunnah (the way) of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And if your Lord had so willed, He could surely have made mankind one <em>Ummah</em>, but they will not cease to disagree,- Except him on whom your Lord has bestowed His Mercy &gt;&gt;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">By The Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ Muhammad Nasiruddeen al-Albaani </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following is a summary of what the Shaykh al-Albaani (d. 1420 A.H.) said in the introduction to a book entitled ‘<em>Bidaytus – Sooli Fee Tafdeel Rasool </em><em>-salAllaahu ‘alaihi wassalam</em><em> as-Sharraffa w­­a Karrama</em>’:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed I firmly believe that it is upon every Muslim who is sincere in his Islaam, to familiarize himself abundantly with a good amount of manners, which Allaah has honoured His Prophet with, in addition to the virtues that Allaah placed upon the Prophet in order for him to excel above all the worlds, from the Jinn and all of mankind altogether, rather even above those Angels who are close to Allaah Ta’ala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This familiarization can be attained through the established evidences from the Book and the Sunnah, researching them and having the correct understanding of them, because indeed that is what will, – without any doubt – increase the Muslim in <em>Eemaan</em>, and sincere love for the Prophet  <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Love for the Prophet  <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> which is a primary principle that becomes firm in the heart of the believer is also connected to the love of Allaah<em>Ta’ala</em>, Who out of His Excellence sent us His Messenger, and blessed us – and Allaah Posses all blessings – with the Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>Tabarak</em> <em>wa</em> <em>Ta’ala</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; He it is Who sent among the unlettered ones a Messenger from among themselves, reciting to them His Verses, purifying them, and teaching them the Book and <em>Al-Hikmah</em> (<em>As-Sunnah</em>). And verily, they had been before in manifest error &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is why the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There are three characteristics, whoever has them finds the sweetness of <em>Eemaan</em>: that Allaah and His Messenger are more beloved to him than other than them; that when he loves a person he loves him only for Allaah’s sake and that he hates to return to disbelief after Allaah has saved him from it just as he hates to be thrown into the Hell-Fire.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this love continues to rise in his heart until the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, becomes more beloved to him, more beloved than every respected person he knows.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘None of you truly believes until I am more beloved to him than his son, his father and all mankind.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know O brother Muslim, that it is not possible for anyone to rise to this level of love for Allaah and His Messenger except with the <em>Tawheed</em> of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> in His worship Alone [rather than to any other than Him].  And singling out the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, by following him from amongst Allaah’s slaves, due to the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; He who obeys the Messenger, has indeed obeyed Allaah &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Say: ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me, Allaah will love you&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘No, by Him in Whose Hand is my soul, even if Moosa was alive today he would have no recourse except to follow me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Albaani) say:  so if it is not granted even for the likes of Moosa whom Allaah spoke to, to follow other than the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, then would it be granted for anyone other than Moosa?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is from the unequivocal/absolute proofs of the obligation of singularly following the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.  It is from the necessities of the testimony of ‘Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah.’ And this is why Allaah <em>Tabarak wa Ta’ala</em>stated it in the preceding Ayah, that following the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>alone is a proof of Allaah loving a person. And there is no doubt that whoever is loved by Allaah, then Allaah will be with him in all that he does, as is mentioned in the authentic <em>hadeeth</em> <em>al</em>&#8211;<em>Qudsi</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And My slave does not come closer to Me except with that which is more beloved to Me than what I have made obligatory upon him, My slave continues to come closer to Me with the optional deeds until I love him, if I love him I will be his hearing with which he hears, and the sight with which he sees, and his hand with which he grips and the leg with which he walks, and if he asks Me I will definitely give it, and if he seeks refuge then I will definitely give him sanctuary . . ..  ’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this is the divine concern that Allaah has for his beloved slave, then it is obligatory upon every Muslim to take those means which make him more beloved to Allaah. And this is done by no other way than singularly following the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>&#8211; as opposed to anyone else. Only by doing this alone will one be granted the special concern from ones Master [Allaah] <em>– Tabaarak wa Ta’ala –</em>do you not see that there is no path to knowing that which is obligatory and distinguishing that from optional worship except by following the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>alone?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt, that when a Muslim becomes more knowledgeable about the biography of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, and knows more of his beautiful qualities and his excellence, then his love for the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>&#8211; would be more, and thus his following of him <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>would be more extensive and more comprehensive.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What drove me to research and distribute this blessed booklet was for me to help my Muslim brothers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In reality my only goal in this life, after fulfilling the obligatory rights that Allaah has upon me, is to familiarize the Muslims through educating, lecturing and writing about the authentic <em>Seerah</em> of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, from all its different angles according to my capability. And to encourage them to take the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>as the only example to be followed, just as Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>encouraged them in doing so, in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a good example to follow for him who hopes in (the Meeting with) Allaah and the Last Day and remembers Allaah much. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and therein lies their happiness in the <em>Dunyaa</em> and the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The last piece of work that I worked on was about a year ago (1401 A.H.) when I summarized the book ‘<em>Shammail al-Muhammadeeyah</em>’ by <em>Imam</em> Tirmidhi.  I distinguished between the hadeeth being <em>Saheeh</em> and <em>Da’eef</em> by commenting upon them, this was while I was staying in my new place of migration ‘Amman’ [capital of Jordan], during a time of afflictions that interrupted me, simultaneously I was preoccupied with buying land and building my home.  After staying there for a few months, an event caused disruption resulting in my leaving my home and my family and travelling to the first place I migrated to: ‘Damascus’ where I went back and stayed for two days, and then from there to Lebanon in spite of a lot of turmoil and chaos making it a difficult place to reach.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed I then preceded to complete this book [<em>‘Bidaytus &#8211; Sooli Fee Tafdeel Rasool</em> <em>-salAllaahu ‘alaihi wassalam</em> <em>as-Sharraffa wa Karrama’</em>] despite great problems during this work, and with very upsetting news which caused me much pain, namely the death of my elder brother Muhammad Naajee Abu Ahmad during the season of Hajj, I continued completing this book whilst seeking mercy for my brother, being patient upon this affliction, due to his death. He was the best of my brothers and was the most sincere towards me, and the strongest from amongst them in response to my <em>Dawa</em>’ and he held a great concern for it. He was enthusiastic in calling to the <em>Dawa</em>’ may Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> bestow his abundant mercy upon him.  We were patient, my brothers and his children and his grandchildren and his in-laws with this affliction. May Allaah grant them someone good as he was a good predecessor for them, may Allaah gather us all with him under the banner of the master/leader of the son of Adam, Muhammad <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>&lt;&lt;The Day when there will not benefit [anyone] wealth or children But only one who comes to Allah with a sound heart.&gt;&gt; [26:88-89] and indeed we belong to Allaah and indeed to him is our return.  O Allaah reward me for my affliction and compensate it for me with better than that. O Allaah forgive Abu Ahmad and raise his rank amongst those who were guided to Islaam to the best of creation (the Prophet), and place someone to look after those still alive after him, and forgive us and him O Lord of all the worlds, and make his grave spacious for him, and make light in there for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed I have digressed a lot from what we were dealing with. Everything that happens to humans is protection under the Will of Allaah and His Compassion, so we return to what we were discussing, so I say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you can comprehend that which has preceded in that <strong>Allaah’s Love cannot be attained except by following His Prophet, you should therefore be concerned with following his Sunnah</strong>, and one should spend in that cause, strive with oneself completely. He should not be deceived by that which some of the deceived, misguided people are upon, from amongst the <em>Soofeeyah</em> and frivolous people, those who have taken their religion to be play and amusement, with <em>an</em>&#8211;<em>Nasheed</em> (songs) and tunes. <strong>By which they claim that they please Muhammad </strong><strong><em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em></strong>with that which they call ‘religious <em>an</em>&#8211;<em>Nasheed</em>’ and they play them constantly for their<em>Dhikr</em> (meetings for remembrance of Allaah) and in their gatherings, which they organize on innovated Eids like the <em>Eid</em> of <em>Mawlid</em> (celebrating the Prophet’s birth) etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed they are –and I swear by Allaah– clearly misguided, and are deviated from the truth.  How can they not be in clear misguidance since they have mixed up the <em>Deen</em>with false amusements, and they have blindly copied shameless singers, with their rhythmical musical tunes, <strong>and they adhere to this in their <em>Soofi</em> paths which kill the hearts</strong>, and divert them from the remembrance of Allaah and the recitation of the Qur’aan.  The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘He is not from us who does not recite the Qur’aan in a beautiful way.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is especially because they add singing to musical instruments and clapping thus completing the resemblance between the two different groups. That is then broadcasted by some foreign radio stations, not only the Arab radio stations. Trying to please the people in the name of <em>Dhikr</em> (remembrance of Allaah) or religious <em>an</em>&#8211;<em>Nasheed</em>!  And regretfully some of the religious radio stations have began to follow their footsteps for which Allaah’s aid is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has even reached me that some of the visual broadcasters (Television) have presented some of these <em>Dhikr</em> (remembrances of Allaah) or religious <em>an</em>&#8211;<em>Nasheed</em>, as if it is from Islaam, and that it is from the characteristics of sincerity in which Muslims call to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I will never forget, once a long time ago I visited a centre from some of the Islaamic organizations, and I was shocked to hear the sound of the <em>Adhaan</em> chanted with musical instruments!  So I questioned them regarding it?  It was said:  ‘It is some Muslim youth from some Arab countries who have come as guests to this organization, and one of them lets them hear the <em>Adhaan</em> with a musical chant,’ and now this is what we hear from many of the Islaamic radio stations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was finally brought to the attention of some Muslim youth, concerning that which those <em>an-Nasheed</em> contain of evil and deviancy opposing the Islaamic <em>Sharia’</em>, so they modified it to a different type of <em>an</em>&#8211;<em>Nasheed</em> which talked about enthusiasm, strength and reminders of Islaamic heroism, and they would also adhere to some musical chanting and some of them have even added some musical instruments like the <em>Duff</em>(Arabic drum) etc. to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, I heard it, with my own ears in some music stores, something of the like, so I spoke with them, due to that which is obligatory in the <em>Deen</em> by way of advising them and reminding them that it is not allowed, especially since many of them have begun listening to <em>an</em>&#8211;<em>Nasheed</em> as a habit, and it has busied them from reciting Qur’aan or listening to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this is from the evil of the deviancy of keeping away from the <em>Salaf</em>, indeed I am certain that this was not from their practice, even though they used to sometimes recite poetry in wars and battles. This practice is one thing and taking that and applying to it a musical chant and making it a habit and resembling the practice of the people of evil and mere amusements, then that is something else, and it is not hidden from the people of knowledge and insight.  May Allaah have mercy upon the one who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Every good is in the following of the <em>Salaf</em> * and every evil is in the innovations of the <em>Khalaf</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In summary: Indeed I advise everyone who reads this book, that they do not suffice with the knowledge in it but follow that up with hopeful consequences which is to sincerely follow this great Messenger, which necessitates the love of Allaah, and His Forgiveness for ones sin, &lt;&lt;and this is the great success&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘We ask Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> that He makes us from them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: A summary from the introduction to ‘Bidaytus &#8211; Sooli Fee Tafdeel Rasool &#8211;<em>salAllaahu ‘alaihi wassalam</em> as-Sharraffa wa Karrama’ p.4 -12]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">By Dr. Muhammad Deeya ar-Rahman al-Azamee</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">Translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After knowing the authenticity of a hadeeth or its weakness, then it becomes obligatory to busy yourself with its understanding since that is the fruit of this knowledge.  Indeed a foundation without a building upon it is like a house which is demolished as Khateeb said in the introduction to his book ‘Muaalim’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haakim said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for the <em>Fuqaha</em> (scholars of Sharia’) of Islaam, the people of<em>Qiyaas</em> (analogy), opinions, derivation, debate and reflection are well-known in every age and are people of every country.  However we will mention here, in this place by Allaah’s permission, the <em>Fiqh</em> of hadeeth according to its people as evidence so that the people who work in and study this science thoroughly (<em>Muhadditheen</em>) are not ignorant of the <em>Fiqh</em> of hadeeth as it is a portion from the categoriesof this knowledge.’[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he lists the names of these <em>Muhadditheen</em> <em>al-Fuqaha</em> with a brief mention of their <em>Fiqh</em>, so from them are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad bin Sheehab az-Zuhri, Yahya bin Sa’eed al-Ansaari, AbdurRahman bin ‘Amr al-Awzaee, Sufyaan bin Uyaina al-Hilaalee, Abdullaah bin al-Mubarak, Yahya bin Sa’eed al-Qataan, AbdurRahman bin Mahdi, Yahya bin Yahya at-Tameemee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding Ahmad bin Hanbal, ash-Shafi’ee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I left Baghdad and I never left behind anyone who had more understanding of the <em>Deen</em>, was more abstinent from the <em>Duniya</em>, more pious or more knowledgeable than Ahmad bin Hanbal.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The list continues with:) ‘Alee bin Abdullaah bin Jafar al-Madeeni, Yahya bin Ma’een, Ishaaq bin Ibraheem al-Hanthaali, Muhammad bin Yahya ath-Thuaali, Muhammad bin Isma’eel al-Bukhari, Abu Zur’ah Ubaydillaah bin AbdulKareem, Abu Hatim Muhammad bin Idrees al-Hanthaali, Ibraheem ibn Ishaaq al-Hanthaali, Muslim bin al-Hajjaj al-Qushaayri, Abu Abdullaah Muhammad bin Ibraheem al-Abdi, ‘Uthmaan bin Sa’eed al-Darmi, Abu Abdullaah bin Muhammad bin Nasr al-Marwazi, Abu AbduRahman bin Shu’aib an-Nisaaee, Abu Bakr Muhammad bin Ishaaq bin Khuzaymah, Abu Daawood, Muhammad bin AbdulWahhab al-Abdi, Abu Bakr aj-Jaarudi, Ibraheem bin Abee Taalib, Abu ‘Isa at-Tirmidhi, Musa bin Haroon al-Bazaar, al-Hasan bin ‘Alee al-Ma’mari, ‘Alee bin al-Hussain bin al-Junaid, Muhammad bin Muslim bin Warah, Muhammad bin ‘Aqeel al-Balkhi and other than them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the <em>Fuqaha</em> of Ahl-ul-Hadeeth is Abu Bakr an-Neesaabooree of whom Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah – may Allaah have mercy on him –said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abu Bakr an-Neesaabooree was an <em>Imaam</em> in <em>Fiqh</em> and hadeeth, he was concerned with the Ahadeeth of <em>Fiqh</em> and with the variantwordings of the Ahadeeth.  He was close to the way and knowledgeof <em>Ahl-ul-Hadeeth </em>such that he was not biased towards the sayings of any of the <em>Fuqaha</em>, just as the famous Imaams of Hadeeth were not.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for Bukhari and Abu Daawood, then they are two Imaams in<em>Fiqh</em> from the people of <em>Ijtihaad</em>.  As for Muslim, Tirmidhee, Nisaaee, Ibn Maja, Abu Ya’ala, al-Bazaar and those similar to them then they were upon the <em>madh-hab </em>of <em>Ahl-ul-Hadeeth</em>.  They were not blind-followers of any single individual from amongst the scholars, nor were they absolutely from the Imaams of <em>Ijtihaad</em>, but rather they were not inclined to take the sayings of the Imaams of hadeeth such as Shafi’ee, Ahmad, Ishaaq, Abu Ubayd and their likes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for al-Bayhaqi then he was on the <em>Madh-hab </em>of ash-Shafi’ee, supporting it with its general statements.  Daraqutnee also inclined towards the <em>Madh-hab </em>of Shafi’ee and the Imaams of the chains of narrations (<em>asaaneed</em>) and hadeeth, but he was not like al-Bayhaqi in blindly following Shafi’ee.  So, even though al-Bayhaqi carried out<em>Ijtihaad</em> in many issues, the <em>Ijtihaad</em> of Daraqutnee was stronger than his as he was more knowledgeable and had a stronger comprehension than him (i.e. al-Bayhaqi).’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘From them there were those who specialised with some of the scholars just as Abu Daawood specialised with Ahmad bin Hanbal so they are more inclined to the <em>Madh-hab</em> of <em>Ahl-ul-Hijaaz</em> – such as Maalik and his likes– than the <em>Madh-hab</em> of <em>Ahl-ul-Iraq</em>  &#8211; the likes of Abu Hanifah and Thawree.’  The end of Shaykh ul-Islaam’s saying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Knowledge of the <em>Fiqh</em> of hadeeth cannot be achieved except if the different paths of the hadeeth are gathered just as Imaam Ahmad said: ‘If the different paths (narrations) are not gathered, the hadeeth cannot be understood.  The hadeeth are explained, some by others.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahya bin Ma’een said: ‘If a hadeeth was not written with 30 different chains, we would not have understood it.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Shafi’ee authored a booklet in ‘Ihktilaaf of hadeeth’, then Ibn Qutaybah followed him in that as did Abu Yahya Zakareeyah bin Yahya as-Saajee, Tahawee, Tabaree, Ibn Abdul Barr and Ibn al-Jawzi.  All of this shows the importance of <em>Fiqh ul-Hadeeth</em> to the<em>Muhaddithee</em>n, researchers and those who extrapolate rulings.  This is what al-Khateeb indicated in his book ‘al-Kafaya’:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If it were not for the concern of <em>As-haabul-Hadeeth</em> (the companions of hadeeth) with the precision of the <em>Sunnan</em>, gathering them, extracting them from their sources and researching the different paths, the <em>Sharia’</em> would have become void and its rulings would have been cancelled out because the rulings were extrapolated from preserved <em>Athaar</em> (narrations) and they took benefit from the transmitted <em>Sunnan</em>.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Al-Haafidh Ibn Rajab Al-Hanbalee<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This book is a translation of a short treatise entitled “<i>Kashf-ul-Kurbah fee wasfi Haali Ahlil-Ghurbah</i>”<b>[Alleviating Grievances in Describing the Condition of the Strangers]</b> written by the great Imaam, Al-Haafidh Zayn-ud-Deen Ibn Rajab Al-Hanbalee, may Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this treatise, Ibn Rajab discusses the topic of the “Strangers”, listing the many <i>ahaadeeth</i> of the Prophet reported about them. They are given this name because they will be strange during the Last Days, due to their adherence to the Sunnah and to the Way of the first Muslims, the Salaf As-Saalih. So just as those who first accepted Islaam at the hands of Muhammad were considered strangers to their families and close ones, then indeed, those who adhere to the Sunnah in the last Days, when innovations and misguidance are rampant and widespread, will also be considered strangers to their families and close ones, not to mention the disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It must be noted that Ibn Rajab uses several weak ahaadeeth in this treatise, which have been pointed out. Also, towards the end of his treatise, he begins to divert from the topic by going deep into the issue of inner strangeness, sometimes focusing on aspects that have no basis in Islaam, such as talk about <i>wajd</i>, <i>khulwah</i> and so on. These were Sufi concepts that were prevalent during his time. Consequently, the last pages of the treatise, which included several quotes and lines of poetry, were left out from this translation. However, the omission of this last part of the book does not detract from the overall meaning and intended theme of the treatise, and Allaah knows best. For the most part, the treatise is of great importance and is often referenced by the scholars, and that is what we hope to convey to the readers. All footnotes were added by the translator based on research and the use of several sources. We ask Allaah to accept this work as a sincere act and that He place it in our scale of good deeds on the Day of Judgement. And we ask that He benefit all the Muslims generally with it</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b><br />
“So when the Prophet was sent forth and began calling to Islaam, his call was not answered at first instance except by a few from each tribe. And those that did accept his call feared from their tribes and families lest they should be subjected to extreme punishment. And they would suffer while being patient with that for the sake of Allaah. Due to their weakness, the (first) Muslims would be frightened by every opposing force and they would flee for the sake of their Religion to far-off lands as was shown when they migrated twice to the land of Abysinnia, and then when they migrated to Madeenah. And there was from among them, he who was tortured for the sake of Allaah and he who was killed. <b>So those who entered into the fold of Islaam, back in those days – they were the strangers. </b>Then Islaam spread after the Hijrah to Madeenah and its followers became victorious over every group. After that, the people entered into the Religion of Allaah in multitudes. And Allaah perfected the Religion for them and completed His favor upon them. Then the Messenger of Allaah died, and the Muslims were upon the utmost level due to their firm adherence to their Religion. They were powerful and dominant, and they continued to be upon this condition during the times (i.e. <i>khilaafah</i>) of Abu Bakr and ‘Umar. Then the Devil unleashed his evil plot upon the Muslims and discord fell between them. And the trials of <b>Doubts</b> (<i>Shubuhaat</i>) and <b>Desires</b>(<i>Shahawaat</i>) became widespread. These two evils did not stop increasing at all until the plan of the Devil was established and the majority of the creation obeyed him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Concerning the statement of the Prophet: <b>‘Islaam began as something strange and will return to being strange, as it began’</b>, Imaam Al-Awzaa’ee (rahimahullaah) said: ‘As for this, then it does not mean that Islaam will go away, rather it means that Ahlus-Sunnah will go away, up to the point that there will not remain any from them in a land except one person.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Based on this understanding, there can be found much praise in the statements of the Salaf for the Sunnah and their describing it as being strange, and describing its adherents and followers as being few. Al-Hasan Al-Basree (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) used to say to his companions: ‘Oh Ahlus-Sunnah! Be gentle with one another, and may Allaah have mercy on you, for indeed, you are from amongst the fewest of people.’ Yoonus bin ‘Ubayd (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said: ‘There is not a thing more strange than the Sunnah. But what is stranger than it, is the one who knows it.’ Sufyaan Ath-Thawree (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said: ‘Treat Ahlus-Sunnah kindly, for verily, they are strangers.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And from the words of Ahmad bin ‘Aasim Al-Andaakee, who was one of the biggest scholars at the time of Sulaymaan Ad-Daaraanee, was: ‘Indeed, I have reached from all the times, a time when Islaam has returned to being strange as it began. In it, the description of truth has returned to being strange as it began. If you were to turn to the scholar, you would find him being tested with the love of this worldly life and the love for honor and authority. And if you were to turn to the worshipper, you would find him ignorant in his worship, deceived and fallen victim to his enemy Iblees (i.e. the Devil). He has mounted to the highest levels of worship while being ignorant of how to perform them so how can he be at that level? And the rest of the people are from among the ignorant followers, simple-minded and quick to follow a way, as if he were a wolf looking to steal a sheep, or a hungry lion, or a fox on the prowl. This is the description of the people of your time from the carriers of knowledge and the Qur’aan and the callers of wisdom.’ This was the description of the people of his time. So how much has the situation increased and the crisis become greater after it. Indeed, it has reached a point that would have never been thought of nor imagined!”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Imaam Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a booklet titled <b>“<i>Manzilat-us-Sunnah fil-Islaam</i>”</b> (The Status of the Sunnah in Islaam) of Imaam Muhammad Naasir-u-Deen Al-Albaanee, may Allaah have mercy on him. The source for this booklet was a lecture he gave in Doha, Qatar during the month of Ramadaan, 1392H. The talk was later transcribed and published. This book can be downloaded in Arabic at sahab.org.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This treatise clarifies the position of the Sunnah in Islaam, in that it bears the same status as the Qur’aan when it comes to deriving religious rulings and laws. So one cannot possibly understand and implement the Qur’aan in the absence of the Sunnah, rather they go hand in hand. Imaam Al-Albaanee gives several examples for this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author then goes on to explain what is meant by Sunnah in his discussion, in that it refers to only the authentic Sunnah, and not the weak and fabricated hadeeth. This is a very important treatise, defining a key principle of the Salafi Manhaj, which consists of following the Qur’aan and the Sunnah, along with the understanding of the Salaf (i.e. Sahaabah, Taabi’een, Atbaa’ at-Taabi’een). This treatise is also a refutation of the deviant groups that rely on the Qur’aan alone, such as the Qur’aaniyoon, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It is unfortunate that there can be found some contemporary tafseer writers and authors that have taken the view of making permissible what has been mentioned in the last two examples, such as the permissibility of eating predatory animals and wearing gold and silk, relying upon the Qur’aan (as proof) only! In fact, there can be found in this present time a group that call themselves the Qur’aaniyoon, who interpret the Qur’aan according to their desires and intellects, without seeking assistance for that in the authentic Sunnah. Rather, the Sunnah, according to them, is subordinate to their desires. So whatever part of it conforms to their desires, they affirm it, and whatever doesn’t conform to their desires, they throw behind their backs (rejecting it).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“From what has been stated previously, it becomes clear that there is no way for anyone, even if he be a scholar of the Arabic Language and its disciplines, to understand the noble Qur’aan, without seeking assistance in that from the Prophet’s Sunnah in speech and action. This is since he will never be more knowledgeable of the language than the Companions of the Prophet, those who the Qur’aan was revealed to in their language. And (at that time) the language was not blemished with the errors of the non-Arabs and the slang of the common people, but in spite of that, they still erred in understanding these previously mentioned ayaat, when they relied on their knowledge of the language only.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“In summary: It is an obligation upon all of the Muslims to not differentiate between the Qur’aan and the Sunnah, with regard to the obligation of accepting both of them together and establishing Laws based on both of them. Indeed this is the guarantee that will prevent them from drifting to the right and the left, and from returning to deviation.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Fourth Aspect: Blind Following and its Dangers</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdil-Wahhaab said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[4]</b> Their religion was built upon certain principles, the greatest of which was taqleed (blind following). So this was the biggest principle for all of the disbelievers &#8211; the first and last of them &#8211; as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And similarly, We sent not a warner before you (Muhammad) to any town (people), except that the luxurious ones among them said: &#8216;Verily, we found our forefathers following a certain way and religion, and we will indeed follow in their footsteps.'&#8221;</b> [Surah Az-Zukhruf: 23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says: <b>&#8220;And when it is said to them: &#8216;Follow that which Allaah has sent down&#8217;, they say: &#8216;Nay, we shall follow that which we found our forefathers (following).&#8217; Would they do so even if the Devil invites them to the torment of the Fire?&#8221;</b> [Surah Luqmaan: 21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He revealed to them His saying: <b>&#8220;Say: &#8216;I exhort you to one thing only &#8211; that you stand up for Allaah&#8217;s sake in pairs and singly &#8211; and then reflect (upon the life of the Prophet). There is no madness in your companion (Muhammad).'&#8221;</b> [Surah As-Saba`: 46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying: <b>&#8220;(Say to the disbelievers): &#8216;Follow what has been sent down unto you from your Lord, and follow not any partners besides Him.&#8217; Little do you remember!&#8221;</b> [Surah Al-A`raaf: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8211; the explanation &#8211;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the characteristics of people of the Days of Ignorance is that they would not base their religion on what the Messengers came with. Rather, they would only base their religion on principles that they innovated from their own selves. And they would not accept any change or abandonment of these principles, of which one was: Taqleed (Blind Following). Taqleed means to imitate another person to the point that one resembles him, even though the one being imitated is not fit to be followed. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And likewise, We did not send before you a warner to any town except that the extravagant ones amongst them said: &#8216;Verily, we found our forefathers upon a certain way and we will follow in their footsteps.'&#8221;</b> [Surah Az-Zukhruf: 23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is meant by the &#8220;extravagant&#8221; are those who live in luxury and possess lots of wealth, since for the most part they are evil people who do not accept the truth. This is contrary to the weak and the poor, for indeed, for the most part, they are humble and more likely to accept the truth. So the people of extravagance are those who possess status and wealth. <b>&#8220;Except that the extravagant ones amongst them said&#8221;</b> &#8211; i.e. those amongst them who had affluence and position in the society &#8211;<b>&#8220;Verily, we found our forefathers upon a certain way&#8221; </b>&#8211; meaning: upon a religion and practice.<b>&#8220;And we will follow in their footsteps&#8221;</b> means: &#8220;We have no need for you Messengers.&#8221; They thought that this sufficed them over having to follow the Messengers. This is an example of Blind-Following, and it is from the characteristics of the Days of Ignorance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for performing taqleed in matters of good, this is called Ittibaa¡¦ (Following) and Iqtidaa (Taking example). Allaah said on behalf of Prophet Yoosuf:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And I follow the Religion of my forefathers &#8211; Ibraaheem, Ishaaq and Ya&#8217;qoob. It is not befitting for us to ascribe anything in worship with Allaah.&#8221;</b> [Surah Yoosuf: 38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And the first and the foremost from among the Muhaajireen and the Ansaar and those who followed them in goodness, Allaah is pleased with them and they with Him. And He ha sprepared for themgardens under which rivers flow to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme success.&#8221; </b>[Surah At-Tawbah: 100]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why Allaah said about the people of the Days of Ignorance:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And when it is said to them: &#8216;Follow what Allaah has revealed&#8217;, they respond: ¡¥Rather, we will follow what we found our forefathers upon!&#8217; Would they do that even though their forefathers did not understand anything and were not guided?&#8221;</b> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 170]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So one who doesn&#8217;t understand and is not guided cannot be taken as a role-model. Rather, the true role-model is only he who comprehends and is guided. Therefore, blind-following is from the characteristics of the people of the Days of Ignorance, and it is also known as fanatical attachment, since the only true role-model is the Messenger of Allaah and those who follow him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the author, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: &#8220;And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8216;And when it is said to them: &#8216;Follow that which Allaah has sent down&#8217;, they say: &#8216;Nay, we shall follow that which we found our forefathers (following).&#8217; Would they do so even if the Devil invites them to the torment of the Fire?&#8217; </b>[Surah Luqmaan: 21]&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When it is said to the polytheists and the disbelievers: <b>&#8216;Follow that which Allaah has sent down&#8217;</b> &#8211; i.e. the Qur&#8217;aan, they say: <b>&#8216;Nay, we shall follow that which we found our forefathers (following).&#8217; &#8220;Would they do so even if the Devil invites them&#8221;</b> &#8211; i.e. calls these forefathers <b>&#8220;to the torment of the Fire?&#8221;</b> Would you follow them into the torment of the Fire? This means: Would you follow your forefathers even if they were followers of the Devil and he led them to the Hellfire? Everyone with common sense and intellect must investigate into his affair and look to whom he is following. The author, may Allaah have mercy on him, continued: &#8220;So He revealed to them His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8216;Say: &#8216;I exhort you to one thing only &#8211; that you stand up for Allaah&#8217;s sake in pairs and singly &#8211; and then reflect (upon the life of the Prophet). There is no madness in your companion (i.e. Muhammad).&#8217;</b> [Surah As-Saba`: 46] And His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8216;(Say to the disbelievers): &#8216;Follow what has been sent down unto you from your Lord, and follow not any partners besides Him.&#8217; Little do you remember!&#8217;</b> [Surah Al-A`raaf: 3]&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: When the Messenger of Allaah countered them with this ayah, they said: We will stick to what our forefathers practiced, and we will not obey this man, referring to Muhammad. But Allaah is telling them: &#8220;Look and reflect on what this man is saying to you. Think about it and do not let fanaticism overtake you.&#8221; <b>&#8220;That you stand up for Allaah&#8217;s sake in pairs and singly.&#8221;</b> &#8211; meaning: in groups and individually. You must look at what Muhammad is calling you to. If it is the truth, you are then obligated to follow it and it is not permissible for you to remain upon what your fathers and grandfathers were upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;That you stand up for Allaah&#8217;s sake&#8221;</b> and not for the sake of desires or fanaticism. Rather, your standing up should be for the sake of Allaah, desiring the truth. <b>&#8220;In pairs and singly&#8221;</b> meaning two by two. Reflect, come together and set up a gathering. This is since when there is cooperation between two people that sit together or a group of people, it is more likely that the truth will be achieved. Or this can be done individually, such as when someone isolates himself to reflect and contemplate on what the Messenger of Allaah came with. And he will find it to be the truth and thus it will be incumbent for him to follow it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Then reflect. There is no madness in your companion.&#8221; </b>This refers to Muhammad of whom they claimed was mad (i.e. insane). But he had no madness in him. Rather, he was the most intellectual of mankind and the most understanding amongst creation. And he was the most sincere and knowledgeable amongst creation. So how can you say that he was mad? Think about it. Look at his intellect. Look at his actions. Is it the actions of someone who is crazy?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;There is no madness in your companion. He is only a warner to you in the face of a severe torment.&#8221;</b> [Surah Saba: 46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you don&#8217;t believe in him and follow him, a severe torment will befall you. So he came to you in order to sincerely advise you. He wants good for you and he wants salvation for you. He desires rectification and success for you in this worldly life and the Hereafter. So how can you describe him with this characteristic, saying that he is mad without looking at, reflecting on and contemplating on what he came with? Likewise, it is obligatory upon everyone with intellect to investigate the statements of people, discerning and scrutinizing them, and distinguishing between the erroneous and the correct. So he should then accept the truth and reject the error. And blind-following should not cause him to remain upon falsehood.</p>

Observing the Sunnah and the manners of its obedience</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And whatsoever the Messenger   (Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) gives you, take it; and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it)&#8221;.</b></span><b> (59:7)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Nor does he speak of (his own) desire. It is only a Revelation that is revealed.&#8221;</b></span><b> (53:3,4)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Say (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) to mankind): `If you (really) love Allah then follow me (i.e., accept Islamic Monotheism, follow the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah), Allah will love you and forgive you of your sins&#8221;.</b></span><b> (3:31)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Indeed in the Messenger of Allah (Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allah and the Last Day&#8230;&#8221;</b></span><b> (33:21)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;But no, by your Rubb, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission&#8221;.</b></span><b> (4:65)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;(And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)&#8221;.</b></span><b> (4:59)</b></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>156.</b>  Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Do not ask me unnecessarily about the details of the things which I do not mention to you. Verily, the people before you were doomed because they were used to putting many questions to their Prophets and had differences about their Prophets. Refrain from what I forbid you and do what I command you to the best of your ability and capacity&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>157.</b> `Irbad bin Sariyah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: One day Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) delivered us a very eloquent Khutbah on account of which eyes shed tears and hearts were full of tears. A man said: &#8220;O Prophet of Allah, this is as if it were a parting advice. So advise us&#8221;. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;I admonish you to fear Allah, to listen and obey even if an Abyssinian slave is appointed as your leader. Because whosoever among you shall live after me, will see much discord. So hold fast to my Sunnah and the examples of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs who will come after me. Adhere to them and hold to it fast. Beware of new things (in Deen) because every Bid`ah is a misguidance&#8221;.</span><br />
[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>158.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Everyone of my Ummah will enter Jannah except those who refuse&#8221;.</span> He was asked: &#8220;Who will refuse?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Whoever obeys me, shall enter Jannah, and whosoever disobeys me, refuses to (enter Jannah)&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>159.</b>  Salamah bin Al-Akwa` (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: My father said that a person ate in the presence of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) with his left hand. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Eat with your right hand&#8221;.</span> He said, &#8220;I cannot do that.&#8221; Thereupon he (the Prophet) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;May you never do that.&#8221; It was pride that prevented him from doing it.</span> And he could not raise it (the right hand) up to his mouth afterwards.<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>160.</b>  Nu`man bin Bashir (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Straighten your rows (during Salat) or Allah would create dissension amongst you&#8221;</span>.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration reported by Muslim, Nu`man bin Bashir (May Allah be pleased with them) narrated: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to straighten our rows (in Salat), as if he was straightening an arrow with their help until he saw that we had learnt it from him. One day he came out, stood up (for Salat) and was about to say: Allahu Akbar (Allah is the Greatest), (marking the beginning of the prayer) when he saw  a man, whose chest was bulging out from the row. He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Slaves of Allah, you must straighten your rows or Allah would create dissension amongst you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>161.</b>  Abu Musa (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A house in Al-Madinah caught fire at night and the roof and walls fell down upon the occupants. When this was reported to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Fire is your enemy; so put it out before you go to bed&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>162.</b> Abu Musa (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The similitude of guidance and knowledge with which Allah has sent me is like a  rain which has fallen on some ground. A fertile part of earth has absorbed water and brought forth much grass and herbs. Another part, which is solid, held the water and Allah benefits men thereby, who  drank and gave others to drink, and used it for irrigation. But some of it has fallen on a portion of sandy land which neither retains the water nor produces herbage. Such is the likeness of the man who understands the religion of Allah and who gets benefit of what Allah has sent me with; he learns and teaches others. It is also the likeness of the man who neither raises his head on that account (meaning he does not benefit from what the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was sent with) nor accepts Allah&#8217;s Guidance with which I am sent&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>163.</b>  Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;My parable  and that of yours is like a man who kindled a fire. When it has illuminated all around him, the moths and grasshoppers began to fall therein. He tried to push them away, but they overcame him and jumped into it. I am catching hold of your waists ties (to save you) from fire, but you slip away from my hands&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>164.</b>  Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) commanded the licking of fingers (after eating) and the cleaning of the dish, saying:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;You do not know in what portion the Blessing (of Allah) lies&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration, Jabir said: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,  <span style="color:#0000ff;">&#8220;When a morsel of any of you falls down, you should pick it up and remove any dirt or dust on it and then eat it; and don&#8217;t leave it for Satan; and do not wipe your hand with the towel until you have licked your fingers, for you do not know in what portion of the food the Barakah* (of Allah) lies&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* Barakah is the abundance of goodness and its continuity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>165.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;On the Day of Resurrection you will be assembled barefooted, naked and uncircumcised&#8221;.</span> He then recited:<span style="color:#ff0000;"> &#8220;As We began the first creation, We shall repeat it. (It is) a promise binding upon Us. Truly, We shall do it,&#8221;</span> and continued:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The first to be clothed on the Day of Resurrection will be (Prophet) Ibrahim. Then some of my Companions will be taken to the left, (i.e., towards Hell-fire) and when I will say, &#8216;They belong to my Ummah, O my Rubb!&#8217;</span> It would be said: &#8216;You do not know what they invented after you had left them.&#8217; I shall then say as the righteous slave [i.e., `Isa (Jesus (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)] said:<span style="color:#ff0000;"> &#8216;And I was a witness over them while I was amongst them, when You took me up, You were the Watcher over them and You are a Witness to all things. If you punish them, they are Your slaves, and if You forgive them, verily, You, only You are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.&#8217;</span> I shall be told: &#8216;They continued to turn on their heels since you parted from them&#8221;.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>166.</b> `Abdullah bin Mughaffal (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) prohibited flicking pebbles by the index finger and the thumb; and he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;It does not kill a game animal nor does it inflict wound on the enemy, but breaks the tooth and gorges the eye&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">  In another narration it is said: A close relative of `Abdullah bin Mughaffal (May Allah be pleased with him) was hitting with pebbles using the index finger and the thumb; he said: &#8220;Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)<span style="color:#0000ff;"> has forbidden it saying that it does not kill the game&#8221;</span>. He repeated the act and Ibn Mughaffal said to him: &#8220;I told you that the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) had prohibited it but you repeated it. I shall never talk to you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>167.</b>  `Abis bin Rabi<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">`</span>ah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I saw `Umar bin Al-Khattab(May Allah be pleased with him) kissing the Black Stone (Al-Hajar Al-Aswad) and saying:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;I know that you are just a stone and that you can neither do any harm nor give benefit. Had I not seen Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) kissing you, I would not have kissed you&#8221;.</span><br />

<h3 align="center">Holding Fast to the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.092.373"></a>Volume 9, Book 92, Number 373:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Tariq bin Shihab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Jew said to &#8216;Umar, &#8220;O Chief of the Believers, if this verse: &#8216;This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favors upon you, and have chosen for you, Islam as your religion.&#8217; (5.3) had been revealed upon us, we would have taken that day as an &#8216;Id (festival) day.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I know definitely on what day this Verse was revealed; it was revealed on the day of &#8216;Arafat, on a Friday.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 374:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That he heard &#8216;Umar speaking while standing on the pulpit of the Prophet in the morning (following the death of the Prophet), when the people had sworn allegiance to Abu Bakr. He said the Tashah-hud before Abu Bakr, and said, &#8220;Amma Ba&#8217;du (then after) Allah has chosen for his Apostle what is with Him (Paradise) rather than what is with you (the world). This is that Book (Quran) with which Allah guided your Apostle, so stick to it, for then you will be guided on the right path as Allah guided His Apostle with it.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 375:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet embraced me and said, &#8220;O Allah! Teach him (the knowledge of) the Book (Quran).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 376:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abal Minhal:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Barza said, &#8220;(O people!) Allah makes you self-sufficient or has raised you high with Islam and with Muhammad</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 377:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah bin Dinar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah Bin &#8216;Umar wrote to &#8216;Abdul Malik bin Marwan, swearing allegiance to him: &#8216;I swear allegiance to you in that I will listen and obey what is in accordance with the Laws of Allah and the Tradition of His Apostle as much as I can.&#8217;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 378:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said bin Al-Musaiyab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Huraira said that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;I have been sent with &#8216;Jawami-al-Kalim &#8216; (the shortest expression with the widest meaning) and have been made victorious with awe (cast in my enemy&#8217;s hearts), and while I was sleeping, I saw that the keys of the treasures of the world were placed in my hand.&#8221; Abu Huraira added: Allah&#8217;s Apostle has gone, and you people are utilizing those treasures, or digging those treasures out.&#8221; or said a similar sentence.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 379:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;There was no prophet among the prophets but was given miracles because of which people had security or had belief, but what I was given was the Divine Inspiration which Allah revealed to me. So I hope that my followers will be more than those of any other prophet on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 380:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Wail:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I sat with Shaiba in this Mosque (Al-Masjid-Al-Haram), and he said, &#8220;&#8216;Umar once sat beside me here as you are now sitting, and said, &#8216;I feel like distributing all the gold and silver that are in it (i.e., the Ka&#8217;ba) among the Muslims&#8217;. I said, &#8216;You cannot do that.&#8217; &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;Why?&#8217; I said, &#8216;Your two (previous) companions (the Prophet and Abu Bakr) did not do it. &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;They are the two persons whom one must follow.'&#8221; (See Hadith No. 664, Vol. 2)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 381:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hudhaifa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to us, &#8220;Honesty descended from the Heavens and settled in the roots of the hearts of men (faithful believers), and then the Quran was revealed and the people read the Quran, (and learnt it from it) and also learnt it from the Sunna.&#8221; Both Quran and Sunna strengthened their (the faithful believers&#8217;) honesty. (See Hadith No. 208)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 382:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The best talk (speech) is Allah&#8217;s Book &#8216;Quran), and the best way is the way of Muhammad, and the worst matters are the heresies (those new things which are introduced into the religion); and whatever you have been promised will surely come to pass, and you cannot escape (it).</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 383:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira and Zaid bin Khalid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were with the Prophet when he said (to two men), &#8220;I shall judge between you according to Allah&#8217;s Book (Laws).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 384:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;All my followers will enter Paradise except those who refuse.&#8221; They said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Who will refuse?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Whoever obeys me will enter Paradise, and whoever disobeys me is the one who refuses (to enter it).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 385:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some angels came to the Prophet while he was sleeping. Some of them said, &#8220;He is sleeping.&#8221; Others said, &#8220;His eyes are sleeping but his heart is awake.&#8221; Then they said, &#8220;There is an example for this companion of yours.&#8221; One of them said, &#8220;Then set forth an example for him.&#8221; Some of them said, &#8220;He is sleeping.&#8221; The others said, &#8220;His eyes are sleeping but his heart is awake.&#8221; Then they said, &#8220;His example is that of a man who has built a house and then offered therein a banquet and sent an inviter (messenger) to invite the people. So whoever accepted the invitation of the inviter, entered the house and ate of the banquet, and whoever did not accept the invitation of the inviter, did not enter the house, nor did he eat of the banquet.&#8221; Then the angels said, &#8220;Interpret this example to him so that he may understand it.&#8221; Some of them said, &#8220;He is sleeping.&#8221; The others said, &#8220;His eyes are sleeping but his heart is awake.&#8221; And then they said, &#8220;The houses stands for Paradise and the call maker is Muhammad; and whoever obeys Muhammad, obeys Allah; and whoever disobeys Muhammad, disobeys Allah. Muhammad separated the people (i.e., through his message, the good is distinguished from the bad, and the believers from the disbelievers).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 386:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hammam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hudhaifa said, &#8220;O the Group of Al-Qurra! Follow the straight path, for then you have taken a great lead (and will be the leaders), but if you divert right or left, then you will go astray far away.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 387:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;My example and the example of what I have been sent with is that of a man who came to some people and said, &#8216;O people! I have seen the enemy&#8217;s army with my own eyes, and I am the naked warner; so protect yourselves!&#8217; Then a group of his people obeyed him and fled at night proceeding stealthily till they were safe, while another group of them disbelieved him and stayed at their places till morning when the army came upon them, and killed and ruined them completely So this is the example of that person who obeys me and follows what I have brought (the Quran and the Sunna), and the example of the one who disobeys me and disbelieves the truth I have brought.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 388:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah&#8217;s Apostle died and Abu Bakr was elected as a Caliph after him, some of the Arabs reverted to disbelief, &#8216;Umar said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;How dare you fight the people while Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, I have been ordered to fight the people till they say &#8216;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah&#8217; And whoever says: None has the right to be worshipped but Allah.&#8217; waves his wealth and his life from me unless he deserves a legal punishment lusty, and his account will be with Allah! Abu Bakr said, &#8220;By Allah, I will fight him who discriminates between Zakat and prayers, for Zakat is the Compulsory right to be taken from the wealth By Allah, if they refuse to give me even a tying rope which they use to give to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, I would fight them for withholding it.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;By Allah, It was nothing, except I saw that Allah had opened the chest of Abu Bakr to the fight, and I came to know for certain that was the truth.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 389:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Uyaina bin Hisn bin Hudhaifa bin Badr came and stayed (at Medina) with his nephew Al-Hurr bin Qais bin Hisn who has one of those whom &#8216;Umar used to keep near him, as the Qurra&#8217; (learned men knowing Quran by heart) were the people of Umar&#8217;s meetings and his advisors whether they were old or young. &#8216;Uyaina said to his nephew, &#8220;O my nephew! Have you an approach to this chief so as to get for me the permission to see him?&#8221; His nephew said, &#8220;I will get the permission for you to see him.&#8221; (Ibn &#8216;Abbas added: ) So he took the permission for &#8216;Uyaina, and when the latter entered, he said, &#8220;O the son of Al-Khattab! By Allah, you neither give us sufficient provision nor judge among us with justice.&#8221; On that &#8216;Umar became so furious that he intended to harm him. Al-Hurr, said, &#8220;O Chief of the Believers!&#8221; Allah said to His Apostle &#8216;Hold to forgiveness, command what is good (right), and leave the foolish (i.e. do not punish them).&#8217; (7.199) and this person is among the foolish.&#8221; By Allah, &#8216;Umar did not overlook that Verse when Al-Hurr recited it before him, and &#8216;Umar said to observe (the orders of) Allah&#8217;s Book strictly.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 166, Vol. 6)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 390:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Asma&#8217; bint Abu Bakr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I came to &#8216;Aisha during the solar eclipse. The people were standing (offering prayer) and she too, was standing and offering prayer. I asked, &#8220;What is wrong with the people?&#8221; She pointed towards the sky with her hand and said, Subhan Allah!&#8221; I asked her, &#8220;Is there a sign?&#8221; She nodded with her head meaning, yes. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle finished (the prayer), he glorified and praised Allah and said, &#8220;There is not anything that I have not seen before but I have seen now at this place of mine, even Paradise and Hell. It has been revealed to me that you people will be put to trial nearly like the trial of Ad-Dajjal, in your graves. As for the true believer or a Muslim (the sub-narrator is not sure as to which of the two (words Asma&#8217; had said) he will say, &#8216;Muhammad came with clear signs from Allah, and we responded to him (accepted his teachings) and believed (what he said)&#8217; It will be said (to him) &#8216;Sleep in peace; we have known that you were a true believer who believed with certainty.&#8217; As for a hypocrite or a doubtful person, (the sub-narrator is not sure as to which word Asma&#8217; said) he will say, &#8216;I do not know, but I heard the people saying something and so I said the same.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

The Prophet then said, &#8220;You continued doing what I saw you doing till I was afraid that this (Tarawih prayer) might be enjoined on you, and if it were enjoined on you, you would not continue performing it. Therefore, O people! Perform your prayers at your homes, for the best prayer of a person is what is performed at his home except the compulsory congregational) prayer.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 229,Vol. 3) (See Hadith No. 134, Vol. 8)</p>

Inform us bout the spirit.&#8221; The Prophet stood up for a while, waiting. I realized that he was being Divinely Inspired, so I kept away from him till the inspiration was over. Then the Prophet said, &#8220;(O Muhammad) they ask you regarding the spirit, Say: The spirit its knowledge is with my Lord (i.e., nobody has its knowledge except Allah)&#8221; (17.85) (This is a miracle of the Qur&#8217;an that all the scientists up till now do not know about the spirit, i.e, how life comes to a body and how it goes away at its death) (See Hadith No. 245, Vol. 6)</p>

Abu Bakr said to &#8216;Umar, &#8220;You intended only to oppose me.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I did not intend to oppose you!&#8221; Then their voices grew louder in front of the Prophet whereupon there was revealed: &#8216;O you who believe! Do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet..a great reward.&#8217; (49.2-3) Ibn Az-Zubair said, &#8216;Thence forward when &#8216;Umar talked to the Prophet, he would talk like one who whispered a secret and would even fail to make the Prophet hear him, in which case the Prophet would ask him (to repeat his words).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Uwaimir Al-&#8216;Ajlani came to &#8216;Asim bin &#8216;Adi and said, &#8220;If a man found another man with his wife and killed him, would you sentence the husband to death (in Qisas,) i.e., equality in punishment)? O &#8216;Asim! Please ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle about this matter on my behalf.&#8221; &#8216;Asim asked the Prophet but the Prophet disliked the question and disapproved of it. &#8216;Asim returned and informed &#8216;Uwaimir that the Prophet disliked that type of question. &#8216;Uwaimir said, &#8220;By Allah, I will go (personally) to the Prophet.&#8221; &#8216;Uwaimir came to the Prophet when Allah had already revealed Qur&#8217;anic Verses (in that respect), after &#8216;Asim had left (the Prophet ). So the Prophet said to &#8216;Uwaimir, &#8220;Allah has revealed Qur&#8217;anic Verses regarding you and your wife.&#8221; The Prophet then called for them, and they came and carried out the order of Lian.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then &#8216;Uwaimir said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Now if I kept her with me, I would be accused of telling a lie.&#8221; So &#8216;Uwaimir divorced her although the Prophet did not order him to do so. Later on this practice of divorcing became the tradition of couples involved in a case of Li&#8217;an. The Prophet said (to the people). &#8220;Wait for her! If she delivers a red short (small) child like a Wahra (a short red animal). then I will be of the opinion that he (&#8216;Uwaimir) has told a lie but if she delivered a black big-eyed one with big buttocks, then I will be of the opinion that he has told the truth about her.&#8221; &#8216;Ultimately she gave birth to a child that proved the accusation.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 408:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Malik bin Aus An-Nasri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I proceeded till I entered upon &#8216;Umar (and while I was sitting there), his gate-keeper Yarfa came to him and said, &#8221; &#8216;Uthman, &#8216;Abdur-Rahman, Az-Zubair and Sa&#8217;d ask your permission to come in.&#8221; &#8216;Umar allowed them. So they entered, greeted, and sat down. (After a while the gatekeeper came) and said, &#8220;Shall I admit &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas?&#8221; &#8216;Umar allowed them to enter. Al-&#8216;Abbas said &#8220;O Chief of the believers! Judge between me and the oppressor (&#8216;Ali).&#8221; Then there was a dispute (regarding the property of Bani Nadir) between them (&#8216;Abbas and &#8216;Ali). &#8216;Uthman and his companions said, &#8220;O Chief of the Believers! Judge between them and relieve one from the other.&#8221; Umar said, &#8220;Be patient! beseech you by Allah, with Whose permission the Heaven and the Earth Exist! Do you know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Our property is not to be inherited, and whatever we leave is to be given in charity,&#8217; and by this Allah&#8217;s Apostle meant himself?&#8221; On that the group said, &#8220;He verily said so.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then faced &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas and said, &#8220;I beseech you both by Allah, do you both know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said so?&#8221; They both replied, &#8220;Yes&#8221;. &#8216;Umar then said, &#8220;Now I am talking to you about this matter (in detail) . Allah favored Allah&#8217;s Apostle with some of this wealth which He did not give to anybody else, as Allah said: &#8216;What Allah bestowed as Fai (Booty on His Apostle for which you made no expedition&#8230; &#8216; (59.6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So that property was totally meant for Allah&#8217;s Apostle, yet he did not collect it and ignore you, nor did he withhold it with your exclusion, but he gave it to you and distributed it among you till this much of it was left behind, and the Prophet, used to spend of this as the yearly expenditures of his family and then take what remained of it and spent it as he did with (other) Allah&#8217;s wealth. The Prophet did so during all his lifetime, and I beseech you by Allah, do you know that?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then addressed &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas, saying, &#8220;I beseech you both by Allah, do you know that?&#8221; Both of them replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;Then Allah took His Apostle unto Him. Abu Bakr then said &#8216;I am the successor of Allah&#8217;s Apostle&#8217; and took over all the Prophet&#8217;s property and disposed of it in the same way as Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to do, and you were present then.&#8221; Then he turned to &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas and said, &#8220;You both claim that Abu Bakr did so-and-so in managing the property, but Allah knows that Abu Bakr was honest, righteous, intelligent, and a follower of what is right in managing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah took Abu Bakr unto Him, &#8216;I said: I am the successor of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr.&#8217; So I took over the property for two years and managed it in the same way as Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and Abu Bakr used to do. Then you both (&#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas) came to me and asked for the same thing! (O &#8216;Abbas! You came to me to ask me for your share from nephew&#8217;s property; and this (&#8216;Ali) came to me asking for his wives share from her father&#8217;s property, and I said to you both, &#8216;If you wish, I will place it in your custody on condition that you both will manage it in the same way as Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr did and as I have been doing since I took charge of managing it; otherwise, do not speak to me anymore about it.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then you both said, &#8216;Give it to us on that (condition).&#8217; So I gave it to you on that condition. Now I beseech you by Allah, did I not give it to them on that condition?&#8221; The group (whom he had been addressing) replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then addressed &#8216;Abbas and &#8216;Ali saying, &#8220;I beseech you both by Allah, didn&#8217;t I give you all that property on that condition?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then said, &#8220;Are you now seeking a verdict from me other than that? By Him with Whose Permission the Heaven and the Earth exists I will not give any verdict other than that till the Hour is established; and if you both are unable to manage this property, then you can hand it back to me, and I will be sufficient for it on your behalf.&#8221; (See, Hadith No. 326, Vol. 4)</p>

Allow him to come in.&#8221; He was called in and &#8216;Umar said to him, &#8220;What made you do what you did.&#8221; He replied, &#8220;We have been instructed thus by the Prophet&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Bring proof (witness) for this, other wise I will do so-and-so to you.&#8221; Then &#8216;Abdullah bin Qais went to a gathering of the Ansar who then said, &#8220;None but the youngest of us will give the witness for it.&#8221; So Abu Said Al-Khudri got up and said, &#8220;We used to be instructed thus (by the Prophet).&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;This tradition of the Prophet remained hidden from me. Business in the market kept me busy.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 452:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-A&#8217;raj:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Huraira said, &#8220;You people claim that Abu Huraira narrates many narrations of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. (Anyhow) with Allah will be our appointment. I was a poor man, and used to stick to Allah&#8217;s Apostle contented with what will fill my stomach, and the Muhajirin (emigrants) used to be busy trading in the markets, and the Ansar used to be busy looking after their properties. One-day I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;Who will spread his Rida&#8217; (a garment covering the upper part of the body) till I finished my speech and then fold it, (i.e. wrap it over your body), in which case he will never forget anything he had heard from me.&#8221; So I spread my garment which I was wearing; and by Him Who sent Muhammad with the Truth, ever since, I have never forgotten whatever I heard from him (the Prophet)&#8221; (See, Hadith No. 119, Vol. 1)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 453:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Muhammad bin Al-Munkadir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I saw Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah swearing by Allah that Ibn Sayyad was the Dajjal. I said to Jabir, &#8220;How can you swear by Allah?&#8221; Jabir said, &#8220;I have heard &#8216;Umar swearing by Allah regarding this matter in the presence of the Prophet and the Prophet did not disapprove of it.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 454:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Horses may be used for three purposes: For a man they may be a source of reward (in the Hereafter); for another, a means of protection; and for another, a source of sin. The man for whom they are a source of reward, is the one who keeps them for Allah&#8217;s Cause and ties them with long ropes and lets them graze in a pasture or garden. Whatever those long ropes allow them to eat of that pasture or garden, will be written as good deeds for him and if they break their ropes and run one or two rounds, then all their footsteps and dung will be written as good deeds for him, and if they pass a river and drink from it though he has had no intention of watering them, even then, that will be written as good deeds for him. So such horses are a source of reward for that man. For the man who keeps horses for his livelihood in order not to ask others for help or beg his bread, and at the same time he does not forget Allah&#8217;s right of what he earns through them and of their backs (that he presents it to be used in Allah&#8217;s Cause), such horses are a shelter for him (from poverty). For the man who keeps them just out of pride and for showing off, they are a source of sin.&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle was asked about donkeys. He said, &#8220;Allah has not revealed anything to me regarding them except this comprehensive Verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Then anyone who has done good, equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant) shall see it, and any one who has done evil, equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant) shall see it.&#8221; (99.7-8)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 455:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A woman asked the Prophet (Hadith 456).</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 456:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A woman asked the Prophet about the periods: How to take a bath after the periods. He said, &#8220;Take a perfumed piece of cloth and clean yourself with it.&#8221; She said,&#8217; &#8220;How shall I clean myself with it, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Clean yourself&#8221; She said again, &#8220;How shall I clean myself, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Clean yourself with it.&#8221; Then I knew what Allah&#8217;s Apostle meant. So I pulled her aside and explained it to her.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 457:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Um Hufaid bint Al-Harith bin Hazn presented the Prophet with some butter, dried yoghurt (curd milk) and mastigures as a gift. The Prophet then asked for a meal (mastigures etc. to be put) and it was eaten over his table cloth, but the Prophet did not eat of it, as he had aversion to it. But if it had been illegal to eat, it would not have been eaten over his table cloth nor would he have ordered that (mastigures meat) to be eaten</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 458:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever has eaten garlic or onion, should keep away from us, or should keep away from our mosque and should stay at home.&#8221; Ibn Wahb said, &#8220;Once a plate full of cooked vegetables was brought to the Prophet at Badr. Detecting a bad smell from it, he asked about the dish and was informed of the kinds of vegetables in contained. He then said, &#8220;Bring it near,&#8221; and so it was brought near to one of his companions who was with him. When the Prophet saw it, he disliked eating it and said (to his companion), &#8220;Eat, for I talk in secret to ones whom you do not talk to.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 459:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jubair bin Mutim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A lady came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and she talked to him about something, and he gave her some order. She said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! If I should not find you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;If you should not find me, then go to Abu Bakr.&#8221; Ibrahim bin Sa&#8217;d said, &#8220;As if she meant the death (of the Prophet).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 460:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of the Book used to read the Torah in Hebrew and then explain it in Arabic to the Muslims. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said (to the Muslims). &#8220;Do not believe the people of the Book, nor disbelieve them, but say, &#8216;We believe in Allah and whatever is revealed to us, and whatever is revealed to you.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 461:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ubaidullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Why do you ask the people of the scripture about anything while your Book (Quran) which has been revealed to Allah&#8217;s Apostle is newer and the latest? You read it pure, undistorted and unchanged, and Allah has told you that the people of the scripture (Jews and Christians) changed their scripture and distorted it, and wrote the scripture with their own hands and said, &#8216;It is from Allah,&#8217; to sell it for a little gain. Does not the knowledge which has come to you prevent you from asking them about anything? No, by Allah, we have never seen any man from them asking you regarding what has been revealed to you!&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 462:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the slanderers had given a forged statement against her, Allah&#8217;s Apostle called &#8216;Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration was delayed. He wanted to ask them and consult them about the question of divorcing me. Usama gave his evidence that was based on what he knew about my innocence, but &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;Allah has not put restrictions on you and there are many women other than her. Furthermore you may ask the slave girl who will tell you the truth.&#8221; So the Prophet asked Barira (my salve girl), &#8220;Have you seen anything that may arouse your suspicion?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;I have not seen anything more than that she is a little girl who sleeps, leaving the dough of her family (unguarded) that the domestic goats come and eat it.&#8221; Then the Prophet stood on the pulpit and said, &#8220;O Muslims! Who will help me against the man who has harmed me by slandering my wife? By Allah, I know nothing about my family except good.&#8221; The narrator added: Then the Prophet mentioned the innocence of &#8216;Aisha. (See Hadith No. 274, Vol. 6)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 463:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle addressed the people, and after praising and glorifying Allah, he said, &#8220;What do you suggest me regarding those people who are abusing my wife? I have never known anything bad about her.&#8221; The sub-narrator, &#8216;Urwa, said: When &#8216;Aisha was told of the slander, she said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Will you allow me to go to my parents&#8217; home?&#8221; He allowed her and sent a slave along with her. An Ansari man said, &#8220;Subhanaka! It is not right for us to speak about this. Subhanaka! This is a great lie!&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 464:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ata:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah in a gathering saying, &#8220;We, the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle assumed the state of Ihram to perform only Hajj without &#8216;Umra.&#8221; Jabir added, &#8220;The Prophet arrived (at Mecca) on the fourth of Dhul-Hijja. And when we arrived (in Mecca) the Prophet ordered us to finish the state of Ihram, saying, &#8220;Finish your lhram and go to your wives (for sexual relation).&#8221; Jabir added, &#8220;The Prophet did not oblige us (to go to our wives) but he only made that legal for us. Then he heard that we were saying, &#8220;When there remains only five days between us and the Day of Arafat he orders us to finish our Ihram by sleeping with our wives in which case we will proceed to &#8216;Arafat with our male organs dribbling with semen?&#8217; (Jabir pointed out with his hand illustrating what he was saying). Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up and said, &#8216;You (People) know that I am the most Allah-fearing, the most truthful and the best doer of good deeds (pious) from among you. If I had not brought the Hadi with me, I would have finished my Ihram as you will do, so finish your Ihram. If I had formerly known what I came to know lately, I would not have brought the Hadi with me.&#8217; So we finished our Ihram and listened to the Prophet and obeyed him.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 713, Vol. 2)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 465:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah Al Muzam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Perform (an optional) prayer before Maghrib prayer.&#8221; (He repeated it thrice) and the third time he said, &#8220;Whoever wants to offer it can do so,&#8221; lest the people should take it as a Sunna (tradition). (See Hadith No. 277, Vol. 2)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 466:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jundab bin &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Recite (and study) the Quran as long as you are in agreement as to its interpretation and meanings, but when you have differences regarding its interpretation and meanings, then you should stop reciting it (for the time being.) (See Hadith No 581, Vol. 6)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 467:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jundab bin &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Recite (and study) the Qur&#8217;an as long as your hearts are in agreement as to its meanings, but if you have differences as regards its meaning, stop reading it then.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 468:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the time of the death of the Prophet approached while there were some men in the house, and among them was &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khatttab, the Prophet said, &#8220;Come near let me write for you a writing after which you will never go astray.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;The Prophet is seriously ill, and you have the Quran, so Allah&#8217;s Book is sufficient for us.&#8221; The people in the house differed and disputed. Some of them said, &#8220;Come near so that Allah&#8217;s Apostle may write for you a writing after which you will not go astray,&#8221; while some of them said what &#8216;Umar said. When they made much noise and differed greatly before the Prophet, he said to them, &#8220;Go away and leave me.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas used to say, &#8220;It was a great disaster that their difference and noise prevented Allah&#8217;s Apostle from writing that writing for them.</p>

<p><em>Hadith</em> of Irbaad ibn Saariyah, may Allaah the Most High be pleased with him, who said, “The Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم gave us a sermon which frightened the hearts and caused the eyes to shed tears. So we said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah! [it is as if it is a farewell sermon] so advise us.’ He said,</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>‘I advise you to fear Allaah and to hear and obey even if an Abyssinian slave were to rule over you. For surely, he who lives from amongst you will see much differing, so it is upon you to be upon my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Caliphs. Bite on to it with your back molar teeth and beware of newly invented matters, for verily, every newly invented matter is an innovation, and all innovation is misguidance.’” </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Related by Aboo Daawood (no. 4607) and by at-Tirmidthee (no. 2676). It was authenticated by Shaykh al-Albaanee in Irwaa’ul-Ghaleel (no. 2455).</p>

Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal (d.241H)<br />
Source: Al-Ibaanah Magazine, Issue No.1 &#8211; Dhul-Qa’dah 1415H / April 1995</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillaahir-Rahmaanir-Raheem</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">THE TEXT:</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Aboo ’Abdullaah Yahyaa Ibn Abil-Hasan Ibnul-Bannaa narrated to us saying: My father Aboo ’Alee al-Hasan Ibn ’Umar Ibnul-Bannaa related to us saying: Abul-Husayn ’Alee Ibn Muhammad Ibn ’Abdullaah Ibn Bushraan al-Mu’addil related to us, saying: ’Uthmaan Ibn Ahmad Ibn as-Sammaak reported to us, saying: Aboo Muhammad al-Hasan Ibn ’Abdul-Wahhaab, Abun-Nabr narrated to us, reading it to him from his handwritten copy in the month of Rabee’ul-Awwal, in the year two-hundred and ninety three (293H) who said: Aboo Ja’far Muhammad Ibn Sulaymaan al-Munqaree, in Basrah related to us, saying: ’Abdoos Ibn Maalik al-’Attaar narrated to me, saying: [1] I heard Aboo ’Abdullaah Ahmad Ibn Hanbal [2] – rahimahullaah – say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Fundamental Principles of the Sunnah [3] with us [4] are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Clinging to that which the Companions [5] of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) were upon, taking them as our example to be followed, [6] avoiding innovation; [7] and every innovation is misguidance.” [8]</span></strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">COMMENTARY:</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]: This is the isnaad (chain of narration connected to the text) which &#8211; just as in the case of the hadeeth of the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) &#8211; helps ascertain whether or not the statement and the ascription is authentically related back to the one it is being reported from. As regards the importance of the isnaad, then a few narrations from the Scholars of the early generations will be mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyaan ath-Thawree (d.161H) – rahimahullaah – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The isnaad is the weapon of the Believer. So if he has no weapon, with what will he fight?”[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibnul-Mubaarak (d.181H) – rahimahullaah – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The isnaad with me is from the Religion. If there were no isnaad, then whosoever wanted would relate whatever they wanted. However, when it is said to him: Who narrated to you? He remains silent.” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards the ascription to Imaam Ahmad, then a number of Scholars have agreed to its ascription from ’Abdoos Ibn Maalik al-’Attaar &#8211; one of the close students of the Imaam &#8211; and from these verifying Scholars are: Ibn Abee Ya’laa in Tabaqaatul-Hanaabilah (1/241-246), al-Laalikaa‘ee in Sharh Usoolul-I’tiqaad Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah (1/158-164) and also Ibnul-Jawzee in Manaaqib Ahmad (p. 222-228).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The text of this brief ’aqeedah was first printed by Daarul-Manaar in al-Mujaahid magazine (no. 28-29, Sha’baan &#8211; Ramadaan 1411H); and the original is a manuscript copy, transcribed by the Shaykh and muhaddith, Muhammad Naasirud-Deen al-Albaanee, rahimahullaah, in the month of Sha’baan 1374H, from the manuscript copy (no. 68, Q. 10-15) which is housed at the Dhaahiriyyah library in Damascus, Syria. We ask Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; to grant us the ability to serialize the introduction of this valuable and concise tract, adding to it &#8211; for the benefit of the honourable readers &#8211; a brief commentary and explanation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]: He is Aboo ’Abdullaah Ahmad Ibn Muhammad Ibn Hanbal ash-Shaybaanee &#8211; the Imaam of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah in his time. Born in Baghdaad in Rabee’ul-Awwal, 164H, he attended the circles of al-Qaadee Aboo Yoosuf (the student of Abee Haneefah) &#8211; rahimahullaah – where he studied fiqh. He left this in favour of hadeeth, which he began to study at the age of thirteen &#8211; having already memorized the Qur‘aan at a young age. He traveled extensively acquiring and learning ahaadeeth from over two-hundred and eighty teachers. From them are: Wakee’ Ibnul-Jarraah, Yahyaa Ibn Sa’eed al-Qattaan, ’Abdur-Rahmaan Ibn Mahdee, Sufyaan Ibn ’Uyaynah, ash-Shaafi’ee, Yazeed Ibn Haaroon and others – rahimahullaah. He underwent severe torture and trial due to defending the correct ’aqeedah &#8211; the ’aqeedah of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah (the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam), his Companions and those who followed them in ’aqeedah and manhaj) &#8211; being from those who were foremost in clinging to their way, whilst shunning the innovations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo ’Umayr said: “May Allaah have mercy upon him. There was no one having more patience regarding this world than him, nor anyone more closely resembling those who cam before him, nor anyone more rightfully amongst the righteous. This world was presented to him, but he rejected it, and he expelled innovations.” In his time, he was the Imaam of the people of Hadeeth specifically, and the Muslims in general.” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ash-Shaafi’ee (d.204H) &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I left Baghdaad, and I did not leave behind me a man better, having more knowledge, or greater Fiqh (understanding), nor having greater taqwaa (piety) than Ahmad Ibn Hanbal.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ishaaq Ibn Raahawayh (d.238H) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I used to sit with Ahmad and Ibn Ma’een revising ahaadeeth; and I would say: What is the Fiqh (understanding) of it? What is its explanation? So they would remain silent, except for Ahmad.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Daawood (d.275H) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The lectures of Ahmad were sittings for the Hereafter. He would not mention in them any worldly affairs; and I never saw him mention this world.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">’Alee Ibnul-Madeenee (d.324H) – rahimahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Indeed Allaah aided this Religion through Aboo Bakr as-Siddeeq on the day of apostasy, and through Ahmad Ibn Hanbal on the day of the trial.” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to these qualities, he became a sign for Ahlus-Sunnah – as Qutaybah Ibn Sa’eed (d.240H) said, “If you see a man loving Ahmad, then know that he is a person of the Sunnah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Abul-Hasan al-Ash’aree (d.324H) – rahimahullaah – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Our statement which we hold and take as our Religion is: Clinging to the Book of Allaah, our Lord the Mighty and Majestic, and to the Sunnah of our Prophet, Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam), and what is narrated from the Companions, the Taabi’een and the Imaams of Hadeeth. This is what we cling to, and also that to which Aboo ’Abdullaah Ahmad Ibn Muhammad Ibn Hanbal – may Allaah enlighten his face, rais up his rank and grant him a magnificent reward – used to say, distancing ourselves from those who oppose his statement. Since he was the noble and complete Imaam, by whom Allaah made the truth clear, and removed the misguidance, and made the minhaaj (methodology) clear, and though whom Allaah annihilated the innovation of the innovators, the deviation of the deviant and the doubts of the doubters. So may Allaah have mercy upon him, the foremost Imaam.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taajud-Deen as-Subkee (d.770H) – rahimahullaah – said, “Abul-Hasan al-Ash’aree is the foremost of Ahlus-Sunnah and Ahmad Ibn Hanbal&#8230;” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibraaheem al-Harbee (d.285H) – rahimahullaah – said, “I saw Aboo ’Abdullaah, and it was as if Allaah had gathered for him the knowledge of the earlier people and the later people.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal died in the year 241H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]: The term ‘Sunnah’ here, refers to the principles and foundations of the correct Islaamic ’aqeedah (belief) and manhaj (methodology), since the Salafus-Saalih (pious predecessors) would apply this term to matters of ’aqeedah and manhaj – as can be seen from their books and writings – for example: [i] Kitaabus-Sunnah of Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal (d.241H); [ii] as-Sunnah of al-Athram (d.273H); [iii] Kitaabus-Sunnah of Aboo Daawood (d.275H) – being part of his Sunan. [iv] Kitaabus-Sunnah of Ibn Abee ’Aasim (d.287H); [v] Kitaabus-Sunnah of ’Abdullaah (d.290H), the son of Ahmad Ibn Hanbal; [vi] as-Sunnah of al-Marwazee (d.292H); [vii] Sareehus-Sunnah of Ibn Jareer at-Tabaree (d.310H); [viii] as-Sunnah of al-Khallaal (d.311H); [ix] Sharhus-Sunnah of al-Barbahaaree (d.329H); [x] as-Sunnah of al-’Asaal (d.349H) and [xi] as-Sunnah of at-Tabaraanee (d.360H).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The term ‘Sunnah’ was employed in this context to differentiate those matters of ’aqeedah and manhaj of the Salafus-Saalih were upon, from that which was innovated by the deviant and misguided sects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]: Meaning, with the Scholars of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah and at the head of them in his time was Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal. And in this regard, the way of the Salafus-Saalih was to point out to the people, the true followers and adherents to the Sunnah so that their ’aqeedah and manhaj (methodology) could be learnt and adhered to, as Imaam Ayyoob as-Sakhtiyaanee (d.131H) – rahimahullaah – said, “From the success of a youth, or a non-Arab is that Allaah guides him to a Scholar of the Sunnah.” [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And ’Amr Ibn Qays al-Mulaa‘ee (d.143H) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“If you see a youth when he begins to sprout, keeping company with Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah then have hope for him. If you see him keeping company with the people of Innovation, then fear for him, because the youth is according to his initial upbringing.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]: Companions: Arabic: Sahaabah, or Ashaab; singular: Sahaabee. As regards the Sharee’ah definition of ‘Sahaabee’ or ‘Companion,’ then:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Haafidh Ibn Hajar (d.825H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The most correct of what I have come across is that a Sahaabee (Companion) is one who met the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) whilst believing in him, and died as a Muslim. So that includes one who lived with him for a long or short time, and those who narrated from him and those who did not, and those who saw him but did not sit with him and those who could not see him due to blindness.” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam an-Nawawee (d.676H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The correct position is that whosoever accompanied the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam), even for an hour, then that person is from his Sahaabah.” [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad (d.241H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Every person who accompanied the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam), whether for a year, month, a day, or even for an hour, or even just saw him is from his Companions.”[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Bukhaaree (d.256H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“H who accompanied the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) or saw him – from the Muslims – then he is from his Companions.” [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Haafidh Ibn Hajar said in Fathul-Baaree (7/1),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“That which al-Bukhaaree states is the saying of Ahmad and the great majority of the Scholars of Hadeeth.” Some of the proofs that the Scholars have used for this are: The saying of the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam), “There will come upon the people a time when a group from amongst the people will go off to fight and it will be said to them: Is there any amongst you who has seen the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam)? So they will say: Yes. So victory will be granted to them. So a group will go off to fight and it will be said to them: Is there any amongst you who were the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam)? So they will say: Yes. So victory will be granted to them. Then a group will go off to fight and it will be said to them: Is there any amongst you who have seen the companions of the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam)? So they will say: Yes. So victory will be granted to them.” [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) also said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“You will not cease to be upon good as long as there amongst you those who accompanied me. By Allaah! You will not cease to be upon good as long as there are amongst you those who accompanied those who accompanied and saw me.” [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these narrations contain a clear proof that a Muslim seeing the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) is granted virtue and excellence and is established as being from amongst the Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer (d.774H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The fact that just seeing him (the Prophet) is enough for one to be called a Companion is clearly stated by al-Bukhaaree, Aboo Zur’ah and others who have written books regarding the names of the Companions – such as Ibn ’Abdul-Barr, Ibn Mandah, Aboo Moosaa al-Madanee, Ibnul-Atheer&#8230;” [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards the statement attributed to the taabi’ee and Imaam Sa’eed Ibnul-Musayyib – rahimahullaah – concerning the definition of a Companion, then this cannot be used as a proof at all. This is because al-Haafidh al-’Iraaqee – rahimahullaah – says, “The third saying is what is related from Sa’eed Ibnul-Musayyib, that he had not used to count someone as being a Companion, except one who accompanied the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) for a year or two and fought along with him in one or two battles. Ibnus-Salaah said, “What is meant by this if it is authentic from him – refers back to what the Scholars of Usool say (i.e. what is meant be companionship language wise). However, this definition contains restrictions, which will mean that we do not count as Companions those such as Jareer Ibn ’Abdullaah al-Bajalee – who obviously does not fulfill these conditions that are made – but such are people about whom we know of no difference of opinion with regards to them being Companions.” I say, this is not authentic from Ibnul-Musayyib, since the isnaad (chain of narration) from him contains Muhammad Ibn ’Umar al-Waaqidee – who is da’eef (weak) in hadeeth.” [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]: Here the Imaam – rahimahullaah – explains and lays down the signposts for the correct manhaj followed by Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, and that is the methodology of the best and most excellent of mankind, the Companions, then those who followed them (the taabi’een), then those who followed them (the atbaa’ut-taabi’een).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah cling to what the first three generations of Muslims were upon – the Salafus-Saalih – whose excellence has been testified to by the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) in his statement, “The most excellent of mankind is my generation, then those who follow them, then those who follow them.” [17] And he (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, “The most excellent Ummah is the generation which I have been sent in, then those who followed them, then those who followed them.” [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards to the following generations, then they have not been praised with any specific excellence. Rather, they have, in general, been spoken ill of by the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam). Indeed, in some authentic narrations, after mentioning the excellence of the first three generations, the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, “&#8230;then there will come a people amongst whom fatness will appear and who will testify without having been asked to do so.” [19] And in another narration, “&#8230;then there will come a people in whom you will not find any good.” [20] Also, there occurs in another authentic narration, the wording, “&#8230;then there will come a people who will testify without being asked to do so, who make promises but do not keep them, who are treacherous and not trustworthy and fatness will appear amongst them.” [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is the first three generations – the Salafus-Saalih – whose era has been praised with an excellence, whose path is to be followed and whose understanding of the Religion is to be accepted and affirmed. ’Aa‘ishah – radiyallaahu ’anhaa – said: A man came to the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and said, ‘Who is the most excellent of mankind?’ So the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, “The generation which I am in, then the second, then the third.” [22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is the first of these generations – the Companions – radiyallaahu ’anhum – who were the foremost in excellence from mankind; since they were: [i] those who learnt the Religion directly from the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and, “Being informed is not like seeing.” [23] [ii] those who knew best and understood the Religion – and this is the root of their excellence – as the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, “Whosoever Allaah intends to show excellence to, He gives him the understanding of the Religion.” [24] [iii] They were those who followed it the best, and [iv] They were the ones who were furthest away from and remained free from innovations. About the excellence of the Salafus-Saalih, and the excellence of those who follow them, and the obligation to follow their path, Allaah – the Mighty and Majestic says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Those foremost of those who first migrated and those that helped them and those who follow them in goodness, Allaah is well-pleased with them and they are well-pleased with Him. He has prepared for them gardens underneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme success.” [Sooratut-Tawbah 9:100]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah – the Most Perfect – says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Whosoever contends with the Messenger, even after guidance has been clearly conveyed to him, and follows a path other than that of the Believers; We shall leave him in the Path he has chosen and land him in Hell, what an evil destination.” [Sooratun-Nisaa‘ 4:115]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, “This is a clear definition and a decisive proof upon the worshipper, in making following the path of the Believers obligatory. And who were the Believers at the time this aayah was revealed, except the Companions (radiyallaahu ’anhum). Thus, Allaah has threatened those who leave their way and traverse other than their path, with lowliness and humiliation in this world; and a severe punishment in the Hereafter.” [25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What further adds to the above decisive proofs, and is considered to be the correct explanation of those aayaat, are the ahaadeeth of the Propht (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam), “Indeed my Ummah will split up into seventy-three. All of them are in the Fire except one.” It was said, ‘What is the one?’ He said, “The Jamaa’ah.” And in another narration, he said, “That which I and my Companions are upon.” [26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He – sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam – also said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Those of you who survive after me shall see many differences of opinion. So hold fast to my Sunnah and to the Sunnah of the rightly-guided Caliphs after me. Cling to it tightly and beware of newly-invented matters, for every newly-invented matter is an innovation and every innovation is a going astray.” [27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The stars are the custodians of the sky, when the stars pass away, that which has been decreed for the sky will come upon it. I am the custodian for my Companions, so when I pass away there will come upon my Companions that which is decreed for them. And my Companions are the custodians for my Ummah, so when my Companions pass away, that which has been decreed upon my Ummah will come upon it.” [28] Below is a summary of the aforementioned proofs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[i] That the iftiraaq (splitting-up) of the Ummah into various sects – on the basis of differences in ’aqeedah and manhaj – has been foretold.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ii] All of the various firaq (sects) have been threatened with Hellfire, except those who adhere to the ’aqeedah and the manhaj of the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and his Companions, and that is al-Firqatun-Naajiyah (the Saved-Sect) and the Jamaa’ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[iii] That the authentic hadeeth about iftiraaq (splitting-up) is an explanation of, and in full agreement with the aayah from Sooratun-Nisaa‘ [4:115] in that all those who, “follow a path other than that of the Believers (the Companions),” have been threatened with Hellfire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[iv] The obligation to follow the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and his Companions, and that is the way of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, cannot be fulfilled, except by avoiding and shunning innovation and its people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[v] When differences and innovations arise, it is obligatory to cling to the Sunnah, and also that which the Jamaa’ah have ijmaa’ (consensus and agreement) upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[vi] That the Companions were made examples to be followed and were for this Ummah, after the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam), the custodians of the correct knowledge, manhaj and ’aqeedah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[vii] The root of the Companions excellence is in their understanding of and clinging onto the correct ’aqeedah and manhaj and also in their defending it, preserving it, and in their conveying it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[viii] This is also the root cause for the excellence of those who followed the Companions in the next two generations. So it is binding upon the Muslims to follow the path taken by the Salafus-Saalih, those Muslims who – living in the first three generations – adhered to the ’aqeedah and manhaj, and have been praised with an excellence over and above the rest of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ix] Opposing the way of the Salafus-Saalih is considered iftiraaq (splitting-up) and opposing them in matters related to Islaamic manhaj is also considered iftiraaq. So whoever chooses to oppose their knowledge and understanding of the Revelation, has split from them; and has therefore split from the way of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, and has taken one of the forbidden and innovated paths.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, Ibn Mas’ood (radiyallaahu ’anhu) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Indeed, Allaah looked into the hearts of the servants and found the heart of Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) to be the best of the hearts of the servants. So He chose him for Himself and sent him as a Messenger. Then He looked into the hearts of the servants after Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and found the hearts of the Companions to be the best of the hearts of the servants. So He made them ministers of His Messenger, fighting for His Religion. So whatever the Muslims (i.e. the Companions) hold to be good, then it is good with Allaah, and whatever the Muslims hold to be evil, then it is evil with Allaah.” [29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Barabahaaree (d.329H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The foundations upon which the Jamaa’ah is made clear is the Companions of Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam). They are Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, so whoever does not take from them has gone astray and innovated; and every innovation is misguidance and misguidance and its people are in the Fire.” [30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, “The truth is that which comes from Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. Th Sunnah is that which the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) laid down, and the Jamaa’ah is that which the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) united upon, in the Caliphate of Aboo Bakr, ’Umar and ’Uthmaan. So he who limits himself to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and that which the Companions were upon, is successful and triumphs over all the people of innovation, is saved and his Religion is preserved – if Allaah wills. Since the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, “My Ummah will split up into seventy-three sects,” and he told us that which would be the saved sect, saying, “That which I and my Companions are upon.” So this is the cure, the explanation, the dear affair and the straight and distinct road.” [31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas’ood (radiyallaahu ’anhu) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) drew a line for us and said, “This is the Straight Path of Allaah.” Then he drew lines to its right and its left and said, “These are other paths; upon every one of them is a devil calling towards it.” Then he recited,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Indeed, this is My Straight Path, so follow it. And do not follow other paths, they will separate you from His Path.” [32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">About the statement of Allaah, “And do not follow other paths,” ad-Daarimee relates in his Sunan (1/68) and al-Bayhaqee relates in al-Madkhal ilas-Sunan (no. 200) that Mujaahid (d.204H) said explaining this aayah, “Innovations and doubts.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul-’Aaliyah (d.90H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Learn Islaam. Then when you have learnt Islaam, do not turn away from it to the right, nor the left. Rather, be upon the Straight Path and be upon the Sunnah of your Prophet and that which his Companions were upon&#8230;And beware of these innovations because they cause enmity and hatred amongst you. Rather, stick to the original state of affairs which was there before they divided.” [33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]: Arabic: Bida’ (singular: Bid’ah). Linguistically, bid’ah means: a newly invented matter. The Sharee’ah definition of bid’ah is: “A newly invented way (beliefs or actions) in the Religion, in imitation to the Sharee’ah (prescribed Law), by which nearness of Allaah is sought, not being supported by an authentic proof; neither in its foundations, nor the manner in which it is performed.” [34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ash-Shaatibee (d.777H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Everyone who follows the mutashaabihaat (those aayaat without a clear meaning), or twists the underlying meanings or gives a meaning to the aayaat not given to it by the Salafus-Saalih, or clings on to the very weak and unauthentic ahaadeeth, or takes that which is apparent as a proof – for every action, statement or belief in agreement with his objetives and intentions, not finding a fundamental proof for understanding it in that manner – then this is the method of deduction and derivation which gives rise to innovations and those who innovate.” [35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ’Abdul-Haadee (d.745H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It is not permissible to invent an interpretation about an aayah or a Sunnah which was not there in the time of the Salaf, nor did they have any knowledge of it, nor explain it to the Ummah. Since this would mean that the Salaf were ignorant of the truth in this matter and failed to reach it, whereas the late-coming opponent is somehow guided to the truth!” [36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibnul-Qayyim (d.756H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Inventing an explanation with regards to the Book of Allaah – to which the Salaf and the Scholars ar in opposition – necessitates one of two things; [i] either the explanation in itself a mistake, or [ii] that the sayings of the Salaf which run contrary to it are in error! And no one with an ounce of intellect would doubt that the one whose saying is in opposition to that of the Salaf is the one who is mistaken and in error.” [37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And avoiding bida’ (innovations) is one of the great usool (foundations) of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, and it involves: [i] keeping away from them; [ii] having hatred for them; [iii] warning the people about them; [iv] clarifying them to the people so that they do not fall into them; [v] refuting the innovators.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam as-Saaboonee (d.449H) said about Ahlus-Sunnah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“They follow the Salafus-Saalih – the Imaams and Scholars of the Muslims – and they cling to the firm Religion that they clung to and the firm truth. And they hate Ahlul-Bid’ah (people of innovation) who innovate into the Religion that which is not from it. They do not love them and they do not keep company with them. They do not listen to their sayings, nor sit with them, nor argue with them about the Religion, nor debate with them. Rather, they protect their ears from their futility – things which if they pass through the ears and settle in the hearts – will cause harm and will cause doubts and wicked ideas to appear. And concerning this, Allaah the Mighty and Majestic sent down:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And when you see people engaged in vain discourse, then turn away from them unless they turn to different theme.” [Sooratul-An’aam 6:68].” [38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ash-Shawakaanee (d.1255H) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And this aayah contains a severe reprimand for those who allow people to sit with the innovators, those who twist the Words of Allaah, play around with His Book, and the Sunnah of His Messenger (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam). And refer them back to their own misleading desires and wicked innovations. Since, if he is unable to reprimand them and change them from what they are upon, then at the very least, he should avoid sitting with them – and that is easy for him, not difficult. And the innovators may make use of his presence with them – even though he may be free from their mistakes – through a doubt by which they will beguile the common people, in which case his presence will cause an extra evil, in addition to just listening to their evil.” [39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, “Indeed, Allaah does not accept the repentance of an innovator, until he ceases from the innovation.” [40] And he (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, “Every innovation is misguidance and going astray.” [41] And he also said, “Whosoever innovates, or accommodates an innovator, then upon him is the curse of Allaah, the Angels and the whole of mankind.” [42]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyaan ath-Thawree – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Innovations are more beloved to Iblees than sin. Since a sin may be repented from, but innovation is not repented from.” [43] The following narrations will highlight – if Allaah wills – the manhaj (methodology) adopted by our Salafus-Saalih with regards to the mubtadi’een (innovators). A man said to ’Abdullaah Ibn ’Umar, ‘Najdah (a man from the Khawaarij) says such and such.’ So Ibn ’Umar prevented himself from listening for fear of that some of it should enter into his heart. [44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Hasan al-Basree (d.110H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Do not sit with the people of innovations and desires, nor argue with them, nor listen to them.” [45]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Asmaa‘ Bint ’Ubayd said: Two of the people of vain desires and innovations entered upon Ibn Seereen (d.110H), and said, “O Abaa Bakr, may we speak with you?” So he said, “No!” They said, “May we recite an aayah?” He from the Book of Allaah said, “No, indeed either you must get up and leave me, or I will get up and leave.” So said, “O Abaa Bakr, what harm would they left, so some of the people it have done to you, for them to recite an aayah from the Book of Allaah?” He said, “I feared that they would read an aayah to me and distort it, and that would remain in my heart.” [46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An innovator asked Ayyoob as-Sakhtiyaanee (d.131H), “O Abaa Bakr, may I ask you about a word?’ He turned away and indicated with his hand, “No, not even half of a word.” [47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibraaheem Ibn Maysirah (d.132H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“He who honours an innovator has assisted him in the demolition of Islaam.” [48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Qilaabah (d.140H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Do not sit with the people of innovation, because I do not feel secure that they will not drown you in their misguidance and make part of what you used to know unclear to you.”[49]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ’Awn (d.150H) – rahimahullaah – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Whosoever sits with an innovator is worse than him.” [50]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was said to Imaam al-Awzaa’ee (d.157H) – rahimahullaah, ‘A person says, ‘I sit with Ahlus-Sunnah and I sit with the innovators.’ So al-Awzaa’ee said, ‘This person desires to fluctuate between the truth and falsehood.” [51] Commenting upon this statement, Ibn Battah said, “Indeed, al-Awzaa’ee has spoken the truth. And I say, indeed this person does not know the truth from falsehood, nor faith from disbelief.” [51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyaan ath-Thawree (d.164H) – rahimahullaah – said, “Whosoever listens to an innovator has left the protection of Allaah and is entrusted to the innovation.” [52]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And al-Fudayl Ibn ’Iyaad (d.187H) – rahimahullaah – said, “Do not sit with an innovator, for I fear that curses will descend upon you.” [53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Maalik (d.197H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“How evil are the people of innovation, we do not give them salaam.” [54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ash-Shaafi’ee (d.197H) – rahimahullaah – said, “That a person meets Allaah with every sin except Shirk is better than meeting Him upon any one of the innovated beliefs.”[55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Daawood as-Sijjistaanee (d.275H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to Aboo ’Abdullaah Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, “If I see a man from the people of the Sunnah sitting with a man from the people of innovation, should I speak with him?” He said, “No, you should first inform him that the one whom you saw him with is a person of innovation. Either he will cease speaking to the innovator, so continue speaking with him, or if not, then consider him to be like him. Ibn Mas’ood said that a person is like his friend.” [56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, the people of knowledge throughout the ages continued warning the masses against the innovators and considered this matter important enough to dedicate chapters in their various books about this. For example:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Daawood placed a chapter in his Sunan (4/197), called: “Chapter: Turning away from the innovators and having hatred for them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh al-Mundhiree (d.656H) – rahimahullaah – placed a chapter in at-Targheeb wat-Tarheeb (3/14) called: “Deterrent against loving the people of innovation, since a person will be with those whom he loves.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam an-Nawawee (d.676H) – rahimahullaah – says in al-Adhkaar (p.323), “Chapter: Disassociating from the people of innovation and sin.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Bayhaqee (d.458H) – rahimahullaah – said in al-I’tiqaad (p.236), “Chapter: The prohibition from sitting with the people of innovation.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Laalikaa‘ee (d.418H) said in Sharh Usoolul-I’tiqaad Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah (1/128), “What is related from the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) with respect to the forbiddance of debating with the innovators.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Baghawee (d.516H) &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘Indeed the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) informed about the division in this Ummah, and the manifestation of desires and innovations in it. And he designated salvation for those who follow his Sunnah and the Sunnah of his Companions, may Allaah be pleased with them. So it is upon the Muslim, that if he sees a man having something from innovations and desires in belief, or something neglected from the Sunnah, that he makes Hijrah (migration) from him, and he frees himself from him, and abandons him in life and death. So he must not greet him if he meets him, and he must not answer him if he (i.e. the innovator) begins the greeting, until he abandons his innovation and returns to the truth…So verily the hijrah from the people of desires and innovation continues until they repent.’’ [57]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qaadee Aboo Ya’laa (d.333H) – rahimahullaah – said in Hajarul-Mubtadi’ (p. 32), “There is ijmaa’ (consensus) from the Companions and the taabi’een as regards disassociating and cutting-off from the innovators.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also necessary to mention here, the distinction that the Scholars make between a newly-invented matter being bid’ah (innovation) and passing a judgement upon the one who is involved in it that he is a mubtadi’ (innovator).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]: Just as the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said in his sermons, “&#8230;and every innovation is misguidance and all that misguides, misguides to the Fire.” [59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And ’Abdullaah Ibn ’Umar (radiyallaahu ’anhu) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Every innovation is misguidance, even if the people think it is good.” [60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Barbahaaree (d.329H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Beware of small innovations, because they will grow until they become large. This was the case with every innovation introduced into this Ummah. It began as something small, bearing resemblance to the truth, which is why those who entered into it were misled and then were unable to leave it. So it grew and became the religion that they followed, and thus deviated from the Straight Path and left Islaam. And may Allaah have mercy upon you! Examine carefully the speech of everyone you hear from in your time particularly. So do not act in haste, and do not enter into anything from it until you ask and see: Did any of the Companions of the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) speak about it, or any of the Scholars? So if you find a narration from them about it, cling to it, do not go beyond it for anything and do not give precedence to anything over it and thus fall into the Fire.”[61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Hasan al-Basree said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Sunnah is – by Him besides whom none has the right to be worshipped – between those who exceed the limits and those who fall short. So be patient upon it, may Allaah have mercy upon you. For indeed, Ahlus-Sunnah were a minority from those who preceded and shall be a minority from those to come. They did not accompany the people of excessiveness when they exceeded, nor the people of innovation when they innovated. Rather, they persevered upon the Sunnah, until they met their Lord.” [62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In summary, two major principles of manhaj – with regards to the ’aqeedah of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah – have been covered in the first part of this serialization: Firstly, “The source for the ’aqeedah is: the Book of Allaah, the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and the ijmaa’ (consensus) of the Salafus-Saalih.” Secondly, “Every newly invented matter in the Religion is an innovation, and every innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance is in the Fire.” [63]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Printed and Published by : Presidency of Islamic research, Ifta propogation, and Guidance</strong><br />
Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Govt Publication – <a href="https://salafiaudio.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/indispensable-implication-of-sunnah-and-caution-against-innovation-ibn-baz.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>Download PDF</strong></a>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allâh who completed the religion for us, perfected the blessing on us and chose Islam as our religion. May the blessings and peace be upon His slave and Messenger, who called upon people to obey his Lord and cautioned against extravagance, innovation and disobedience; and may Allâh bless his posterity, his companions and those who follow his footsteps till the Day of Judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have been acquainted with the article published on the first page of the weekly magazine <em>Edarat</em> of Kanpur , an industrial city of Uttar Pardesh in India , which contains an implied campaign against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia , its adherence to the Islamic creed, and its opposition to innovations. The writer alleges that the creed of the <em>Salaf</em> (early adherents to Islam) which is held by Saudi Kingdom does not agree with the<em> Sunnah</em>. By this, the writer aims at creating division amongst the<em> Ahl-as-Sunnah</em> and encouraging the innovations and superstitions. This attitude, no doubt, is most abominable and dangerous and aims at offending the Religion of Islam and spreading innovations and deviations from the truth. Furthermore, the article concentrates clearly on the subject of celebrating the Prophet&#8217;s birthday as an excuse to discuss the creed of the Kingdom and its rulers. Therefore, I consider it necessary to enlighten the people on this subject. So seeking help of Allâh, I say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible to celebrate the birthday of the Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم or somebody else. In fact, it must be stopped, as it is an innovation in the religion. Allâh&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم neither celebrated it, nor commanded others to do this for himself; or for anyone who died before him amongst the Prophets, or for his daughters, or his wives, or his other relatives. The rightly-guided Caliphs, the Companions of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم or the Successors who rightly followed them did not celebrate this event, nor did anyone of the Muslim scholars in the centuries before.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They knew the <em>Sunnah </em>of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم best, they loved him more, and followed the <em>Shari&#8217;ah</em> better than those who came after them. If celebrating his birthday was a good deed, they would have done it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are commanded to follow and forbidden to innovate. This is because of the perfection of the Islamic religion and the sufficiency of what Allâh and His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم have given us and are accepted by <em>Ahl-as-Sunnah wal-Jama&#8217;ah.</em> The Muslim community of the Companions and those who followed them in the best way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is related to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; من أحدث في أمرنا هذا ما ليس منه فهو رد &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;He who innovates something in this matter of ours that is not of it, will have it rejected). (Transmitted by<em> Al-Bukhâri</em> and <em>Muslim)</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to Muslim who reported:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; من عمل عملا ليس عليه أمرنا فهو رد &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever does an act which is not in agreement with our matter, will have it rejected.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another tradition, the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; عليكم بسنتي وسنة الخلفاء الراشدين المهديين من بعدي, تمسكوا بها وعضوا عليها بالنواجذ, وإياكم ومحدثات الأمور, فإن كل محدثة بدعة وكل بدعة ضلالة &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;You must keep to my <em>Sunnah </em>and of the <em>Sunnah</em> of the rightly-guided Caliphs, cling to it firmly. Beware of newly invented matters, for every new matter is an innovation and every innovation is misleading&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He used to say in every Friday <em>Khutbah</em> (sermon, religious talk):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; فإن خير الحديث كتاب الله وخير الهدي هدي محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم وشر الأمور محدثاتها وكل بدعة ضلالة &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The best discourse is the Book of Allâh and the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad, the Messenger of Allâh, and the worst matter is that of innovation and every innovation is misleading&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, these<em> Ahâdith</em> (traditions) contain a strong caution against innovations and a warning that such an act is a deviation from the right course. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم warned the people of the gravity of these innovations and of their bad consequences. There are many traditions adduced in this connection. And the Almighty has said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَمَا آتَاكُمُ الرَّسُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَاكُمْ عَنْهُ فَانْتَهُوا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8230; And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم ) gives you, take it, and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it), &#8230;&#8221; (V.59:7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">فَلْيَحْذَرِ الَّذِينَ يُخَالِفُونَ عَنْ أَمْرِهِ أَنْ تُصِيبَهُمْ فِتْنَةٌ أَوْ يُصِيبَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8230; And let those who oppose the Messenger&#8217;s (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم ) commandment (i.e. his <em>Sunnah</em> &#8211; legal ways, orders, acts of worship, statements, etc.) (among the sects) beware, lest some <em>Fitnah </em>(disbelief, trials, afflictions, earthquakes, killing, overpowered by a tyrant, etc.) befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them.&#8221; (V.24:63).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh the Almighty said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏لَقَدْ كَانَ لَكُمْ فِي رَسُولِ اللَّهِ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ لِمَنْ كَانَ يَرْجُو اللَّهَ وَالْيَوْمَ الْآخِرَ وَذَكَرَ اللَّهَ كَثِيرًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed in the Messenger of Allâh (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes in (the Meeting with) Allâh and the Last Day and remembers Allâh much.&#8221; (V.33:21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allâh the Almighty said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏وَالسَّابِقُونَ الْأَوَّلُونَ مِنَ الْمُهَاجِرِينَ وَالْأَنْصَارِ وَالَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوهُمْ بِإِحْسَانٍ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُوا عَنْهُ وَأَعَدَّ لَهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي تَحْتَهَا الْأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا أَبَدًا ذَلِكَ الْفَوْزُ الْعَظِيمُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And the first to embrace Islam of the <em>Muhâjirun</em> (those who migrated from Makkah to Al-Madinah) and the <em>Ansâr</em> (the citizens of Al-Madinah who helped and gave aid to the <em>Muhâjirun</em>) and also those who followed them exactly (in Faith). Allâh is well-pleased with them as they are well- pleased with Him. He has prepared for them Gardens under which rivers flow ( Paradise ), to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme success.&#8221; (V.9:100).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allâh the Almighty said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">الْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِي وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ الْإِسْلَامَ دِينًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8230; This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion&#8230;&#8221; (V.5:3).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse decisively indicates that the Almighty Allâh has completed the religion for this <em>Ummah,</em> and has showered His blessings on them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم passed away only after he had imparted the complete Message of Allâh to the <em>Ummah </em>as well as his legislations concerning sayings and deeds. He also stressed that all things invented by people and then attributed to the religion of Islam are innovations and to be rejected, even if their inventors did so in good faith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is established that the Companions of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and the righteous Successors after them warned the people against innovations as they add to Islam and legislate what is not permitted by Allâh, in line with the enemies of Allâh such as the Jews and the Christians who added to their religion and innovated what was not allowed by Allâh. Moreover, to admit innovation in Islam is to admit that Islam is incomplete and imperfect. Such a belief is not only an evil but contradicts the following verse: &#8220;This day have I perfected your religion for you,&#8221; and the sayings of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم which warn us against innovations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To celebrate the anniversary of the birth of Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and the others, means that the religion is not perfected by Allâh (the Glorious, the Almighty) for this <em>Ummah,</em> and the Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم did not impart to the people what was necessary regarding their religious duties, till these late ones appeared and invented in the religion what is not permitted by Allâh, thinking that this would bring them nearer to Allâh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Undoubtedly, this is a great danger and is tantamount to criticizing Allâh the Almighty and the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم ; whereas Allâh the Almighty has already completed the religion and perfected His Grace, and the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم has conveyed the Message openly and informed the <em>Ummah</em> of all such ways that will lead them to the Paradise and save them from Hell-fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to an authentic<em> Hadith,</em> on the authority of Abdullah bin Amr bin Al-Aas, Allâh&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; ما بعث الله من نبي إلا كان حقا عليه أن يدل أمته على خير ما يعلمه لهم وينذرهم شر ما يعلمه لهم &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allâh تعالى (the Almighty) did not send a Prophet but obliged him to lead his people to the best way which is known to him, and warn them against the worst which is known to him.&#8221; (Transmitted by<em> Muslim)</em><br />
It is well-known that our Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم is the best of all the Prophets, the last and the most perfect of them regarding the way he conveyed the Message and advised his people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Had the celebration of <em>Milâd</em> been an act of religion chosen by Allâh for His slaves, the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم would have either explained that to his people and would have celebrated it during his life, or his Companions would have done it. As these did not happen, it becomes clear that Islam has no concern with <em>Milâd.</em> On the contrary, it is one of the innovations against which the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم has warned his people as mentioned earlier.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A host of scholars have not only rejected the celebration of <em>Milâd</em> but have warned against it in view of the evidences given above.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to the rule of the Islamic <em>Shari&#8217;ah</em> all matters regarding legalization or prohibition and all disputes among the people, should be referred to the Book of Allâh and the <em>Sunnah </em>of His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم in line with the saying of Allâh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَطِيعُوا اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُوا الرَّسُولَ وَأُولِي الْأَمْرِ مِنْكُمْ فَإِنْ تَنَازَعْتُمْ فِي شَيْءٍ فَرُدُّوهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَالرَّسُولِ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ تُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ ذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ وَأَحْسَنُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O you who believe! Obey Allâh and obey the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم ), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority. (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allâh and His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم , if you believe in Allâh and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination.&#8221; (V .4:59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allâh the Almighty said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَمَا اخْتَلَفْتُمْ فِيهِ مِنْ شَيْءٍ فَحُكْمُهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And in whatsoever you differ, the decision thereof is with Allâh (He is the ruling Judge). (42:10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Referring this issue back to the Book of Allâh, we find it ordaining upon us to follow Allâh&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم in his commandments and warns us against whatever he prohibits. Furthermore it tells us that Allâh has perfected the religion for the people. So, as long as <em>Milâd</em> is not among the teachings of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم , it cannot be a part of the religion which Allâh has perfected for us and asked us to adhere to by following the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Again when we refer this issue back to the <em>Sunnah</em> of Allâh&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم , we do not find either the Prophet or the Companions doing it by themselves or asking others to do it. So it becomes evident that<em> Milâd,</em> is not a part of religion, rather one of innovations and blind imitation of the people of the Scripture, i.e. the Jews and the Christians in their festivals. With this argument in mind, it becomes crystal clear for everyone having the least insight and inclination towards truth and justice, that celebrating any birthday has nothing to do with Islam. It is rather among the innovations which Allâh and His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم warned against emphatically.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A wise man must not be deceived by seeing a large number of people doing it throughout the world because the truth is known and recognized by the evidences of<em> Shari&#8217;ah</em> and not by the acts of a great number of people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh تعالى (the Almighty) says regarding the Jews and the Christians:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَقَالُوا لَنْ يَدْخُلَ الْجَنَّةَ إِلَّا مَنْ كَانَ هُودًا أَوْ نَصَارَى تِلْكَ أَمَانِيُّهُمْ قُلْ هَاتُوا بُرْهَانَكُمْ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And they say, `None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian.&#8217; These are their own desires. Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم ): `Produce your proof if you are truthful.&#8221;&#8217; (V.2:111).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Almighty also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏وَإِنْ تُطِعْ أَكْثَرَ مَنْ فِي الْأَرْضِ يُضِلُّوكَ عَنْ سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ إِنْ يَتَّبِعُونَ إِلَّا الظَّنَّ وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلَّا يَخْرُصُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And if you obey most of those on earth, they will mislead you far away from Allâh&#8217;s path. They follow nothing but conjectures, and they do nothing but lie.&#8221; (V.6:116).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most of these innovations, in addition to their innovatory nature, also do not usually escape from a number of other evils, such as mixed gatherings of men and women, songs accompanied by musical instruments. drinking intoxicants, narcotics and the like. They may also involve the worst thing i. e. the greatest <em>Shirk,</em> through showing exaggeration in Allâh&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم and other saints and through praying to him, invoking his help or believing that he knows what is hidden and all similar claims which render a believer as an infidel. It is authentically reported that the Messenger of Allâh has said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; وإياكم والغلو في الدين فإنما أهلك من كان قبلكم &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Beware of extravagance in the religion: It has caused the people before you to perish&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; لا تطروني كما أطرت النصارى ابن مريم, إنما أنا عبد فقولوا عبد الله ورسوله &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Do not lavish praise on me as the Christians did with the son of Maryam. I am just a slave. So simply say: The slave of Allâh and His Messenger&#8221;. (Transmitted by <em>Bukhâri)</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is curious to note that a great many people participate most actively in these celebrations and defend them vehemently, while they sit back from attending the obligatory forms of worship such as daily and Friday prayers. They are not even ashamed of this, nor do they realize that they are committing a great evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Undoubtedly, this shows the weakness of their Faith, their short-sightedness, and the deeply ingrained rust on their hearts because of sins and disobedience. We ask Allâh&#8217;s protection for us and for all the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is even more astonishing to note that some people believe that Allâh&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم is present at <em>Milâd.</em> Consequently they stand to greet and welcome him. That is not only a sheer lie but a worst form of ignorance, as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم shall neither come out of his grave before the Day of Resurrection, nor shall he meet the people or attend their meetings. Instead, he shall remain in his grave till the Day of Resurrection while his soul rests at the highest of the high with his Lord in the most exalted and highest place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh تعالى (the Almighty) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏ثُمَّ إِنَّكُمْ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ لَمَيِّتُونَ. ‏ثُمَّ إِنَّكُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ تُبْعَثُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;After that, surely, you will die. Then (again), surely, you will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221; (V.23:15, 16).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; أنا أول من يشق عنه القبر يوم القيامة وأنا أول شافع وأول مُشَفَّع &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I am the first one to rise from the grave on the Resurrection Day and I will be the first intercessor and the first one whose intercession is to be accepted.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The aforesaid evidences from the Qur&#8217;ân and <em>Hadith</em> prove beyond doubt that the dead people will come out of their graves only on the Day of Resurrection. All the scholars of Islam agree upon this. A Muslim should be aware of these things and must not be easily misled by the innovations and the superstitions created by the ignorant people with no authority from Allâh at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for offering the blessings and greetings (<em>Salât</em> and <em>Salâm</em>) to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم , they are among the most preferred and virtuous deeds in accordance with the Saying of Allâh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏إِنَّ اللَّهَ وَمَلَائِكَتَهُ يُصَلُّونَ عَلَى النَّبِيِّ يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا صَلُّوا عَلَيْهِ وَسَلِّمُوا تَسْلِيمًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allâh sends His<em> Salat</em> (Graces, Honours, Blessings, Mercy, etc.) on the Prophet (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم ) and also His angels too (ask Allâh to bless and forgive him). O you who believe! Send your <em>Salat</em> on (ask Allâh to bless) him (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم ), and (you should) greet (salute) him with the Islamic way of greeting (salutation i.e.<em> As- Salâm-o-Alaikum)</em>.&#8221; (V.33:56).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم has said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; من صلى عليَّ واحدة صلى الله عليه عشرا &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whosoever sends blessings on me one time, Allâh sends blessings on him ten times&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is prescribed on all times, particularly at the end of each prayer. It is held obligatory at the last <em>Tashahhud</em> of each <em>Salât </em>(prayer) by most of the scholars. It is strongly required at a number of occasions such as immediately after <em>Adhân,</em> at the mention of the name of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم , during the day of Friday and the night preceding it, according to a host of <em>Ahâdith.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what I wanted to emphasize regarding this issue. I hope it will satisfy everyone whom Allâh has shown the light.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How sad it is to see some devoted Muslims, known for their strength of Faith and love for the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم organizing such innovatory celebrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let us ask such people: Tell us, if you belong to<em>Ahl-as-Sunnah</em> and follow the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم , whether he himself or one of his Companions or their Successors did this or is it no more than a blind-following of the enemies of Islam from among the Jews and the Christians and the like ؟</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The love of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم is not reflected by the celebration on his birthday, but by obeying him, believing in his teachings, keeping away from what he prohibited and by worshipping Allâh in the way he prescribed for us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also reflected through offering<em> Salat</em> and <em>Salâm</em> to him from time to time, particularly at the mention of his name and during prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Wahhabiyya,</em> as the writer tends to put it, are not new in rejecting all such innovations. Their creed is to hold fast to the Book of Allâh and the<em> Sunnah</em> of His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم ; to follow his footsteps and those of his rightly- guided Successors; to believe and practise what was propounded by the virtuous Predecessors and the <em>Imâms </em>of learning and guidance who were capable to issue religious injunction concerning the knowledge of Allâh, and His Attributes of perfection and dignity as shown in the Glorious Book and the authentic <em>Ahâdith</em> (traditions) of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and as wholeheartedly accepted by his Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Wahhabiyya</em> believe in them, the way they are reported without any alteration, personification, exemplifying or negation of such attributes. They stick to the way of the Successors and their followers from among the people of learning, Faith and piety. They believe that the foundation of the Faith is to bear witness that there is none to be worshipped except Allâh and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allâh. To them, this is the root of Faith and one of its most exalted branches as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They know in accordance with the consensus of the Muslims, that this root requires knowledge, acknowledgement and practice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It implies that none is to be worshipped except Allâh the Almighty, Who has no associates at all. It further implies the negation of worshipping any other except Him. It shows why jinn and mankind were created; why the Messengers were sent and why the Books were revealed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, <em>Ibâdah</em> (worship) is not only complete submission and love but also complete obedience and veneration as well. Islam is the only religion prescribed by Allâh and disseminated by the Prophets and nothing, except it, is acceptable to Allâh whether in the past or the present. The one who submits his will to Allâh as well as to someone else beside Him, is a <em>Mushrik</em> (polytheist). The same is true for the one who prays to Allâh and someone else beside Him. As for the one who does not submit to Him, he is arrogant concerning his duties towards his Creator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh, the Almighty says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِي كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَسُولًا أَنِ اُعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُوا الطَّاغُوتَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And verily, We have sent among every <em>Ummah</em> (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): &#8220;Worship Allâh (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from)<em> Tâghût</em> (all false deities etc. i.e. do not worship <em>Tâghût</em> besides Allâh).&#8221; (V.16:36).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus the creed of the <em>Wahhabiyya</em> is based upon fulfillment of witnessing that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allâh and completely abandoning all innovations, superstitions and whatever goes against the <em>Shari&#8217;ah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what Sheikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab رحمه الله believed and invited others to believe. Whoever accredits to him anything contrary to it, does not only lie but commits a great sin and claims what is totally unfounded. He will, no doubt, receive what Allâh has promised to all the fabricators of lies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh has shown &#8211; through a series of his well-known treatises and scholarly books on the topic of the &#8220;Declaration of Oneness: <em>La ilaha illAllâh&#8221; &#8211;</em> that no one deserves worship except Allâh the Almighty, and that this type of worship should be devoid of all sorts of <em>Shirk</em> whether big or small. Anyone who is aware of these writings, his way of preaching and calling people to Allâh and of the way of his pupils and disciples, can easily find out that his approach was not different from that of our virtuous Predecessors, the great Imâms of learning and guidance. Indeed, he has propounded what they did throughout their lives concerning the worship of Allâh Alone and leaving all innovations and superstitions aside.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the foundation of the Saudi regime and this view is held by the scholars of Saudi Arabia . The hard attitude shown by the Saudi government is directed only against the superstitions and innovations in contradiction with Islam, or the extreme type of extravagance which is totally prohibited by the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم . All Muslims, scholars and rulers of Saudi Arabia hold great respect and love for every Muslim regardless of his affiliation to any group or country in the world. They do reject all types of celebrations or gatherings which are based on innovation, with no authority from Allâh or His Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم .<br />
They oppose them because every new matter in the religion is an innovation and because the Muslims are commanded to follow, not to innovate. Islam is perfect and complete by itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is in no need of any addition after what Allâh and His Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم have ordained and what the <em>Ahl-as-Sunnah wal-Jamâ&#8217;ah,</em> from among the Companions, the Successors and their followers have already received. To forbid celebrating the birthday of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم due to its innovative nature in addition to the signs of extravagance and <em>Shirk</em> normally associated with it, is not un-Islamic or derogatory to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم . Instead, it is an act of obedience as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم himself said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; إياكم والغلو في الدين فإنما أهلك من كان قبلكم الغلو في الدين &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Beware of the extravagance in matters of religion. Those before you have perished because of extravagance in the matters of religion&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Again he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; لا تطروني كما أطرت النصارى ابن مريم, إنما أنا عبد فقولوا عبد الله ورسوله &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Do not lavish praise on me as the Christians did with the son of Maryam. I am but a slave. So simply say: `Slave of Allâh and His Messenger.&#8221;&#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what I wanted to point out regarding the aforesaid article.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allâh help us and all the Muslims to understand His religion, to continually confirm us on it, stick to Sunnah and keep away from the innovation. Indeed He is Generous and Kind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And may Allâh shower His blessings and mercy upon our Prophet Muhammad, his posterity and his Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah Magazine, Issue No.6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE BASIS OF RIGHT GUIDANCE</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) &#8211; <i>rahimahallaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Religion of the Muslims is built upon following the Book of Allaah, the Sunnah of His Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, and that which the Ummah has agreed upon. So these are the three infallible <i>usool</i> (fundamentals). So whatever the Ummah differs in, then it is referred back to Allaah and His Messenger. Thus, it is not for anyone to set-up a person for the Ummah, and to call to his way, and form <i>walaa</i> (love, loyalty and allegiance) and <i>&#8216;adaa</i> (enmity and hatred) based upon that, except for the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. Nor is any speech set-up for them based upon which they form <i>walaa</i> and <i>&#8216;adaa</i>, except for the speech of Allaah, and that of His Messenger, and that which the Ummah has agreed upon. Rather, this is the practice of the people of Innovation, who set-up a person, or a saying, with which they cause splits in the Ummah; forming <i>walaa</i> or<i> &#8216;adaa</i> based upon that saying or ascription.&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Taymiyyah &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; also said:<br />
&#8220;It is not for anyone to ascribe himself to a particular Shaykh and to have <i>walaa</i> with those who follow him, or to have <i>&#8216;adaa</i> based upon that. Rather, he should have <i>walaa</i> for everyone who is from the people of <i>eemaan</i> (i.e. is a Muslim) and is known to have <i>taqwaa</i> (piety and obedience to Allaah in that which He has ordered and prohibited), from the Shaykhs, or from others. No one should be particularised with an increase in <i>walaa</i> except if he sees from him greater <i>eemaan</i> and <i>taqwaa</i>. So precedence and excellence is given to whomsoever Allaah and His Messenger have given them to. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;O mankind! Indeed We created you from a man and a woman, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Indeed the most noblest of you with Allaah are those that have the most <i>taqwaa</i> (piety).&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Hujuraat 49:13].&#8221;2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>SECTARIANISM AND MISPLACED LOYALTIES</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah said:<br />
&#8220;Indeed the people of the truth and the Sunnah do not follow anyone (unconditionally) other than Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>; who does not speak from his desires, rather it is nothing less than Revelation sent down to him. So it is obligatory to affirm all that he informs, and to obey all that he commands. This status is not given to anyone else from this Ummah. Rather, every person&#8217;s saying can be taken or left, except that of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. So whoever sets up an individual other than Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, such that the one who loves and agrees with him is reckoned to be from <i>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah</i>, and the one that differs with him is reckoned to be from the people of innovations and sectarianism &#8211; as happens with those groups who follow certain Imaams of <i>kalaam</i> (theology and rhetorical speech) &#8211; then the person doing so is from the people of innovation, deviation and sectarianism.&#8221;3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; further said:<br />
&#8220;Indeed many &#8211; from the people who say such sayings &#8211; follow their desires in this, in order to elevate their egos, or to gain leadership; or whatever is connected to it. Their intention is not to make the word of Allaah uppermost, nor is it to make the Religion purely for Allaah. Indeed, they have hatred for those who oppose them &#8211; even if it is a <i>mujtahid</i> (a Scholar striving his utmost to arrive at the truth) who is excused, and whom Allaah is not angry with. Likewise, they are pleased with those who agree with them &#8211; even if it is an ignorant person with evil intentions, who neither has any knowledge, nor good intent. This leads them to praise those whom Allaah and His Messenger have not praised, and to censure those whom Allaah and His Messenger have not censured. It also causes them to have <i>walaa</i> (love and allegiance) and <i>&#8216;adaa</i> (enmity and hatred) based upon their own self-desires, not upon the Religion of Allaah and His Messenger &#8230; So whosoever does this will only bring about <i>fitan</i> (trials and discord) between the people.&#8221;4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>PRESERVING THE LOVE AND UNITY</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez bin Baaz &#8211; <i>hafidhahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Religion of Allaah orders to judge (with justice) in all matters, and not to have <i>walaa</i> (love, loyalty and allegiance) with your brother merely because he agrees with you, or to have <i>&#8216;adaa</i> (enmity and being distant) from him merely because he disagrees with you on a certain opinion or issue. This is not from justice at all! The Companions &#8211; <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhum</i> &#8211; differed in various issues, yet this did not affect the happiness and sincerity between them, nor their <i>walaa</i> and love for each other &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with them all. So the Believer acts upon the <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i> (Prescribed and Divine Islaamic Law) of Allaah, follows the truth, gives priority to the evidences before anyone &#8211; yet in doing so, he does not oppress his brother, nor negate doing justice to him when he differs regarding any issue of <i>ijtihaad</i> in which the evidences are not so apparent. Likewise is the case for those issues in which differences occur due to a different interpretation of the text. So, in such instances he is excused, and it is upon you to sincerely advice him, and to love only the good for him, and not to split-up, nor to have enmity and hatred between you and your brother &#8211; and there is no might, nor any power, except with Allaah. &#8220;5</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">TAMAAM-UL-MINNAH’<br />
Translated by Dawud Burbank (rahimahullaah)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many writers – especially in the present age – despite their differing madhabs and specialities – are in the habit of quoting Ahaadeeth attributed to the Prophet (s.a.w.s) – without declaring those which are weak there from, out of ignorance of the Sunnah, or desiring that, or being too lazy to refer back to the books of the experts in that field – and some of those experts are lenient in that about narrating Ahaadeeth about excellent actions. Aboo Shaamah said [‘al-Baa’ith ‘alaa Inkaar il-Bida’ wal-Hawaadith’ p.54] :<strong>&#8221; And this is with the verifiers of the scholars of Ahaadeeth and with the scholars of Usool and Fiqh a mistake, rather they should make its status clear if known – and if not then that will fall under the threat in his (s.a.w.s) saying : &#8221; He who narrates from me a saying which he thinks is a lie, then he is one of them. &#8221; Reported by Muslim. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the ruling for one who remains silent about weak Ahaadeeth concerning excellent actions!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then how about that which concerns rulings and its like?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And know that this done by one of two men : &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) Either he knows the weakness of those Ahaadeeth and he does not indicate their weakness – then he does not indicate their weakness – then he is one who deceives the Muslims, definitely entering under the aforementioned threat – as Ibn Hibbaan says in his book ‘Ad-Du’afaa’ (1/7-8).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; In this narration is a proof that if the Muhaddith narrates something which is not         authentic from the Prophet (s.a.w.s) from what is attributed to him incorrectly and he knows that – then he is like one of the liars – and the text of the narration is even stronger than that, he (s.a.w.s) said : <strong> &#8221; He who narrates Ahaadeeth form me and he thinks it is a lie.. &#8220;</strong>and he did not say : <strong> &#8221; Which he is sure is a lie&#8221;,</strong> so everyone who doubts about what he narrates whether it is authentic or not – then he falls under the address of that narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Ibn ‘Abdul-Haadee quotes this in ‘as-saamirul-munkee’ (p.165-166) and agrees to it, or that he does not know that is it weak &#8211; and he is also sinful due to his taking it upon himself to attribute it to the Prophet (s.a.w.s) without knowledge, and he (s.a.w.s) said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8221; It is enough falsehood for a person that he narrates everything which he hears&#8221; [Reported by Muslim in the introduction of his ‘saheeh’ see ‘as-saheehah, no. 205]. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he has his share of the sin lying upon the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.s), since he (s.a.w.s) indicated that he who narrates everything which he hears &#8211; and like him is the one who writes is – falls for certain into lying upon him – and therefore he is one of the liars. Firstly – the one who invented it,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and secondly this one who spread it! And Ibn Hibbaan also said (1/9) :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8221; And this narration contains a strong warning against a person’s narrating everything which he hears until he knows for certain that it is authentic.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And an-Nawawee clearly states that the one who does not know whether Ahaadeeth is weak or not then it is not permissible for him to use it as a proof without researching and checking it if he knows how – or by asking the people of knowledge if he does not know. And refer to the preface of ‘ad-Da’eefah’ (pp.10-12 ).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Compiled by The Eminent Shaykh, the Muhaddith, Rabee’ ibn Haadee al-Madkhalee<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the place which is enlightened by the Book and the Sunnah in the Islaamic world is the place of the People of Hadeeth, as-Salafiyoon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the place which is darkened in the Islaamic world is the place of the People of Bida’ and misguidance, those who oppose the people of Hadeeth and wage war against them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the present day political groups – who have among them Ikhwaan Muslimoon and their likes – and the deviant sects – who have among them Jamaat Tabligh – want this darkness to remain in dominance over the Islaamic world and to cover it, they do not even move against it. They have no intention of eliminating it and they have no Manhaj (methodology) to direct them to its removal or to establish Tawheed and the light of the Book and the Sunnah, taking its place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they guard this darkness &#8211; especially the darkness of the Rafidah and Soofeeyah- with the justification that they are combating the enemies of Islaam, although they definitely do not do this. Their justification is that they say, ‘We cooperate in what we agree upon and overlook what we differ upon,’ which they justify further with their claim that they gather the Muslims together along with the Rawafidah and the extreme Soofees in order to confront the enemies of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, they wage war against the people of Hadeeth, placing different obstacles and hindrances in front of them which then prevent the people from being enlightened by that which the People of Hadeeth have of the light of Tawheed and the light of the Book, the Sunnah and the Manhaj of the Salaf-as-Saalih.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How long will the defence of this darkness subjected upon the Ummah continue?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When will the Muslims see this light?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qayyim -Rahimullaah- said, quoting as-Samaanee -Rahimullaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Every sect from the people of Bida’ claims that they adhere to the Sharia’ of Islaam and that the truth the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- established is what they believe in and profess. However, Allah has denied them that as the truth and correct ‘Aqeedah will only be with the People of Hadeeth and Athaar because they successively took their Deen and beliefs with from those who preceded them, generation by generation, until they reached the Tabi’een.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Tabi’een took it from the Companions of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam and the Companions took it from the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no way of knowing what the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- called the people to, of the straight path, except by way of what the People of Hadeeth followed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What shows that the People of Hadeeth are upon the truth is that if you were to research all the books authored by them, from the first to the last, the oldest to the newest, you would find &#8211; despite the fact that they are from different countries and time periods with vast distances between their lands, each of them living in their own regions- that in the matter of belief they are on one path, they flow in one direction following that path and they do not diverge from it, nor do they deviate from it. Their hearts are one heart; you do not see any differing in what they narrated nor any divisions or differing in any issue, no matter how small it may be.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, if everything they uttered with their tongues and what they narrated from the Salaf were gathered you would find it as though it had come from one heart and spoken by one tongue. So is there any evidence clearer than this to show the truth?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Do they not then consider the Qur’aan carefully? Had it been from other than Allaah, they would surely have found therein much contradiction. &gt;&gt; [Nisa:82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And hold fast, all of you together, to the Rope of Allaah (i.e. this Qur’aan), and be not divided among yourselves, and remember Allaah’s Favour on you, for you were enemies one to another but He joined your hearts together, so that, by His Grace, you became brethren (in Islaamic Faith)&gt;&gt; [Aali-Imraan: 103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason that the people of Hadeeth are united is because they take their Deen and method of narration from the Book and the Sunnah and so, they inherit unity and harmony.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of Bida’ took the Deen from their intellects so they inherited separation and differences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed conveying and narrating from trustworthy, precise narrators ensures that differences are rare and if there were a difference it would be in a single word or the wording of a narration. This differing does not harm the Deen, not does it belittle it. As for following intellects and desires, ideas and opinions, they rarely bring unity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have seen that the Companions of Hadeeth, past and present, are those who travelled for these Aathaar. They sought them and took from their sources, they memorized them and became delighted by them, they called to following these narrations and they rebuked those who opposed them. They had numerous narrations between them such that they became famous due to them, just as a craftsman becomes famous because of his skill and what he produces.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then we saw a people who became disconnected from their memorization and knowledge and deviated from following the well-known, authentic narrations. They absolved themselves from the companionship of its people and attacked the narrations and their people. These people abandoned the rights due to this knowledge, they ascribed evil examples to it and to the people of hadeeth, giving them the vilest of descriptions. So, they called them Nawasib (haters of the family of the Prophet), Mushabiha (those who compare Allaah to the creation), Hashaweeyah (those who busy themselves with things of no benefit) or Mujjassama (those who ascribe a physical body to Allaah). So we came to know, from the correct proofs and supporting evidences, that the people of hadeeth have more right to it (i.e. the knowledge of hadeeth/narrations) than the rest of the sects.’ [Mukhtasir as-Sawaaiq pg 423-429]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The new opponents of the People of Hadeeth continually repeat the attacks that the communist, laymen and Baaith party (a political party with strong socialist tendencies) use against their opponents from amongst the Muslims and other than them, attacking with such statements as, ‘they are spies,’ ‘working for America,’ ‘ scholars of the royal courts’ or ‘scholars who want meals.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah for guidance that everyone returns to the truth, turning away from falsehood and departing from the darkness of Bida’.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Nasirud-Din al-Albani<span style="line-height:1.5em;"> &#8211; al-Hijra magazine (vol.4 no.2)<br />
</span>Al-Ibaanah Magazine Issue No.1 &#8211; Dhul-Qa’dah 1415H / April 1995</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>What Benefits the Dead</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abû Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> “The likeness of wealth, family and the actions of the son of Âdam is of a man who has three companions. One of the man’s companions says: I am with you as long as you live; when you die, you have taken your share of yourself and you have taken your share of me &#8211; this is his wealth. The second companion says: I am with you until you reach that tree; you have had your share of yourself and your share of me &#8211; this is his family. The third companion says: I am with you in life and in death.”</i> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above authentic hadîth is in fact like the following hadîth in meaning and in subject matter. Anas said that the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> “The dead person is followed (to his grave) by three: His family, his wealth and his actions. Two of them return and only one remains. His family and wealth return, but his actions remain.”</i> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These two ahâdîth show that actions alone endure and enter the grave with their doers. Both these ahâdîth also affirm the fact that anything other than actions &#8211; such as wealth, servants or relatives &#8211; are of no benefit at all. Rather, they all return (to this world). His wealth becomes the property of his inheritor, whilst his relatives and family do not grant him anything from Allâh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These ahâdîth intend to direct Muslims to be concerned with actions which will stay with them forever; and not to strive for wealth and position for the sake of relatives, family and servants. Apparently, the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> wanted to show us the value of good actions when he related these ahâdîth to us, (which can be found) in the books of <i>Zuhd</i> (renouncement of the world). He pointed out to us that because actions will last rather than wealth, you have to make your actions righteous. Part of making ones actions righteous is through good wealth that is earned lawfully and spent in a good manner. Then one gains the rewards of <i>’amalus-sâlih</i> (a righteous action).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Acceptable Action</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, in these ahâdîth, the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> encouraged us to make our actions righteous, whether gaining wealth or other things. However, we must remember a certain fact about this action, a fact that many people neglect. The explanation of this fact should actually be a complete lesson in itself; and it is that only a <i>righteous action</i> is beneficial, not just any action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what are the conditions that a Muslim must fulfill in order for the action to be righteous? This is shown in the statement of Allâh &#8211; <i>the Exalted and Sublime</i>: <b>“Say (O Muhammad): Verily I am only a man like yourselves, but revelation has been revealed to me that the One whom you should worship is only One Deity. And whoever hopes to meet his Lord, let him do righteous actions; and in the worship of your Lord, do not associate anyone along with Him.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Two Important Conditions</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Scholars of <i>Tafsîr</i> have said that the end of this verse is an indication that there are two conditions for an action to be righteous and acceptable: [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>Firstly</i></b>: That the action must be in accordance with the Sunnah. Therefore, if the action is done as an act of worship, but is not in accordance with the Sunnah, it is not a righteous action. The reason is that compliance with the Sunnah is one of the conditions for the action’s righteousness. The proofs of this are many, but it is enough to state one: The hadîth of the Prophet <i>sallallâhu </i> <i>’alayhi wa sallam</i> in which he said: <i> “Whoever innovates in this matter of ours what is not upon it, it shall be rejected.” </i>[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, any action that was not part of Islâm when Allâh revealed it upon the heart of the Prophet Muhammad <i>sallallâhu </i> <i>’alayhi wa sallam</i> is not a righteous action. About this, Allâh &#8211; the Most High &#8211; says: <b> “This day I have perfected your Dîn for you and completed My favour upon you and I have chosen Islâm as your Dîn.”</b> [7] It must be remembered that <i>Bid’ah</i> (innovation) [8] is not divided into five categories, as some Scholars say. A proof for this is that the Prophet <i>sallallâhu </i> <i>’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> “Every innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance is in the Hellfire.”</i> [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>Secondly</i></b>: That after being in accordance with the Sunnah, the action has to be sincere, purely seeking the Face of Allâh &#8211; <i>the Most High</i> &#8211; because Allâh says at the end of the aforementioned verse: <b> “And in the worship of your Lord, do not associate anyone along with Him.”</b> This means that the person seeks, by his righteous action, only the Face of Allâh &#8211; <i> the Exalted and Sublime</i>. However, if he seeks other than Allâh, then he has setup partners with Allâh (made shirk with Allâh), therefore his action is rejected.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is confirmed by Allâh in an authentic hadîth Qudsî: <i>“I am so self-sufficient that I am in no need of having any partners. Thus, whosoever does an action for the sake of someone else as well as Me, will have that action rejected by Me, to him whom he associated with Me.” </i>[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consequently, if the action is righteous but not sincere for the sake of Allâh’s Face, it is rejected. Moreover, if the action is purely for the sake of Allâh’s Face, but not in accordance with the Sunnah, it is likewise not accepted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Worthless and Sinful Action</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these arc the two conditions for every action to be a righteous action. If one of these conditions is not present, the action does not become a righteous action, rather, it becomes an evil one. Had the person not done this action, it would have been better for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a man prays two <i> rak’ât </i> of prayer at night, while others sleep, then even if he prays them according to the Sunnah &#8211; without addition or deletion &#8211; but he does this so that people may talk about him and say: “This Person is a righteous man. He prays at night when the people are asleep,” then his action becomes <i> bâtil</i> (null and void), since he did not sincerely seek the Face of Allâh alone, but rather he sought the praises of people, thus becoming sinful by associating partners with Allâh in his action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if his action only became null and void, then the following hadîth would apply to him; and he would not be punished for this action: <i>“How many fasting people obtain nothing from their fasting except hunger and thirst. And how many people who stay up at night (praying), obtain nothing from their being awake except sleeplessness and tiredness.”</i> [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But this is not the case, for this person’s action has changed into a sin. The two <i> rak’ât</i> that this person performed without intending to seek only the Face of Allâh &#8211; <i>the Exalted and Sublime</i> &#8211; are the same as if he had disobeyed Him, that is to say: He will be punished for these two <i> rak’ât </i> because he associated others along with Allâh &#8211; <i> the Exalted and Sublime</i> &#8211; in his action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a man prays eleven <i> rak’ât</i> at night with the intention, in this worship, that his brothers would say about him: “This man is correctly following the Prophet; he does not add to the Sunnah,” his action becomes null and void; and his action changes to a sin against him. Rather, he must pray according to the Sunnah but sincerely seeking only the Face of Allâh &#8211; the Most High. He must be absolutely free of seeking the pleasure of others along with Him in this worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This has been but a summary about the action that does not leave the person but enters the grave with him &#8211; whether the action was good or bad &#8211; and that what is of benefit is the person’s righteous action. What is a righteous action and what are its conditions? The two conditions are:- <i><b>Muwwâfaqah</b></i> (compliance) with the Sunnah; and <i><b>Ikhlâs</b></i> (sincerity and purity of intention) to Allâh. Therefore, one must remember these two conditions and act upon them so that one may become righteous and pious.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Safeguarding against Insincerity</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many people unfortunately neglect the first condition (complying with the Sunnah) because they are astray and believe that <i> bid’ah</i> (innovation) is good in the religion.[12] But there are those upon whom Allâh has granted His favour, by guiding them to the Sunnah of the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>. They are those who know the reality of this condition and adhere to it the best they can. Yet they must pay attention to the second condition, which either group may fail to fulfill, and that is <i>riyâ’</i> (insincerity and showing-off). No one is exempt from <i>riyâ’</i> and all people are susceptible to it in their actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This matter is a very serious one and must be stressed here, so that we may know that we are in need of making our actions correct and purely for the Face of Allâh &#8211; <i> the Exalted and Sublime</i>. Part of this is that we are tested even while making <i> Da’wah</i> to the Qur‘ân and the Sunnah, for trials are not only in evil matters, but also in the good matters:<b> “And We test you with evil and good, by way of <i>fitnah</i> (trial).”</b> [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <i>da’wah</i> has been neglected by Muslims throughout the world so that the <i>du’ât</i> (the callers) have become strangers. Not only are they strangers in foreign countries, but they are strangers even in their own countries; amongst their relatives and brothers. This makes them praiseworthy, but they must not stand up to be praised for this <i>da’wah</i>. This is the reality, for the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>“Verily Islâm started as something strange and it will return as something strange, so Tûbâ is for the Strangers.”</i> [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Tûbâ and the Strangers</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of <i>Tûbâ</i> in the Arabic language is: “Praise and thanks.” The meaning according to the <i>Sharî’ah</i> refers to a tree in Paradise, which would take a rider a hundred years to traverse its shade. [15] This hadîth gives glad tidings to the newcomers of Paradise in which there is: <i>“What no eye has never seen, no ear has ever heard, and no heart has ever imagined.”</i> [16] This tree is mentioned in the Qur’ân in the statement of Allâh: <b>“<i>Tûbâ</i> is for them, and the best abode.”</b> [17] Therefore, <i>Tûbâ</i> is for the Ghurabâ (the Strangers), but who are they? The answer to this is in the reply of the Prophet: <i>“Those who correct [themselves and others], when the people have become corrupt.”</i> [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Need for Care</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These Strangers call the people to the revival of the Sunnah and eradication of all that differs from it. However, they must still pay attention to the second condition of the righteous action: To be sincere in their <i>da’wah</i>. They must neither seek fame, pride, nor arguments from their <i>da’wah</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They must not seek anything that <i>an-Nafs ul-Amârata bis-Sû’</i> (the soul that calls them to evil) orders them to do. Whatever they call to is as a result of Allâh &#8211; <i>the Most High </i> &#8211; having ordered them to make <i> da’wah</i> to the Qur’ân and the Sunnah and to make<i> da’wah</i> to what the Muslims have neglected. They must take care of this <i>da’wah</i>. However, they stand in danger. It can happen that one may say a word seeking only to have fingers of praise pointed at him, not sincerely advising the people and desiring to guide them. Rather, to do that for fame.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here we mention a saying of some <i>Sûfîs</i>, who have some wise sayings that can not be denied: “The love of fame breaks backs.” Therefore, I insist, that we who make <i> Da’wah</i> to the Sunnah be sincere in our actions so that when our actions enter the grave with us, it will help us to answer correctly when we are asked: “Who is your Lord? Who is your Prophet? What is your religion?” If the deed is evil, when the person enters the grave, he will deny it. His deed will come to him in the worst of forms. He will ask it: “Who are you?” It will say: “I am your deed.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Wealth &#8211; its Reality and Purpose</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The next Hadîth is also authentic. Abû Hurayrah said that the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>“The servant says: My wealth! My wealth! However, he gets from his wealth three things: What he eats and finishes. What he wears and makes shabby; and what he gives away and pleases others with. Whatever else is besides this, goes and is left for the people.”</i> [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Hadîth also emphasises the subject of the previous ahâdîth. It shows us the care taken by people in amassing wealth. Allâh pointed this out in the Qur‘ân by His statement: <b>“And for the love of good he is strong.”</b> [20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet depicted the nature of mankind for us in his saying: <i>“The servant says: My wealth! My wealth!”</i> Nevertheless, what is the amount that remains left over for him from his wealth? Is all his wealth for him? No! He gains from his wealth only the examples that the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> specified. The first is defined by the Prophet’s statement: <i>“What he eats and finishes.”</i> From his wealth is that which is necessary for him to survive and that which enables him to accomplish the rights of Allâh. These rights are the rights of His <i> Tawhîd</i> (singling out Allâh alone for worship), as Allâh said: <b> “And I have not created the jinn and mankind except to worship Me.”</b> [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second is what a person wears until it becomes shabby. Add to this that which he volunteers and does good with, which is mentioned in the statement of the Prophet: <i>“Or what he gives away and pleases others with.”</i> He got rid of his wealth by giving it away to another in charity. Therefore, the wealth that is for the servant is the amount that he eats and the amount that he wears in order to survive. However this is not an end in itself. Rather, one exists solely to accomplish the obligation of worship, as we pointed out previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third kind of wealth that returns with a benefit is not only the obligatory charity, but it also includes non-obligatory charities. Then the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> explained what is left after these categories. He said: <i>“And other than that is gone, and is left, for the people.”</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The relation of this Hadîth with the previous one is: Why do people exhaust themselves in amassing wealth, when this is the reality of wealth? They do not benefit from there wealth except the amount that they eat, drink and with which they help other people. All else will be left and it will remain for the people who inherit it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following Hadîth is also <i>Sahîh</i> (authentic). Abdullâh ibn ash-Shikhkhîr said: I came to the Prophet whilst he was reciting: <b>“Seeking increase diverted you.” </b> The Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said:<i> “The son of Âdam say My wealth! My wealth! What do you obtain, O son of Âdam, from your wealth except that which you eat and consume, or wear until it becomes shabby, or what you give as charity and accomplish.”</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadîth is also similar in meaning to the previous one, though some of its words are different; and was recorded by Muslim, at-Tirmidhî and an-Nasâ‘î. This hadîth is clear in its wording, however, the statement of the Prophet at the end of the hadîth: <i>“or what you give as charity and accomplish.”</i> may not be clear to some people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Generosity and Miserliness</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This statement aims at drawing one’s attention to the fact that what is intended for charity is that which he actually gives away. It is not sufficient that a person should just make out a will, that he should give such and such to the poor, or such and such for a specific masjid. However, the Prophet calls our attention to the fact that benefit is in that wealth which a person actually gave away during his lifetime, since he did not really know what would happen with his wealth after he died, if he had made a will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">with this word, the Prophet points to a hadîth in the <i> Sahîh</i> of al-Bukhârî &#8211; the meaning of which is that the miser is one who when death comes to him makes a will and says: “Give so and so such amount and for so and so such and such amount.” The Prophet said: <i>“This was already for so and so and so and so.”</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> meant was that the deceased did not own anything anymore. He had left this <i>dunya</i> (life of this world ) and had entered into the <i>Âkhirah</i> (the Hereafter) and his inheritance will remain for those people who are still alive. Then should not the person have made his will earlier? Should he not have given charity whilst he was strong, hoping to be rich and fearing poverty?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the nature of the people today, they say: “Hoard your white Dirham for your black day.” They hoard this money for themselves for when they become old. They are covetous of this wealth. The generous person is the one who gives away his own wealth when his own soul is attached to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who is on the brink of death and who says: “Give so and so such and such amount,” he is a miser and is not generous. Rather, a truly generous person is one who gives charity whilst he holds onto his life and also whilst he loves this wealth very much.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Insignificance of this World</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The next hadîth is narrated by Jâbir ibn ’Abdullâh: The Messenger of Allâh <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> passed by the market place coming from the direction of ‘Âliyah and people were around him. He passed by a dead kid goat (i.e. a baby goat) which had very short ears. He held it by its ears and said: <i>“Who amongst you would like to have this for a dirham?”</i> They (the Companions) said: We would not want it even for less than that! What can we do with it? He said: <i>“Do you wish to have it (for any price)?”</i> They said: By Allâh, even if it were alive it (we would not want it), as it has very short ears, let alone now when it is also dead! The Messenger of Allâh <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> “By Allâh, this world is more insignificant to Allâh than this (goat) is to you all.”</i> [23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let us return to the hadîth. He passed by the market place <i> “and the people were around him.”</i> Here I would like to pause a little in order to remind people about some of the guidance of the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> that most of the Shaykhs of today have neglected.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykhs of today walk with their students behind them. This was not the way of the Messenger of Allâh <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>. The ahâdîth describing this are many and the following is from them: “He used to walk side by side with Abû Bakr and side by side with Abû Hurayrah; and they all walked with each other.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, it is authentically proven that the Messenger of Allâh <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> used to say to his Companions <i>radiallâhu ’anhum</i>, when he used to walk with them: <i> “Walk in<br />
front of me and leave my back for the angels.”</i> [24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here he highlights two matters from one saying. People do not see angels, they see only people. Therefore, if anyone saw the Messenger <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> walking, they would only see people walking in front of him. The Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said in the authentic hadîth: <i> “He who humbles himself for the sake of Allâh, Allâh will raise him.” </i>[25] His humbleness raised him to a degree whereby the angels walked behind him. Therefore, is a noble person one behind whom people &#8211; good or bad &#8211; walk; or is he the one who is followed by those described by Allâh in the following verse: <b> “They do not disobey what Allâh ordered them to do and do precisely what they are commanded.”</b> The nobility of the Prophet manifested itself in a visible and an invisible side. The visible side is that the Companions used to walk in front of the Prophet and not behind him. The invisible side is that the angels walked behind him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Of course, the first phenomenon is the one in which we are ordered not to act proudly with our companions and our brothers in faith, even those who may be less than us in knowledge, morals, worship and righteousness. This is enough for us, because Allâh says: “Do not sanctify yourself. He knows best the ones who are pious.” [26] It is sufficient for us at least, to walk with people side by side. Whosoever intentionally goes against this Sunnah, without doubt, does not truly love the Messenger of Allâh <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>. This is because one’s degree of love from him, is based upon following him. This is established in the Qur’ân by the statement of Allâh: <b> “Say (O Muhammad): If you do love Allâh then follow me; Allâh will love you and forgive you your sins.”</b> [27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if this was the case with the Prophet who was infallible and protected from the whispering of the <i>Shaytân</i> and this was an indication of the level with his Companions, then what can we say about ourselves? We are not infallible and are not protected from the <i>Shaytân</i>. We must adhere to this Sunnah as if it were obligatory. It is better for us to walk with people around us than to walk looking with our eyes at the backs of their shoulders. The statement of the Prophet, at the end of the hadîth: <i>“By Allâh, this world is more insignificant to Allâh than this (goat) is to you all,”</i> is to be reflected upon by people of intellect!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The next authentic hadîth is similar to the previous hadîth. Ibn ’Abbâs said: The Prophet passed by a dead goat that had been thrown away by its owners. He said: <i>“By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, this world is more insignificant to Allâh than this is to its owner.”</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sahl ibn Sa’d said that the Messenger of Allâh <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>“If this world was worth as much to Allâh as the wing of a mosquito, He would not have given a disbeliever even a sip of water.” </i>[28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Salmân said: Some people came to the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> and he asked them: <i>“Do you have food?”</i> They said: Yes. He asked: <i>“Do you have drink?”</i> They said: Yes. He said: <i>“Verily their outcome is like the outcome of this world, one of you stands behind his house holding his nose from their bad smell.”</i> This is the similitude of this world. What is the eventual outcome of food and drink? They change to stool and urine. Therefore, a person hates the smell for himself. This is the similitude of the outcome of this World.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following hadîth has the same meaning. Ubayy ibn Ka’b said that the Messenger of Allâh <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>“Indeed the food of the son of Âdam is like the example of the world. Even if he puts spices and season into it, see what becomes of it.” </i>[29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is the eventual outcome of spices and seasoning in his food? Look at what it becomes! Likewise, this world becomes a similar thing except that which is for Allâh. The next hadîth explains this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abû Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> “The world and all that it contains is cursed, except for the remembrance of Allâh and what supports it; or a Scholar and a student.” </i>[30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>In Conclusion</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the reality of this world in the <i> Sharî’ah</i>, it has no value. The similitude of this world is like good food and drink: its outcome is decay. The exceptions arc those things which are done for Allâh whether remembrance of Allâh, knowledge or even food because it helps to support the worship of Allâh. These things are among the deeds of man that endure in this fleeting life. The goal behind these <i> ahâdîth</i> is that a person should not be overly concerned about this world, except with which is sufficient to keep him alive and strong; and sufficient enough to be able to accomplish the worship of his Lord. For if his wealth is greater than this, it will only benefit him by the amount of good that he does by helping others; otherwise, he is going to leave this wealth behind and it will not benefit him at all. However, what will benefit him are the righteous actions that he has done.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allâh not to put love of this world in our hearts, but to guide us to earn in this life what helps us to worship and obey Him. And all praise is for Allâh, Lord of the Worlds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Tafseer Ibn Kathir &#8211; Surah 3 : Ale Imraan :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(31. Say (O Muhammad to mankind): &#8220;If you (really) love Allah, then follow me (i.e. Muhammad), Allah will love you and forgive you your sins. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221;) (32. Say: &#8220;Obey Allah and the Messenger.&#8221; But if they turn away, then Allah does not like the disbelievers.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This honorable Ayah judges against those who claim to love Allah, yet do not follow the way of Muhammad . Such people are not true in their claim until they follow the Shari`ah (Law) of Muhammad and his religion in all his statements, actions and conditions. It is recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Whoever commits an act that does not conform with our matter (religion), then it will be rejected of him.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why Allah said here,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say (O Muhammad to mankind): &#8220;If you (really) love Allah, then follow me, Allah will love you&#8230;&#8221;) meaning, what you will earn is much more than what you sought in loving Him, for Allah will love you. Al-Hasan Al-Basri and several scholars among the Salaf commented, &#8220;Some people claimed that they love Allah. So Allah tested them with this Ayah;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say (O Muhammad to mankind): &#8220;If you (really) love Allah, then follow me, Allah will love you&#8230;&#8221;). &#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;And forgive you your sins. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221;) meaning, by your following the Messenger , you will earn all this with the blessing of his mission. Allah next commands everyone,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say: &#8220;Obey Allah and the Messenger.&#8221; But if they turn away) by defying the Prophet ,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(then Allah does not like the disbelievers.) thus, testifying that defiance of the Messenger&#8217;s way constitutes Kufr. Indeed, Allah does not like whoever does this, even if he claims that he loves Allah and seeks a means of approach to Him, unless, and until, he follows the unlettered Prophet, the Final Messenger from Allah to the two creations: mankind and the Jinn. This is the Prophet who, if the previous Prophets and mighty Messengers were to have been alive during his time, they would have no choice but to follow, obey him, and to abide by his Law.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ahmad as-Subay&#8217;ee</strong> حفظه الله said in a Friday sermon delivered at the Salafi Masjid in Birmingham:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;[&#8230;] O companion of the Sunnah! Remember the statement of Allah جلا وعلا:<span style="color:#008000;"><em> &#8220;And strain not your eyes in longing for the things We have given for enjoyment to various groups of them, the splendour of the life of this world that We may test them thereby. But the provision (good reward in the Hereafter) of your Lord is better and more lasting.</em> </span>[Ta-Ha 20:131]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You have been guided to the Sunnah! Do you know what the Sunnah is?! You have been guided to the Sunnah in this time where those who apparently ascribe themselves to the Sunnah many betray it! Allah جلا وعلا has guided you to knowing the truthful scholars that have been praised (given tazkiyah) by the Imams such as Shaykh Rabee&#8217;! The one who was praised by al-Albaanee and Ibn Baz and Ibn Uthaymeen! Bring me an &#8216;Alim where there has been agreement on his tazkiyah other than this man (Shaykh Rabee&#8217;) !!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So you have been guided to the correct path! You have been guided to the Sunnah! You have been guided to this great good! [&#8230;]&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">In it our brother <strong>Abu Ishaaq Nadeem Ahsan Shah</strong> (حفظه الله تعالى) covers the following topic in a comprehensive manner:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He states, at the beginning of the lecture the following: <span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;&#8230;speaking about some of the doubts presented surrounding the Sunnah over time.  This is a very important topic because many Muslims have become corrupted or gone astray after misunderstanding this issue, the issue of following the Sunnah and what it means to follow the Sunnah.  And there were those amongst them who rejected the Sunnah altogether.&#8221; </span></p>

From Shaykh Fawzaan&#8217;s hafizahullaah explanation of Sharh-us-Sunnah<br />
Translated by Abu Talhah rahimahullaah</p>
<p>From <strong>Shaykh Fawzaan</strong>&#8216;s hafidhahullaah explanation of <a href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2011/10/01/audio-sharh-us-sunnah-dawud-ibn-ronald-burbank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sharh-us-Sunnah</a> (<a href="http://salafiaudio.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/sharh-us-sunnah-06-sh-s_09-10-05-abu-talhah-dawood-burbank.mp3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lesson 6</a>)<br />

<p>His saying,<strong> “It was not left up to the intellects of men and their opinions.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Religion is not what men deem to be good or what they hold as their opinion, because this is not the Religion of Allaah. This is the Religion of the people, which they have newly invented. As for the Religion of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, then it is what He legislated.  As for that which the men hold as their opinion, based upon their own opinions, this is not the Religion of Allaah the Perfect and Most High.  Rather it is just a religion of whoever holds that opinion. So nothing can be ascribed to Allaah from the Religion except that which He legislated upon the tongue of His Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And as for what others besides Him legislated, then it cannot be ascribed to Allaah, rather it can only be ascribed to whoever legislated it, and Allaah is free of it.  He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:x-large;"><br />
أَمْ لَهُمْ شُرَكَاء شَرَعُوا لَهُم مِّنَ الدِّينِ مَا لَمْ يَأْذَن بِهِ اللَّهُ<br />
</span><br />
<strong>Do they have partners who legislate for them religion which Allaah has not permitted </strong>(Sooratush-Shooraa (42), <em>aayah</em> 21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And its knowledge is with Allaah and His Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.</em>”</strong> The affairs of the Religion are <em>towqeefiyyah</em> (depend upon text); there must be proofs from Allaah and His Messenger with regard to the affairs of the Religion. The matter is restricted to what occurs in the Book and the Sunnah from the affairs of the Religion. And newly introduced matters and innovations are abandoned, that which Allaah has not sent down any proof for &#8211; even if their people hold them to be religion, and they draw closer to Allaah through them, then we turn no attention to these things and we do not believe in them, because the Religion of Allaah is what He legislated and His Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because the Religion is based upon knowledge which came from Allaah and His Messenger. And do not follow the desires of the people and the opinions of the people and what they declare to be good and what they follow each other upon, and it has no basis in the Book of Allaah or the Sunnah of His Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. Just as he `<em>alayhis-salaatu was-salaam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><em>“Whoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it, it is rejected.”</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in one narration:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><em>“Whoever does an action which our affair is not in accordance with, it is rejected”<strong>[1]</strong></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the person who wishes that his action be righteous and be beneficial, then he should adhere to two matters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first matter: </strong>is that he makes his Religion pure for Allaah and free from shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And the second matter:</strong> <em>ittibaa`</em> following the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, free of innovations and newly introduced affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A person will indeed find many things which contradict what is correct in the <em>`aqeedah</em>, matters which contradict what is correct in matters of worship, many of them; (because) the people have desires, and have their own aspirations, and they have  their own opinions and they have their own ways (which  they follow). So we do not follow the people, rather we present whatever the people are upon to the Book and the Sunnah. So whatever conforms with the Book and the Sunnah then it is the Truth, and whatever contradicts these two then it is false and futile.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaikh Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhab al-Wasabi </strong>(may Allah preserve him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That the religion of al-Islaam can be summarized into two basic important and mighty principles, and they are as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First (al-Awwal):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That we do not worship anyone except Allaah alone, having no partner in that<br />
[An-laa Na’budu illa-Allaah Wahdahu laa Shareeka lah].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (ta’aalaa) said:<br />
Say (O Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam): &#8220;O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians): Come to a word that is just between us and you, that we worship none but Allaah, and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take others as lords besides Allaah.&#8221; Then, if they turn away, say: &#8220;Bear witness that we are Muslims.&#8221; (Aali Imraan 3:64)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (ta’aalaa) said: And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. (Al-Israa’ 17:23)<br />
And this is the meaning of: (I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah) [Ash-hadu an-laa Ilaaha illa-Allaah].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And The Second (ath-Thaanee):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That we do not worship Him except by what He legislated in His Book or in the Sunnah of His Messenger Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam), without innovations and desires [An-laa Na’budahu illaa bimaa Shara’ fee Kitaabihi aw fee Sunnati Rasoolihi Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) laa bil-Bida’i wal-Ahwaa’].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (ta’aalaa) said:<br />
[Say (O Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) to these idolaters (pagan ‘Arabs) of your folk:] Follow what has been sent down unto you from your Lord (the Qur’aan and Prophet Muhammad&#8217;s Sunnah), and follow not any Awliyaa&#8217; (protectors and helpers, etc. who order you to associate partners in worship with Allaah), besides Him (Allaah). Little do you remember! (Al-A&#8217;raaf 7:3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (ta’aalaa) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) gives you, take it, and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it), and fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is Severe in punishment. (Al-Hashr 59:7) And this is the meaning of: (I bear witness that Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) is the Messenger of Allaah) [Ash-hadu anna Muhammadar-Rasool-ullaah].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah) said in his valuable book ((Iqtidaa’ as- Siraatul-Mustaqeem Mukhaalifat Ashaab al-Jaheem)) [The Requirements of the Straight Path in Opposing the Companions of the Fire] page 451:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">( And these two fundamentals: are the essence of the religion (Jimaa’ ad-Deen): That we do not worship anyone except Allaah and that we do not worship Him except with what He has legislated, and we do not worship Him with innovations … and these two fundamentals, they are the realization and the perfection of the two testimonies (ash-Shahaadatayn), which are the head of al- Islaam … ). End of quote. And see at-Tahqeeq wal-‘Eedaah of ash-Shaykh Ibn Baaz (rahimahullaah) page: 63.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>EXPLANATION OF THE TEXT BY SHAYKH AHMED AL-WASAABEE (HAFIDHAHULLAAH):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the first fundamental principle, which is the Tawheed of Allaah, the Shaykh mentioned that in the Kitaab of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger we find many Aayaat and Ahaadeeth that point to this great fundamental principle. And it was for this cause that Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa) sent His Messengers, and He ordered them to call the people first and foremost to this fundamental principle, which is the Tawheed of Allaah, and the oneness of Allaah in His worship (Tawheed al-Ulooheeyah), and the oneness of Allaah in His Names and Attributes (Tawheed al- Asmaa was-Sifaat), and the oneness of Allaah in His Lordship (Tawheed ar-Ruboobeeyah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa) said:<br />
And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): &#8220;Worship Allaah (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from) Taaghoot (all false deities, etc. i.e. do not worship Taaghoot besides Allaah).&#8221; (An-Nahl 16:36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (ta’aalaa) said:<br />
And We did not send any Messenger before you (O Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam)) but We inspired him (saying): Laa Ilaaha Illaa Ana [none has the right to be worshipped but I (Allaah)], so worship Me (Alone and none else).&#8221; (Al-Anbiyaa’ 21:25)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a person worships Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa) and obeys these commands of Allaah, then this is the realization of Tawheed, and this is the first fundamental which this religion of al-Islaam is based upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the second fundamental principle, and it is that we do not worship Allaah except by what He has legislated in His Book or in the Sunnah of His Messenger Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam), and that we do not worship Him with innovations and desires. The Shaykh mentioned that those who beautify and make beautiful to themselves innovations and desires, and from the innovations is celebrating the Mawlid (birthday) of the Prophet (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam), which is an innovation of the Soofiyyah, and the Shaykh mentioned that this is not allowable in our religion and it is not legislated, and the people who perform this, they are under a severe threat. Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa) has issued a severe warning against those who oppose and go against the commandments of the Messenger:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And let those who oppose the Messenger&#8217;s (Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam)) commandment (i.e. his Sunnah legal ways, orders, acts of worship, statements, etc.) (among the sects) beware, lest some Fitnah (disbelief, trials, afflictions, earthquakes, killing, overpowered by a tyrant, etc.) befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them. (An-Noor 24:63)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have been ordered to be followers and we have been ordered to take firm hold of the Sunnah. So that which the Prophet (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) has given us, then it is upon to take it and firmly hold on to it, and that which he prohibited us from then it is upon us to prohibit ourselves from it. And the one who goes against the clear orders of the Messenger (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) is in opposition to the Messenger, and he is on a great level of jeopardy, and if Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa) does not give him the Tawfeeq to repent, and he dies upon this, then he is in a dangerous state. And many of the people in this day and age have fallen into numerous types of innovations, such as the Soofiyyah and the Raafidhah, and other than them. And they have not prohibited themselves from that which the Prophet (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) has prohibited them from, and they have not enjoined upon themselves that which the Prophet (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) has enjoined upon them and ordered them with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the valuable book of Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah is the warning to the Believers of following the path of the people whose destination is the Fire, the people of the Book, the Jews and the Christians. And in this day and age we find many of the Muslims following the Kuffaar in all levels of life. And verily we have been ordered to oppose the Kuffaar in all actions and in all levels of life, such as our speech, and our character, and in our dress, and in our actions of worship, so much so that even in the prayer, as the Prophet (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) has said: ((Pray in your shoes, for verily the Jews do not pray in their shoes)). A Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And many of the Muslims have invented various holidays following in the footsteps of the Kuffaar, such as labor day, and workers holiday, and mothers day, and other holidays like this, all of which are alien to al-Islaam and all of which are innovations.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation Of The Text In Al-Qawl-Ul-Mufeed Fee Adillatit Tawheed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Benefit (Faa’idah):<br />
al-‘Allaamah Ibnul-Qayyim has mentioned in Zaad al-Ma’aad: 4/352:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His (ta’aalaa) statement:<br />
Is it not sufficient for them that We have sent down to you the Book (the Qur&#8217;aan) which is recited to them? (Al-&#8216;Ankaboot 29:51)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said: ((Whosoever the Qur’aan does not heal, then may Allaah not heal him. And whosoever the Qur’aan does not suffice, then may Allaah not suffice him)) [Faman lam Yashfih al- Qur’aan, Falaa Shafaahul-Allaah, wa man lam Yakfih Falaa Kafaahul-Allaah]. End of quote.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Aboo Ibraaheem [2] said: Whosoever the Book and the Sunnah does not suffice, then may Allaah not suffice him. And whosoever the Book and the Sunnah does not satisfy, then may Allaah not satisfy him [Wa man lam Yakfih al-Kitaab was-Sunnah Falaa Kafaahul-Allaah, wa man lam Yaqna’ bil-Kitaab was-Sunnah Falaa Aqna’hul-Allaah].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>EXPLANATION OF THE TEXT BY SHAYKH AHMED AL-WASAABEE (HAFIDHAHULLAAH): </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We find many of the people of innovation following the statements of their leaders in misguidance, and beautifying this to themselves and to the people, and leaving off the guidance of the Kitaab and the Sunnah. So the phrases that are mentioned in this chapter are supplications against these people and their likes, from the people of innovations and desires, those who are not satisfied, and do not find comfort in the Kitaab and the Sunnah, then these are supplications against them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] And he is the writer, ash-Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab al-Wasaabee (hafidhahullaah).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tirmidhi #76 records on the authority of Nawwas ibn Sam&#8217;an that the messenger of Allah (sallallahu alyhi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;Allah has set forth the following as a parable:</span></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">There is a road that leads straight to the destination. On either side of the road there is a wall in which there are open doors with curtains hanging on them. From the remote end of the road, a voice calls, &#8216;proceed straight and do not turn aside&#8217;. Whenever someone intends to lift a curtain from the door another voice calls from above. &#8216;Beware! Do not lift the curtain; otherwise you will be lured inside&#8217;. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The prophet (sallallahu alyhi wa sallaam) explained the parable by saying that the straight path is Islam. the walls are the limits imposed by Allah, the open doors are the things that He has prohibited, the voice which calls from the end of the road is the Quran and the voice which calls from above is Allah&#8217;s monitor in the heart of every believer&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was declared Hasan Gharib by Tirmidhee and sahih by Hakim #245 with Dhahabi agreeing and Al-Albani , Sahih al-Jami&#8217; #3887</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Abû Bakr Al-Siddîq – Allâh be pleased with him – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I will not leave anything Allâh’s Messenger – Allâh’s peace and blessings be upon him – did, except that I will also do it; for I fear that if I were to leave any of his commands and ways I would deviate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhârî, <em>Al-Sahîh</em> 2:386 hadîth no. 3093; Ibn Battah, <em>Al-Ibânah</em> article 77, and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After recording this narration, Ibn Battah states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This, my brothers, is the greatest Siddîq (true believer i.e. Abû Bakr), fearing that he would fall into deviation if he were to leave any of the commandments of his Prophet – Allâh’s peace and blessings be upon him. What then is to happen in a time in which people deride their Prophet and his commandments, and compete with each other and show off in contradicting him and mock his Sunnah?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Source</strong> :Class 42 from <a title="‘al-Qawl-ul- Mufeed Fee Adillatit-Tawhid’ [Beneficial Speech in Establishing the Evidences of Tawhid] – Shaykh Muhammad al-Wasabi" href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2014/01/17/tawheed-lessons-wasabi/">Lessons on Tawhid &#8211; Approximately 50 Classes</a> &#8211; from Dar-ul-Hadith, Dammaj, Yemen new</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>These were lessons conducted on the book &#8216;al-Qawl-ul- Mufeed Fee Adillatit-Tawhid&#8217; [Beneficial Speech in Establishing the Evidences of Tawhid] written by one of the major scholars of the Sunnah in Yemen, Shaikh Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhab al-Wasabi (may Allah preserve him).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Qisam al-Awwal (The First Category): </strong></p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>They do not want by this from the people a recompense or thankfulness, and nor do they seek a high position with them, and they do not seek praise and position in their heart, and they are not fleeing from their rebuke. Verily, they see the people [who are alive] in the position of the people of the grave, those who do not control for them harm or benefit, or life or death, or resurrection. So actions for the people, and seeking a position with them,and hoping in harm or benefit from them [i.e. the general people], is not from them [i.e. these category of people]. Verily, it is from those who are ignorant of the situation and ignorant of their Lord. And whoever knows the people and puts them in their proper places, and knows Allaah, is sincere in his actions and his statements and his givings and his forgivings and his love and his hatred. So no one does actions and deeds for the creation other than Allaah except that he is ignorant of Allaah and ignorant of the creation. For verily, the one who knows Allaah and knows the people prefers actions and deeds for Allaah over actions and deeds for the people.</li>
<li>So their actions, all of them, are for Allaah, and all of their statements are for Allaah, and their giving and their forgiving is for Allaah, and their love is for Allaah and their hatred is for Allaah, and their actions, both in the apparent and the hidden, are for the face of Allaah alone.</li>
<li>Those who have gathered between Ikhlaas (sincerity) and Mutaabi’ah (following the guidance of the Prophet).</li>
<li>And like this their actions, all of them, and their worship is in agreement with the command of Allaah, and with what He loves and what He is Pleased with. And Allaah does not accept from the people any action except this. And Allaah has tested His servants with life and death, so He said: Who has created death and life, that He may test you which of you is best in deed. (Al-Mulk 67:2)</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He has made that which is upon the earth as a beauty for them upon the earth so that He may test them which of them are best in actions and deeds. al-Fudayl ibn ‘Iyyaad said: A beautiful action (al-‘Amal al-Hasan) is that which is sincere (Akhlasuh) and that which is correct (Aswabuh).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: Oh Abaa ‘Alee, what is sincere and what is correct? He said: Verily, if the action is sincere (Khaalis) but it is not correct (Sawaab): it is not accepted (Lam Yuqbal), and if it is correct but it is not sincere: it is not accepted, until it is sincere and correct. And a sincere [action] is: that which is for Allaah, and a correct [action] is: that which is upon the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is mentioned in His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord. (Al-Kahf 18:110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in His (ta’aalaa) statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And who can be better in religion than one who submits his face (himself) to Allaah (i.e. follows Allaah&#8217;s Religion of Islaamic Monotheism); and he is a Muhsin (a good-doer). And follows the religion of Ibraaheem (Abraham) Haneefaa (Islaamic Monotheism &#8211; to worship none but Allaah Alone). (An-Nisaa’ 4:125)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah does not accept from the actions except that which is done sincerely seeking His Face, and that which is in agreement with His Order, and other than this is not accepted, rather it is repelled back on the person who does it at a time when he is in most need of it, and it is turned intoscattered ashes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in as-Saheehayn [i.e. al-Bukhaaree and Muslim] from the narration of ‘Aa’ishah (radiyAllaahu ‘anhaa) who narrated from the Prophet (Peace be Upon him), that he said: ((Whoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it will have it rejected)). And in the narration from Muslim: ((Whoever does a deed that is not ordered by us will have it rejected)).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So every action that is not in agreement [with the Sunnah], then it does not increase its doer except in distance away from Allaah, for verily Allaah (ta’aalaa) is only worshipped with what He has ordered to be worshipped with, not with opinions (Aaraa’) and desires (Ahwaa’).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Qisam ath-Thaanee (The Second Category): </strong></p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Those who have no sincerity and have no adherence to the Sunnah,so their actions and deeds are not in agreement with the legislation, and they are not sincere to the One who is worshipped.</li>
<li>They are like the ones who beautify themselvesto the people, showing-off to them with that which Allaah has not decreed and that which the Messenger has not informed the people of. And they are the evilest of creation (Shiraarul-Khalq).</li>
<li>And they are the most disliked and the most hated of people to Allaah (‘azza wa jall), and they havethe biggest portion of His (ta’aalaa) statement: Think not that those who rejoice in what they have done (or brought about), and love to be praised for what they have not done,- think not you that they are rescued from the torment, and for them is a painful torment. (Aali Imraan3:188)</li>
<li>They are happy with what they do from innovation (Bid’ah) and misguidance (Dalaalah) and association (Shirk), and they love that they be praised as they are the followers of the Sunnah and the people of sincerity – and they are not from the people of the Sunnah or sincerity (Ahlus-Sunnati wal-Ikhlaas) –</li>
<li>And this category of people are numerous, from the people who have gone astray from the ones who are alienated from the people of knowledge (‘Ilm), and poverty (Faqr), and worship (‘Ibaadah), from the Straight Path (Siraatul-Mustaqeem).</li>
<li>For verily they do actions of innovation and misguidance to show-off and to be heard-off, and they love to be praised for that which they have not done from the following of the Sunnah, and possessing sincerity and knowledge. So they are the people of hatred and misguidance (Ahlul-Ghadabi wad-Dalaal).</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Qisam ath-Thaalith (The Third Category)</strong>:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>The one who is sincere in his actions and deeds,but his actions and deeds are not in agreement with the order of Allaah.</li>
<li>And they are like the ignorant worshippers and the ones who are from the path of abstinence (Zuhud) and poverty (Faqr).</li>
<li>And they are the ones who worship Allaah with other than what He has decreed and legislated, and they believe that their worship is bringing them close to Allaah.</li>
<li>And they believe that listening to clapping and whistling is bringing them close to Allaah, and being isolated and leaving off the Jumu’ah [i.e. the Friday prayer] and the Jama’ah [i.e. the mandatory prayers] is also being close to Allaah, and continuing the fast until the night is also being close to Allaah, and fasting the two holidays (Siyaam al-‘Eedayn) of al-Islaam is also a way of being close to Allaah.</li>
<li>And they try to get close to Allaah with actions of innovation (Bid’ah) and disobedience (Ma’aasee).</li>
<li>So the sincerity of a person in this state does not benefit him because these actions that he does are from the actions of innovation. And the actions of the innovator are not accepted, and the proof being in the Hadeeth of Umm-ul-Mu’mineen ‘Aa’ishah (radiyAllaahu ‘anhaa), raised to the saying of the Prophet (Peace be upon him): ((Whoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it will have it rejected)). Agreed Upon [i.e. reported by al-Bukhaaree and Muslim].</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Qisam ar-Raabi’ (The Fourth Category):</strong></p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>The one whose actions are in accordance with the Sunnah, but they are for the sake of other than Allaah.</li>
<li>Such as obedience of the ones who show-off, and like the ones who fight to show-off, and because of great pride and great courageousness. And he does the Hajj so that it may be said that he has performed the Hajj.</li>
<li>And he reads the Qur’aan so that it may be said that he reads the Qur’aan.</li>
<li>And the actions of these people, from the apparent they seem righteous, but they are not righteous since they are performed for other than the sake of Allaah, so they are not accepted. Allaah (ta’aalaa) said: And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allaah, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him). (Al-Baiyinah 98:5)</li>
<li>So they have not been ordered except that they worship Allaah with that which He has legislated and with sincerity to Him in all their worship.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the people of sincerity and adherence (Ahlul-Ikhlaas wal-Mutaabi’ah), they are the people of:You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything). (Al-Faatihah 1:5)</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Various groups, each claiming to be the victorious one!</strong><br />
by Ibn Baz (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) in Nur Al-Adab Session.<br />
<a href="http://alifta.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://alifta.net</a><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q3- There are many religious sects and groups, each claiming that they are the victorious one. This matter is perplexing to many people, so what should we do, especially as there are groups that are related to Islam, such as <strong>Al-</strong><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/sufism-soofiyyah/"><strong>Soofiyyah</strong> (صُوفِيَّة)</a> <strong><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/salafiyyah/">Al-Salafiyah</a></strong>, and others, and how can we distinguish between them? May Allah bless you<strong>.<br />
</strong></span><br />
A: It is confirmed that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>&#8220;The Jews split into seventy-one sects; one will be in Paradise (i.e., those who followed Moses) and seventy will be in the Fire. The Christians split into seventy-two sects; seventy-one will be in the Fire and one will be in Paradise (i.e., those who followed Jesus). And by the One in Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad, this Ummah (nation) of mine will split into seventy-three sects; one will be in Paradise and seventy-two will be in the Fire. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>It was asked, &#8220;Who are they, O Messenger of Allah?&#8221; </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>He (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;<em>Al-Jama‘ah</em> (i.e., the group which adheres steadfastly to the way of the Prophet, peace be upon him, and his Companions).&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>&#8220;</strong>(Those who follow)<strong> what I and my Companions are following.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the saved group; those who adhere steadfastly to the truth that the Messenger (peace be upon him) came with, and adopt the way of the Messenger (peace be upon him) and that of his Companions. They are <em>Ahl Al-Sunnah wal-Jama‘ah</em> (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim community). They are the people who adhere to the Hadith; the righteous predecessors who follow in the footsteps of the early generations in acting upon the Qur’an and the Sunnah. Any sect that contradicts them is threatened with the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Dear questioner, you have to study every group that claims to be the victorious one. Scrutinize their deeds; if they are in conformity with the Shari‘ah, they are included in the victorious group; otherwise they are not.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The measure here is the Qur’an and the Sunnah</strong>, so any group whose words and deeds are in accordance with the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger (peace be upon him) is within the victorious one and any that contradict this, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">the <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/jahmiyyah/"><strong>Jahmiyyah</strong> (الجهمية)</a><strong> </strong>(an Islamic sect denying some of the Attributes of Allah, claiming they are ascribed to people and cannot be ascribed to Allah),</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">the <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/mutazilah/"><strong>Mu’tazilah</strong> (المعتزلة)</a> (a deviant Islamic sect claiming that those who commit major sins are in a state between belief and disbelief),</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">the <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/shia-raafidah/"><strong>Raafidah</strong> (<span dir="rtl" lang="ar" xml:lang="ar"><b>الرافضة</b></span>‎)</a><strong> </strong>(a Shi`ah group denying the caliphates of Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq and ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab, and making accusations against them and many other Companions),</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">the <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/al-murjiah/"><strong>Murji’ah</strong> (المرجئة)</a> (a deviant Islamic sect claiming that Faith is restricted to belief not deeds), and others, as well as most of the <strong><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/sufism-soofiyyah/">Sufis</a> </strong>who invent matters in the religion, which Allah does not permit.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are all among the groups that the Messenger (peace be upon him) forewarned of the Fire, until they repent from going against <em>Shari‘ah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Any group that adopts anything contrary to <em>Shari‘ah</em> have to repent from it, and return to the right path and the truth that our Prophet, Muhammad (peace be upon him), brought. In this way they will be saved from the threat. But if they insist on the rejected innovations they have introduced in religion and do not follow the way of the Messenger (peace be upon him), they will be among the threatened groups. <span style="color:#808000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Not all of these groups are disbelievers, but they are threatened with the Fire</span></strong></span>. Among them are those who are disbelievers for committing acts of disbelief, and among them are those who are not disbelievers, but they are still threatened with the Fire, because they have introduced heresies in religion and sanctioned what Allah has not permitted (may He be Glorified and Exalted).</p>
