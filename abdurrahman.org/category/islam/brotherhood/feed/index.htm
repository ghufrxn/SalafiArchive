<p style="text-align:center;">The Explanation of:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَنْ سَتَرَ مُسْلِمًا سَتَرَهُ اللَّهُ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَالآخِرَةِ</span></h2>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Whoever conceals (the faults of) a Muslim, Allah will conceal him in this life and the hereafter.”</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is another point that is emphasized by other texts with similar meanings. Ibn Mājah recorded a ḥadīth from Ibn ‘Abbās ( رضي الله عنه ) that the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَنْ سَتَرَ عَوْرَةَ أَخِيهِ الْمُسْلِمِ سَتَرَ اللَّهُ عَوْرَتَهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ ، وَمَنْ كَشَفَ عَوْرَةَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">أَخِيهِ الْمُسْلِمِ كَشَفَ اللَّهُ عَوْرَتَهُ حَتَّى يَفْضَحَهُ بِهَا فِي بَيْتِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Whoever conceals the faults of his Muslim brother, Allah will conceal his faults on the Day of Resurrection. And whoever exposes the faults of his Muslim brother, Allah will expose his faults even by revealing those he committed in (the privacy of) his home.</span>[22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported that some of the Salaf said something similar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#0000ff;">I have met people having no shameful faults but they began to mention the faults of others, so the people began discovering their faults. And I met people who had faults, yet they used to conceal other people’s faults, so their own faults were forgotten.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ḥadīth of Abū Barzah ( رضي الله عنه ) also supports this in that the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا مَعْشَرَ مَنْ آمَنَ بِلِسَانِهِ وَلَمْ يَدْخُلْ الإِيمَانُ قَلْبَهُ ، لا تَغْتَابُوا الْمُسْلِمِينَ وَلا </span><span style="color:#000000;">تَتَّبِعُوا عَوْرَاتِهِمْ ، فَإِنَّهُ مَنْ اتَّبَعَ عَوْرَاتِهِمْ يَتَّبِعُ اللَّهُ عَوْرَتَهُ ، وَمَنْ يَتَّبِعْ اللَّهُ </span><span style="color:#000000;">عَوْرَتَهُ يَفْضَحْهُ فِي بَيْتِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Oh you who have believed with your tongues but faith has not yet entered your hearts, do not back-bite Muslims. Do not seek to discover their faults, for whoever seeks after their faults, Allah will seek his faults. And if Allah seeks after someone’s faults, he will expose him for even (what he committed) in his home</span>. [23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam al-Tirmidhī collected a ḥadīth with a similar meaning from Ibn ‘Umar ( رضي الله عنه ) [24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that people or are two types in this regard:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. People whose faults are not know to others in that they may have committed them in private but nothing of their sins is known. If they make a mistake or sin, it is not permissible to reveal or expose it or even speak about it. That would be the forbidden type of back-biting that has been condemned in the texts. Regarding this, Allah (عزّ وجلّ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يُحِبُّونَ أَن تَشِيعَ الْفَاحِشَةُ فِي الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ فِي </span><span style="color:#000000;">الدُّنْيَا وَالْآخِرَةِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed, those who like that immorality should be spread and publicized among those who believe, there will be for them a painful punishment in this world and in the hereafter</span>.[25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This spreading and publicizing of such immorality from a believer could be regarding something the person actually did or something he is wrongly accused of, being innocent of it, such as the case with the famous story of the lie against ‘Āishah, the wife of the prophet (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some righteous officials used to instruct those who enjoin good upon people saying, “<strong>Try to conceal the sinners, for publicizing their sins is a means of showing the faults of the people of Islam, and the most important thing is to conceal people’s fault</strong>s.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, if a remorseful person comes repenting and admitting his crime, he is not to be exposed or inquired about. Rather, he is ordered to return and conceal his affair as the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) instructed Mā’iz and a Ghāmīdee woman. [26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) also did not inquire into the affair of the one who came to him saying, “I transgressed the prescribed limit, so establish the punishment upon me.” [27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the same way, if such a person were to be taken to account for his crime yet the news of which had not reached the leader, then intercession should be made on his part so that he would not inform the leader.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, there has come a ḥadīth in which the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَقِيلُوا ذَوِي الْهَيْئَاتِ عَثَرَاتِهِمْ إِلاّ الْحُدُودَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Pardon those of prestigious character of their faults except the prescribed punishments.</span> [28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The second type of people with respect to sins is those who are well-known for their sins, those who openly and publicly commit them. They themselves are neither concerned at all with the sins they commit, nor with what people say about them. These are the wicked ones who openly display their crimes. Such people do not have the honor of others refraining from back-biting them as has been reported from al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī and others. Regarding such people, there is no problem with inquiring about their affairs in order to establish the prescribed rulings against them. Some of our companions have explicitly stated this, using as evidence the statement of the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) to Unays ( رضي الله عنه ):</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَاغْدُ يَا أُنَيْسُ إِلَى امْرَأَةِ هَذَا فَإِنْ اعْتَرَفَتْ فَارْجُمْهَا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">G<span style="color:#808000;">o in the morning, Unays, to the wife of this man (she was accused of adultery) and if she confesses, stone her.</span>[29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, regarding this type of people, intercession is not to be made on their behalf when taken to account even if the news has not reached the leader. Rather, they are left to have the prescribed penalties pronounced upon them so that their crime is known as a deterrent to others like them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imam Mālik said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever is not known for harming the people, yet may have made some errors or mistakes, then there is no problem with interceding and pleading on his behalf as long as his crimes have not already been conveyed to the leader. As for those who are known for their evil and corruption, I do not like that anyone should intercede or argue on their behalf. Rather they are left to have the sentences carried out upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn al-Mundhir</strong> and others have also reported this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imam Aḥmad</strong> also disliked that crimes should be raised up to the attention of the authorities in every circumstance because often they would not carry out the prescribed punishments as they should. For this he said, “If you know that the ruling will be (correctly) pronounced upon a person, then raise the matter (to the attention of the leaders).” It was mentioned that some people beat a man (as a punishment for a crime) until he died, while killing him was not permissible. If only the person would have repented from the time he committed the offense, it would have been better for him in that he repents for something between him and Allah, thereby concealing his own sin. As for his second offense, some people are of the opinion he should do the same—he should not disclose it. Still, others have said that even upon the first offense, a person should come to the leader and confess against himself in what requires a prescribed punishment so that he may be purified (of his crime).</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[22] Authentic: Recorded by Ibn Mājah (no. 2546) and al-Albānī said it is authentic in “Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan Ibn Mājah” (no. 2063).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[23] Authentic: Recorded by Abū Dāwūd (no. 4880) and Imam Aḥmad. al-Albānī said it is authentic (Hasan Ṣaḥīḥ) in “Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan Abī Dāwūd” (no. 4083).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[24] The ḥadīth collected by al-Tirmidhī (no. 2032) that Ibn Rajab is referring to is:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا مَعْشَرَ مَنْ أَسْلَمَ بِلِسَانِهِ وَلَمْ يُفْضِ الإِيمَانُ إِلَى قَلْبِهِ، لا تُؤْذُوا الْمُسْلِمِينَ وَلا تُعَيِّرُوهُمْ وَلا تَتَّبِعُوا عَوْرَاتِهِمْ، فَإِنَّهُ </span><span style="color:#000000;"> مَنْ تَتَبَّعَ عَوْرَةَ أَخِيهِ الْمُسْلِمِ تَتَبَّعَ اللَّهُ عَوْرَتَهُ، وَمَنْ تَتَبَّعَ اللَّهُ عَوْرَتَهُ يَفْضَحْهُ وَلَوْ فِي جَوْفِ رَحْلِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Oh you who have accepted Islam with their tongue yet faith has not reached your hearts, do not harm Muslims. Do not humiliate them, and do not seek to discover their faults. Whoever seeks after the faults of his Muslim brother, Allah will certainly seek his faults. And if Allah seeks his faults, he will expose him even if he were in the innermost privacy of his own home.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Albānī said this narration is authentic in “Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan al-Tirmidhī” (no. 1655).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[25] Sūrah al-Nūr, 24:19.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[26] Authentic: This is a reference to the story in which the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) repeatedly refused to carry out the prescribed punishment upon a companion and kept asking for excuses for him. The ḥadīth is recorded by Muslim (no. 1695) from Sulaymān Ibn Buraydah who narrated from his father who said: Mā’iz Ibn Maalik ( رضي الله عنه ) came to the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) and said, “Oh messenger of Allah, purify me (by establishing the prescribed punishment upon me).” He ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) replied:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَيْحَكَ ارْجِعْ فَاسْتَغْفِرْ اللَّهَ وَتُبْ إِلَيْهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Woe to you. Seek forgiveness from Allah and repent to him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then returned and later came back and said the same thing to which the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) kept saying:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَيْحَكَ ارْجِعْ فَاسْتَغْفِرْ اللَّهَ وَتُبْ إِلَيْهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Woe to you. Seek forgiveness from Allah and repent to him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the fourth time, he ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) asked him:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"> فِيمَ أُطَهِّرُكَ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">For what should I purify you?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mā’iz said, “For committing adultery.” So Allah’s messenger ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) asked (others about the man):</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَبِهِ جُنُونٌ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Is there madness in him?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After being informed that the man is not crazy. He ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) further asked:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَشَرِبَ خَمْرًا </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Did he drink alcohol?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man stood up to him but did not find the smell of alcohol from him. Allah’s messenger ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) asked him:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"> أَزَنَيْتَ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Did you (really) commit adultery?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied, “Yes.” He ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) then instructed that he be stoned. So, the people differed amongst themselves about him into two groups: one saying, “He is ruined! His deeds are lost.” and another group saying, “What repentance could be better than the repentance of Mā’iz? He came (willingly) to the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ), put his hand in his hand, and said, ‘Kill me by the stone.’” So they remained in that state for two or three days. Then the messenger of Allah ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  came while they were sitting, greeted them and sat. He said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">اسْتَغْفِرُوا لِمَاعِزِ بْنِ مَالِكٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Ask for forgiveness for Mā’iz Ibn Mālik.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they said, “May Allah forgive Mā’iz Ibn Mālik.” Allah’s messenger ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) then said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَقَدْ تَابَ تَوْبَةً لَوْ قُسِمَتْ بَيْنَ أُمَّةٍ لَوَسِعَتْهُمْ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">He repented with such repentance that if it were divided among the entire nation, it would encompass them all.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) did similarly with the pregnant woman who also came to confess committing adultery with Mā’iz.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[27] Authentic: This story was narrated in the ḥadīth collected by al-Bukhārī (no. 6823), Muslim (no. 2764), and Abū Dāwūd (no. 4381). Anas Ibn Mālik ( رضي الله عنه ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was with Allah’s messenger ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) when a man came to him and said, “Oh messenger of Allah, I have transgressed the limit, so establish the punishment upon me.” Yet he ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) did not ask about him (his crime). The prayer time came and he prayed with the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ). When the he ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) finished the prayer, the man stood and again said, “Oh messenger of Allah, indeed I transgressed the limit so establish the book of Allah upon me.” He صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) ) replied:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَلَيْسَ قَدْ صَلَّيْتَ مَعَنَا </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Did you not pray with us?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered, “Yes.” He ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) then told him:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ قَدْ غَفَرَ لَكَ ذَنْبَكَ أَوْ قَالَ حَدَّكَ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Then indeed Allah has forgiven your sin (or he said:) your (transgression of the) prescribed law.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[28] Authentic: Recorded by Abū Dāwūd (no. 4375) and al-Albānī declared it to be authentic in “Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan Abī Dāwūd” (no. 3679).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[29] Authentic: Recorded by al-Bukhārī (no. 2315), Muslim (no. 1698), al-Tirmidhī (no. 1433), and Ibn Mājah (no. 2549).</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 77 : Points 131</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The blameless one from the Muslims is the one from whom nothing suspicious becomes apparent.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F408965550&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“O you who believe, avoid much (types) of suspicion. Verily some (forms) of suspicion is a sin.”</strong></span> [Surah Al-Hujuraat: 12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Abu Hurairah (<em>radhi Allaahu anhu</em>) reported that Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sall Allaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>Beware of suspicion, for indeed suspicion is the most untruthful form of speech</strong>.” [<em>Saheeh</em> – Reported by Al-Bukhaaree (10/484 of al-Fath) and Muslim (2563)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ahaadeeth with this same understanding I have mentioned here are many. <strong>What the backbiting of the heart means, is: When the heart has firm conviction and holds bad thoughts about someone. But as for the notions that occasionally display in one’s mind or when one talks to himself, then as long as these thoughts do not remain established and continuous in him, it is excused according to the consensus of the scholars</strong>. This is since he has no choice in the matter as to stop it from occurring nor can he find any way to liberate himself from it when it does occur. This is the understanding of what has been authentically established (in the texts).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah (radhiyallaahu &#8216;anhu) narrated that the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Imam Allaama Shaykh Rabee bin Hadi al-Madkhali -hafidhullaah- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;We advise the Salafis to have harmony/solidarity and to adhere to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To have brotherhood upon what is contained in the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam of Aqeedah, worship and actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having brotherhood for the sake of Allaah Azza wa Jal and to have Eemaan in these principles and these foundations and to love each other for the sake of Allaah Azza wa Jal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">If a person makes a mistake whether it is a minor one or a major one, advice is given with wisdom and good admonition.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There are people who make a claim of Salafeeyah, they are hard and forceful with falsehood, with slander and oppression. They are harsh and hard when being harsh is not required and they have no wisdom whatsoever, nor mercy or any of these things!</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">With sadness some people accuse the established Salafis with this exaggeration! This is extreme oppression.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I swear by Allaah we wage war against this harshness, the harshness of the Khawarij, we criticize these people who are extreme and delve too deeply and also the harsh ones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We criticize those who water-down, belittle and wage war against the principles of Islaam who originate, derive and produce false, unintelligent principles and statements to protect the people of Bida.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We criticize this extremist and we call to the straight path and to that what the Salaf as-Salih were upon of beliefs, actions and manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are extremists in watering-down, belittling and warring against the principles of Islam and the others are extremists in declaring people innovators and making Takfeer of people, so both of these types deviate from the straight path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allaah ordered us to have moderation and justice and to be steadfast upon the straight path.&#8217;</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Do Not Envy people for what Allaah has given them of His Bounty<br />
</span>Taken From: My Advice To The Women , By the Shaykhah: Umm &#8216;Abdillaah al-Waadi&#8217;iyyah </em><br />
<em>With the introduction and review of the Esteemed Shaykh: Aboo &#8216;Abdur-Rahmaan Muqbil ibn Haadee al-Waadi&#8217;ee </em><br />
<em>Pgs. 242-251</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Musaddad told us that Yahya told us upon the authority of Shu&#8217;bah from Qataadah from Anas (radiAllahu anhu) that the Prophet (sallAllahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>     &#8220;None of you [truly] believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself.&#8221;</em> (288)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, in this prophetic narration you find that the one who does not desire good for his Muslim brothers, similar to the good that he desires for himself, is deficient in his belief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh said, The intent behind the negation here is (a negation of) the completeness of faith, and negating the name of something conveys a negation of the completeness of it and this is understood from their speech as in the statement, &#8220;So and so is not human.&#8221;  The word <strong>Khayr</strong> (good) is a comprehensive word that includes all of the acts of obedience and permissible actions related to both the worldly life and the Hereafter while excluding the prohibited things.  This is because the word Khayr (good) does not include those actions. (289) [End of cited speech]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also understood from this prophetic narration that a Muslim should hate evil for his brother, just as he hates evil for himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Upon the authority of &#8216;Abdullaah ibn &#8216;Amr ibn al-&#8216;Aas who narrated that the Prophet (sallAllahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;So whoever desires to remove himself from the Fire and enter the  Paradise, such that death overcomes him while he is a believer in Allaah and the Last Day, then let him treat the people in a manner in which he wishes to be treated.&#8221;</em> (290)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So desiring good for the Muslims is from the reasons that cause a person to be removed from the Fire, as this prophetic narration indicates.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Desiring good for the Muslims is something that does not occur except from a person with a sound heart that is free of contamination like envy, contempt, and pride. For this reason, desiring good for the Muslims has become rare in this time, due to the lack of purity in the hearts, which is present in many of the people, except those whom Allaah has shown His Mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who does not desire good for the Muslims is described with despicable attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From them is:<br />
1- Envy (Hasad):<br />
Envy (Hasad) is to desire the removal of good from others.<br />
Envy is from the attributes of the Jews and it is from their characteristics.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah the Exalted says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;Or do they envy people for what Allaah has given them of His Bounty? We have indeed already given the family of Ibraaheem (Abraham) the Book and the wisdom, and conferred upon them a great kingdom.&#8221;</em>[Soorah an-Nisaa&#8217; 4:54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah the Exalted says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;Many of the people of the Scripture (Jews and  Christians) wish that if they could turn you back to disbelief after you have believed, out of envy from  themselves, (even) after the truth has become clear to them.&#8221; </em><br />
[Soorah al-Baqarah 2:109]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the Jews and Christians do not desire that good comes to any one of the Muslims. Thus, they desire from us that we abandon our religion while they know what we are upon leads to everlasting happiness and we have been prohibited from imitating them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Envy (Hasad) is from the characteristics of the hypocrites:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Exalted says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;If some good should touch you, it distresses them, but if some evil should befall you, they rejoice at it. And if you  remail patient and fear Allaah, their plot will not harm  you at all. Indeed, Allaah encompasses all that they do.&#8221; </em>[Soorah Aali &#8216;Imraan 3:120]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Envy (Hasad) can sever even the strongest of bonds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sons of Ya&#8217;qoob (Jacob alayhis salaam) envied their brother Yoosuf (Joseph) because their father used to love him moreso than he did them, just as Allaah described in their story that He has presented in Soorah Yoosuf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Exalted says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;When they said, Truly, Yoosuf (Joseph) and his brother (Benjamin) are more beloved to our father than we, while we are a group consisting of many. Certainly, our father is in clear error. Kill Yoosuf (Joseph) or cast him out to (another) land, so that the favour of your father may then be attainable for you, and after that you will be a righteous people.&#8221; </em>[Soorah Yoosuf 12:8-9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, they planned to kill him becasue of their envy for him because of his being more beloved to their father than they were.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, Satan envied our father Aadam (alayhis salaam) because of what Allaah had given him from [His] bounties and he became arrogant as Allaah the Exalted said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;And when your Lord said to the angels, &#8216;I will create a  human being out of clay from an altered black smooth mud. So, when I have fashioned him and breathed into  him the soul which I created for him, then fall down to  him in prostration.&#8217; So, the angels prostrated themselves, all of them together. Except Iblees (Satan), he refused to be with those who prostrated. (Allaah) said, &#8220;O Iblees (Satan)! Why is it that you are not with those who prostrate?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Never would I prostrate myself to a human whom You created out of clay from an altered black smooth mud.&#8217;  (Allaah) said, &#8216;Then, get out of here, for indeed, you are an outcast. And certainly upon you is the Curse until the  Day of Recompense.'&#8221; </em>[Soorah al-Hijr 15:28-35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, the story of the two sons of Aadam, one of them envied his brother because Allaah accepted his brother&#8217;s sacrifice while his own sacrifice was not accepted. This envy led him to kill his brother</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Exalted says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;And recite to them the story of the two sons of Aadam  in truth; when they both offered a sacrifice (to Allaah), it was accepted from the one of them but was not accepted  from the other. The latter said to the former, &#8216;I will surely kill you.&#8217; The former said, &#8216;Certainly, Allaah  accepts only from the righteous. If you raise your hand against me to kill me, I shall not raise my hand against  you to kill you, for I fear Allaah, the Lord of the worlds. Indeed, I intend to let you acquire my sin as well as your sin and then you will be one of the people of the Fire. And that is the recompense of the wrongdoers.&#8217; So his soul permitted for him the murder of his brother; he murdered him and became one of the losers. Then Allaah sent a crow who scratched at the ground to show him how to hide the disgrace of his brother. He said, &#8216;Woe to me! Have I failed to be like this crow and hide the disgrace of my brother?&#8217; Then he became one of the regretful.</em>   [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:27-31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So then, the consequences of envy (Hasad) are harmful and can cause separation between two friends and between a man and his brother.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 2- The envious resent of the decree of Allaah: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Therefore, he sees himself as though he has been cheated and for this reason, he cannot feel contentment or tranquility, but rather he feels depressed and sad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is upon mankind to look to those whom are below them, for indeed this is closer to recognizing the blessings (of Allaah) and being thankful for them; while looking towards those who are above them, leads to remorse and sadness and the belittling of one&#8217;s self.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Zuhayr ibn Harb told me that Zubayr told us. (291)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, Aboo Kurayb told us that Aboo Mu&#8217;aawiyyah told us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Bakr ibn Abee Shaybah (with his wording) told us that Aboo Mu&#8217;aawiyyah and Wakee&#8217; told us upon the authority of Al-&#8216;A&#8217;mash from Aboo Saalih from Aboo Hurayrah who said that the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;Look to those who are below you, and do not look to those whom are above you, because it is more appropriate that you do not belittle the blessings of Allaah.&#8221;</em> (292)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No matter what mankind acquires in the worldly life, none of it matters in the least when compared to the safeguarding of his religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3- From the examples of the envious person&#8217;s resentments of  the decree of Allaah is if the envious person had the ability to remove a blessing that was given to a person whom Allaah had favored with His blessings, he would most definitely do so</strong>. Either by making him poor after he had been rich, or by  making him lowly after he had been honorable or ignorant when he had been knowledgeable or childless after once having many children or ugly after having been handsome or sickly after  having been healthy and other than that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, Allaah the Mighty and Majestic censures the one who withholds resentment towards His decree and His wisdom. He, the Glorified says:<br />
<em><br />
&#8220;Do they distribute the Mercy of your Lord? It is We who appropriate their livlihood in this world, and We have raised some of them above others in degrees, so that they may make use of one another for service. But the  Mercy of your Lord is better that whatever they accumulate.&#8221; </em>[Soorah az-Zukhruf 43:32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Poet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Should it not be said to the one who was envious of me,  &#8220;Do you not know whose rights you have violated?&#8221;<br />
He has violated the rights of Allaah with his action  because he was not contented with what he was given. So becasue of this, Allaah increased me (in good) and refused your supplications because of your insolence.&#8221; </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is very important that the envious people be neglected as mentioned by the poet:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;Remain patient upon the envy of the jealous, for indeed patience will deter them. Indeed the fire will devour itself if it does not find anything else to burn.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-align:justify;line-height:1.5em;">Certainly, Allaah has commanded His Prophet to seek refuge from the envious one when He says: </span><br style="text-align:justify;line-height:1.5em;" /><em style="text-align:justify;line-height:1.5em;"><br />
&#8220;Say, I seek refuge in the Lord of the daybreak. From  the evil of that, which He has created. And from the evil of the darkness when it settles. And from the evil of those who blow on the knots. And from the evil of the envier when he envies.&#8221; </em><span style="text-align:justify;line-height:1.5em;"> [Soorah al-Falaq 113:1-5] </span><br style="text-align:justify;line-height:1.5em;" /><br style="text-align:justify;line-height:1.5em;" /><span style="text-align:justify;line-height:1.5em;"> In addition, Jibreel (Gabriel) recited a Ruqyaa (293) on the Prophet (sallAllahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) for everything that might harm him and this included the envious person. </span><br style="text-align:justify;line-height:1.5em;" /><br style="text-align:justify;line-height:1.5em;" /><span style="text-align:justify;line-height:1.5em;"> Muhammad ibn Abee &#8216;Umar al-Makkee told us that &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez ad-Daraawardee told us upon the authority of Yazeed (who is Ibn &#8216;Abdullaah ibn Usaamah ibn al-Haad) from Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem from Aboo Salamah ibn &#8216;Abdur-Rahmaan from &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah &#8211; the wife of the Prophet (sallAllahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) that she said, &#8220;If the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) used to complain of something, Jibreel (Gabriel) used to recite to him the following Ruqyaa: </span><br style="text-align:justify;line-height:1.5em;" /><br style="text-align:justify;line-height:1.5em;" /><span style="text-align:justify;line-height:1.5em;">  &#8216;In the Nmae of Allaah, may He heal you, and from every  ailment, may He cure you, and from the evil of the envier  when he envies; and from the influence of the eye.'&#8221; (294) </span><br style="text-align:justify;line-height:1.5em;" /><br style="text-align:justify;line-height:1.5em;" /><strong style="text-align:justify;line-height:1.5em;">The Levels of Envy</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- From them is the one who exerts effort to remove the blessings of the person who is envied by way of transgression upon him with statements and actions. Then from these people are those who exert themselves in an effort to acquire what has been removed from the person against who was transgressed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- From them is the one who restricts his efforts to removing the blessings of the person who he envies without acquiring anything from him. This is the more evil and despicable of the two. This blameworthy envy is prohibited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- Another group from amongst the people, if they happen to envy another person, they do not act in accordance ith their envy. These people do not transgress against the person who is envied by way of their statements nor their actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- Another group of people, if they find within themselves envy, they strive hard to remove it with kindness to the one whom they have envied by initiating goodness towards him and by supplicating for him, and spreading news of his good qualities. They do all of this in an effort to remove what they found in themselves of envy until this envy eventually changes because of their desire to be a better Muslim. This is from the highest degrees of belief and the possessor of this is a complete believer who loves for his brother what he loves for himself.  (295)</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">By the Shaykh Muhaddith Allaama Rabee&#8217; bin Hadi bin Umayr al-Madkhalee<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s Introduction</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise belongs to Allaah the Lord of the Heavens and the Earth, peace and blessings be upon His Prophet, the Prophet’s family, his Companions and all those who follow his way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following is a translation of a lecture which the noble <em>Shaykh</em> – may Allaah reward him with goodness &#8211; delivered in the blessed city of the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.   This lecture, which is available in tape form, was transcribed and adapted into a booklet[1] and published in 1426 A.H.  Due to the immense importance of the topic and the deep wisdom of the <em>Shaykh</em> we place it forward in the hands of our brothers and sisters by Allaah’s permission to promote the correct <em>Dawa’</em> on the understanding of the <em>Manhaj as-Salafiee</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah to bless and protect our noble <em>Shaykh</em> and all the noble scholars of Islaam and reward them on our behalf with a great reward amongst the righteous in His uppermost Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p>In the Name of Allaah the Most Kind the Most merciful</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed all Praise belongs to Allaah, we praise Him, we seek His aid and we seek His forgiveness.  We seek refuge in Him from the evil of ourselves and the evil of our actions. Whomsoever Allaah guides, there is none to misguide him, and whomsoever Allaah leaves astray then there is none that can guide him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em>, Alone without any partner, and I testify that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Fear Allaah as He should be feared and dare not die except in a state of Islaam with complete submission to Allaah.</span></strong> &gt;&gt; [al-Imraan: 102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O mankind! Be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person (Adam) and from him He created his wife and from them both He created many men and women.  And fear Allaah through Whom you demand your mutual (rights) and do not cut the relations of the wombs (kinship). Surely, Allaah is Ever an All­-Watcher over you.</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [an-Nisaa: 1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you who believe! Keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him and always speak the truth.  He will direct you to do righteous good deeds and will forgive you your sins.  And whosoever obeys Allaah and His Messenger he has indeed achieved a great achievement.</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [Ahzab: 70-71]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Amma ba’d:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the best speech is the Speech of Allaah, the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>&#8211; and the worst of the affairs are the innovated ones, every innovation is a <em>Bida’</em> and every <em>Bida’</em> is misguidance and every misguidance is in the Hellfire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Welcome &#8211; O my brothers for the sake of Allaah and O you noble students &#8211; those students of this distinguished knowledge who have made the journey from far distant places, to drink from the knowledge of the <em>Sharia&#8217;</em> which gushes forth from the Book of Allaah and from the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> at the place of descent of the revelation in the city of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.   Which is the second place of descent of the revelation after Makkah al-Mukkaramah the place from where the banners for the struggles and conquests were sent out to make the word of Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala –</em> uppermost, to spread this true religion and to make this <em>Deen</em> apparent over all the religions.  As Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala –</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">It is He Who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to make it victorious over all other religions even though the <em>Mushrikoon</em>(polytheists) hate it.</span></strong>&gt;&gt;[as-Saff:9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Allaah made this religion manifest at the hands of the noble, sincere Companions; the Companions of Muhammad   <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> &#8211; who conquered hearts with knowledge, guidance and Eemaan.  They conquered fortresses and lands with the swords of truth.  So they assisted the religion of Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em> with everything they had of strength, with everything that they were capable of sacrificing of wealth and souls.  They put into effect the objective which Allaah had intended for this <em>Deen</em>, that it prevail and that it be manifest above all religions.  This is because this religion stands upon guidance and upon knowledge not upon desires, ignorance, foolishness and chaos &#8211; which has now become predominant in many countries!  &#8211; There are those people whose <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> is not built upon the Book of Allaah nor upon the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah, rather their <em>Dawa’</em> stands upon the following desires, except those whom Allaah  <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em> has protected.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Islaamic University &#8211; along with those who are responsible for it and those who founded it &#8211; came to realize the reality of the Muslims and what they live in of ignorance and their being far from the true <em>Manhaj</em> of Allaah &#8211; except for a few &#8211; in the Muslim world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed this University was founded upon correct Islaamic methodologies, which spring forth from the Book of Allaah and from the Sunnah of theMessenger of Allaah – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam</em>.  There were about four fifths of those accepted to the University from the sons of the rest of the Islaamic world and 20 in every 100 from the sons of the country of the two holy Islaamic sites so that those who come to the place of the descent of the revelation to receive pure knowledge could return to their countries to disseminate this knowledge, this goodness and this guidance which they had learnt:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#008000;">Of every group of them, a party only should go forth, that they (who are left behind) may get instructions in (Islaamic) religion, and that they may warn their people when they return to them, so that they may beware (of evil).</span></strong> &gt;&gt; [at-Taubah: 122]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a great opportunity for you, so take advantage of it and come closer to the pure and clear beneficial knowledge which is derived from the Book of Allaah and from the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, since its sources are abundant and all praise belongs to Allaah &#8211; in this city and in this university.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever wishes truth and goodness  &#8211; for himself, his family, his people and country &#8211; then it is upon him to become serious and acquire knowledge from those of the scholars who are present; those who have given their own selves to learning this truth and disseminating it, <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">The Correct Sources of Knowledge</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is upon him to learn from the sources which contain the correct beliefs and correct methodologies, to read the <em>Salafi Tafseer</em> books, which are based upon the <em>Tafseer</em> of the Book of Allaah by the Book of Allaah, by the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah and by the <em>Fiqh</em> of the noble Companions those who lived through the descent of the revelation and were present at the time of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> and lived with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They knew the aim of the Book and the Sunnah. They are the ones whose <em>Fiqh</em> should be held on to as they preserved the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam</em><em>.  </em>This is why the noble Messenger – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam &#8211;</em> when he spoke about splitting up into sects and spoke about the <em>Firqaat-Un Najeeyah</em> said: &#8216;Those who are upon what I am upon and my Companions.'[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this <em>Fiqh</em> of the true <em>Deen</em> of Allaah which the noble Companions had &#8211; which they acquired from the Book of Allaah and from the Sunnah of theMessenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, from his sayings, actions, his teachings and his directives – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam –</em> it is obligatory upon us to take it as our reference.  The Companions are the intended believers in the saying of Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala -:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been shown clearly to him and follows other than the believers&#8217; way. We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and burn him in Hell &#8211; what an evil destination. &gt;&gt; [an-Nisaa: 115]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a severe threat to the one who contends with Allaah and His Messenger and follows a path other than that of the believers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So pay attention to this matter and strive to understand the way of the believers which they derived from the Book of Allaah, the Sunnah of theMessenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam </em>&#8211; and from his purifying and educating them upon the Book and the wisdom <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a great opportunity for you; understand from it the true <em>Deen</em> of Allaah and strive earnestly to make it apparent over all religions with proofs and evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is upon you to seek knowledge from its original watering sources; from the <em>Salafi</em> books of <em>Tafseer</em>, from the <em>Salafi</em> books of <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em>, which gush forth from the Book of Allaah and from the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah –<em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam</em>.  The difference between the way of the truthful believers and the way of the innovating discriminators of the true <em>Manhaj</em> of Allaah will become clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They &#8211; I swear by Allaah &#8211; are the protectors of this <em>Ummah</em> upon the <em>Deen</em> of Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em>, they had the correct <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em> and <em>Manhaj</em> and they were firmly upon what Muhammad <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> came with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From what is understood principally, is that it is obligatory upon us to follow the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> to hold on firmly to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> and to bite onto that with our molar teeth, just as the Messenger of Allaah mentioned &#8211; when he gave an eloquent sermon whereby tears fell and the hearts trembled  &#8211; the Companions requested him to give them some advice they said ; O Messenger of Allaah it is as if this is a farewell sermon, so advise us, he said: ‘I advise you to fear Allaah&#8230;&#8230;.’  pay attention to this advice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘….to hear and obey, whoever lives from amongst you will see many differences so it is upon you to hold on to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly guided <em>Khulafah</em>, bite on to it with your molar teeth, beware of newly invented matters, for every newly invented matter is a <em>Bida</em>’ and every <em>Bida’</em> is misguidance.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s note: Due to the saying of the noble Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> ‘Whoever does not thank the people does not thank Allaah.’ As narrated by Abee Sa’eed, &amp; authenticated by al-Albaani in as-Saheehah, I say that may Allaah reward with all goodness in this life and in the Hereafter the brother who facilitated us with the booklet and aided us in its translation.  And to our editor, may Allaah enter her into the highest grades of His Paradise among the Prophets, the Companions and the righteous for all her efforts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The headings were added for further clarity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Narrated by Tirmidhi (2641) from the hadeeth of Abdullaah bin ‘Amr –radhiAllaahu anhu- &amp; regarded as Hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’ (5343).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Narrated by Abu Daawood (4607), Tirmidhi (2676) &amp; Ibn Majah (42) from the hadeeth of al-Irbaad bin Saariyah –radhiAllaahu anhu &#8211; &amp; it was authenticated by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’ (2549).</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Part 2</strong></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">The Station of <em>Taqwa</em> and <em>Ihsaan</em></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this sermon consists of the advice to fear Allaah, which is necessary and it is not exemplified except in the lives of the righteous, truthful scholars as in the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allaah. &gt;&gt;[Fatir: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fear Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em> so you can reach this level and learn so that you can reach that status; because the one who knows the correct <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em>, <em>Manhaj</em> and rulings, manners and behaviour springing from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> then he is the one who fears Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em> and <em>Taqwa</em> is attained with all of these matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when these matters &#8211; which we have mentioned – are acknowledged then the slave is driven to the <em>Taqwa</em> of Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em>, to having fear of Him and being aware of Him in every time, place and situation.  This is a great station which is the station of <em>al-Ihsaan</em> (perfection of worship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;That you worship Allaah as if you see Him and if you cannot see Him then know that He sees you.'[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This station of <em>al-Ihsaan</em> (perfection of worship) is that a person has certainty that Allaah sees him and that Allaah hears all he says and hears; the beating of his heart, the feelings of his heart and what he thinks to himself.   Allaah<em>Subhanahu Wa Ta’ala</em> knows it and hears it and He sees his movements and when he is still.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the true believer regards Allaah with true greatness and he acknowledges that Allaah <em>Subhanah</em> hears everything that he says and knows everything he discusses, or thinks to himself and that Allaah has:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Angels <em>Kirâman </em>(honourable)<em> Kâtibîn</em> writing down (your deeds). They know all that you do. &gt;&gt; [al-Infitar: 11-12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if these distinguished feelings are found in the soul of a believer then he has acquired the characteristic of <em>Taqwa</em> which causes him to keep away from sinning, <em>Shirk, Bida&#8217;</em> and superstitions and he acquires the station of <em>al-Ihsaan</em>(perfection of worship) since he is aware of Allaah and he feels that Allaah sees him and he cannot hide anything of his affairs from Allaah not a little nor a lot, not even the like of an atom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a noble awareness and distinguished feeling which pushes one <em>-InshAllaah &#8211;</em> to the <em>Taqwa</em> of Allaah.  This cannot be reached except for the one who knows the correct <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em>, the correct rulings of <em>Halaal</em> and <em>Haraam</em> and knows the commands and prohibitions, the promise and the warnings from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam</em><strong><em>.  </em></strong>They are the ones who deserve the praise of Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala –</em> He said; about them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allaah.&gt;&gt; [Fatir: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Allaah will exalt in degree those of you who believe and those who have been granted knowledge. &gt;&gt; [al-Mujadilah: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So strive to be from these types of people: i.e. that you combine knowledge and action.  That is the fruit of correct knowledge and having the <em>Taqwa</em> of Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em> and being aware of Him.</p>
<h1 style="text-align:justify;">The Call to Allaah</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is upon you O brothers to acquire the pure, truthful Eemaan, beneficial knowledge and righteous actions.  Our Lord <em>–Jal Sha’anahu-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; By <em>Al-&#8216;Asr</em> (the time). Verily! Man is in loss, except those who believe and do righteous good deeds, and recommend one another to the truth and recommend one another to patience&gt;&gt; [al-Asr: 1-3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Truthful Eemaan is only built upon knowledge.  Righteous actions do not emanate except from knowledge. <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> to Allaah cannot be set forth with it (i.e. knowledge) except by the people of knowledge and being patient with harm <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em> &#8211; is required for the one who has learnt, teaches and calls to Allaah  <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So be from those who know and believe in this knowledge, those who call to this knowledge and Eemaan and are patient with harm in the path of conveying this truth and goodness to the people.  Indeed a believing Muslim caller to Allaah will face harm the likes of which never even crossed his mind and nor had he anticipated!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A believer is not dazed by this since he is harmed in the way of Allaah and the best of Allaah’s creation were harmed in the path of <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> to Allaah although they were the Prophets and the noble Messengers <em>&#8211; alayhim as-sallam &#8211;</em> and they were harmed more than us.  They were tried with severe enmity and hatred more than we are and this is the meaning of the saying of the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam </em>: &#8216;The people with the severest trials are the Prophets, then the righteous people then their likes and their likes.'[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> saying: &#8216;No one was harmed for the sake of Allaah like I was harmed.'[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever holds fast to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah and calls to it, will definitely be harmed &#8211; except if Allaah wills &#8211; so accustom yourself to patience:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Only those who are patient shall receive their rewards in full, without reckoning. &gt;&gt; [az-Zumar: 10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah ordered His Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> to take the great Prophets as an example and to be patient in the field of <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> and striving just as the great Prophets were patient.  Allaah said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Therefore be patient as did the Messengers of strong will and be in no haste about them (disbelievers). &gt;&gt; [al-Ahqaf: 35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Narrated by Bukhari (50) &amp; Muslim (9) from the hadeeth of Abu Huraira – radhiAllaahu anhu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Narrated by Ahmad in his Musnad (1484) and it’s his wording. Also by Tirmidhi (2398) &amp; Ibn Majah (4023) from the hadeeth of Sa’ad bin Abee Waqqas – radhiAllaahu anhu &#8211; &amp; it was authenticated by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’ (992,994).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Narrated by Tirmidhi (2472) &amp; Ibn Majah (151) from the hadeeth of Anas –radhiAllaahu anhu &#8211; &amp; it was authenticated by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’ (5125).</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 3</h2>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">An Excellent Example</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we have in the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> and in all the Prophets of Allaah a good example.  The Messenger was commanded to take those Prophets before him as an example and to follow their guidance and we have been commanded to follow the guidance of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, and take him as an example:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a good example to follow forhe who hopes in (the Meeting with) Allaah and the Last Day and remembers Allaah much. &gt;&gt; [al-Ahzab: 21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This good example is complete in every matter which Muhammad <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> came with<em>;</em> so, he is an example in his <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em>, so we believe in that which he believed in; an example in his worship, so we worship Allaah making the religion sincerely for Him, following that which the noble Messenger – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam &#8211; </em>came with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is an example in great manners which perhaps many of the callers to Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em> and many of the youth have lost, much of it having been forgotten and some of the youth have forgotten it too.  Indeed Allaah has praised His Messenger – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam &#8211;</em> with eloquent praise and He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And verily, you are on an exalted standard of character &gt;&gt; [Qalam: 4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the caller to Allaah, the student of knowledge, the instructor and the guide all need to take the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> as an example in their <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em>, <em>Manhaj</em> and manners.  So if these matters are combined in the caller to Allaah or they are nearly complete then this <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> will be successful <em>&#8211; InshAllaah &#8211;</em> and the caller to Allaah will have presented it in the most beautiful and best form <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the caller to Allaah is deficient in the matters of his <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>, being deficient in having noble manners-from which is having patience, wisdom, gentleness, softness and other things which are important, which the <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> of the Messengers <em>–alayhim Sallat wa Sallam-</em> requires.  Then this is an apparent deficiency in his <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>.  So it is upon him to ensure he manifests those matters completely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps many of the people are negligent of this! And this harms the <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> of Salafiyyah and harms its people.  Since if these manners are neglected and the<em>Dawa&#8217;</em> is presented to the people in a way that they dislike and is made unpleasant and detestable by having harshness, severity and recklessness &#8211; and the likes of these things &#8211; then this is an obstacle to the <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> and to it being accepted.  Since these matters are even disliked in the affairs of the <em>Duniya</em> let alone in the matters of the <em>Deen</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is necessary for the student of knowledge to follow a path of righteous good manners in giving <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">The Manner of The Call</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is necessary for you &#8211; O brother &#8211; to take as an example the<em>Aathar</em> which are mentioned about the way of calling to Allaah; and that is done by studying the biography of the Messenger, studying his manners, studying his <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em> and studying his <em>Manhaj</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people do not care about the <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em> of the Messenger nor about his<em>Manhaj</em> and they follow other methodologies and beliefs, which Shaytaan fabricates for the people of <em>Bida&#8217; </em>and misguidance whom Allaah forsakes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are a few people who have been blessed enough to acquire the <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em>, but they are deprived of the <em>Manhaj</em>!  There are people who are blessed with the <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em> and the <em>Manhaj</em> but in their behaviour they end up neglecting the<em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em> and the <em>Manhaj</em>, the truth is with them &#8211; correct <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em> and correct<em>Manhaj</em> &#8211; but their behaviour and technique of giving <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> destroys the <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>and harms it!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So be careful of opposing the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> in his <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em>, his<em>Manhaj</em> and his <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>.  It is upon you to learn how he – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam &#8211;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">used to call the people and to find out about these prophetic instructions of wisdom, patience, gentleness, pardoning and forgiveness, softness, kindness and other matters alongside these.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Comprehend these O brothers and know that these are necessary in our <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>to the people; do not take one aspect of Islaam and neglect the other aspects, or take one aspect from the ways of giving <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> to Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em> and neglect the other aspects.  Since that harms the <em>Deen</em> of Allaah <em>-Azza wa Jal-</em> and it harms the <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> and its people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I swear by Allaah; the <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> of <em>Salafiyyah</em> in recent times &#8211; and in other times &#8211; was not spread except at the hands of people who were scholars, wise and gentle, who were the representation of the <em>Manhaj</em> of the Messenger – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam &#8211;</em> and they implemented what they were able to.  So Allaah caused them to be of benefit and the <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> <em>As-Salafiyyah</em> was widespread in many lands of the <em>Duniya</em> via their manners, knowledge and wisdom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the present time; we see that the <em>Dawa&#8217; As-Salafiyyah</em> is retreating and dwindling and that is not due to anything except the loss of their wisdom, rather the wisdom of the Messenger – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam &#8211;</em> foremost, and the loss of the likes of his gentleness, mercy, manners, kindness and softness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Aeysha cursed a Jew, so the Messenger of Allaah said to her: &#8216; O &#8216;Aeysha indeed Allaah loves kindness in all matters.'[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a scholar nowadays mentions this hadeeth to the youth, directing them to the correct <em>Manhaj</em> of giving <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> to Allaah, then they say: this is watering things down (<em>Tameea’</em>)!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If these noble manners are mentioned and cited as a reminder the likes of wisdom, kindness, softness, gentleness and pardoning -which are the necessary requirements for giving <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> to Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em> and they are attributes which attract the people to the correct <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>&#8211; then the result of this would be that the people would enter into the religion of Allaah in droves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These people, who try to change things, push the people away &#8211; in spite of the saying of the Messenger of Allaah: ‘Indeed there are those amongst you who repel.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> ‘Make things easy, and do not make things difficult, give good news and do not drive people away.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brothers: these people do not comprehend! Otherwise &#8211; I swear by Allaah &#8211; it obligates them to then brand the Messenger as one who waters things down<em>(Mumaya’)</em>! And that the Companions and the scholars of the <em>Ummah</em> watered things down <em>(Mumaya’een)</em>!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their claim of watering down necessitates that they – those who are upon this severity and destructive harshness &#8211; which has destroyed the <em>Dawatul Salafiyyah</em>&#8211; it necessitates, that they claim that the Messenger himself who calls to kindness, wisdom and softness is also watering things down <em>(Mumaya’)</em>, and we seek forgiveness from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I swear by Allaah; they do not want this nor do they intend the Messenger of Allaah in what they say!  But they lack understanding.  So it is upon them &#8211; from now on &#8211; to comprehend what results from these rulings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We, indeed &#8211; by Allaah, strive, debate, write, advise and call to Allaah <em>&#8211; Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em>with kindness and they regard us from those who water things down<em>(Mumaya’een)</em>, they do not want us to say: wisdom, softness and kindness!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed we have seen that harshness has destroyed the <em>Dawa’ As-Salafiyyah</em>, and torn its people apart, so what should we do?? I say: O brothers, when we see fires burning, do we leave them to burn more?? Or do we bring that which will extinguish these fires???</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was forced to &#8211; and this is my obligation &#8211; and I used to say this before today, but I concentrated upon this when I saw this destruction, and I saw these tribulations.  I say: it is upon you to have gentleness, it is upon you to have softness, it is upon you to have brotherhood and it is upon you to be merciful to each other.  Indeed this harshness has been directed towards the <em>Ahl -ul-Sunnah</em> themselves whereas they have left the <em>Ahl- ul- Bida&#8217;</em> and aimed at the<em>Ahl-ul Sunnah</em> with this destructive harshness and mixed it with oppression and false oppressive rulings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Be aware be very aware, lest you follow this path which will destroy you and destroy <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> <em>As-Salafiyyah</em> and it destroys its people.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 4</h2>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Said, The Messenger Said, The Scholars Said</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Call to Allaah <em>&#8211; Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em> with everything you have, with proofs and evidences in every place, with the words &#8216;Allaah said&#8217;, and &#8216;the Messenger of Allaah said&#8217; and aided with &#8211; after Allaah – with the speech of the scholars of guidance whom, both the <em>Ahul -ul &#8211; Sunnah</em> and the people of <em>Bida&#8217;</em> accept in their leadership and their status in Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I advise those brothers who go to Africa or to Turkey or to India or any other place that they should go with the phrase: &#8216;Allaah said, the Messenger of Allaah said and so and so from the scholars whom they respect said.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if, for example you went to Africa and you said: ‘Ibn Abdul Barr said, Malik said, so-and-so said.’  Even though the number of people who have corrupt beliefs is not small in number!  So if you come to them with the Book of Allaah <em>&#8211; Ta&#8217;ala </em>&#8211; and with the Sunnah of the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> then you should also bring the speech of the scholars so that they will listen to your speech and obey you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is wisdom, but if you come to them with just your own speech from yourself no-one will ever accept it from you. So it is necessary for you &#8211; after the speech of Allaah and the speech of His Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> that you connect it up with the speech of the scholars who have status in the hearts of the people and have a high station, those whom the people will not criticize nor their statements. So if you say: ‘Bukhari said’, you will find that they respect him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So for example: The <em>Soofeeyah</em> everywhere respect Bukhari and they respect Muslim.  They respect these two books (Saheeh al-Bukhari and Saheeh Muslim) and they respect these two Imams.  They respect Ahmad bin Hanbal, al-Awzaa’ee and Sufyaan ath-Thawree and other than them from the preceding senior people of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why there are ties between us and them where we meet up in the truth, so we enter into them from these channels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is from wisdom O brothers; you should not now, due to this, begin by saying: ‘Ibn Taymeeyah said’, even though he is an Imam; because the ignorant people do not know him and even if they knew him they are made to hate him from what they hear from their senior people, so they do not want him nor do they desire him <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>..</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should say :’Ibn Taymeeyah said’  amongst the <em>Salafiyeen</em> -those who respect him- but do not say amongst other people, for example ‘Ibn Taymeeyah said, Ibn Abdul Wahhab  said,’ because the ignorant person who is cultured amidst the people of <em>Bida&#8217;</em> runs away from this, so their shaykhs push them away.  So mention to them the names of the scholars whom they respect and hold in regard, because their leaders and their shaykhs misrepresent Ibn Taymeeyah and Ibn Abdul Wahhab and they misrepresent the scholars and leaders of the Dawa&#8217; as we previously mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So do not approach them from this angle, since it is not from wisdom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, approach them from the angle of: ‘Malik said, Sufyaan ath-Thawree</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">said, al-Awzaa’ee said, Ibn &#8216;Uyainah said, Bukhari said, Muslim said, in such-and-such volume on such-and-such page.’  So the likes of these, they will accept from you.  Then if they accept this from you, they will after that respect Ibn Taymeeyah, they will know that he is on the truth and they will respect Ibn Abdul Wahab and they will know that he is on the truth etc.<em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: this is a word of admonition, to follow the path of wisdom in calling the people to Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is from wisdom not to curse their <em>Jamaah</em> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And insult not those whom they (disbelievers) worship besides Allaah, lest they insult Allaah wrongfully without knowledge. &gt;&gt; [al-An’aam:108]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Journey to Sudan</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: when I went to Sudan, we stopped at Port Sudan.[1]  I was received by the youth of <em>Ansaar as-Sunnah</em> and they said to me: O shaykh we want to bring your attention to something.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: “Go ahead.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: “Say whatever you want, say: &#8216;Allaah said, the Messenger of Allaah said.&#8217; and attack with whatever you want of <em>Bida&#8217;</em> and misguidance; like supplicating to other than Allaah, slaughtering, vows and seeking help etc.  But do not mention: such-and-such sect, nor so-and-so shaykh.  Do not mention that the <em>Tijaaneeyah</em> are from the different sects, nor the <em>Batineeyah</em>, nor mention their leaders, but quote the <em>&#8216;Aqaaid</em> (beliefs); and you yourself will find that the truth will be accepted from you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: “fine.”  And I followed that way and found a great acceptance from the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not think &#8211; O student of knowledge &#8211; that it is from the complete, truthful<em>Manhaj</em> that it is necessary to curse their shaykhs and to defame them!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Allaah <em>Subhanahu</em> says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And insult not those whom they (disbelievers) worship besides Allaah, lest they insult Allaah wrongfully without knowledge. &gt;&gt; [al-An’aam:108]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So don&#8217;t curse the shaykh or say: &#8216;deviant!&#8217; or something similar! Or such<strong><em>&#8211;</em></strong>and<strong><em>&#8211;</em></strong>such <em>Tariqaa</em> (<em>Soofee</em> path)!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since, when they hear this they run away from you.  You will be sinful and will have pushed the people away then you will be those who cause the people to turn away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> sent Muadh and Abu Musa to Yemen he said: “Make things easy and do not make things difficult, give glad-tidings and do not push people away.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are from the ways in which there is ease and glad-tidings.  It does not cause the people to be driven away.  I swear by Allaah that I did not enter a masjid except that I saw joy on the faces of the people and I couldn&#8217;t exit the place due to the many people who came to me to shake my hand and invite me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the leaders of the <em>Soofeeyah &#8211; Shayaateen &#8211;</em> saw the danger of this way and this methodology in giving <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>, so they gathered together and conspired and strung some statements together with which to refute me.  They announced a lecture for me in a big field.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we all gathered in this field and I spoke, then their leader got up and commented upon what I said, he began to allow seeking help from other than Allaah, to allow <em>Tawwassul </em>(Seeking closeness to Allaah with Haram means), to speak with the denial of <em>Sifaat</em>, talking and talking &#8230;&#8230;.. Supporting all types of falsehood with an evil interpretation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he finished &#8211; he had no evidences, and he had mentioned weak and fabricated Ahadeeth and he mentioned sayings of Socrates.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: “O people, you have heard my speech and I say: ‘Allaah said, the Messenger said.  The well known scholars of the <em>Ummah</em> said.’  This man has mentioned fabricated Ahadeeth and did not support it with anything from the Qur&#8217;aan.  Did you hear: &#8216;Allaah said such-and-such in allowing seeking aid from other than Allaah?  And regarding the permissibility of <em>Tawwassul</em>?  Did you hear statements of the senior scholars like Malik and those like him?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You did not hear that, rather you heard fabricated and weak Ahadeeth and the statements of people who you know well to believe in superstitions.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this person who believed in superstitions began cursing and swearing.  And I began laughing, I did not curse him nor did I swear at him and I did not say anything more then: may Allaah bless you, may Allaah reward you, may Allaah reward you, may Allaah bless you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then we left, I swear by Allaah other than whom there is none worthy of worship except Him &#8211; the next day the people began talking in the <em>masajid</em> and the markets that the <em>Soofeeyah</em> were defeated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] This is an inference to a lecture that Shaykh Rabee’ gave in the city of Port Sudan in the year 1392 A.H.  This is just one of many of the evidences that Shaykh Rabee’ follows a moderate Manhaj &amp; has wisdom in giving Dawa’ to Allaah from the beginning of his life until today.  This is contrary to what some people claim that Shaykh Rabee’ follows a Manhaj of harshness. – Publisher’s Quote.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Narrated by Bukhari (3038) &amp; by Muslim (1733) from the hadeeth of Abu Musa al-Ashaari –radhiAllaahu anhu.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 5</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Guidance for the People</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So learn, O brothers, the correct methods of the <em>Sharia&#8217;</em>.  The aim is guidance for the people and the aim is conveying the truth to the hearts of the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brother, it is upon you to use all that you can from the ways of the <em>Sharia&#8217;</em> in the path of <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> to Allaah.  And we do not believe that the ends justify the means since this is from the characteristics of the people of <em>Bida&#8217;</em> who fell into &#8211; due to these characteristics &#8211; lying, twisting, circling around the subject and trickery.  Just as the Imam &#8216;Alee bin Harb al-Moosalee said: &#8216;Every person who follows his desire lies and he doesn&#8217;t care that he lies.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We don&#8217;t have any of these characteristics; we are the people of honesty and the people of truth.  We present the truth in a form and fashion which the people accept and it affects their hearts, may Allaah bless you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then we also went to &#8216;Kasla&#8217; in Sudan and <em>MashAllaah</em> the <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> was going smoothly and well and all praise belongs to Allaah, we spoke there and praise belongs to Allaah and Allaah made our speech beneficial.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then we went to &#8216;al-Ghazarif&#8217; it is a small city there and we rotated between all the <em>masajd</em> in that place.  The people said: there does not remain in this city except one <em>masjid</em>, which is with the <em>Tijaaneeyah</em>, which we cannot get to!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I SAID: &#8216;WHY NOT?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: &#8216;They&#8217;re prejudiced, severely prejudiced.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: &#8216;Let&#8217;s go to them and request permission, if they allow us to talk, we will convey the message and if they prevent us then we have an excuse in front of Allaah, it is not necessary that we face them with force and strength <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>..</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we went there and the imam led us in prayer.  After we finished it, I gave him Salaams and said to him, will you allow me to deliver a speech to these brothers?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8216;go ahead.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I spoke, called to Allaah, to Tawheed, to Sunnah and to other matters of knowledge.  I criticized some of the mistakes which are present, points of misguidance until I reached to the hadeeth of &#8216;Aeysha <em>–radhiAllaahu anha-</em> which is mentioned by Bukhari and Muslim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There are three things, whoever speaks with one of them then he has told a major lie against Allaah: whoever says: that Muhammad saw his Lord; then he has told a major lie against Allaah, whoever says: that Muhammad knows what will happen tomorrow; then he has told a major lie against Allaah’: and I mentioned the proofs for that &#8211; &#8216;and he who claims that Muhammad did not convey what was revealed to him; then he has told a major lie against Allaah.’[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Imam stood up &#8211; he was annoyed and he said to me: ‘I swear by Allaah that indeed Muhammad saw his Lord with his own eyes!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to him: <em>JazakAllaahu khair</em>.  As for ‘Aeysha &#8211; who is the most knowledgeable of the people about the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em>, she said: ‘whoever says: that Muhammad saw his Lord; then he has told a major lie against Allaah.’ If the Messenger of Allaah had seen his Lord he would have told her, but he did not tell her this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he began to make a din and press me, I said to him: ‘O my brother wait until I finish my talk, then after that ask about whatever you want.  That which I know I can answer, that which I do not know, I&#8217;ll say to you Allaah knows best.’  I left him and continued speaking, I don&#8217;t know if he remained or left.  I don’t know, I didn&#8217;t turn around towards him. Then I heard a man saying:  ‘I swear that what this man is speaking the truth!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I heard the same sentence again from somebody else and he added: &#8216;the man is saying: &#8216;Allaah said, the Messenger of Allaah said.&#8217; <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the <em>Adhaan</em> was called for the <em>Isha</em> prayer, so the talk ended.  The prayer was about to begin and the people began pushing me to lead them in prayer. So I said to them: &#8216;no way, I won&#8217;t lead you in prayer, the <em>Imam</em> will lead.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: &#8216;we swear by Allaah you will lead the prayer, we swear by Allaah you will lead the prayer.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: &#8216;OK&#8217; and I led them in prayer.  After we finished I left with the youth of<em>Ansaar as-Sunnah </em>and I asked them: &#8216;where did the <em>Imam</em> go?&#8217; They said: &#8216;They evicted him.&#8217; I said: &#8216;who evicted him?&#8217; they said: &#8216;we swear by Allaah his congregation evicted him.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED. &#8211; O BROTHERS &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a person comes and says that the <em>Tijaaneeyah</em> <em>al-Marganiyaah</em> are fools! They might slaughter him, not just evict him, but if you come to them with wisdom and gentleness <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em> then Allaah will make them benefit by this.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Advice to the Salafiyyoon</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brothers, use beneficial knowledge and solid proof and beneficial wisdom in your <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>. You should have all the noble and beautiful manners encouraged by the Book and the Messenger of guidance; indeed they are causes for victory and causes for success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You have to believe that the Companions did not spread Islaam or enter it into the hearts except with their wisdom and their knowledge more so than with their swords.  However, whoever enters into Islaam under the sword might not be firm, but whoever enters Islaam by way of knowledge, proof and evidence then this is what makes his Eemaan firm by Allaah&#8217;s permission and His assistance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is upon you to have these good methods and also to be serious about knowledge.  You have to be serious about <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Now &#8211; O brothers &#8211; I advise you with two issues:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: Brotherhood between all of <em>Ahl -ul-Sunnah</em>; So O you Salafees, disseminate the soul of love and brotherhood between yourselves.  Put into effect what the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> informed us of regarding the believers: ‘Like a building, some of its parts supporting others.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that they are: ‘Like a single body if one limb complains then the rest of the body suffers with fever and insomnia.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is how you should be O brothers: distance yourselves from the causes of splitting, I swear by Allaah indeed it is a dangerous evil and a disastrous disease.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: distance yourselves from the causes which lead to enmity, hatred, splitting up and dissension.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Keep away from these things; because this has become predominant nowadays at the hands of people, about whom only Allaah knows their condition and intent.  It has become predominant and has torn apart the youth in this country &#8211; whether in the university or other than it &#8211; or in the other parts of the <em>Duniya</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why?! Because those who are not from its people – neither in knowledge nor in understanding &#8211; entered into the arena of giving <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is possible that the enemies could have entered someone into the midst of the <em>Salafeeyeen</em> to tear them apart and split them up, and this issue is not unlikely, rather it can truly happen <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Strive to have brotherhood.  If any dissension has occurred between you, then both parties should make themselves forget what is past and start with a clean slate now.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say to the brothers: whoever falls short it is not allowed to debase him, nor destroy the one who is deficient.  Whoever makes a mistake amongst us we do not destroy him. <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em> &#8211; but we cure him with gentleness, wisdom and face him with love and friendship and all the rest of the righteous manners, along with the correct <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> until he repents.  And if there remains a weakness in him then we are not hasty with him, or otherwise, I swear by Allaah no one will remain, no one will remain!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are some people now who chase after the Salafis so much so that they reached the scholars and called them those who water things down <em>(Mumaya’een)</em>!! There is hardly any scholar in the arena of <em>Dawa’</em> today except that he has been falsely attacked with this claim about him!  Of course this is the way of the Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen and the way of <em>Ahl-ul-Bida’</em> since, from the weapons of the <em>Ahl ul-Bid</em>a’ is that they begin by overthrowing the scholars, rather it is the Jewish Masonic way: that if you wanted to discredit an idea, then discredit their scholars or their personalities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So keep away from this rotten legacy and have respect for the scholars.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">And I swear by Allaah; that those who make efforts in speech against me &#8211; or attack that which we are upon – do not do so except that the intended result is to bring down the <em>Manhaj</em>; so the one who dislikes this <em>Manhaj</em> speaks about its scholars.  He who hates this <em>Manhaj</em> and wants to bring it down follows this path, so that there are no obstacles for them: they follow way of the Jews and the way of the misguided groups from the Raawafidah and other than them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Raawafidah hate Islaam and they are not capable of speaking against Muhammad &#8211;<em> sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, so they speak against Abu Bakr and Umar and the scholars of the <em>Ummah</em>; they want to overthrow Islaam.  If the people of major <em>Bida&#8217;</em> speak: then they don&#8217;t speak against Ahmad and Shafi&#8217;, but they speak against Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab and Ibn Taymeeyah and their likes; so that they can try to overthrow this <em>Manhaj</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And now, we have people who have grown up amongst the ranks of the<em>Salafeeyeen</em>, I was not aware that they wanted to break up the leaders from amongst the scholars!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These people, what do they want? What do they want? If they intend Allaah and the Hereafter and intended to aid this <em>Manhaj</em> – they claim to love this<em>Manhaj</em> – but I swear by Allaah, if they really loved it they would have defended the scholars of this <em>Manhaj</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So do not feel safe about your <em>Deen</em> with these people.  Do not regard them as trustworthy. <em>BarakAllaahu Feekum</em> &#8211; be completely careful of them, hold together firmly and have brotherhood amongst yourselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I know that you are not without blame, nor are the scholars without blame – we sometimes make mistakes with the exception of those who fall into <em>Rafd</em> or<em>‘aatizal</em> or <em>Tajahum</em> or fall into <em>Hizbeeyah</em> from the different parties which are present; then this person is the one to be abandoned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <em>Salafi</em> who has allegiance to the <em>Salafeeyeen</em> and loves the <em>Salafi</em><em>Manhaj</em> <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>&#8211; and dislikes the different groups, dislikes <em>Bida’</em> and its people – amongst other aspects from the signs of the <em>Salafi</em> <em>Manhaj</em> – but then this <em>Salafi</em> becomes weak in other points, here we are gentle with this person we do not leave him but we advise him and we rescue him and we are patient with him and we try to cure him <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it were said: whoever makes a mistake is destroyed! Then according to this statement no-one remains! This is why you see these people, when they have finished dealing with the youth; they begin by overthrowing the scholars – this is the <em>Manhaj</em> of the Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen when they entered into many countries.  The first thing they started with was overthrowing the scholars and at the same time they defend Sayyid Qutb, Hasan al-Banna, Mawdudi and others from amongst <em>Ahl –ul Bida’</em>.  They overthrow the scholars of the <em>Salafi Manhaj</em> and they described the scholars as being agents and spies and scholars of the rulers……and many other accusations!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is their intent!?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their intent is to overthrow the <em>Salafi</em> <em>Manhaj</em> and to establish falsehood and misguidance upon mutiny.   Those who now defame the scholars say that they themselves are the <em>Salafiyoon</em> yet, along with that, they criticize the scholars of the <em>Salafiyyah</em>!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What do they want? Do they want to raise the banner of Islaam!? And raise the banner of the Sunnah and the <em>Manhaj</em> <em>as-Salafi</em>?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Never, never!  These are indications and proofs that they are blameworthy liars, no matter what they claim for themselves.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Final Counsel</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I advise you O brothers and I emphasize that you leave off splitting and that you should have brotherhood and mutual cooperation upon the truth. You should spread this <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> between the students of the university and other than them in its correct and beautiful form, not in the distorted form which these people follow!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Present the <em>Dawa&#8217; as-Salafiyyah</em> as I mentioned in a beautiful form with the words; ‘Allaah said, the Messenger of Allaah said, the Companions said, Shafi&#8217; said, Ahmad said, Bukhari said, Muslim said’, also the scholars of Islaam whom they respect and revere, bring their attention to the speech of the scholars <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em> this will aid you a great deal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Of course, you will find some people who will be obstinate but not everyone is obstinate.  You will find most of the people accepting your <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> whether it is here in the university or when you return to your countries. Use these methods which attract the people to the Book of Allaah and to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em>, to the <em>Manhaj</em> of the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em>, to the correct beliefs and correct <em>Manhaj</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka  wa Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em> that He gives us and you capability and success in that which He loves and is pleased with and that He makes us from the sincere callers and practising scholars and keeps us and you away from the plots of<em>Shaytaan</em>, also from the plots of the <em>Shayateen</em> from <em>Jinn</em> and mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Him <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em> that He puts love between your hearts and gathers you upon the truth, that you are beneficial wherever you reside and wherever you travel and go to, and I ask Allaah to make that a reality.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his Family, his Companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>
