<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Difference between Kufr and Shirk</strong></span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: A Muslim sister N. S. `A from Riyadh says: What is the difference between Kufr (disbelief) and Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship)? Please, advise. May Allah reward you!</span></strong></p>



<p><strong><span style="color:#808080;">Answer by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah):</span></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Kufr</strong> </span>is the denial and concealment of the Truth such as those who deny the obligation of Salah, Zakah, Sawm, Hajj in case of being financially and physically able, and dutifulness to one&#8217;s parents, and so on.&nbsp;It is also like those who deny the prohibition of Zina (premarital sexual intercourse and/or adultery), consuming Khamr (intoxicants), and disobeying one’s parents.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Shirk</span> </strong>is to devote the acts of worship to anything beside Allah (Exalted be He) such as those who seek the help of the dead, the absent, the Jinn, idols, the stars, and so on or those who offer sacrifices or make vows to them.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">A Kafir (disbeliever) may be called a Mushrik (one who associates others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and vice versa. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says,</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever invokes (or worships), besides Allâh, any other ilâh (god), of whom he has no proof; then his reckoning is only with his Lord. Surely! Al­Kâfirûn (the disbelievers in Allâh and in the Oneness of Allâh, polytheists, pagans, idolaters) will not be successful.</span></strong>&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Allah (may He be Praised) also says, <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily, whosoever sets up partners (in worship) with Allâh, then Allâh has forbidden Paradise to him, and the Fire will be his abode.&#8221;</span></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In Surah Fatir, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says, <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Such is Allâh, your Lord; His is the kingdom. And those, whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmîr (the thin membrane over the date­stone). If you invoke (or call upon) them, they hear not your call; and if (in case) they were to hear, they could not grant it (your request) to you. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will disown your worshipping them. And none can inform you (O Muhammad ملسو هيلع اللها ىلص) like Him Who is the All­Knower (of everything).&#8221;</span> </strong>Here, Allah (Exalted be He) names their call upon things other than Him as Shirk and in Surah Al­Mu&#8217;minun, Allah (Exalted be He) names it Kufr.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In Surah Al­Tawbah, Allah (Glorified be He) says, <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;They (the disbelievers, the Jews and the Christians) want to extinguish Allâh’s Light (with which Muhammad ملسو هيلع اللها ىلص has been sent ­ Islâmic Monotheism) with their mouths, but Allâh will not allow except that His Light should be perfected even though the Kâfirûn (disbelievers) hate (it). It is He Who has sent His Messenger (Muhammad ملسو هيلع اللها ىلص) with guidance and the religion of truth (Islâm), to make it superior over all religions even though the Mushrikûn (polytheists, pagans, idolaters, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh) hate (it).&#8221;</strong></span> Here, Allah (Exalted be He) calls the disbelievers as Kuffar and Mushriks. This indicates that a Kafir may be called a Mushrik and vise versa. There are many Ayahs and Hadith that stress the same meaning.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Verily, between a man and Shirk and Kufr is the negligence of prayer.</strong></span>&#8221; (Related by Muslim in his Sahih (authentic) book of Hadith on the authority of Jabir Ibn `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with them).He (peace be upon him) also said, &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The covenant that distinguishes between us and them (the hypocrites) is Salah. Anyone who abandons it is a Kafir.</strong></span>&#8221; (Related by Imam Ahmad, Abu Dawud, Al­Tirmidhy, Al­Nasa&#8217;y, and Ibn Majah with a Sahih chain of transmission on the authority of Buraydah ibn Al­Hasib, may Allah be pleased with him).May Allah grant us success!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q3: What is the ruling on amulets consisting of the Qur’an and other things? </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullah):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Amulets that consist of other than the Qur’an such as bones, talismans, cowrie shells, wolf’s hair and the like are all evil and Haram (prohibited) by the Nas (Islamic text from the Qur’an or the Sunnah)</strong></span>. It is not permissible to hang them on anybody or anything, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “Anyone who wears an amulet, may Allah not fulfill it (i.e., their purpose) for them, and whoever wears a cowrie shell, may Allah not give them peace.” And in another narration, he (peace be upon him) said, “Anyone who wears an amulet has committed Shirk (associated others with Allah in His Divinity or worship).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, if amulets consist of the Qur’an or well­known good supplications, this is a controversial matter among the scholars. Some say that such amulets are permissible. This opinion was reported from a group of the Salaf (righteous predecessors) who likened it to recitation (of some Qur’anic Ayahs and supplications) over sick people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Others say that it is not permissible. This opinion is supported by ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud and Hudhaifah (may Allah be pleased with them both). A group of the Salaf and the righteous successors said it is not permissible to tie amulets even if they are from the Qur’an in accordance with the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>principle of Sadd­ul­Dhara’i (blocking the means leading to sins)</strong> </span>and to forestall acts of Shirk and to act upon the general meaning of the Hadiths. This is because the Hadiths that prohibit amulets are general and make no exception. Muslims should abide by the general ruling. Therefore, it is basically not permissible to use any kind of amulets in order not to permit people to use some other types of amulets, thus leading to confusing matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory to prohibit all types of amulets and this is the soundest opinion for the obvious evidence supporting it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If we permit the use of amulets made from the Qur’an and good supplications, it will open the door for people to wear any form of amulets they like</strong></span>. Then, if they are reproved for what they do, they will say that they are amulets consisting of the Qur’an or good supplications. Consequently, the door will be opened, the hole will expand and all types of amulets (whether from the Qur’an or anything else) will be worn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There is another reason for their prohibition, which is the fact that people may enter the bathroom and other unclean places while wearing them</strong></span>. It is well­known that the Words of Allah (the Qur’an) are too sacred to be in such places and it is not appropriate to take them into bathrooms.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Ruling on swearing by the Prophet (peace be upon him)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">A questioner sent us a message that reads: Some people are used to swear by the Prophet (peace be upon him) and this has become customary for them, yet they do not take that as a belief. What is the ruling on this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ans by Imam Ibn Baz:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Swearing by the Prophet (peace be upon him) or any other part of creation is a grave <strong>Munkar</strong> (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect) and a form of <strong>Shirk</strong> (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). Thus, it is not permissible for anyone to swear but by Allah Alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported from Imam Ibn `Abdul­Bar (may Allah be merciful with him) that it is not permissible to swear by other than Allah. Besides, authentic Hadith are related in which the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade this and declared it to be an act of Shirk. One of these Hadith is the one related in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al­Bukhari and Muslim) from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Verily! Allah forbids you to swear by your fathers. If one has to take an oath, they should swear by Allah or else keep silent.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another wording reads:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">.<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>..they should swear by Allah or say nothing.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, Abu Dawud and Al­Tirmidhy related through an authentic Sanad (chain of narrators) from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Anyone who swears by other than Allah has become a Kafir (disbeliever) or Mushrik (one who associates others with Allah in His Divinity or worship).&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Anyone who swears by Amanah (trust) is not one of us.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are numerous Hadith on this issue, and it is obligatory for all Muslims not to swear by other than Allah. Again, it is not permissible to swear by any creature, no matter who it may be, according to the Hadith mentioned above as well as other Hadith. Hence, the one who is used to do so should be warned against that and his family members, companions and acquaintances should be warned against that as well. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Anyone among you who sees (an act of) Munkar should change it with his hand; if he could not (do it), he should do so with his tongue; and if he could not, (even) then he should abhor it from his heart, and that is the least (form) of Iman (Faith).</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Related by Muslim in his Sahih Book of Hadith)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, swearing by other than Allah is a form of <strong>minor Shirk</strong> (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship), based on the above quoted Hadith. It could even be a form of <strong>major shirk</strong> if the one taking oath has it in his heart that the one by whom he swears deserves glorification just as Allah deserves it or that he could be worshipped along with Allah, or any other similar disbelieving objectives.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah to endow all the Muslims with protection against that and to grant them understanding of His Religion and safety from all things that could bring about His Wrath; indeed He is All­Hearing, Ever­Near.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">31-Ruling on making Du&#8217;a&#8217; the dead</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: What is the ruling on those who make Du&#8217;a&#8217; (supplication) to the dead?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ans by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who make Du`a&#8217; (supplication) to the dead are Mushriks (those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). If they make Du&#8217;a&#8217; to the dead, idols, trees, stones, angels or jinn, they will be regarded as Kafirs (disbelievers) as making Du&#8217;a&#8217; to all these leads to one thing; namely, Kufr (disbelief that takes the Muslim out of Islam),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One thing that can be excluded from this ruling which is seeking help from his fellow Muslim brother or non-Muslim like buying a commodity from a non-Muslim, asking him to build a shop or mend a car while the person while he is alive. This case is considered to be exceptional and is not a kind of Shirk. It is similar to what Allah (Exalted be He) mentions in the story of Musa (Moses): <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(The man of his own) party asked him for help against his foe)</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one asks his fellow Muslim brother or the non-Muslim, who is present, to do something for him like building a house, mending the car, or plowing the land in return for something, or they agree upon doing something that is legally permitted, there will be nothing wrong as all these things are normal and can be done by human beings who are alive and present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But what is Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect) is making Du&#8217;a&#8217; to those who are not present and cannot hear him, the dead or a living person whom he thinks to be supernatural and has a mysterious power. This understanding leads him to think that if he makes Du&#8217;a&#8217; to this person for forgiveness and admittance to paradise, he will be able to do this because of something secret about this person. This is Munkar even if the person who is invoked besides Allah (Exalted be He) is living.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Sufis who worship their Shaykhs and their senior and prestigious persons who are dead. They ask them for help and make Du&#8217;a&#8217; to them to cure the sick. All these things are considered to be major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) <strong>even if the person whom they make Du`a&#8217; to is alive because they ask him something beyond his abilities</strong>. This behavior differs from asking a person to lend you something, build a house for you, cultivate some land, mend a car, bring your belongings from the car, and so on. All these things are normal and contain there is nothing wrong in them.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/09/21/explanation-of-four-rules-of-shirk-shaykh-muhammad-al-khumayyis/">Four Rules Regarding Shirk</a></strong></h3>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Section Three: The Second Rule Regarding Shirk</strong></p>



<p><b>[</b><b>Text from Imam Muhammad Ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab’s “Four Rules Regarding Shirk”]</b></p>



<p><strong>The Second Rule:</strong> They (i.e. the disbelievers) said: “We did not invoke them nor turn towards them except to seek nearness (to Allah) and (their) intercession. The proof for their seeking nearness (to Allaah) is His saying:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color: #000000">&nbsp;وَالَّذِينَ اتَّخَذُوا مِن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَاءَ مَا نَعْبُدُهُمْ إِلَّا لِيُقَرِّبُونَا إِلَى اللَّهِ زُلْفَىٰ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَهُمْ فِي مَا هُمْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَهْدِي مَنْ هُوَ كَاذِبٌ كَفَّارٌ</span></h2>



<p><span style="color: #008000">“And those who take protectors besides Him (say): ‘We don’t worship them except to bring us closer to Allaah.’ Verily Allaah will judge between them concerning that which they differ in. Verily, Allaah does not guide he who is a liar, a disbeliever.”</span> [Surah Az-Zumar: 3]</p>



<p>The proof for their seeking intercession is Allaah’s saying:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color: #000000">وَيَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مَا لَا يَضُرُّهُمْ وَلَا يَنفَعُهُمْ وَيَقُولُونَ هَٰؤُلَاءِ شُفَعَاؤُنَا عِندَ اللَّهِ</span></h2>



<p><span style="color: #008000">“And they worship besides Allaah things that harm them not nor benefit them. And they say: ‘These are our intercessors besides Allaah.’”</span> [Surah Yoonus: 18]</p>



<p>Intercession is of two types: Intercession that is negated and Intercession that is affirmed.</p>



<p>The Negated Intercession is that which is sought from someone other than Allaah in matters that no one has the ability to carry out except Allaah. The proof for this is Allaah’s saying:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color: #000000">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَنفِقُوا مِمَّا رَزَقْنَاكُم مِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِيَ يَوْمٌ لَّا بَيْعٌ فِيهِ وَلَا خُلَّةٌ وَلَا شَفَاعَةٌ ۗ وَالْكَافِرُونَ هُمُ الظَّالِمُونَ</span></h2>



<p><span style="color: #008000">“O you who believe! Spend of that which We have provided for you, before a Day comes when there will be no bargaining nor friendship nor intercession. And it is the disbelievers who are the wrong-doers.”</span> [Surah Al- Baqarah: 254]</p>



<p>The Affirmed Intercession is that which is sought from Allaah. The intercessor is one who is granted the honor of being able to intercede (by Allaah), while the one who is interceded for is the one whom Allaah is pleased with his statements and actions. (All of these occur) after Allaah’s permission is granted, as Allaah says:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color: #000000">&nbsp;مَن ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</span></h2>



<p><span style="color: #008000">“Who is it that will intercede in His presence except with His permission.”</span> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 255]</p>

<p><span style="color: #993300"><strong>Explanation from Dr. Muhammad Bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Khumayyis&#8217; explanation of <em><a style="color: #993300" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/09/21/explanation-of-four-rules-of-shirk-shaykh-muhammad-al-khumayyis/">Four Rules Regarding Shirk</a></em></strong></span></p>



<p><strong>Language</strong>:</p>



<p><em><strong>Zulfaa</strong> </em>means closeness; <em><strong>Shufa’aaunaa</strong> </em>(our intercessors) is the plural of <em><strong>shaafi</strong></em>’ and <em><strong>shafee</strong></em>’, and he is the one that gets in between (two parties) in order to bring some benefit or to repel some harm; <em><strong>Khillah</strong> </em>(friendship) mutual love.</p>



<p><strong>Explanation</strong>:</p>



<p>These disbelievers used as an argument for their supplicating and worshipping of other gods besides Allaah, the claim that they did not call unto them nor turn to them except for two reasons.</p>



<p><strong>First</strong>: So that these things (i.e. false gods) that they were worshipping could bring them nearer to Allaah. And Second: So that they may intercede for them before Allaah.</p>



<p>The proof for the first reason is Allaah’s saying:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color: #000000">وَالَّذِينَ اتَّخَذُوا مِن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَاءَ مَا نَعْبُدُهُمْ إِلَّا لِيُقَرِّبُونَا إِلَى اللَّهِ زُلْفَىٰ</span></h2>



<p><span style="color: #008000">“And those who take protectors besides Him (say): ‘We don’t worship them except to bring us closer to Allaah.’”</span> [Surah Az-Zumar: 3]</p>



<p>Meaning: We only supplicated to them and worshipped them so that they may serve as a means to gain nearness to Allaah and attain a high position with Him.</p>



<p>The proof for the second reason is Allaah’s saying:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color: #000000">وَيَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مَا لَا يَضُرُّهُمْ وَلَا يَنفَعُهُمْ وَيَقُولُونَ هَٰؤُلَاءِ شُفَعَاؤُنَا عِندَ اللَّهِ</span></h2>



<p><span style="color: #008000">“And they worship besides Allaah things that harm them not nor benefit them. And they say: These are our intercessors besides Allaah.”</span> [Surah Yoonus: 18]</p>



<p>Meaning: We only worshipped them so that they may intercede for us before Allaah in bringing about some good or repelling some harm.</p>



<p>Then the Shaikh explains that Intercession is of two types in the Book of Allaah. The first is an intercession that the Qur’aan has negated, rejected and restricted that it be achieved. And the second type is the Affirmed Intercession, which the Qur’aan has affirmed will occur on the Day of Judgement, based on the clear evidences.</p>



<p>As for the Intercession that Allaah has negated in His Book, when He said:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color: #000000">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَنفِقُوا مِمَّا رَزَقْنَاكُم مِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِيَ يَوْمٌ لَّا بَيْعٌ فِيهِ وَلَا خُلَّةٌ وَلَا شَفَاعَةٌ ۗ وَالْكَافِرُونَ هُمُ الظَّالِمُونَ</span></h2>



<p><span style="color: #008000">“O you who believe! Spend of that which We have provided for you, before a Day comes when there will be no bargaining nor friendship nor intercession”</span> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 254]</p>



<p>then it is the Intercession that is sought from other than Allaah in matters that no one has control over except Allaah, such as a person who seeks entrance into Paradise from other than Allaah, for example, or to be saved from the Hellfire. What also falls into the Negated Intercession is the Intercession that is done for those whom Allaah did not permit that intercession be granted to, such as the disbelievers, or the Intercession from someone that Allaah did not allow to intercede. As for the Affirmed Intercession, then it is that which is sought from Allaah and which occurs with His permission. So the one who intercedes, Allaah has granted him the honor of interceding. As for the one who is interceded for, he is the one whom Allaah is pleased with his statements and actions, after He has given His permission for him to be interceded for.</p>



<p>This is as Allaah says:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color: #000000">&nbsp;مَن ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</span></h2>



<p><span style="color: #008000">“Who is it that will intercede in His presence except with His permission.”</span> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 255]</p>



<p>The true intercession, which is the affirmed one cannot occur unless two conditions are first met:</p>



<p><strong>First</strong>: Permission for the intercessor to intercede, as is stated in the previous ayah.</p>



<p><strong>Second</strong>: Allaah must be pleased with the one being interceded for. This is as is stated in Allaah’s statement:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color: #000000"> وَلَا يَشْفَعُونَ إِلَّا لِمَنِ ارْتَضَىٰ وَهُم مِّنْ خَشْيَتِهِ مُشْفِقُونَ</span></h2>



<p><span style="color: #008000">“And they cannot intercede except for he whom Allaah is pleased with. And they stand in awe from fear of Allaah.”</span> [Surah Al-Anbiyaa: 28]</p>



<p>So due to this, all of the Intercession occurs by Allaah’s Permission and it is all in His Hand and Command, as Allaah says:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color: #000000">قُل لِّلَّهِ الشَّفَاعَةُ جَمِيعًا</span></h2>



<p><span style="color: #008000">“Say: To Allaah belongs all of the intercession.”</span> [Surah Az-Zumar: 44]</p>



<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>



<p>1. The disbelievers worshipped false gods besides Allaah seeking nearness (to Allaah) and intercession (from them) before Allaah.</p>



<p>2. Having good intention is not sufficient in the absence of following of the Sunnah.</p>



<p>3. Intercession is of two types: Affirmed and Negated.</p>



<p>4. The Conditions for Intercession are: (a) permission must be granted to the intercessor and (b) Allaah must be pleased with the one being interceded for.</p>



<p><strong>Examination:</strong></p>



<p>1. What is it that caused the disbelievers to worship other than Allaah? Provide evidence for your answer.</p>



<p>2. What are the types of Intercession? Give one proof for each type.</p>



<p>3. What are the conditions for the Affirmed Intercession?</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Section Five: The Fourth Rule Regarding Shirk</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[</b><b>Text from Imam Muhammad Ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab’s “Four Rules Regarding Shirk”]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Fourth Rule:</strong> The polytheists in our era are more severe in their (committing of) Shirk than the first polytheists (during the Prophet’s time). This was since the first polytheists used to ascribe partners to Allaah at times of ease and worship Him sincerely during times of hardship. However, the polytheists in our era constantly commit Shirk in times of ease as well as in times of hardship. The proof for this is Allaah’s statement:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>فَإِذَا رَكِبُوا فِي الْفُلْكِ دَعَوُا اللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ الدِّينَ فَلَمَّا نَجَّاهُمْ إِلَى الْبَرِّ إِذَا هُمْ يُشْرِكُونَ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And when they embark on a ship, they invoke Allaah making their Faith purely for Him alone. But when He brings them safely to land, behold they give a share of their worship to others.”</span> [Surah Al-‘Ankaboot: 65]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Explanation from Dr. Muhammad Bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Khumayyis&#8217; explanation of <em><a style="color:#993300;" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/09/21/explanation-of-four-rules-of-shirk-shaykh-muhammad-al-khumayyis/">Four Rules Regarding Shirk</a></em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Language</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><strong>Aghladh</strong> </em>(more severe) greater and stronger; <em><strong>Rakhaa</strong> </em>(times of ease) times of comfort and blessing; <em><strong>Shiddah</strong> </em>(hardship) difficulty and times when tribulations befall.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Explanation</span></strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the fourth and last rule, which is that the polytheists in our time, those who devote a share of their worship to other than Allaah, such as the righteous people that are buried in graves and so on. These people are greater in Shirk and stronger in disbelief than the first polytheists.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason for this is because the first polytheists would ascribe partners to Allaah during times of ease only, and as for times of hardness and difficulty, they would call sincerely out to Allaah (for help) and they knew that no one else could save them and that their (false) gods would not benefit them. What indicates this is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>فَإِذَا رَكِبُوا فِي الْفُلْكِ دَعَوُا اللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ الدِّينَ فَلَمَّا نَجَّاهُمْ إِلَى الْبَرِّ إِذَا هُمْ يُشْرِكُونَ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And when they embark on a ship, they invoke Allaah making their Faith purely for Him alone. But when He brings them safely to land, behold they give a share of their worship to others.”</span> [Surah Al-‘Ankaboot: 65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also Allaah’s saying:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ مَن يُنَجِّيكُم مِّن ظُلُمَاتِ الْبَرِّ وَالْبَحْرِ تَدْعُونَهُ تَضَرُّعًا وَخُفْيَةً لَّئِنْ أَنجَانَا مِنْ هَٰذِهِ لَنَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الشَّاكِرِينَ </span></strong><strong><span style="color:#000000;">قُلِ اللَّهُ يُنَجِّيكُم مِّنْهَا وَمِن كُلِّ كَرْبٍ ثُمَّ أَنتُمْ تُشْرِكُونَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Say: Who rescues you from the darkness of the land and sea (when) you call upon Him in humility and in secret (saying): ‘If He only saves us from this (danger), we will truly be grateful.’ Say: Allaah rescues you from this and from all other distresses, but yet you worship others besides Allaah.”</span> [Surah Al- An’aam: 63-64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these <em>ayaat</em> (verses) indicate that they would mix partners in their worship with Allaah during times of ease only. But as for times of hardship then they wouldn’t.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for those who commit Shirk in our time, then they indeed mix partners in Allaah’s worship in both these conditions. If some blessing and comfort befalls them, they rush to the graves, presenting them with sacrificial offerings and slaughtering animals at their sites. And they put forth thanks to the deceased buried within them and glorify them with praises.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if some calamity befalls them, they rush to these graves and seek help from them, supplicating to them and making oaths to them for such and such if this calamity is removed from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>We see this clearly going on at the graves that are worshipped besides Allaah, such as the grave sites of Husayn, Sayyidah Zaynab, ‘Abdul-Qaadir al-Jeelaani, Sayyid Al- Badawee and others.</strong> So it is clear that the Shirk that is committed by these latter-day polytheists is greater and worse than the Shirk that was done by the polytheists of old because it is a Shirk that is done constantly under every condition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this completes the objective of this treatise, thus all praise is due to Allaah, Lord of the Worlds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Summary</span></strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The polytheists of old used to mix partners in Allaah’s worship during times of ease and turn to Him in sincere worship during times of hardship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The polytheists of this era mix partners in Allaah’s worship in both conditions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The polytheists in our time are greater in their Shirk than the first polytheists.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Examination</span></strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. What is the difference between the polytheists in our time and the polytheists of old times?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Which of the two is greater in their Shirk: the polytheists of old or the polytheists of our time?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. What is the proof that the polytheists of old would commit Shirk during times of ease and not during times of hardship?</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Section Four: The Third Rule Regarding Shirk</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[</b><b>Text from Imam Muhammad Ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab’s “Four Rules Regarding Shirk”]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">The Third Rule:</span> </strong>The Prophet was sent to people that differed from one another in their worship. Among them were those who worshipped the angels. And among them were those who worshipped the prophets and righteous people. And among them were those who worshipped trees and stones. And among them were those who worshipped the sun and the moon. However, the Messenger of Allaah fought against (all of) them and did not differentiate between any of them. The proof for this is Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And fight against them until there is no more fitnah (trial, i.e. Shirk) and the Religion is all purely for Allaah alone.”</span> [Surah Al-Anfaal: 39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof of them worshipping the sun and the moon is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And among His signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon. Do not prostrate to the sun or the moon, but rather prostrate to Allaah who created them, if it is truly He whom you worship.”</span> [Surah Fussilat: 37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof that they worshipped the angels is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And nor did he order you to take the angels and prophets as lords (besides Allaah).”</span> [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 80]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof that they worshipped the prophets is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And when Allaah will say: ‘O ‘Eesaa, son of Maryam! Did you tell the people: Take me and my mother as gods besides Allaah?’ He will say: ‘Glory be to You, it is not for me to say what I have no right to say. Had I said such a thing, You would have surely known it. You know what is in my inner self yet I do not know what is in Your self. Verily, You re the All-Knower of the Unseen.’”</span> [Surah Al-Maa’idah: 116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof that they worshipped the righteous people is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Those whom they call unto (besides Allaah), they themselves seek the means of access to their Lord as to which of them will be the nearest (to Him). And they hope for His Mercy and fear His Torment.”</span> [Surah Al-Israa: 57]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof that they worshipped trees and stones is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> “Have you then considered Al-Laat and Al-‘Uzzaa, and Manaat, the third other?”</span> [Surah An-Najm: 19-20]</p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Explanation from Dr. Muhammad Bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Khumayyis&#8217; explanation of <em><a style="color:#993300;" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/09/21/explanation-of-four-rules-of-shirk-shaykh-muhammad-al-khumayyis/">Four Rules Regarding Shirk</a></em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Language:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fitnah (tribulation) here means Shirk; ‘<em><strong>alaamaat</strong> </em>(signs) proofs and indicators; <em><strong>yabtaghoon</strong> </em>(they seek) they look for; <em><strong>hudathaa ‘ahdin</strong> </em>(recently come out) close to that time; <em><strong>sidrah</strong> </em>(lote-tree); <em><strong>yanootoon</strong> </em>(hang on) cling onto.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) was indeed sent to a people who varied in their worship and differed in their religions. Among them were those that worshipped angels and (those that worshipped) prophets and righteous people, and those that worshipped trees and stones or the sun and the moon. So Allaah legislated for His Prophet to fight against them. Rather, He commanded him to do that without differentiating between any of them. He commanded him to fight against every one of them until all of the Religion (i.e. worship) became solely for Allaah and until islaam gained supremacy over all other religions. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And fight against them until there is no more fitnah (i.e. Shirk) and the Religion is all purely for Allaah.”</span> [Surah Al-Anfaal: 39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) fought against all of them until he brought them under the rule and laws of Islaam. From the texts that provide evidence that there existed those who worshipped the sun and the moon and that Allaah forbade them from doing that is His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And among His signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon. Do not prostrate to the sun or the moon, but rather prostrate to Allaah who created them, if it is truly He whom you worship.”</span> [Surah Fussilat: 37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the evidences that indicate that there existed those who used to worship the angels, and that Allaah forbade them from doing that, is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And nor did he order you to take the angels and prophets as lords (besides Allaah).”</span> [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 80]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from what makes it clear that there existed those who would worship the prophets and that this worship of theirs was false is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And when Allaah will say: ‘O ‘Eesaa, son of Maryam! Did you tell the people: Take me and my mother as gods besides Allaah?’ He will say: ‘Glory be to You.”</span> [Surah Al-Maa’idah: 116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So ‘Eesaa, peace be on him, will free himself from their worshipping of him and rule upon its falsehood. And from the proofs that show that there existed those who would worship the righteous people and the ruling that this is futile, is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Those whom they call unto (besides Allaah), they themselves seek the means of access to their Lord as to which of them will be the nearest (to Him). And they hope for His Mercy and fear His Torment.”</span> [Surah Al-Israa: 57]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the scholars of Tafseer said: There was a group amongst the Arabs that used to worship some individuals amongst the Jinn. Afterward, these Jinn accepted Islaam, but those people who worshipped them did not know this. So Allaah explains to them that those people whom you worship, they themselves seek nearness to Allaah, hoping for His reward and fearing His punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from that which indicates that there existed those who would worship the stones is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Have you then considered Al-Laat and Al-‘Uzzaa, and Manaat, the third other?”</span> [Surah An-Najm: 19-20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These were (false) gods that the polytheists of Makkah used to worship. They were statues that they had constructed and worshipped besides Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from that which indicates that there existed those who would worship trees is the hadeeth of Abu Waaqid Al-Laythee (radyAllaah ‘anhu) when some of the Companions went out with the Prophet during the battle of Hunayn. And among them were those who had just recently come out of disbelief, i.e. they had only become Muslims a little while before. So they saw a lote-tree that belonged to the polytheists, known as Dhaat Anwaat, which the polytheists would seek blessings from and hang their swords on. So they asked the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) to make for them a Dhaat Anwaat tree just like theirs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At this the Prophet said Allaahu Akbar, became very angry and was stern in his speech, forbidding them from this. He said to them: <span style="color:#808000;">“You have just said, by the One in whose hand my soul is, similar to what the companions of Moosaa said to him: ‘Make for us a god just as they have gods.’ He replied: ‘Verily you are a people given into ignorance.’”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Reported by Ahmad (5/218), ‘Abdur-Razzaaq (20763), At-Tayaalisee (1346), Al-Humaydee (848), At- Tirmidhee (2180) who said of it: “hasan saheeh” and others.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this hadeeth proves that there existed those polytheists who would worship trees. It also proves that believing in trees (i.e. that they have the ability to bring good or repel harm) amounts to disbelief. It also proves that even the noble and scholarly amongst people may fall into Shirk, while not being aware of it. It also proves that if a person utters a statement of disbelief while not knowing that it amounts to disbelief or intentionally doing it, he does not commit disbelief until he is fully aware (of what he is saying).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has declared all of these different types of worship false and futile. And He commanded His Messenger to fight against all of these people without differentiating between any of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Summary:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) was sent to various people with different religions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) fought against all of these people without differentiating between any of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. A Muslim does not commit disbelief by making a statement of disbelief if he says it unknowingly and unintentionally.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The truth may be unknown at times to the high ranking amongst people, not to mention the common folk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Examination:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. State some of the types of worship that existed at the time of the Prophet’s advent, giving one proof for each type.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Did the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) distinguish between the adherents of these various religions?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. What points of benefit can we derive from the hadeeth mentioned in this chapter?</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First Rule:</strong> You must know that the disbelievers whom the Messenger of Allaah fought against agreed that Allaah was the Creator and the Administrator. But this (belief) did not cause them to enter into the fold of Islaam. The proof for this is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ مَن يَرْزُقُكُم مِّنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ أَمَّن يَمْلِكُ السَّمْعَ وَالْأَبْصَارَ وَمَن يُخْرِجُ الْحَيَّ مِنَ الْمَيِّتِ وَيُخْرِجُ الْمَيِّتَ مِنَ الْحَيِّ وَمَن يُدَبِّرُ الْأَمْرَ ۚ فَسَيَقُولُونَ اللَّهُ ۚ فَقُلْ أَفَلَا تَتَّقُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Say: ‘Who provides for you from the sky and the earth, or who owns the hearing and the sight? And who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living? And who administers the affairs?’ They will surely say: ‘Allaah.’ Say: ‘Will you then not be dutiful to Him?’”</span> [Surah Yoonus: 31]</p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Explanation from Dr. Muhammad Bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Khumayyis&#8217; explanation of <em><a style="color:#993300;" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/09/21/explanation-of-four-rules-of-shirk-shaykh-muhammad-al-khumayyis/">Four Rules Regarding Shirk</a></em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Language:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Muqirroon</em> </strong>(agreed) means they acknowledged; <em><strong>Al-Mudabbir</strong> </em>(Administrator) The One who disposes of all affairs; <em><strong>tattaqoon</strong> </em>(dutiful) means putting a shield and a barrier between yourselves and what you fear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Explanation</strong><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first of these rules is: Knowing that the polytheists during the time of Allaah’s Messenger, from the disbelievers of Makkah and others, affirmed and acknowledged Allaah’s Lordship (<em>Ruboobiyyah</em>), which is to single Allaah out and make Him one with regard to His creating, administering and controlling of the universe. They did not ascribe partners to Him in these aspects. The proof for this is Allaah’s saying: <span style="color:#008000;">“Say: ‘Who provides for you from the sky and the earth, or who owns the hearing and the sight? And who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living? And who administers the affairs?’ They will surely say: ‘Allaah.’ Say: ‘Will you then not be dutiful to Him?’”</span> [Surah Yoonus: 31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also His saying:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ</span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">قُلِ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ ۚ بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And if you ask them: ‘Who created the heavens and the earth (?)’, they will certainly say: ‘Allaah.’ Say: ‘All praise be to Allaah.’ But most of them know not.”</span> [Surah Luqmaan: 25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>ayaat</em> that provide evidence for this are many. All of them make it clear that the polytheists acknowledged that Allaah alone was the only Creator, Provider and Administrator of all affairs. However, they ascribed and mixed partners with Him in worship, so this acknowledgement was of no benefit to them. And this did not cause them to enter into the fold of Islaam nor did it make their lives and wealth sacred (i.e. unlawful to be violated). Rather, the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) fought against them and made lawful (the taking of) their lives and their wealth because of that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They were <strong>not</strong> judged as being Muslims simply because they acknowledged and agreed to Allaah’s Lordship. Rather he (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) made their abiding by T<em>awheed Al-Uloohiyyah</em> (i.e. that worship is only for Allaah), acknowledging it and acting upon it as a condition for judging them as Muslims, withholding from causing harm to them, and sparing their lives.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Summary<span style="color:#993300;">:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The polytheists during the time of Allaah’s Messenger used to affirm and acknowledge Allaah’s Lordship (i.e. that He was the sole Creator and Administrator)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Acknowledging that Allaah is the one and only Lord (i.e. <em>Ruboobiyyah</em>) is not sufficient to affirm that an individual be judged as a Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Examination</strong><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. What was the stance the polytheists during the time of the Prophet took with regard to Allaah’s Lordship? Bring three ayaat that prove what you say.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. What was the stance Allaah’s Messenger took with regard to these polytheists during his time?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Is acknowledging that Allaah is the sole Creator and Administrator (<em>Ruboobiyyah</em>) enough to affirm that someone is Muslim? Provide evidence for your answer.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>What is Shirk?</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You may have already studied Tawḥīd. However, to truly understand Tawḥīd, its opposite, Shirk, must also be understood. The greatest thing Allah has commanded us to do is worship him alone, and the greatest sin he has forbidden is Shirk as He says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَلا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئً</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Worship Allah and do not make Shirk with anything along with him.</span> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is Shirk? Shirk (شِرْك) is an Arabic word which means <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>sharing something with others that only Allah deserves</strong></span>. Worshipping others along with Allah is the main type of Shirk. The verse above means we must worship Allah and only him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever worships someone or something instead of Allah, he is a disbeliever in Allah who has refused to worship him alone. If someone worships Him but also worships someone else along with Allah, he is still a disbeliever in Allah, and it is this person who makes Shirk. As for someone who worships Allah alone, he is a Muslim who sincerely believes in Tawḥīd.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shirk is the greatest sin against Allah and he says about it:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَقَدِ افْتَرَى إِثْمًا عَظِيمًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever makes Shirk with Allah has certainly made up a great sin</span>.[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shirk is also the worst of all major sins. Prophet Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) once asked his companions:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَلا أُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِأَكْبَرِ الْكَبَائِرِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Should I tell you the greatest of all major sins?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His companions said, “Of course, messenger of Allah.” He then said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الإِشْرَاكُ بِاللَّهِ وَعُقُوقُ الْوَالِدَيْنِ وَشَهَادَةُ الزُّورِ أَوْ قَوْلُ الزُّورِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Making Shirk with Allah, disobeying parents, and lying.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was laying back when he said that, but then he sat up and began repeating that over and over because of how serious Shirk and those other major sins are in Islam. [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) was also asked, “What is the greatest sin?” He answered:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَنْ تَجْعَلَ لِلَّهِ نِدًّا وَهُوَ خَلَقَكَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">That you make something equal to Allah while he is the (only) one who created you.</span> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Making someone or something equal to Allah is Shirk. It is to belittle Allah, believing him to be less than He is while believing others are equal to Him. About this, Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا بِرَبِّهِمْ يَعْدِلُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Those who disbelieve think others are equal to their Lord.</span>[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though Allah lets people choose to make Shirk and believe others are equal to Him, He does not like it and forbids us from doing so:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَلا تَجْعَلُوا لِلَّهِ أَندَادًا وَأَنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">So do not make anything equal with Allah while you know (that he alone should be worshipped).</span>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shirk is also to deny the very reason Allah created us which was to worship him alone as he says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالإِنسَ إِلاَّ لِيَعْبُدُونِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">I only created Jinn and people to worship me.</span>[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever worships others along with Allah, believing they deserve to be worshipped, they have made the creation equal to its creator. This is the worse comparison because it is to believe that people who are helpless and in need are equal to Allah, the one who is able to do anything and who needs nothing from any of his creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shirk is the greatest crime of injustice and unfairness. This is because the greatest rights are the rights Allah deserves. Yet when people make Shirk, they are refusing to give him what he deserves most &#8211; Tawḥīd. This is the greatest form of injustice and unfairness just like Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الشِّرْكَ لَظُلْمٌ عَظِيمٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Shirk is certainly a great crime of injustice.</span>[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shirk is also the greatest form of misguidance and straying from the right way of believing in Allah:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلالاً بَعِيدًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever makes Shirk with Allah has certainly gone far astray.</span>[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In short, Shirk is to share something that only Allah deserves with others such as worshipping others or describing others with Allah’s descriptions. It is the greatest sin against Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Review</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. What is Allah’s greatest command to us?<br />
2. What is the greatest sin against Allah?<br />
3. Explain in your own words the meaning of Shirk.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">SHIRK IN TAWḤĪD OF LORDSHIP</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you learned about Tawḥīd, you may remember there are three main categories. Let us review the categories of Tawḥīd before moving on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Tawḥīd of Lordship: Allah is the only one who creates, owns, and controls everything.<br />
2. Tawḥīd of Names and Descriptions: Allah is the only one who is described with his perfect names and descriptions.<br />
3. Tawḥīd of Worship: Allah is the only one who deserves worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shirk in Tawḥīd of Lordship is to believe that others besides Allah create or share control over his creation. This belief means that someone other than Allah can make good things happen or keep bad things from happening.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One example of this type of Shirk is to believe something brings good luck. People often have “good luck” rings or similar items they believe will help good things happen to them. Others tie special strings around them or their children, believing that if they recite the Qur&#8217;aan over the strings, they will protect from bad things happening. However, only Allah can protect us from bad things and we should only seek his protection in ways he mentions in the Qur&#8217;aan or the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) taught us in the ḥadīth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another common example of Shirk in Tawḥīd of Lordship today is when people believe others like themselves who are created and have no control in Allah’s universe can control what happens. Such people even wait until the ones they believe in are dead before worshipping them by praying to them. The act of praying to dead people is Shirk in Tawḥīd of Worship (which we will cover shortly), but the belief itself is also Shirk in Tawḥīd of Lordship because when people pray to dead people, they believe the souls of humans can control things in this life even after their death. This is completely wrong because the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) told us:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">When a person dies, his actions come to an end except for (receiving rewards for) three things: continuous charity, beneficial knowledge, or a righteous child who prays for him.</span> [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While a person may still receive rewards from Allah for things he left behind after he died, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) clearly told us that after death, a human being’s actions stop. So how can dead people control whether good and bad things happen in life when they are not even in life anymore? Still, some people continue to pray to the dead, asking for their help in changing events in this life although only Allah can do this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even if a dead person was a righteous worshipper of Allah, believing that dead people or anyone else controls things in this life is Shirk in Tawḥīd of Lordship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Review</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. What is Shirk in Tawḥīd of Lordship?<br />
2. Give an example of Shirk in Tawḥīd of Lordship.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>SHIRK IN TAWḤĪD OF NAMES AND DESCRIPTIONS</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tawḥīd of Names and Descriptions is to believe that Allah is the only one who deserves to be described with perfect names and descriptions. Shirk in this category of Tawḥīd is to believe that Allah can be described with descriptions of the creation, or to believe that others besides Allah share in his descriptions. So believing that Allah is like his creation or that his creation is like Allah is Shirk.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Describing Allah with Descriptions of His Creation</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When people describe Allah with the descriptions of creation or they believe Allah is similar to people, they have made Shirk in Tawḥīd of Names and Descriptions. There are several ways this type of Shirk is made. One example is when people make statues or paintings of God, claiming they are images of Allah. By doing so, they have described Allah in the image or form of people although Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like him.</span> [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Today, Christians fall into this type of Shirk when they believe Allah has a son. They believe the Messiah, Prophet Jesus the son of Mary, is his son. Allah knows they believe this and he says about this statement of Shirk and disbelief:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَالُوا اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَٰنُ وَلَدًا </span><span style="color:#000000;">لَّقَدْ جِئْتُمْ شَيْئًا إِدًّا </span><span style="color:#000000;">تَكَادُ السَّمَاوَاتُ يَتَفَطَّرْنَ مِنْهُ وَتَنشَقُّ الْأَرْضُ وَتَخِرُّ الْجِبَالُ هَدًّا </span><span style="color:#000000;">أَن دَعَوْا لِلرَّحْمَٰنِ وَلَدًا  </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا يَنبَغِي لِلرَّحْمَٰنِ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَدًا  </span><span style="color:#000000;">إِن كُلُّ مَن فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ إِلَّا آتِي الرَّحْمَٰنِ عَبْدًا</span></h2>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">And they say, “The Most-Merciful has a son.” You have said a terrible thing. The heavens are almost torn, the earth is split open, and the mountains almost fall in ruin because they claim the Most-Merciful has a son. But it is not suitable that the Most-Merciful has a son. There is no one in the heavens and earth except that will come to the Most-Merciful as a servant. </span>[13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah explains who Prophet Jesus truly is:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّمَا الْمَسِيحُ عِيسَى ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, was only a messenger of Allah.</span> [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example of Shirk in Tawḥīd of Names and Descriptions is when many Jewish people claim that Allah likes the Jews more than all other people – just because they were born to a Jewish parent. This belief of theirs means that Allah is prejudice and unfair just like some people are, and this is describing Allah with descriptions of people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our belief in Tawḥīd of Names and Descriptions is that Allah is not like his creation. He alone deserves the highest descriptions. When someone believes that Allah is like his creation, they have made Shirk in Tawḥīd of Names and Descriptions by giving Allah the descriptions of his creation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Describing Creation with Allah’s Descriptions</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The belief that created beings or things share Allah’s names or descriptions is also Shirk in Tawḥīd of Names and Descriptions. This type of Shirk is when people raise other humans up to the level of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Today, some Christians describe people with Allah’s descriptions. They believe Prophet Jesus or saints can hear their prayers while Allah alone is the All-Hearing. Some Christians even believe Jesus was Allah in the form of a man. This is a form of describing Allah with descriptions of people as well as describing the creation with the descriptions of Allah. About this statement of Shirk and disbelief, Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَقَدْ كَفَرَ الَّذِينَ قَالُوا إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْمَسِيحُ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">They have surely disbelieved who say, “Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary.”</span> [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By believing that someone is nicer than Allah, more merciful, more forgiving, or treats others more fairly than Allah, this is giving created people Allah’s descriptions and this is Shirk in Tawḥīd of Names and Descriptions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Review</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. What is Shirk in Tawḥīd of Names and Descriptions?<br />
2. Give an example of Shirk by describing Allah with the descriptions of his creation.<br />
3. Give an example of Shirk by describing the creation with the descriptions only Allah deserves.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">SHIRK IN TAWḤĪD OF WORSHIP</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tawḥīd of Worship means we believe Allah is the only one who deserves worship. Since Shirk is the opposite of Tawḥīd, Shirk in Tawḥīd of Worship is worshipping others along with Allah. We must never share our worship with other than Allah. There are two types of Shirk in this category: Major Shirk and Minor Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is important to remember that both types of Shirk, major and minor, may be in other categories of Tawḥīd as well as Tawḥīd of Worship. We should not become overwhelmed or confused deciding if a statement or action is Shirk in this category of Tawḥīd or that one. Instead, we simply should concentrate on believing in, describing, and worshipping Allah alone as Islam instructs us. Still, we will discuss some differences between Major Shirk and Minor Shirk.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Major Shirk</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Major Shirk is any type of Shirk the Qur&#8217;aan or the ḥadīth explains that whoever does it is not considered a Muslim, not within the religion of Islam, and is not a true believer in Allah. Major Shirk dooms the person to live in Hell forever if he does not stop making Major Shirk before he dies. Any form of worship that is done for other than Allah is Major Shirk, such as praying to others besides Allah or hoping for things from others that only Allah can give (e.g. forgiveness, Paradise, etc.).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A common example of Major Shirk is when people pray to other people such as prophets or visit the graves of saints, believing those people hear or answer prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This form of Shirk is the greatest sin and the most unfair way to behave toward the Lord of all creation. We will mention some of the results of Major Shirk if a person dies while believing in it and doing acts of Major Shirk in worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Major Shirk Removes Hope of Entering Paradise</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says about the punishment for someone who dies while making Major Shirk:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّهُ مَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَقَدْ حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ الْجَنَّةَ وَمَأْوَاهُ النَّارُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Surely, whoever makes Shirk with Allah, Allah will make Paradise forbidden to him and his final home will be the fire.</span> [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Major Shirk Guarantees Entrance into the Fire</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said about someone who meets Allah while making Shirk:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَنْ لَقِيَ اللهَ لا يُشْرِكُ بِهِ شَيْئاً دَخَلَ الجَنَّةَ ، وَمَنْ لَقِيَهُ يُشْرِكُ بِهِ شَيْئاً دَخَلَ النَّار</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Whoever meets Allah without making Shirk with him will enter Paradise, and whoever meets him making Shirk with him will enter the fire</span>. [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We will meet Allah when we die, and one of the most common ways people make Major Shirk is by praying to and calling upon someone other than Allah. For this reason, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) clearly said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَنْ مَاتَ وَهْوَ يَدْعُو مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ نِدًّا دَخَلَ النَّارَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Whoever dies while calling upon anything other than Allah, making them equal to Allah (in worship), he will enter the fire.</span> [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Major Shirk Ruins All Good Deeds</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If someone makes Major Shirk, all their good deeds may be ruined and lost. Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَوْ أَشْرَكُوا لَحَبِطَ عَنْهُم مَّا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And if they had made Shirk, whatever (good) they used to do would be ruined.</span> [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he also says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَقَدْ أُوحِيَ إِلَيْكَ وَإِلَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكَ لَئِنْ أَشْرَكْتَ لَيَحْبَطَنَّ عَمَلُكَ وَلَتَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">It has been revealed to you and to those before you, if you make Shirk, your deeds will be ruined and you will certainly be among the losers.</span>[20]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Minor Shirk</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Minor Shirk is any type of saying or action that the Qur&#8217;aan or ḥadīth describes as being Shirk but that the person who says or does it could still be considered a Muslim, still inIslam, and is still a believer in Allah. However, Minor Shirk does mean that the person’s belief in Tawḥīd may be incorrect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some actions or statements are considered Minor Shirk. For example, saying something like, “If it was not for Allah and you, something bad would have happened!” Someone once said to Prophet Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم), “Whatever Allah wants and you want (to happen will happen).” The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) explained that such things are not correct to say; he said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَجَعَلْتَنِي مَعَ اللهِ عَدْلاً ؟ لا بَلْ : مَا شَاءَ اللهُ وَحْدَهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Have you made me an equal with Allah? No, instead say: “Whatever Allah alone wants (to happen will happen).”</span> [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some common superstitions are also Minor Shirk. For example, if someone believes Allah will allow bad things to happen if he does not wear a certain ring or hang verses from the Qur&#8217;aan in his car, this is a form of Minor Shirk because Allah has not made those things ways to prevent bad things from happening. However, if someone believes those things themselves actually prevent bad things from happening instead of Allah, then this becomes Major Shirk. Such a wrong belief would then mean there are other things besides Allah that control creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another form of Minor Shirk is harder to recognize. This type of “hidden Shirk” is in a person’s intention, or the reason he does something. When someone does a good deed—which he should do for only Allah—yet he does his good deed just for people to think he is a good worshipper, this is a form of Minor Shirk. Examples of this may be if someone prays very well, raises his voice while remembering Allah or reading the Qur&#8217;aan, or gives charity but he does so only for people to think and say good things about him. About this type of showing off, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إنَّ أَخْوَفَ مَا أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ الشِّرْكَ الأَصْغَرَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">The thing I fear for you the most is Minor Shirk.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His companions asked, “What is Minor Shirk, messenger of Allah?” He (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) answered:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الرِّيَاء ، يَقُوْلُ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ : اِذْهَبُوْا إِلَى الَّذِيْنَ كُنْتُمْ تُرَاؤُوْنَ فِي الدُّنْيَا ،فَانْظُرُوْا هَلْ تَجِدُوْنَ عِنْدَهُمْ جَزَاءً</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Showing off (riyā). Allah ( عزّ وجلّ ) will say, <span style="color:#008000;">“Go to those you were showing off for during life and see if you can find any reward with them.”</span></span> [22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Minor Shirk Ruins Good Deeds Done for Showing Off</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Good deeds will not be accepted if they are done for anyone other than Allah. While Major Shirk ruins all a person’s good deeds, Minor Shirk ruins only the deeds that were done for showing off. The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) says about this Shirk in intention:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قَالَ اللَّهُ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى : أَنَا أَغْنَى الشُّرَكَاءِ عَنْ الشِّرْكِ ، مَنْ عَمِلَ عَمَلاً أَشْرَكَ فِيهِ مَعِي غَيْرِي تَرَكْتُهُ وَشِرْكَهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Allah ( تبارك وتعالى ) said,<span style="color:#008000;"> “I am in no need of Shirk. Whoever does a deed but does so for someone else besides me, I will reject him and his Shirk”</span>.</span> [23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the prophet’s companions named Abū Mūsá al-‘Ash’arī ( رضي الله عنه ) said: The messenger of Allah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) once gave us a talk and said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ ، اتَّقُوا هَذَا الشِّرْكَ فَإِنَّهُ أَخْفَى مِنْ دَبِيبِ النَّمْلِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Oh people, be afraid of this Shirk because it is more hidden than a creeping ant.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While Major Shirk is much worse than Minor Shirk, both are sins against Allah. For this reason, we should stay away from all forms of Shirk because Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Allah will not forgive that Shirk is made with him.</span> [24]</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">CONCLUSION</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We do not study Tawḥīd and Shirk simply to memorize detailed categories and types of Shirk. We learn Tawḥīd for the purpose of getting closer to Allah by believing in and worshipping him in the way he wants. And we do so only to make him happy with the hope of achieving his forgiveness and entering his Paradise. Similarly, we learn Shirk so we know what beliefs, statements, and actions make Allah unhappy. Remember, while learning the details of Tawḥīd and Shirk may help us know what Allah wants from us, he did not make our religion difficult upon us, he simply instructed us to:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَلا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئً</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Worship Allah and do not make Shirk with anything along with him.</span> [25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The important thing to remember is that Allah is the only Lord, the only creator, owner, and controller of everything and everyone in the universe. He is the only one who we describe with the names and descriptions of perfection and we truly believe Allah is not like his creation and his creation is not like him. Allah tells us:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُ كُفُوًا أَحَدٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing equal or comparable to him.</span> [26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because we believe Allah is the only Lord and only he deserves the highest descriptions, it only makes sense that we worship him and no one else. So do not let your study of Tawḥīd and Shirk become difficult or confusing. By simply reading about this knowledge, you have taken steps to get closer to Allah. Read what Allah says about those who try to come closer to Allah and those who avoid Shirk:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَنْ تَقَرَّبَ مِنِّي شِبْرًا تَقَرَّبْتُ مِنْهُ ذِرَاعًا ، وَمَنْ تَقَرَّبَ مِنِّي ذِرَاعًا تَقَرَّبْتُ مِنْهُ بَاعًا ، وَمَنْ أتَانِي يَمْشِي أتَيْتُهُ هَرْوَلَةً ، وَمَنْ لَقِيني بِقُرَابِ الأرْض خَطِيئةً لا يُشْرِكُ بِي شَيئاً ، لَقِيتُهُ بِمِثْلِهَا مَغفِرَةً</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Whoever comes close to me a hand-span, I will come close to him an arm’s length; and whoever comes close to me an arm’s length, I will come close to him the distance of two outstretched arms. Whoever comes to me walking, I will come to him running. And whoever meets me with the earth full of sins but does not make Shirk in anything with me, I will meet him with as much forgiveness.” [27]</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">A PRAYER FOR PROTECTION FROM SHIRK</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) once said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الشِّرْكُ فِيكُمْ أَخْفَى مِنْ دَبِيْبِ النَّمْلِ ، وَسَأَدُلُّكَ عَلَى شَيْ ء إِذَا فَعَلْتَهُ أَذْهَبَ عَنْكَ صِغَارَ الشِّرْكِ وَكِبَارَهُ ، تَقُولُ : اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَعُوْذُ بِكَ أَنْ أُشْرِكَ بِكَ وَأَنَا أَعْلَمُ ، وَأَسْتَغْفِرُكَ لِمَا لا أَعْلَمُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Shirk among you is more hidden than a creeping ant, but I will guide you to something that, if you do it, will remove from you Minor Shirk and its Major type. You should say, “<strong>Oh Allah, I ask for your protection from making Shirk with you while I know, and I ask your forgiveness for what I do not know</strong>.”</span> [28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because our belief in Tawḥīd is that Allah is the only one who can help us and we only pray to him, we understand that only he can help us stay away from Shirk completely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of this, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) taught us to ask his protection from knowingly making Shirk in belief, statement, or action. We must also ask for his forgiveness if we happen to make a mistake by believing, saying, or doing anything that is Shirk that we may not know.</p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Kitāb-ut-Tawheed : Chapter 9:<br />
</strong><strong>Whoever seeks Blessing through a tree,a Stone, or the like</strong></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>عن أبي واقد الليثي، قال: خرجنا مع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم إلى حنين ونحن حدثاء عهد بكفر، وللمشركين سدرة يعكفون عندها وينوطون بها أسلحتهم، يقال لها: ذات أنواط، فمررنا بسدرة فقلنا: يا رسول الله أجعل لنا ذات أنواط كما لهم ذات أنواط فقال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم: (الله أكبر! إنها السنن، قلتم ـ والذي نفسي بيده ـ كما قالت بنو إسرائيل لموسى: (<span style="color:#008000;">اجعل لنا إلهاً كما لهم آلهة قال إنكم قوم تجهلون</span>)  (لتركبن سنن من كان قبلكم</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(رواه الترمذي وصححه )</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Abū Wāqid al-Laythī said: &#8220;We went with Allah&#8217;s Messenger to Ḥunayn while we had just recently left disbelief. The mushrikīn had a lote tree which they used to frequent and hang their swords upon. They called it <em>thāt al-anwāt </em></strong>(possessor of the medals of honor)<strong>. Afterward, we passed by </strong>(another)<strong> lote tree, so we said: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8216;O Messenger of Allah, make a <em>thāt al-anwāt</em> for us like their <em>thāt al-anwāt</em>.&#8217; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>«Allahu Akbar! This way that you have mentioned, by the One in whose Hand my soul is, is just like what the children of Isrā&#8217;īl asked Mūsā:</strong></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Types of <em>Taaghoot</em></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">والطواغيتُ كثيرونَ ورؤوسُهُمْ خمَسةٌ: إبليسُ لعنَهُ اللهُ، ومَنْ عُبِدَ وهو راض<strong> </strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The <em>taaghoots</em> are many, and their heads are five:  Iblees &#8211; may Allaah’s curse be upon him. Whoever is worshipped and is pleased with that</span></strong>.<span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>79</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">79</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying: “<strong>And the <em>taaghoots</em> are many and the heads of them are five</strong>.”<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>taaghoots</em> upon whom this definition applies are: everyone who is worshipped or followed or obeyed, and they are many but their heads are five – meaning their major ones are five.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Firstly, Iblees</strong></span>, may Allaah’s curse be upon him &#8211; meaning: may Allaah expel him and distance him away from His Mercy on account of the fact that he refused to prostrate to Aadam and he disobeyed Allaah, the Perfect and Most High and he was proud and haughty. And He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قَالَ أَنَا خَيْرٌ مِّنْهُ ۖ خَلَقْتَنِي مِن نَّارٍ وَخَلَقْتَهُ مِن طِينٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And he </strong>(Iblees)<strong> said:</strong> </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">I am better than him </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Aadam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, You created me from fire and You created him from clay.</span></strong>[38:76]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore he disobeyed the command of Allaah and was haughty; therefore Allaah cursed him and He repelled him and distanced him. And he is called <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Iblees</strong></span>, it is said, because he <span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>ablasa</em> </strong></span>(despaired) of Mercy – meaning he despaired of Mercy. So the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>mublis</em> </strong></span>is one who despairs of something.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Iblees, may Allaah’s curse be upon him, is the head of the <em>taaghoots</em> because he is the one who commands with worship of other than Allaah and he is the one who commands with following other than the Messenger of Allaah <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> and he is the one who commands obedience to other than Allaah by declaring things to be permissible or forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Iblees is the source of evil and he is the head of the <em>taaghoots</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The second category (of <em>taaghoots</em>) is:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The one who is worshipped and he is pleased with that – meaning he is worshipped and he is pleased with the people’s worship of him. So he is a <em>taaghoot</em>.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for one who is worshipped and he is not pleased with that then he does not enter into that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For ‘Eesaa <em>‘alaihissalaatu wassalaam</em> has been worshipped besides Allaah but he was not pleased with that. And his mother and ‘Uzayr and the <em>awliyaa</em> (beloved servants of Allaah) and the righteous people from the servants of Allaah, they are not pleased with that (worship of them). Rather they used to criticize this and fight against those who did it. So whoever is worshipped and he is not pleased with that, then he is not called a <em>taaghoot</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that is because when Allaah sent down His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You </strong>(people of shirk)<strong> and whatever idols you worship will be fuel for the Hellfire. You will enter it.</strong></span> [21:98]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; the people of shirk became happy and they said, “We worship the Messiah (‘Eesaa) and we worship such and such and we worship such and such. Therefore they will be with us in the Fire.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah, the Most High, sent down:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُم مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَىٰ أُولَٰئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">لَا يَسْمَعُونَ حَسِيسَهَا ۖ وَهُمْ فِي مَا اشْتَهَتْ أَنفُسُهُمْ خَالِدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Those for whom Allaah has written that they shall be people of bliss, they shall be kept far away from it. They shall not hear even the slightest sound from it </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the Fire)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> but rather they shall be enjoying whatever their souls desire forever</span>. </strong>[21:101-102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in the other aayah that they said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they say: are our gods better or is he?</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: ‘Eesaa <em>‘alaihissalaam</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَالُوا أَآلِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هُوَ ۚ مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلَّا جَدَلًا ۚ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَاهُ مَثَلًا لِّبَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>They do not quote him as an example to you except in order to argue. Indeed they are an argumentative people; he was no more than a slave upon whom We bestowed favor and We made him an example for the Banoo Israa.eel.</b></span></span> [43:58-59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he is a slave of Allaah and he was not pleased that he should be worshipped besides Allaah. Indeed Allaah sent him to criticize that:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَا قُلْتُ لَهُمْ إِلَّا مَا أَمَرْتَنِي بِهِ أَنِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ رَبِّي وَرَبَّكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(‘Eesaa will say on the Day of Resurrection)<strong>, “I did not say to them except what You commanded me to – that you should worship Allaah alone, my Lord and your Lord. </strong></span>[5:117]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore one who is worshipped and he is not pleased with that – he does not enter under this threat and he is not a <em>taaghoot</em> because he rejects and criticises that. This is because at <em>taaghoot</em> is one who is pleased with worship besides Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ومَنْ دعا الناسَ إلى عبادَةِ نفسِه</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> Whoever calls the people to the worship of himself</strong></span><strong>.</strong><span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>80</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[80]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third: “<strong>Whoever calls the people to the worship of himself</strong>”:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such as the heads of the people of shirk, those who call the people to worship them, such as Fir’awn who said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَقَالَ أَنَا رَبُّكُمُ الْأَعْلَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So he </strong>(Fir’awn)<strong> said, “I am your highest Lord.” </strong></span>[79:24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And such as Namrood and such as the extreme Soofees, those who call the people to worship them, to such an extent that they give instructions to the people to worship them after they have died, so that one of them says, “<em>When matters become very difficult for you then come to my grave</em>” – meaning: “<em>when affairs become difficult  for you, then you should come to my grave  and a few handfuls of earth cannot prevent you from me</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they counsel the people to come to their (the leaders’) graves and they promise them that they (the leaders) will carry out their needs. So whoever calls the people to worship of himself, whether whilst he is alive or dead, then he is from the heads of the <em>taaghoots</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise whoever calls the people to worship someone else besides him from the <em>taaghoots</em> and they are the callers to shirk, they are <em>taaghoots</em>, those who falsely beautify shirk for the people and they call it with other than its name, and they say, “<em>This is a case of tawassul (seeking legitimate means to Allaah) or a case of shafaa’ah (legitimate intercession)</em>.” And they are many.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those are <em>taaghoots</em> because they call the people to shirk, so they call to the worship of other than Allaah and they call that (shirk) with other than its name and they falsely adorn it for the people with doubts and falsely adorned speech. They are <em>taaghoots</em>. The callers to shirk are <em>taaghoots</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And everyone who is worshipped besides Allaah and is pleased with that or calls the people to the worship of himself or calls the people to worship of other than Allaah then he is from the <em>taaghoots</em>; indeed he is from the heads of the <em>taaghoots</em> – we ask Allaah for safety and salvation.</p>

<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ومَنِ ادَّعى شيئًا مِنْ عِلمِ الغيْبِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Whoever claims to possess anything from the knowledge of the affairs of the hidden and unseen (<em>al-Ghayb</em>)</span></strong><span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>81</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">81</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth one is “<strong>whoever claims to possess anything from knowledge of the hidden and unseen</strong>”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And entering into this are the sorcerers and the astrologers and the fortunetellers and the geomancers, and everyone who claims that he possesses knowledge of the <em>ghayb</em> and says to the people, “Such and such will occur for you. For you, you will receive bliss or you will receive some hardship or you will have a successful marriage or you will have an unsuccessful one. Those people claim knowledge of the hidden and the unseen. And the hidden and unseen is not known except by Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And knowledge of the <em>ghayb</em> is not known except by Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُل لَّا يَعْلَمُ مَن فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ الْغَيْبَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: No one in the Heavens or the Earth knows the <em>ghayb</em> except Allaah. </strong></span>[27:65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">عَالِمُ الْغَيْبِ فَلَا يُظْهِرُ عَلَىٰ غَيْبِهِ أَحَدًا  &#8211; إِلَّا مَنِ ارْتَضَىٰ مِن رَّسُولٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">He (Allaah) is the Knower of the <em>ghayb</em>. He does not reveal what He has kept hidden to anyone except to one whom He is pleased with whom He has sent as a Messenger</span>.</strong> [72:26-27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَعِندَهُ مَفَاتِحُ الْغَيْبِ لَا يَعْلَمُهَا إِلَّا هُوَ ۚ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِي الْبَرِّ وَالْبَحْرِ ۚ وَمَا تَسْقُطُ مِن وَرَقَةٍ إِلَّا يَعْلَمُهَا وَلَا حَبَّةٍ فِي ظُلُمَاتِ الْأَرْضِ وَلَا رَطْبٍ وَلَا يَابِسٍ إِلَّا فِي كِتَابٍ مُّبِينٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And with Allaah are the keys to the <em>ghayb</em>; no one knows it except Him. And He knows whatever is in the land and in the ocean; and no leaf falls except that He knows of it. Nor is there any grain in the darkness of the Earth nor any fresh thing nor any dry thing except that it is written in a Clear Book. </strong></span>[6:59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>no one knows it except Him…</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a limitation. So no one knows the <em>ghayb</em> except for Allaah or one from His Messengers to whom Allaah has revealed something from the ghayb for the benefit of Mankind and as miracle for the messenger. However he will not know the <em>ghayb</em> from himself. Rather he only knows from Allaah’s teaching it to him. So no one knows the ghayb except for Allaah. So whoever claims to have knowledge of the <em>ghayb</em> then he would be a sharer with Allaah with regards to something particular to Him, He the Perfect. Therefore, that person is a <em>mushrik</em> (person of <em>shirk</em>), he is a <em>taaghoot</em>, and he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever). And this is one of the greatest forms of apostasy from Islaam.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ومَنْ حكمَ بغيِر مَا أنزلَ الله</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> <span style="color:#993300;">And whoever judges by other than what Allaah sent down</span></strong>.<span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>82</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">82</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fifth one is whoever judges by other than that which Allaah sent down.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يُرِيدُونَ أَن يَتَحَاكَمُوا إِلَى الطَّاغُوتِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They wish to refer for judgment to the <em>taaghoot</em>. </strong></span>[4:60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever judges by other than that which Allaah sent down holding that to be permissible to do, then he will be a <em>taaghoot</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the person who says, “It is permissible to refer for judgment to man-made laws or to the customs of the times of <em>Jaahiliyyah</em> or to the customs of the tribes of the Bedouins and to leave behind the Legislation,” – he says, “This is lawful to do,” or he says, “This is equal to that which Allaah sent down.” And if he says, “It is better than that which Allaah sent down or equal to that which Allaah sent down,” or he says, “It is just permissible to do,” and he doesn’t even say, “It is equal or better,” – he just says, “It is permissible and allowed to do this”, then this person is a <em>taaghoot</em>. And this is by the text of the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يُرِيدُونَ أَن يَتَحَاكَمُوا إِلَى الطَّاغُوتِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They wish to refer for judgment to the <em>taaghoot</em>. </strong></span>[4:60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was called a <em>taaghoot</em> because he has gone beyond his limit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for a person who judges by other than that which Allaah has sent down whilst he affirms that that which Allaah sent down is what is obligatory to follow and is the Truth and that anything else is false and futile and that he is judging with something futile &#8211; then this person is counted as being a <em>kaafir</em> who has committed <em>al-kufr-ul-asghar</em> (lesser <em>kufr</em>) which does not take a person out of the religion. However he is upon great danger, he is upon a way which may lead to <em>kufr</em> which takes a person out of the religion if he becomes lax about this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for one who judges by other than that which Allaah sent down, without intending to do so, rather (he does so) from <em>ijtihaad</em> (personal striving and deduction) and he is a person who is rightful to be performing <em>ijtihaad</em> from the people of <em>fiqh</em>, and he performs <em>ijtihaad</em> but he does not actually attain the judgment of Allaah and he makes a mistake in his <em>ijtihaad</em>, then this is forgiven for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“When the judge judges and strives and he reaches the correct conclusion, then he will receive two rewards. And when he judges and strives and reaches the incorrect conclusion, then for him there is one reward.”</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Hadith Reported by al Bukhaaree (7352) and Muslim (1716 )from the hadeeth of ‘Amr ibn al ‘Aas <em>radiy Allaahu ‘anhu</em>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because he did not deliberately commit a mistake. He was intending the Truth; he was intending conformity with the judgment of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. However, he was not granted the success of attaining it. So this person is counted as being excused and one who will receive reward. But it is not permissible to follow him upon the error.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from this are the matters of <em>ijtihaad</em> of the jurists who have made a mistake in those matters or the striving of the judges in the courts when they strive to arrive at a ruling and they exert effort to reach the Truth. However they are not granted it. So their error is forgiven.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Rejecting <em>at-Taaghoot</em>, and Having <em>Eemaan</em> in Allaah</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وافترضَ اللهُ على جميعِ العبادِ الكفرَ بالطاغوتِ والإيمانَ بالله</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Allaah has made it obligatory upon all of the servants to reject <em>at-taaghoot</em>, and to have <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah</strong></span>.<span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>77</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">77</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Shaykh <em>rahimahullaah</em> said, “<strong>And Allaah has made it obligatory upon all of the servants to reject <em>at-taaghoot</em>, and to have <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah…</strong>” Then he mentioned the definition of <em>at-taaghoot</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>taaghoot</em> has been mentioned by Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, in many <em>aayaat</em>. From them is His saying, He the Most High, in Soorat-ul-Baqarah:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> فَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِالطَّاغُوتِ وَيُؤْمِن بِاللَّهِ فَقَدِ اسْتَمْسَكَ بِالْعُرْوَةِ الْوُثْقَىٰ لَا انفِصَامَ لَهَا ۗ وَاللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُ وَلِيُّ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا يُخْرِجُهُم مِّنَ الظُّلُمَاتِ إِلَى النُّورِ ۖ وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا أَوْلِيَاؤُهُمُ الطَّاغُوتُ يُخْرِجُونَهُم مِّنَ النُّورِ إِلَى الظُّلُمَاتِ ۗ أُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ ۖ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So whoever rejects <em>at-taaghoot </em></strong>(everything which is worshipped besides Allaah)<strong> and believes truly in Allaah, then he has grasped the firmest handhold that will not break. And Allaah is All Hearing, All Knowing.</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah is the Guardian Lord of those who truly believe; He brings them out from darkness into light.</strong><strong> </strong></span><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And those who disbelieve, then their supporters are <em>at-taaghoot</em>; they take them out from the light into darkness. They are the inhabitants of the Fire; they will remain in it forever. </strong></span>[2:256-257]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in Soorat-un-Nisaa His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا نَصِيبًا مِّنَ الْكِتَابِ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالْجِبْتِ وَالطَّاغُوتِ وَيَقُولُونَ لِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا هَٰؤُلَاءِ أَهْدَىٰ مِنَ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا سَبِيلًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Will you not consider those who were given a portion of the Scripture? They believe in <em>al</em> <em>jibt </em></strong>(the idols, soothsayers and sorcery)<strong> and in <em>at-taaghoot</em>. And they say to those who disbelieve that they are closer to the Truth than the believers. </strong></span>[4:51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this <em>aayah</em> is with regard to the Jews.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Perfect, said with regards to the hypocrites:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ يَزْعُمُونَ أَنَّهُمْ آمَنُوا بِمَا أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ وَمَا أُنزِلَ مِن قَبْلِكَ يُرِيدُونَ أَن يَتَحَاكَمُوا إِلَى الطَّاغُوتِ وَقَدْ أُمِرُوا أَن يَكْفُرُوا بِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Will you not consider those who claim that they believe in that which came down to you and in that which came down before you, wishing to refer for judgment to at taaghoot? And they were commanded to reject it.</span> </strong>[4:60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in Soorat-un-Nahl that He, the Majestic and Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِي كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولًا أَنِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُوا الطَّاغُوتَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We sent a Messenger to every nation commanding, “Worship Allaah alone and keep away from at taaghoot.”</span> </strong>[16:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>At-taaghoot</em> is derived from at <em>tughyaan</em> and it is to exceed the due limit. So it is said in the (‘Arabic) language, ‘the water has <em>taghaa’</em> when the water raises above its level.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّا لَمَّا طَغَى الْمَاءُ حَمَلْنَاكُمْ فِي الْجَارِيَةِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>When the water <em>taghaa</em> </strong>(went beyond its limits)<strong> then We carried you in the Ark. </strong></span>[69:11]</p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قال ابنُ القيِّمِ رحمهُ اللهُ تعالى: معنى الطاغوت ما تجاوزَ بِهِ العبدُ حدَّهُ مِنْ معبودٍ، أو متبوعٍ، أو مطاع<strong> </strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Ibn ul Qayyim, <em>rahimahullaah ta’aala</em>, said:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“The meaning of <em>At-taaghoot</em> is anyone regarding whom the servant goes beyond the due bounds, whether it is someone <span style="text-decoration:underline;">worshipped</span> or <span style="text-decoration:underline;">followed</span> or <span style="text-decoration:underline;">obeyed</span>.”</strong></span> <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>78</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">78</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the meaning of <em>at-taaghoot</em> in the Legislation, then it is just as ibn ul Qayyim <em>rahimahullaah</em> mentioned, and the author quoted him here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>At-taaghoot</em> – whoever the servant goes beyond the due limits regarding. The servant has a due limit because he is a servant; Allaah has given him bounds which it is obligatory that he should stop at. So if he goes beyond them, then he will be a <em>taaghoot</em>. So whoever goes beyond the limits set by Allaah for His servants and which He has commanded them not to exceed and not to come close to, then he is a <em>taaghoot</em>. So if he disobeys Allaah and goes beyond His limits and goes beyond the bounds, then he is called a <em>taaghoot</em> because he has gone beyond the limits and exceeded the limits laid down by Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So his saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#993300;">(<strong><em>At-Taaghoot</em></strong>) is anyone regarding whom the servant goes beyond the due bounds, whether it is someone worshipped or followed or obeyed</span>”<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the comprehensive definition for the <em>taaghoot</em> because Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, commanded that He alone be worshipped and that no partner be set up with Him. And He commanded that His Messenger <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> should be followed and He commanded that He should be obeyed and that His Messenger should be obeyed with regard to that which He declared lawful and that which He declared forbidden. So whoever goes beyond this matter then he is a <em>taaghoot</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever exceeds the limit of worship which Allaah has made obligatory and which is particular to Him and which He has negated for anyone else besides Him, then (this person) worships anything else along with Allaah, then he is a <em>taaghoot</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>mushrik</em> (person of shirk) is a <em>taaghoot</em> because he has exceeded the limit with regards to worship, and has worshipped someone else along with Allaah. He has directed worship to other than the One who deserves it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise the one who is worshipped and is pleased with that (is a <em>taaghoot</em>). The person who is worshipped by the people and he is pleased with that and he establishes himself as a chief and as a leader upon that basis – such as Fir’awn (the Pharaoh) and an-Namrood and the shaykhs of the extreme Soofee paths, those who are worshipped by their followers and they are pleased with that, or who call the people to that, i.e. to worship them, as will follow – then this a <em>taaghoot</em> with regards to worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, “<strong><span style="color:#993300;">or followed”</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, commanded the whole of creation that they should follow Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>. So it is not permissible for anyone to follow anyone else besides him <em>‘alaihissalaatu wassalaam</em>. So whoever follows other than the Messenger <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> and claims that this is permissible, then he (this person) will be a <em>taaghoot</em> because he has followed someone other than the Messenger <em>sall Allaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>, the one whom he was commanded to follow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So following is specific to the Messenger <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>. As for other than him from the scholars and the callers then they are followed when they follow the way of the Messenger <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>. So the one who is followed in truth is the Messenger <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those (other people) then they are just conveying the message, they are followed for the truth and upon whatever they conform to with regard to the following of the Messenger <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>. And wherever they are contrary to what the Messenger <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>was upon, then it is not permissible to follow him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of that is the shaykhs of the Soofee paths; their followers and their worshippers follow them upon other than obedience to the Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam)</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed they say, “<em>We have no need for the Messenger (sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) because we take from where the Messenger (sall Allaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) took from and we take knowledge directly from Allaah. The Messenger (sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) took from Allaah through an intermediary, via Jibreel whereas we take directly from Allaah.</em>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they say, “<em>You people narrate your religion from those who have died whereas we narrate our religion from Allaah, the Perfect and Most High</em>” because they claim that their shaykhs have a connection with Allaah and that they take knowledge from Allaah directly. They have reached this level of transgression – and Allaah’s refuge is sought – this is their way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that those people are the heads of the <em>taaghoots</em> – and Allaah’s refuge is sought – because there is no way to Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, except through following His Messenger <em>sallallaahu‘alaihiwasallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ إِن كُنتُمْ تُحِبُّونَ اللَّهَ فَاتَّبِعُونِي يُحْبِبْكُمُ اللَّهُ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ ذُنُوبَكُمْ ۗ وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ  &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ أَطِيعُوا اللَّهَ وَالرَّسُولَ ۖ فَإِن تَوَلَّوْا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ الْكَافِرِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say </strong>(O Muhammad)<strong>, “If you truly love Allaah, then follow me, then Allaah will love you and will forgive you your sins. And Allaah forgives extensively and bestows mercy.</strong><strong> </strong></span><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say, “Obey Allaah and the Messenger.” So if they turn away then Allaah does not love the disbelievers.</strong></span> [3:31-32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the person who follows other than the Messenger, this person is counted as a <em>taaghoot</em>. And likewise the person who calls people to follow him and says to the people, “<em>I will bring you orders directly from Allaah</em>” – this is the greatest one of the <em>taaghoots</em> in existence in the world. And Allaah’s refuge is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>one who is obeyed…</strong></span>”<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Obedience is to be for Allaah and for His Messenger regarding what he declares to be lawful and what he declares to be forbidden. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَطِيعُوا اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُوا الرَّسُولَ وَأُولِي الْأَمْرِ مِنكُمْ ۖ فَإِن تَنَازَعْتُمْ فِي شَيْءٍ فَرُدُّوهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَالرَّسُولِ إِن كُنتُمْ تُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ وَأَحْسَنُ تَأْوِيلًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you who believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger and those in authority from amongst you. And if you dispute about anything, then refer it back to Allaah and to the Messenger, if you truly believe in Allaah and in the Last Day. </strong><strong>That is what is best for you and is what is best in its consequences.</strong></span> [4:59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is lawful is that which Allaah has made lawful; and that which is forbidden is that which Allaah has made forbidden. And it is not for anyone to share with Allaah in making things lawful or forbidden. And therefore Allaah passed the ruling upon those who declare things lawful or declare things forbidden or obeys one who does that – that such a person is a <em>mushrik</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Perfect and Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَكُلُوا مِمَّا ذُكِرَ اسْمُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ إِن كُنتُم بِآيَاتِهِ مُؤْمِنِينَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا لَكُمْ أَلَّا تَأْكُلُوا مِمَّا ذُكِرَ اسْمُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ وَقَدْ فَصَّلَ لَكُم مَّا حَرَّمَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِلَّا مَا اضْطُرِرْتُمْ إِلَيْهِ ۗ وَإِنَّ كَثِيرًا لَّيُضِلُّونَ بِأَهْوَائِهِم بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ ۗ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِالْمُعْتَدِينَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَذَرُوا ظَاهِرَ الْإِثْمِ وَبَاطِنَهُ ۚ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَكْسِبُونَ الْإِثْمَ سَيُجْزَوْنَ بِمَا كَانُوا يَقْتَرِفُونَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا مِمَّا لَمْ يُذْكَرِ اسْمُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ وَإِنَّهُ لَفِسْقٌ ۗ وَإِنَّ الشَّيَاطِينَ لَيُوحُونَ إِلَىٰ أَوْلِيَائِهِمْ لِيُجَادِلُوكُمْ ۖ وَإِنْ أَطَعْتُمُوهُمْ إِنَّكُمْ لَمُشْرِكُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Eat from that which Allaah’s Name has been mentioned upon, if you truly believe in His Signs. And why would you not eat from that which Allaah’s Name been mentioned upon when He has made clear to you whatever has been made forbidden for you – except for that which you have a dire need of.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>And there are many who misguide with their desires without knowledge. Indeed your Lord knows best those who exceed the limits.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>And leave off outward and inward sins. Those who earn sin shall be recompensed for what they earned.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>And do not eat from that which Allaah’s Name is not mentioned upon, and it is sin.</strong><strong>And the devils inspire their followers to dispute with you. And were you to obey them, then you would be people of shirk. </strong></span>[6:118-121]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because the people of <em>Jaahiliyyah</em> said, “<em>Dead meat is lawful because Allaah, He is the One who slaughtered it. So it has more right to be lawful than that which you people sacrifice and slaughter</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says (in these <em>aayaat</em> from Soorah al An’aam) (for us) do not eat except for that which has been slaughtered in the legislated manner and He made forbidden for you dead meat. Whereas those people say, “No, dead meat is permissible; it has more right to be lawful than that which has been slaughtered because it is you people who have slaughtered it whereas an animal which has died, then Allaah is the One who has slaughtered it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore He refuted the people of <em>shirk</em> and He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا مِمَّا لَمْ يُذْكَرِ اسْمُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ وَإِنَّهُ لَفِسْقٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do not eat from that which Allaah’s Name has not been mentioned upon. And it is sin…</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: it is to exit from obedience to Allaah, the Perfect, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said after it:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; وَإِنَّ الشَّيَاطِينَ لَيُوحُونَ إِلَىٰ أَوْلِيَائِهِمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the devils inspire their allies&#8230;</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They say, “<em>Dead meat, it was slaughtered by Allaah whereas the animals that you people slaughter, you have slaughtered them. So how can you hold it as lawful that which you people sacrifice and you do not regard as lawful that which Allaah has sacrificed?!</em>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a false and futile argument.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِنْ أَطَعْتُمُوهُمْ إِنَّكُمْ لَمُشْرِكُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if you were to obey them, then you would be people of <em>shirk</em>.</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because this is <em>shirk</em> with regards to obedience. Declaring something lawful and declaring something forbidden is the right of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not permissible for anyone to declare lawful or to declare forbidden from his own self, or to obey someone in declaring something lawful or something forbidden from his own self. And whoever does that then he is a <em>taaghoot</em> and he is obeying the <em>taaghoots</em>, those who declare things lawful and declare things forbidden besides Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the meaning of his saying: “Or one who is obeyed…” Meaning: obeyed in declaring things lawful and forbidden because declaring things lawful and declaring things forbidden is the right of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High; and the Messenger <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> was one who conveyed from Allaah that which He made lawful and that which He made forbidden.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Proof for His Lordship and His Divinity and Right to All Worship, He the Perfect and Most High</strong></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ اللَّيْلُ وَالنَّهَارُ وَالشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ ۚ لَا تَسْجُدُوا لِلشَّمْسِ وَلَا لِلْقَمَرِ وَاسْجُدُوا لِلَّهِ الَّذِي خَلَقَهُنَّ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And from His signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon. Do not prostrate to the sun nor to the moon, but rather prostrate to Allaah, the One Who created them if you truly worship Him.</span> </strong>[41:37] <sup>7</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a proof for His <em>Ruboobiyyah</em> (Lordship) and <em>Ilaahiyyah</em> (Divinity and Right to Worship), He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ اللَّيْلُ وَالنَّهَارُ وَالشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And from His signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon </strong></span>[41:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sun and the moon: the sun is the tremedous star which gives light to the creation, as a lamp burning and shining, just as Allaah the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَجَعَلْنَا سِرَاجًا وَهَّاجًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We have made it</strong></span> <span style="color:#008000;">(the sun)<strong> a lamp, burning and shining.</strong></span> [78:13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the moon is a light which brightens the night-time and gives light to the pathway of the people. And from their benefits also is the well-being of the creation through its trees and its fruits and oceans. So if the sun were hidden away from the creation, then the creation would suffer harm, and many of the means of livelihood and their welfare would be corrupted and if the moon were hidden away, then likewise. The moon also brings about benefit for their fruits and their trees, along with what it contains also from awareness of reckoning (of time periods). He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">هُوَ الَّذِي جَعَلَ الشَّمْسَ ضِيَاءً وَالْقَمَرَ نُورًا وَقَدَّرَهُ مَنَازِلَ لِتَعْلَمُوا عَدَدَ السِّنِينَ وَالْحِسَابَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We made the moon a light and appointed set phases for it so that you should know the number of years and the reckoning of the months days and hours. </strong></span>[10:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْأَهِلَّةِ ۖ قُلْ هِيَ مَوَاقِيتُ لِلنَّاسِ وَالْحَجِّ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They ask you about the crescent moons, then say: They are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the Hajj </strong></span>[2:189]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the crescent moons bring benefit for awareness of time-periods and deadlines, deadlines for debts and deadlines for the waiting periods of the women, and the set times for acts of worship and fasting and Hajj, all of them are known by reckoning based upon these two lights, the sun and the moon. So the solar reckoning and the lunar reckoning contain many benefits for all of the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from those things which He has created are the seven heavens. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُ الَّذِي خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَاوَاتٍ وَمِنَ الْأَرْضِ مِثْلَهُنَّ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah is the One Who created seven heavens, and their like from the earth. </strong></span>[65:12]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِي خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَاوَاتٍ طِبَاقًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah the One Who created seven heavens in levels </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(one above the other)</span> [67:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Each being above the other, the lowest heaven, then the one which follows it up until the seventh one. And above them all is the Throne of the Most Merciful, He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the earths are seven just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> الْأَرْضِ مِثْلَهُنَّ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And their like from the earth </strong></span>[65:12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they are seven levels or layers also, and every level from the levels of the seven heavens and the earths have inhabitants and occupants. And whatever planets and stars are in the heavens the sun and the moon and whatever is in the earth from created things from animals with their different types and from mountains and trees and rocks and minerals and oceans. These are from the signs of Allaah the Perfect and Most High, the creational signs, which are seen and witnessed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said: and the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ اللَّيْلُ وَالنَّهَارُ وَالشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ ۚ لَا تَسْجُدُوا لِلشَّمْسِ وَلَا لِلْقَمَرِ وَاسْجُدُوا لِلَّهِ الَّذِي خَلَقَهُنَّ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And from His signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon. Do not prostrate to the sun nor to the moon, but rather prostrate to Allaah, the One Who created them if you truly worship Him.</span> </strong>[41:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from His signs is the night: meaning from His signs which prove Lordship and His Ability and His sole right to worship to the exclusion of all else besides Him, is the night which brings darkness, and the daytime which brings light to the whole of the creation. This is from the amazing signs of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So who can make the whole of the creation dark, all at once, and then make the whole of the creation bright, all at once? He is Allaah the Perfect and Most High. If all of the creation were to gather together to make one part of the earth bright, they would not be able except to make a restricted area bright, if they brought all the electrical generators which are in the world, all of them, they could not make bright except a restricted portion of the earth. As for the sun and the moon then they bring light to the whole of the earth, the night and the day follow each other in succession, and the sun and the moon likewise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَا تَسْجُدُوا لِلشَّمْسِ وَلَا لِلْقَمَرِ وَاسْجُدُوا لِلَّهِ الَّذِي خَلَقَهُنَّ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do not prostrate to the sun nor to the moon, but rather prostrate to Allaah, the One Who created them, if it is He that you truly worship. </strong></span>[41:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a nullification of <em>shirk</em>: Do not prostrate to created things. Since from the greatest of the created things are the sun and the moon, and because the people of shirk, they used to worship the sun and prostrate to it, and from them were those who used to worship the moon and the stars, such as the people of Ibraaheem, they would build for them temples in the form of the stars and they would worship them. So His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَا تَسْجُدُوا لِلشَّمْسِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do not prostrate to the sun</span> </strong>[41:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>As-Sujood</em> means placing the forehead upon the ground in humble submission to the one who is worshipped, and it is the greatest of the types of worship, and Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallaam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أقرب ما يكون العبد من ربه وهو ساجد</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The closest that the servant comes to his Lord is whilst he is in prostration” </strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a>  Reported by Muslim (482) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhu</em>. [And the narration of Muslim has a completion at the end, “So therefore make plentiful supplication.”]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the greatest of the types of worship is prostration upon the ground, since your face is the thing which you cherish the most, you have placed it for Allaah upon the ground, as an act of worship for Allaah and in submission before Him, He the Perfect and Most High. This is true prostration, and it is not befitting to perform it as worship except for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for prostrating to the sun and the moon, then it is prostration to a created thing, which does not have the right to be prostrated to. So it is not permissible to prostrate to created things, but rather prostration is only for the Creator of the created things. As for the created things, then they are just like you, something created, something managed and controlled. Would you prostrate to a created being who is incapable, just the same as you? This is not permissible. Where have the intellects gone?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Prostration is only deserved by the Creator, He the Perfect and Most High, who is not rendered incapable by anything. So prostration is the right of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, it is not the right of the creation, no matter how great and large the created being is, it is still a created being who is weak and managed and controlled.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَا تَسْجُدُوا لِلشَّمْسِ وَلَا لِلْقَمَرِ وَاسْجُدُوا لِلَّهِ الَّذِي خَلَقَهُنَّ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do not prostrate to the sun nor to the moon, but rather prostrate to Allaah, the One Who created them, if it is He that you truly worship.</strong></span> [41:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is obligatory is that we do not worship except Allaah. So if you make prostration to Him and you also prostrate to other than Him, then you are not worshippers of Allaah with correct worship. Rather you are worshipping Him along with <em>shirk</em>, and <em>shirk</em> corrupts and destroys worship.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>And the most serious thing which He forbade is <em>shirk</em></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وهو دعوةُ غيرهِ معهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And it is to call upon other than Him along with Him.</span></strong><sup>19</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[19]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan’s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the definition of <em>shirk</em>: it is to call upon other than Him along with Him – meaning that something from <em>‘ibaadah </em>(worship) is directed to other than Allaah, whether it be (to) an angel from the angels or a prophet from the prophets or a righteous person from the righteous people or a building from the buildings or other than that from all the created beings. So whoever directs anything from worship to other than Allaah, then this is the greatest thing that Allaah has forbidden. This is <em>shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So know the explanation of <em>tawheed </em>and the explanation of <em>shirk </em>because there are from the people those who explain <em>tawheed </em>with other than its true explanation and those who explain <em>shirk </em>with other than its true explanation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the people are those who say, “<em>Shirk </em>is<em> shirk </em>with regards to <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/01/17/haakimiyyahalbaani/"><em><u>H</u>aakimiyyah </em>(judgement and legislation)</a>”. And this has appeared now unfortunately. <em>Al-<u>H</u>ukm bi ghayri ma anzal Allaah  </em>(judging by other than that which Allaah sent down) is a type from the types of <em>shirk </em>called <em>shirk-ut-<u>T</u>aa‘ah </em>(<em>shirk </em>of obedience). There is no doubt that obeying a created being in declaring lawful that which Allaah has made forbidden or in declaring forbidden that which Allaah has made lawful, <em>this</em> is a type of <em>shirk </em> &#8211; however there is that which is more serious than it and it is worshipping other than Allaah by slaughtering and making vows and performing <em>tawaaf</em> (circumambulation) and calling for rescue. So what is obligatory is to warn against all <em>shirk</em>, not to take up something from it and to leave aside that which is worse and more dangerous than it. So <em>shirk </em>is not to be explained as being only <em>shirk-ul-<u>H</u>aakimiyyah </em>or <em>shirk </em>in political affairs. And (these people) say: “Shirk of the graves, this is just simple shirk”, meaning it is something easy. This is insolence towards Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. <em>Shirk </em>is the worst thing that Allaah has forbidden and it is to call upon something else besides Him along with Him. This is <em>shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them are those who say that, “<em>Shirk </em>is to have love of the<em> dunyaa </em>(worldly life) and to have love of wealth.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Wealth is something which Allaah has made beloved (to people) with their natural love.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَتُحِبُّونَ الْمَالَ حُبًّا جَمًّا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And you love wealth with immense love.</span> </strong>[89:20]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِنَّهُ لِحُبِّ الْخَيْرِ لَشَدِيدٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And indeed he</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (man)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> is certainly fervent in love of </span><em><span style="color:#008000;">khayr</span> </em></strong>[100:8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: (of) wealth.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ إِن كَانَ آبَاؤُكُمْ وَأَبْنَاؤُكُمْ وَإِخْوَانُكُمْ وَأَزْوَاجُكُمْ وَعَشِيرَتُكُمْ وَأَمْوَالٌ اقْتَرَفْتُمُوهَا وَتِجَارَةٌ تَخْشَوْنَ كَسَادَهَا وَمَسَاكِنُ تَرْضَوْنَهَا أَحَبَّ إِلَيْكُم مِّنَ اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَجِهَادٍ فِي سَبِيلِهِ فَتَرَبَّصُوا حَتَّىٰ يَأْتِيَ اللَّهُ بِأَمْرِهِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ لَا يَهْدِي الْقَوْمَ الْفَاسِقِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: If your fathers and your children…</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Up to His statement:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">.. أَحَبَّ إِلَيْكُم</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">are more beloved to you.</span> </strong>[9:24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: <strong>‘are more beloved to you’</strong>, and He did not criticize them for loving them (their fathers, their children, etc). Rather He criticized them for giving precedence to love of them over the love of Allaah. Love of wealth is not <em>shirk </em>because it is a natural love. The people have need of wealth and they love it; love of wealth is not <em>shirk </em>because it is (a case) of love of things which are beneficial through which the people derive benefit. However those people who say these sayings  (that shirk is love of wealth) &#8211; either they are ignorant people who do not know <em>taw<u>h</u>eed </em>and <em>shirk</em> – or otherwise they are people who deliberately turn away, wishing to turn the people away from these realities towards things which they want and purposes which they desire . And Allaah knows best about people’s intentions and goals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is important is that this is not <em>shirk; shirk </em>is to call upon other than Allaah along with Him or to direct anything from the types of worship to other than Allaah  &#8211; such as sacrifice, and making vows, and supplicating and calling for rescue and seeking aid and turning for refuge and fear and hope and other than that &#8211; this is <em>shirk </em>which is the greatest of sins, calling upon other than Him along with Him, He the Perfect and Most High, because <em>ad-Du‘aa </em>(supplication) is the greatest type of worship, just as He, the One free of all imperfections, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَهُ دَعْوَةُ الْحَقِّ ۖ وَالَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ لَا يَسْتَجِيبُونَ لَهُم بِشَيْءٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The True Call is that which is for Allaah; and those whom they call upon besides Him cannot respond to them with anything</strong>.</span> [13:14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَادْعُوا اللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ الدِّينَ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ الْكَافِرُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So call upon Allaah, making the religion purely and sincerely for Him even though the disbelievers detest it. </strong></span>[40:14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So supplicating to other than Allaah is the <em>shirk </em>which Allaah and His Messenger made forbidden. As for these lesser matters which they declare <em>shirk </em>to be then that is not the case. However it is to be said: some of them are a part of <em>shirk; </em>however there is that which is more dangerous than it and more important than it because shirk is of levels, some of them are worse than others. And Allaah’s refuge is sought.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَلَا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And worship Allaah, and do not associate anything along with Him</span></strong> [4:36] <sup>20</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[20]:  <strong>Shaykh Fawzan’s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “And the proof is His saying, the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَلَا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And worship Allaah, and do not associate anything along with Him.</span> </strong>[4:36]”:<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have said that the proof that the greatest thing that Allaah has commanded is <em>taw<u>h</u>eed </em>is His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَلَا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And worship Allaah, and do not associate anything along with Him.</span> </strong>[4:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he mentioned the rest of the rights (in the rest of the above ayah). So the fact that He began with <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and with the prohibition of <em>shirk</em>, this is a proof that <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> is the greatest thing which Allaah has commanded because He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And worship Allaah..</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He followed it with His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">and do not associate anything along with Him.</span> </strong>[4:36]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a prohibition. He began with the command for <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and the prohibition from <em>shirk</em>. So this proves that the greatest thing that Allaah has commanded is <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and the worst thing that He has forbidden is <em>shirk</em>, because Allaah began with that. And He, the Perfect, does not begin except with the most important thing and then what is next in importance. This is the way in which the <em>aayah </em>is a proof.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>The Most Serious Thing Which Allaah Forbade is <em>Shirk</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">وأعظمُ ما نهى عنه الشركُ<strong> </strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And the most serious thing which He forbade is <em>shirk </em></strong></span><sup>18</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[18]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan’s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying – <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah </em>– “And the most serious thing which Allaah forbade is <em>shirk</em>”: This is a tremendous point of benefit because some people believe that there are things which are the worst crimes and the worst thing which Allaah has forbidden, saying, “Ribaa (usury) is the most serious of the forbidden things! Fornication is the greatest of forbidden things!” And therefore they focus upon forbidding ribaa and upon fornication and corruption of manners and behaviour. However they do not give importance to the matter of <em>shirk</em> and they do not warn against it and (yet) they see the people falling into it. So this is a case of tremendous ignorance of the <em>Sharee‘ah</em> (revealed law) of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the most serious thing which Allaah forbade is <em>shirk</em>, so it is more serious than usury and it is more serious than drinking alcohol and more serious than stealing and more serious than falsely devouring the wealth of the people and more serious than betting  and gambling; it is the most serious of the forbidden things. And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ تَعَالَوْا أَتْلُ مَا حَرَّمَ رَبُّكُمْ عَلَيْكُمْ ۖ أَلَّا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا ۖ وَبِالْوَالِدَيْنِ إِحْسَانًا ۖ وَلَا تَقْتُلُوا أَوْلَادَكُم مِّنْ إِمْلَاقٍ ۖ نَّحْنُ نَرْزُقُكُمْ وَإِيَّاهُمْ ۖ وَلَا تَقْرَبُوا الْفَوَاحِشَ مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا وَمَا بَطَنَ ۖ وَلَا تَقْتُلُوا النَّفْسَ الَّتِي حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ إِلَّا بِالْحَقِّ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ وَصَّاكُم بِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَا تَقْرَبُوا مَالَ الْيَتِيمِ إِلَّا بِالَّتِي هِيَ أَحْسَنُ حَتَّىٰ يَبْلُغَ أَشُدَّهُ ۖ وَأَوْفُوا الْكَيْلَ وَالْمِيزَانَ بِالْقِسْطِ ۖ لَا نُكَلِّفُ نَفْسًا إِلَّا وُسْعَهَا ۖ وَإِذَا قُلْتُمْ فَاعْدِلُوا وَلَوْ كَانَ ذَا قُرْبَىٰ ۖ وَبِعَهْدِ اللَّهِ أَوْفُوا ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ وَصَّاكُم بِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَذَكَّرُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: Come, I will recite to you what my Lord has truly forbidden for you: Do not associate anything along with Allaah, and treat the parents well, and do not kill your children for fear of poverty; We shall provide for you and for them. And do not approach shameful sins, whether apparent or hidden, and do not kill the soul which Allaah has forbidden, except by right. This is what He has commanded you with so that you may understand. And do not approach the wealth of the orphan except in a manner which is best .. [6:151-152]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">.. to the end of the aayaat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And these <em>aayaat</em> are called the <span style="color:#ff0000;">ten commandments</span>.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ تَعَالَوْا أَتْلُ مَا حَرَّمَ رَبُّكُمْ عَلَيْكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: Come, I will recite to you what my Lord has truly forbidden for you…</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Up to His statement:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">ذَٰلِكُمْ وَصَّاكُم بِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>That is what He has enjoined you with so that you may understand.</strong></span> [6:151-152]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These forbidden acts – Allaah began them with His statement:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَلَّا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do not associate anything along with Allaah&#8230; </strong></span>[6:151]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this proves that <em>shirk</em> is the most serious thing which Allaah has forbidden.<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in <em>Soorat-ul-Israa</em> – Allaah, the Most High,said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَّا تَجْعَلْ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَٰهًا آخَرَ فَتَقْعُدَ مَذْمُومًا مَّخْذُولًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do not set up another object of worship along with Allaah and so become one who is blameworthy and forsaken! </strong></span>[17:22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He began with a prohibition of <em>shirk </em>and He concluded it with a forbiddance of <em>shirk</em>:<em> </em></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">ذَٰلِكَ مِمَّا أَوْحَىٰ إِلَيْكَ رَبُّكَ مِنَ الْحِكْمَةِ ۗ وَلَا تَجْعَلْ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَٰهًا آخَرَ فَتُلْقَىٰ فِي جَهَنَّمَ مَلُومًا مَّدْحُورًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And do not set up another object of worship along with Allaah so that you are cast into Hellfire rebuked and banished! </strong></span>[17:39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this proves that it is the most serious thing that Allaah has forbidden. This proves the saying of the Shaykh, “and the greatest thing that Allaah forbade is shirk.”<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in the authentic <u>h</u>adeeth that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><b>‘Which sin is greatest?’</b> </span><b><span style="color:#000000;">He said, “That you set up a rival for Allaah and (yet) it is He who created you.” It was said, ‘Then which (sin)?’ He said, “That you kill your child for fear that he will consume food along with you.” It was said: ‘Then which (sin)?’ He said, “That you commit adultery with the wife of your neighbour.”</span> </b><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by al-Bukhaaree (6861) and Muslim (86) from the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of ‘Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu ‘anhu</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah sent down the confirmation of that in His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَالَّذِينَ لَا يَدْعُونَ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَٰهًا آخَرَ وَلَا يَقْتُلُونَ النَّفْسَ الَّتِي حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ إِلَّا بِالْحَقِّ وَلَا يَزْنُونَ ۚ وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذَٰلِكَ يَلْقَ أَثَامًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the servants of </span><span style="color:#008000;"><em>ar-Ra<u>h</u>maan</em></span><span style="color:#008000;"> are)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> those who do not call upon another deity along with Allaah and they do not kill the soul which Allaah has made forbidden except by right, and they do not commit fornication. And whoever does </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(these things) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">will receive punishment.</span> </strong>[25:68]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he began with <em>shirk</em> in his saying, “<strong>That you set up a rival for Allaah”, </strong>meaning: a partner, “<strong>and (yet) it is He who created you.”</strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said that this is the greatest of sins because he was asked “which sin is greatest?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he began with <em>shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Keep away from the seven destructive sins.” So it was said, ‘What are they, O Messenger of Allaah?’ So he said, “Committing shirk with Allaah, and sorcery and killing the soul which Allaah has made forbidden, except with right.”</span></strong>.. to the end of the hadeeth.<em> <strong> </strong></em><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Reported by al Bukhaaree (2766) and Muslim (89) from the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iallaahu ‘anhu</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He began it with <em>shirk </em>so this shows that <em>shirk </em>is the greatest of all sins and that is because the person of <em>shirk</em> will never enter Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّهُ مَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَقَدْ حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ الْجَنَّةَ وَمَأْوَاهُ النَّارُ ۖ وَمَا لِلظَّالِمِينَ مِنْ أَنصَارٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Whoever makes <em>shirk  </em>with Allaah, then Allaah has made Paradise forbidden for him; and his abode will be the Hellfire. And the disbelieving wrongdoers will have no helper. </strong></span>[5:72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah will not forgive the <em>mushrik</em>:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاءُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah does not forgive that <em>shirk </em>be committed with Him and He forgives whatever is less than that to whomsoever He wishes. </strong></span>[4:48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this proves that Paradise is forbidden for the person of <em>shirk </em>and that Allaah will not forgive him and it proves that <em>shirk</em> is the greatest of all sins since all sins &#8211;  except for <em>shirk</em> – can be met with forgiveness:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاءُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah does not forgive that <em>shirk </em>be committed with Him and He forgives whatever is less than that to whomsoever He wishes.</span> </strong>[4:48]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So fornication and theft and drinking alcohol and taking usury  &#8211; all of it enters under <em>al-mashee’ah </em>(Allaah’s Wish and Will)  &#8211; if Allaah wishes, He will forgive its person and if He wishes, He will punish him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <em>shirk</em>, then it will not be forgiven. Allaah has passed judgement that He will not forgive it. And likewise the person of sin &#8211; even if he has committed major sins which are less than <em>shirk</em> then Paradise will not be forbidden for him. His final destination will be Paradise.  Either Allaah will forgive him straightaway and enter him into Paradise or else he will come out of the Fire after having been punished in it and he will (then) enter into Paradise. No matter what evil and sins which are less than <em>shirk</em> occur from the believer then he will not despair of the Mercy of Allaah and he will not be forbidden from Paradise, and he enters under the forgiveness (of Allaah) by the Wish and Will of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the person of <em>shirk </em>then he will be deprived and forbidden of all of that  &#8211; and Allaah’s refuge is sought – then this proves that <em>shirk</em> is the greatest of all sins. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الشِّرْكَ لَظُلْمٌ عَظِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong><em>Shirk</em></strong></span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> is the greatest <em><u>z</u>ulm (</em>wrongdoing)</span>. </strong>[31:13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Perfect, said:<strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاءُ ۚ وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَقَدِ افْتَرَىٰ إِثْمًا عَظِيمًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And whoever commits <em>shirk </em>with Allaah then he has invented a tremendous sin! </strong></span>[4:48]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلَالًا بَعِيدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And whoever commits <em>shirk </em>with Allaah then he has indeed strayed far away from the True Path! </strong></span>[4:116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this proves that <em>shirk</em> is the greatest of sins and since <em>shirk</em> is the greatest of sins then it is obligatory upon the scholars and the educated people to forbid it and to warn against it and that they do not remain silent from warning against <em>shirk</em>. And it is obligatory to fight <em>jihaad</em> against the people of <em>shirk</em> along with ability just as Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>fought <em>jihaad</em> against them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَاقْتُلُوا الْمُشْرِكِينَ حَيْثُ وَجَدتُّمُوهُمْ وَخُذُوهُمْ وَاحْصُرُوهُمْ وَاقْعُدُوا لَهُمْ كُلَّ مَرْصَدٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then kill the people of <em>shirk</em> wherever you find them and seize them and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush.</strong></span> [9:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is therefore obligatory to warn against <em>shirk</em> and to clarify it to the people so that they avoid it; this is what is obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for remaining silent about <em>shirk</em> and leaving the people passionately involved in worshipping other than Allaah whilst they claim to be upon Islaam – and there is no one forbidding them and no one warning them – then the matter is very serious. There are some people who turn their attention to forbidding usury and fornication and corruption of manners; these are forbidden matters and contain corruption however <em>shirk</em> is more serious. So why is attention not given to forbidding <em>shirk</em> and warning against <em>shirk</em> and explaining what many people have fallen into with regards to major <em>shirk</em> whilst they claim to be upon Islaam?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why is there laxity with regards to the matter of <em>shirk</em> and disregard of it and leaving the people to fall into it and (yet) the people of knowledge are present? Indeed they live along with those people and (yet) they remain silent with them. What is obligatory is to turn attention firstly to forbidding this tremendous danger (of <em>shirk</em>) which has devastated the Muslim nation. Every sin is less than it and what is obligatory is to begin with what is most important, then with what is next in importance.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh-ul-Usool-ith-Thalaathah : Lesson 10 : Part A</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F429094221&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنَّ الْمَسَاجِدَ لِلَّهِ فَلَا تَدْعُوا مَعَ اللَّهِ أَحَدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And that <em>masaajid</em> (the places of prayer) are to be for Allaah alone, so do not invoke anyone along with Allaah</span>. </strong>[72:18] <strong><sup>9</sup></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is not pleased that anyone should be associated with Him, no matter who it is, and this is stated clearly in the Book and in the Sunnah, however, to one who uses the intellect and who thinks carefully, and who discards blind following and the use of false and futile excuses, and who is alert to his own benefit. And the proof that Allaah is not pleased that anyone else besides Him should be associated with Him no matter who it is, is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنَّ الْمَسَاجِدَ لِلَّهِ فَلَا تَدْعُوا مَعَ اللَّهِ أَحَدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And that the places of prayer are to be for Allaah alone, so do not invoke anyone along with Allaah</span>. </strong>[72:18]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Masaajid </em>(the mosques), are the houses of Allaah and they are the places which are prepared for the <em><u>S</u>alaah </em>(prayer) and they are the most beloved of places to Allaah, and they are houses which Allaah has commanded should be raised and in which His Name should be mentioned. Then these mosques must be made a place for the worship of Allaah alone, nothing for other than Allaah must occur within them, so graves are not to be built in them, nor tombs because the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> cursed those who did that, and he informed that this is the practice of the Jews and the Christians and he forbade us from that at the end of his life, whilst he was in the throes of death <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> with his saying:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">ألا إن من كان قبلكم كانوا يتخذون القبور مساجد</h3>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"> ألا فلا تتخذوا القبور مساجد فإني أﻧﻬاكم عن ذلك</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Indeed those who came before you used to take the graves as places of prayer…” </strong> (he said this whilst he was dying), <strong>“…Indeed do not take the graves as places of prayer, for I certainly forbid you from that.”</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">لعنة الله على اليهود والنصارى اتخذوا قبور أنبيائهم مساجد</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Allaah’s curse is upon the Jews and the Christians, they took the graves of their Prophets as places of prayer.”</strong><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the mosques, it is obligatory that they be purified from traces of <em>shirk</em> and idolatory and that they not be built upon the graves, nor should the dead be buried in them after they have been built, rather they should be places for the worship of Allaah alone, the prayer should be established in them, and the Name of Allaah should be mentioned in them, and the Qur’aan should be recited in them, and beneficial lessons should be established in them, and people should remain in them for worship. This is the role of the mosques.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for having in them idols which are worshipped besides Allaah, then these are not mosques, these are shrines of <em>shirk</em>, even if their people call them mosques, because Allaah says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنَّ الْمَسَاجِدَ لِلَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And that the mosques, the places of prayer, are for Allaah</span> </strong>[72:18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: not for anyone else besides Him. And because the mosques, they are the places where the people gather and meet, so it is obligatory that they should be pure and free of <em>shirk</em> and <em>bid‘ah </em>(innovations) and false superstitions, because the people acquire knowledge in them and worship, so if anything from shirk and false superstitions are found in the mosques, then they will be influenced by that and they will propagate it upon earth, so it is obligatory that mosques should be purified from <em>shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the greatest of them is <em>al-Masjid-ul-<u>H</u>araam </em>(the Sacred Mosque, in Makkaah), just as Allaah, the Majestic and Most High commanded that it should be purified, He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِذْ بَوَّأْنَا لِإِبْرَاهِيمَ مَكَانَ الْبَيْتِ أَن لَّا تُشْرِكْ بِي شَيْئًا وَطَهِّرْ بَيْتِيَ لِلطَّائِفِينَ وَالْقَائِمِينَ وَالرُّكَّعِ السُّجُودِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And remember when We showed the site for the House to Ibraaheem and commanded him, that you should not associate anything with Me, and purify My house, for those people who are performing <em><u>T</u>awaaf</em> and for those who are standing in prayer and performing the bowing and prostration.</strong></span> [22:26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Purify it from what? Purify it from <em>shirk</em>, and from innovations and false superstitions, just as it is also to be purified from impurities and filthy things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> لَا تَدْعُو</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do not call upon or invoke</span> </strong>[72:18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The, “<em>laa”</em>, is the, ‘no of prohibition’. And the, “<strong><em>tad‘oo</em></strong>”, is a present tense verb which is in the jussive form because of the prohibiting, <em>“laa”</em>, and the sign that it is the jussive form is the removal of the, <em>‘noon’</em>. So the factor which makes it jussive is the, ‘no of prohibition’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So do not invoke, O people, anyone along with Allaah, do not supplicate for help from anyone along with Allaah, such as saying, “O Allaah, O Mu<u>h</u>ammad”, “O Allaah, O Abd-ul-Qaadir”, or saying, “O Abd-ul-Qaadir, O Mu<u>h</u>ammad”, or the like of that, because Allaah is not pleased with that and will not accept it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying He the Most High, “<strong><em>a<u>h</u>adan</em></strong>”, (anyone): is in indefinite form in the context of a prohibition, so therefore it is general to everyone, no-one is excepted, neither any angel drawn close nor any prophet sent, nor any idol, nor any object of worship, nor any grave, nor any Shaikh, nor any beloved servant of Allaah, nor any living person, nor any dead person, no matter who it is.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is general covering everyone who is called upon besides Allaah</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَلَا تَدْعُوا مَعَ اللَّهِ أَحَدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So do not call upon, do not invoke anyone along with Allaah.</span> </strong>[72:18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this <em>aayah</em> shows that worship will not benefit except with <em>taw<u>h</u>eed, </em>and that if <em>shirk</em> is mixed with it, then it becomes null and void and it will be an affliction for the person. Then He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنَّ الْمَسَاجِدَ لِلَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And the places of prayer are for Allaah</span> </strong>[72:18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory that they be built purely and sincerely, that the intention of the one building them should not be to show off or to be heard of or to be remembered as they say, or to be just Islamic antiquities, all of this is futile.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mosques should be built for worship and with the intention of worship, and the intention in them should be purely and sincerely for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and also they should be built from good and pure earnings, they should not be built from forbidden earnings because they are for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الله لا يقبل إلا طيبا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<span style="color:#000000;">Allah does not accept except what is good and pure</span>”</strong><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the mosques are to be built from lawful spending and the intention of their builders is that it is to be done purely and sincerely seeking the Face of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, he should not intend by building it to obtain praise from the people, or to be remembered, or for show of, or to be heard of, because building the mosques is worship and worship, it is obligatory that it should be done purely and sincerely for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh-ul-Usool-ith-Thalaathah : Lesson 09 : Part A</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F428168643&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/allaah-is-not-pleased-that-anyone-else-should-be-associated-with-him-in-worship-of-him" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah the Perfect and Most High is not pleased that anyone else should be associated in worship with Him</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">المَسْأَلَةُ الثَّانِيَةُ: <span style="color:#000000;"><sup> </sup>أَنَّ اللهَ لاَ يَرْضَى أَنْ يُشْرَكَ مَعَهُ أَحَدٌ غَيرُهُ فِي عِبَادَتِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The second matter: that Allaah is not pleased that anyone else should be associated with Him in worship of</strong> <strong>Him<sup>7</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih Al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This matter is connected to the first matter, because the first one was an explanation of the obligation of worshipping Allaah, and of following the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>and it is the meaning of the <em>shahaadatain </em>(two testifications), the meaning of the testification that, ‘None has the right to be worshipped except Allaah’, and the testification that, ‘Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah’. And the second matter is that worship, if it has <em>shirk</em> mixed with it, then it will not be accepted, because it is essential that worship is done purely for the Face of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore whoever worships Allaah, and worships something else along with Him, then the worship of him is futile or null and void. Its presence is just the same as its absence, because worship will not benefit except with <em>ikhlaa<u>s</u></em> (i.e. it is done purely for Allaah) and <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>. So if it is mixed with <em>shirk</em> then it is corrupted, just as he the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَقَدْ أُوحِيَ إِلَيْكَ وَإِلَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكَ لَئِنْ أَشْرَكْتَ لَيَحْبَطَنَّ عَمَلُكَ وَلَتَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And it was revealed to you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(O Mu</span><span style="color:#008000;"><u>h</u></span><span style="color:#008000;">ammad) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">and to those Messengers who came before you, that if you associate anything with Allaah then all your deeds will be rendered null and void, and then you would certainly be from the losers</span>. </strong>[39:65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Perfect said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَوْ أَشْرَكُوا لَحَبِطَ عَنْهُم مَّا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if they committed <em>shirk</em> </strong>(associated anything along with Allaah) <strong>then whatever deeds they had done would be rendered null and void. </strong></span>[6:88]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So worship is not called worship except along with <em>taw<u>h</u>eed, </em>just as the <em><u>s</u>alaah</em> (prayer) is not called <em><u>s</u>alaah</em> except along with purification. So if <em>shirk</em> is mixed with worship, it corrupts it and nullifies it, just as is the case with purification, if it is mixed with one of those things which break the <em>wu<u>d</u>oo’</em> then that corrupts it and nullifies it, and therefore Allaah in many <em>aayahs</em> of the Qur’aan joins the command to worship Him and the prohibition of <em>shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَلَا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And worship Allaah and do not associate anything along with Him </strong></span>[4:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211;</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا أُمِرُوا إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ الدِّينَ حُنَفَاءَ وَيُقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَيُؤْتُوا الزَّكَاةَ ۚ وَذَٰلِكَ دِينُ الْقَيِّمَةِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they were not commanded except that they should worship Allaah making the religion purely and sincerely for Him, upon the true religion of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, turning away from <em>shirk</em>. </strong></span>[98:5]</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلَّا نُوحِي إِلَيْهِ أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا أَنَا فَاعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We did not send before you a Messenger except that We revealed to him that none has the right to be worshipped except Me so therefore worship Me alone. </strong></span>[21:25]</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا أَنَا فَاعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>None has the right to be worshipped except Me </strong></span>[21:25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This contains two matters: it contains a negation of <em>shirk</em> and it contains affirmation of worship for Allaah the Most High.</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَضَىٰ رَبُّكَ أَلَّا تَعْبُدُوا إِلَّا إِيَّاهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And your Lord commanded that you should not worship except Him </strong></span>[17:23]</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِي كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولًا أَنِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُوا الطَّاغُوتَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We sent a Messenger to every nation, commanding worship Allaah and avoid <em>a<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>aaghoot</em> </strong>(all false objects of worship)</span><strong>. </strong>[16:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He joined between the worship of Allaah and avoiding the <em><u>T</u>aaghoot </em>(all the false objects of worship)<em>, </em>because the worship of Allaah will not be worship except with avoiding the <em><u>T</u>aaghoot, </em>and that is <em>shirk</em>. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِالطَّاغُوتِ وَيُؤْمِن بِاللَّهِ فَقَدِ اسْتَمْسَكَ بِالْعُرْوَةِ الْوُثْقَىٰ لَا انفِصَامَ لَهَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So whoever rejects the <em><u>T</u>aaghoot</em> and truly believes in Allaah, and that Allaah alone has the right to be worshipped, then he has clung on to the firmest hand-hold which will never break</span> </strong>[2:256]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So truly believing in Allaah is not sufficient except with rejection of <em>a<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>aaghoot, </em>otherwise the <em>mushrikoon</em> (the people of <em>shirk</em>) they believed in Allaah, however they associated others in worship with Him:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا يُؤْمِنُ أَكْثَرُهُم بِاللَّهِ إِلَّا وَهُم مُّشْرِكُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And most of them do not believe except that they associate others in their worship of Allaah</strong></span> [12:106]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He the Perfect makes it clear that they had belief in Allaah, however they corrupted it with <em>shirk</em> (association of others in worship of Allaah), and Allaah’s refuge is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is meaning of the saying of the Shaikh (author), that whoever worshipped Allaah and obeyed the Messenger, then he may not associate anything in worship along with Allaah, because Allaah is not pleased that anything be associated with Him in His worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>said in that which he reported from his Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, Allaah the Most High said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">أنا أغنى الشركاء عن الشرك ، من عمل عملا أشرك معي فيه غيري تركته وشركه</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“I am the One having no need of any association of worship. Whoever does an action in which he associates anyone else along with Me, then I will abandon him and his <em>shirk</em>.”</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Muslim as a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Huraira (<em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhu).</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there are people who pray the <em><u>s</u>alaah</em>, and they bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah, and they do that plentifully, and they fast and they perform the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em>. However, they make supplication to tombs, and they perform worship of Al-Hasan and Al-Husain and Al-Badawee and so-and-so and so-and-so, and they call for relief from the dead. Those people their worship is false and futile, because they have associated others with Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, they have mixed worship with shirk so their deeds are futile and nullified, until they single out Allaah the Mighty and Majestic with worship and they make worship purely for Him and they abandon the worship of everything else besides Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Otherwise they will be upon nothing, so it is obligatory to draw attention to this, because Allaah is not pleased that anything should be associated with Him in His worship, anyone no matter who it is. He the Perfect is not pleased that anyone should be associated with Him no matter who it may be, so that no-one should say, “I take the beloved servants of Allaah, the righteous people and the good people as intercessors. I do not worship the idols and images as they used to do in the times of ignorance. I only take these ones as intercessors, I do not worship them.” So we say to him: This was the saying of the people in the times of ignorance, they took them as intercessors with Allaah because they were righteous people and beloved servants from the beloved servants of Allaah. But Allaah is not pleased with this.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b style="color:#993300;">[</b><b style="color:#993300;">Text from Imam Muhammad Ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab’s &#8220;Four Rules Regarding Shirk&#8221;]</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know, may Allaah grant you the ability to obey Him, that the <em>Haneefiyyah</em>, the religion of Ibraaheem is that <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>you worship Allaah alone, making the Religion sincere for only Him</strong></span>, as Allaah says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And I did not create the Jinn and mankind except to worship Me.”</strong><br />
</span>[Surah Adh-Dhaariyaat: 56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when you come to realize that Allaah created you in order to worship Him, then know that worship is not called worship unless it is accompanied by Tawheed, just as prayer is not called that unless it is accompanied by (ritual) purity. So if Shirk (mixing partners) enters into one’s worship, it ruins it, just like impurity when it enters into the (ritual) purity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when you come to realize that Shirk – when mixed into one’s worship – spoils it, invalidates one’s actions, and makes the person who possesses it into one who will reside eternally in the Hellfire, you will know that the most important thing that is binding upon you is to gain knowledge of that, so that perhaps Allaah may absolve you from this trap, which is ascribing partners to Allaah (i.e. Shirk) about which Allaah said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاءُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Verily, Allaah does not forgive that partners be ascribed to Him in worship, but He forgives what is less than that to whom He wills.”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This can be achieved by knowing <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/islamic-book-study/the-four-rules-regarding-shirk-al-qawaaid-ul-arbaah/"><strong>Four Rules</strong></a> that Allaah has mentioned in His Book.</p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Explanation from Dr. Muhammad Bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Khumayyis&#8217; explanation of <em><a style="color:#993300;" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/09/21/explanation-of-four-rules-of-shirk-shaykh-muhammad-al-khumayyis/">Four Rules Regarding Shirk</a></em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Language</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Haneefiyyah</em> comes from <em>Haneef</em>, which is someone that turns away from Shirk while being firmly established upon Tawheed; <em>ahbata</em> (invalidates) nullifies; <em>maa doona dhaalik</em> (what is less than that) i.e. what is less than Shirk such as sins and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Explanation</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh, may Allaah have mercy on him, began by clarifying the foundation of <em>AlHaneefiyyah</em>, which is the upright religion of Ibraaheem. Its basis is found in what Allaah has stated, calling the people to follow Ibraaheem:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ دِينًا مِّمَّنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ لِلَّهِ وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌ وَاتَّبَعَ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And who can be better in religion than one who submits his face </strong>(i.e. himself)<strong> to Allaah, while being a good-doer, and follows the Religion of Ibraaheem as a Haneef </strong>(i.e. rejecting Shirk and affirming Tawheed)<strong>?”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">قُلْ إِنَّنِي هَدَانِي رَبِّي إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ دِينًا قِيَمًا مِّلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفًا ۚ وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Say </strong>(O Muhammad)<strong>: ‘Truly my Lord has guided me to a Straight Path, and upright religion, the religion of Ibraaheem – Haneef – and he </strong>(i.e. Ibraaheem)<strong> was not from the polytheists.’”</strong></span> [Surah Al-An’aam: 161]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So its foundation is: Singling Allaah out in the worship and sincerity that is due to Him, as Allaah says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And I did not create the Jinn and mankind except to worship Me.”</strong></span><br />
[Surah AdhDhaariyaat: 56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah did not create mankind except for them to worship Him. And it is not truthful to call worship by this name unless Tawheed accompanies it, since one of the conditions for its validity is that it (i.e. worship) must be done sincerely for Him alone. Similarly, it is not truthful to call prayer by this name unless (ritual) purity accompanies it, since it is a condition for its existence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if this is not so, then if a condition is absent this means that the thing that requires this condition will also be absent. Shirk entering and mixing into worship spoils and nullifies it, just as an impure occurrence (hadath) causes the (ritual) purity to be spoiled and nullified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when it becomes clear that Shirk spoils the worship once it mixes into it, causing its reward to be lost and it to return rejected to the one that performed it, as well as canceling out his deeds, as Allaah says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">وَلَقَدْ أُوحِيَ إِلَيْكَ وَإِلَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكَ لَئِنْ أَشْرَكْتَ لَيَحْبَطَنَّ عَمَلُكَ وَلَتَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Had you committed Shirk, we would have surely cancelled out your deeds and you would have indeed been one of the losers”</strong></span> [Surah Az-Zumar: 65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and that the one who falls into this Shirk by committing it deserves eternity in the Hellfire, as Allaah says in His Book:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وَكَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا أُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا ۖ وَبِئْسَ الْمَصِيرُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And those who disbelieve and reject Our signs </strong>(i.e. verses)<strong>, they are the inhabitants of the Hellfire, wherein they will reside forever – what an evil destination”</strong></span> [Surah At-Taghaabun: 10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">then at this point it will become clear that the most important thing that is obligated on the servant is that he know how to single Allaah out solely for worship and how to avoid Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By this, perhaps he may be set free from this satanic trap, which the Devil has set up in order to mislead the people away from their Lord and into committing Shirk with Allaah. This is the sin that Allaah does not forgive, as He says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاءُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Verily, Allaah does not forgive that partners be ascribed to Him in worship </strong>(i.e. Shirk)<strong>, but He forgives what is less than that to whom He wills.”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this cannot be accomplished unless one knows the following four rules, which Allaah has mentioned in His Book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Summary:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The foundation of the Religion of Ibraaheem is to make one’s worship sincerely for Allaah alone and not mix partners into His worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Shirk spoils one’s worship and causes a person’s good deeds to be invalidated. And the person that commits it will reside eternally in the Hellfire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The most important thing that the servant (of Allaah) is obligated to learn is knowledge of Tawheed so that he may act on it, and knowledge of Shirk so that he may avoid it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Examination:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. What is the foundation of the Religion of Ibraaheem and what is the proof for it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Explain the effect that Shirk has on worship and what it resembles. Give an example for it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. What is the most important thing the servant (of Allaah) is obligated to learn and know?</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 69 : Point 115</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Look into the stars sparingly, just enough to help you to know the times of the prayer. And turn away from whatever besides that, since it invites to apostasy </strong></span></p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani: The Prophet (ﷺ) led us in the Fajr prayer at Hudaibiya after a rainy night. On completion of the prayer, he faced the people and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Do you know what your Lord has said (revealed)?</strong></span>&#8221; The people replied, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Allah has said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8216;In this morning some of my slaves remained as true believers and some became non-believers; whoever said that the rain was due to the Blessings and the Mercy of Allah had belief in Me and he disbelieves in the stars, and whoever said that it rained because of a particular star had no belief in Me but believes in that star.&#8217; &#8220;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Bukhari] [Muhsin Khan&#8217;s Translation]</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qatadah (<em>radi Allaahu anhu</em>) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>&#8220;These stars were only created for three purposes: Allah created them as adornment for the heaven </strong>(sky)<strong>, as missiles for the devils and as signs for navigation. Therefore, whoever seeks to interpret any other meanings for them other than these, then verily he has spoken with his own opinion, he has lost his portion and burdened himself with that which he has no knowledge of.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim both recorded this statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwa no. 1304</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: The questioner would like to be given a general idea about the Qadiriyyah Tariqah (Sufi order). He read one of the Qadiriyyah books: <em>&#8220;Al-Fiyudat Al-Rabbaniyyah fi Al-Ma&#8217;athir wa Al-Awrad Al-Qadiriyyah&#8221;</em>, and saw a poem including some of the claims and feats performed by the shaykh of this Tariqah. He asks if what is said in this poem is true or untrue. The questioner sent the poem along with his question to ask for a general Fatwa (legal opinion issued by a qualified Muslim scholar) on it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The poem that was sent by the questioner shows that the one who wrote it was ignorant, as the things that he ascribes to himself are Kufr (disbelief) and misguidance. He claims that all the scholars&#8217; knowledge has been derived from his knowledge and is part of him. He also claims that the Servants&#8217; behavior is according to what he legislates for them and that he would be able to close the Fire due to his greatness, except for a prior pledge taken from the Prophet. He says he can help those of his Murid (students) who are loyal to him and save them from ordeals, protect them in this world and in the Hereafter, secure them from fear, and be with them at the Mizan (the Scales for weighing deeds) on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are false claims, and could only be said by someone who is ignorant and does not know his own ability. Comprehensive knowledge is possessed by Allah Alone, as are the matters related to the Hereafter, and He Alone has control over them; not an angel, a prophet, or a pious person. Allah commanded His Messenger, who was the best of His Creation, to recite to the Ummah (nation) His Words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8220;I possess no power over benefit or harm to myself except as Allâh wills. If I had the knowledge of the Ghaib (Unseen), I should have secured for myself an abundance of wealth, and no evil should have touched me. I am but a warner, and a bringer of glad tidings unto people who believe</strong></span>.&#8221; (Surah Al-A`raf, 7: 188)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Say: &#8220;It is not in my power to cause you harm, or to bring you to the Right Path.&#8221; </strong></span>(Surah Al-Jinn, 72: 21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8220;None can protect me from Allâh’s punishment (if I were to disobey Him), nor can I find refuge except in Him</strong></span>.&#8221; (Surah Al-Jinn, 72: 22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) told those closest to him to save themselves and their children from Allah&#8217;s Punishment through having Iman (Faith) in Him (Glorified be He) and by acting according to His Shari`ah (laws). He also told them that Allah is not in need of them and that Adam, Nuh (Noah), Ibrahim (Abraham) and `Isa (Jesus) will be saying on the Day of Resurrection, &#8220;Myself, myself!&#8221; So how can a shaykh of the Qadiriyyah Tariqah or anyone else created by Allah save their followers, protect those who are loyal to them, and come with them when their deeds are being weighed on the Day of Resurrection? And how could he close the gates of Hell by his greatness? <strong>This is a manifest fabrication and clear Kufr regarding the Shari`ah of the Lord of the Worlds</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author of this poem has been excessive in his exaggeration and has overstepped the boundaries of the senses,the intellect, and the Shari`ah, when he claims that he was in the light of Muhammad before the existence of creation, and that he witnessed the meeting of friends, i.e. when Jibril (Gabriel) met with Muhammad (peace be upon them both); he was with Nuh (peace be upon him) in the ark and witnessed the flood; he was with Ibrahim (peace be upon him) when he was thrown to the fire and saw how the fire cooled due to his Du`a&#8217; (supplication); he was with Isma`il (Ishmael) and that the ram was only sent except by his generosity; he was with Ya`qub (Jacob, peace be upon him) when his sight was taken away and that his eyes were only cured with his spit; he was the one who settled Idris (Enoch, peace be upon him) in Jannah (Paradise); he was with Musa (Moses, peace be upon him) when he talked to his Lord and that Musa&#8217;s stick was taken from his stick; he was with `Isa (peace be upon him) in the cradle; and that it was he who gave Dawud (David) his beautiful voice for recitation. He also makes even more obscene claims than these, as he claims that he is Allah in three verses of his poem, the clearest of which is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I am the one, the only, and the great one in himself,<br />
I am the describer and the described; the shaykh of the Tariqah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah be Exalted and Glorified from this great exceeding of the bounds; <strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">is there anything worse than this sheer Kufr?</span> </strong>May Allah protect us from it!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Dear questioner, may Allah turn you away from this evil you heard and make you feel no need to study the detailed history and biography of the Qadiriyyah, and what is in this poem by the shaykh of this Tariqah in terms of falsehood, Kufr, and exaggeration. Exert yourself instead to learn the truth from the Book of Allah(Exalted be He), the Sunnah of His Prophet (peace be upon him), and the explanations of the Salaf (pious predecessors) from among the Sahabah (Companions) and their followers of the Qur&#8217;an and the Sahih (authentic) Sunnah. We believe that <strong>Shaykh `Abdul-Qadir Al-Jilany</strong>, to whom this Tariqah is ascribed, is as innocent of what is in this poem as the wolf was innocent of the blood of Yaqub&#8217;s son. His followers tell many lies about him and ascribe to him that which he is innocent of.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>[1] Translator’s Side Point:</strong></span> <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> says regarding the last phrase “<strong>having no partner</strong>” &#8211; denial of any partner for Allaah the Most High will not be complete except by negating/denying three types of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Firstly</strong></span>: By denying <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> in Allaah’s Lordship; which is to believe that there is another creator along with Allaah, He the Perfect and Most High, as is the belief of the Magians – those who say that evil has a creator besides Allaah the Perfect. And this type of <em><u>sh</u>irk </em>is something very rare in this Ummah and all praise is for Allaah, even though the saying of the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> is very close to it – their saying that evil is the creation of the person; and this fact is indicated by the saying of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">القدرية مجوس هذه الأمة</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>The <em>Qadariyyah</em> are the Magians of this Ummah</strong>…” the <u>h</u>adee<u>th</u>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Secondly</strong></span>: It is <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> with regard to worship; which is, that a person worships someone along with Allaah – someone from the prophets or the righteous such as calling upon them for relief and calling upon them at times of hardship and so on. And this, regretfully, is present a great deal in this Ummah. And the major part of responsibility for it is borne by those <u>sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>s who support this type of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> by giving it the name of <em>tawassul</em> (drawing closer to Allaah) calling it by other than its name!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Thirdly</strong></span>: <em><u>Sh</u>irk</em> with regard to Allaah’s Attributes; which is, that a person describes someone from the creation of Allaah the Most High, with some of the attributes which are particular to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. Such as, claiming that people have knowledge of the hidden and unseen for example; and this type is widespread amongst many of the <u>S</u>oofees and those who are influenced by them.  For example, those who praise the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> with exaggerated praise like the one who said about him in a line of poetry: “From your generosity came about the whole world and whatever it contains and from your knowledge is the knowledge of the Preserved Tablet and the knowledge of everything the Pen has written.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from this has come the misguidance of those <em>dajjaals</em> – those who claim that the see the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> today whilst they are awake and that they ask him about things which are hidden – things about the secrets of the souls of people they associate with. Whereas, the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> did not know such things even when he was alive; rather, he was told to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>If I knew the hidden and unseen then I could have increased greatly in good and harm would not have touched me.</em></span><strong> </strong>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>188)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how could he know that after his death and after he passed on to the highest company of angels?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these three types of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>, whoever negates/denies them from Allaah in his <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of Him and he singles out Allaah in His Self and His worship and His Attributes, then that person is the <em>muwa<u>hh</u>id</em> (the person of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>) who is covered by the virtues particular to the people of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed.</em> And whoever commits something from that <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> then to him is directed the like of the saying of Allaah the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>If you commit shirk then (all of) your deeds will be rendered null and void and you will from the losers.</em></span><strong> </strong>(Sooratuz-Zumar (39), <em>aayah </em>65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So preserve this point because it is the most important thing in `<em>aqeedah</em>. So, there is no surprise in the fact that the author began with it. And whoever wishes to see further details then let him refer back to the explanation of this book and the books of the <u>Sh</u>uyoo<u>kh</u>ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibnul-Qayyim and Ibn `Abdil -Wahhaab and others, and those who followed upon their way.</p>

Original Title: فتح المجيد<br />
Original Author: ‘Abdur-Raḥmān Ibn Ḥasan Āli-Shaykh<br />
Translator: Abu az-Zubayr Harrison ( hafidhahullaah)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Contents:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First Verse:</strong> That is only Satan who frightens (you) of his supporters<br />
The Types of Fearing Others Besides Allah<br />
<strong>The Second Verse:</strong> The mosques of Allah are only to be maintained by those who believe in Allah and the Last Day<br />
<strong>The Third Verse:</strong> &#8220;And of mankind are some who say, “We believe in Allah,” but if they are made to suffer for the sake of Allah…&#8221;<br />
<strong>The Ḥadīth:</strong> “Whoever seeks the pleasure of Allah by angering people, Allah will suffice him regarding people.”</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">The First Verse:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (تعالى ) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">That is only Satan who frightens (you) of his supporters. So do not fear them, but fear Me, if you are indeed believers.</span> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fear is one of the most dignified and important religious principles. Fear of Allah summarizes all forms of worship which must be made solely and sincerely for Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says (about His messengers):</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">And they, from fearing Him, are frightened.</span> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (تعالى ) says (about the angels):</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">They fear their Lord above them.</span>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (تعالى ) says (about the believers):</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">But whoever has feared standing before his Lord will have two gardens</span>.[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">So fear only Me.</span>[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">So do not fear people, but fear Me.</span> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many verses in the Quran similar to these.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Fear of other than Allah can be divided into three types.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The first type of fear is an inward, spiritual fear. This type is the religious fear one has of other than Allah such as fearing idols and false gods, being afraid that they may afflict him with something he dislikes. An example is the verse in which Allah narrated that the people of Prophet Hūd said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">“We only say that some of our gods have possessed you with evil.” He said, “Indeed, I call Allah to witness, and you witness yourselves, that I am free from whatever you associate with Allah.”</span> [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah also says about this type of fear:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">And they threaten you with those (they worship) other than Him.</span> [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is exactly the same type of fear those who worship grave inhabitants have as well as idol worshippers; such people fear these false gods. They threaten the people who believe only in Allah with the punishment of such false deities when the believers criticize their misplaced worship, encouraging them to instead sincerely worship Allah alone. This type of fear completely invalidates tawḥīd – the worship of Allah alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The second type of fearing others besides Allah is when one chooses not to do what he is religiously obligated to do out of fear of other people. This type of fear is impermissible and it is a form of associating others with Allah which contradicts complete tawḥīd. And it is this type of fear for which the opening verse was revealed; Allah (تعالى ) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Those to whom hypocrites said, “The people have certainly gathered against you, so fear them.” But it (only) increased them in faith and they said, “Sufficient for us is Allah and (He is) the best disposer of affairs.” So they returned with favor from Allah and bounty, no harm having touched them. They pursued the pleasure of Allah, and Allah is the possessor of great bounty. That is only Satan who frightens (you) of his supporters. So do not fear them, but fear Me, if you are indeed believers.</span> [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, in a ḥadīth</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Allah (تعالى ) will ask a worshipper on the Day of Resurrection, “What prevented you, when you saw some wrongdoing, from changing it?” The person will answer, “My Lord, the fear of people.” He will say, “I was more deserving that you fear Me.”</span> [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The third type of fearing others besides Allah is the natural fear. It is the instinctive fear of an enemy, a wild animal, or similar things. There is nothing wrong with this type of fear as Allah (تعالى ) said relaying the story of Prophet Mūsá ( عليه السلام) :</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">So he escaped it (the city), fearful and anticipating (apprehension). He said, “My Lord, save me from the wrongdoing people.”</span> [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the meaning of &#8220;That is only Satan who frightens (you) of his supporters&#8221; in the opening verse,12 it means he tries to make you afraid of his allies. And as for &#8220;So do not fear them, but fear Me&#8221;, this is a commandment from Allah (تعالى ) to believers that they must not fear others besides Him. It is an order that they should limit their emotion of fear to Allah alone, fearing none other. This is the complete sincerity and devotion Allah requires from his worshippers and with which He is pleased. So when they ensure their fear is for none other than Allah, as well as all other aspects of worship, He will in return give them what they hope for and keep them safe and secure from the fears of this life and the hereafter as He (تعالى ) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">Is Allah not sufficient for His servant? And yet they threaten you with other than Him.</span>[13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great scholar Ibn al-Qayyim ( رحمه الله  تعالى ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Part of the plot of the enemy of Allah is that he tries to frighten believers with his soldiers and supporters. He does so in order that the believers will be too scared to oppose and strive against them, too scared to encourage his supporters to do good or forbid them from doing evil. As such, Allah, the Most High, informs us that this is all part of the plot and deception of Satan and his intimidation and frightening (of believers). Yet He has forbidden us from fearing them by saying—and this is the interpretation of most interpreters—that Satan is only trying to make the believers scared of his supporters. Qatādah says, “He (Satan) makes them (his supporters) seem greater, more significant in the believer’s hearts.” So whenever a worshipper’s faith in Allah becomes stronger, the fear of Satan’s supporters becomes less, and when his faith weakens, his fear of them becomes greater. Therefore, this verse shows that sincerity in fear is one of the conditions of complete faith.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">The Second Verse</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (تعالى ) says:</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">The mosques of Allah are only to be maintained by those who believe in Allah and the Last Day and establish prayer and give charity and fear none other besides Allah. It is expected that those will be of the rightly guided.</span>[14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here, Allah tells us the mosques of Allah are to be maintained only by people of faith in Allah and the last day (the Day of Judgment). They are those who both believe with their hearts and worship with their limbs, and they make their fear sincerely and exclusively for Allah and no other. For these, He has confirmed the maintenance of places of worship after He forbade it for those who worship others besides Him. This is because the establishment and care of such places of worship is to be done with obedience (to Allah) and righteous actions. As for one who worships other than Allah, even if he were to perform a seemingly righteous action:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Their deeds are like a mirage in a desert which a thirsty one thinks is water until, when he comes to it, he finds it is nothing but finds Allah before him.</span> [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Or:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">Their deeds are like ashes which the wind blows forcefully on a stormy day.</span>[16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Considering that, true goodness does not result from such action or person. So places of worship, the mosques, should be maintained and populated with only true faith, the most dignified of which is tawḥīd and righteous deeds free of all forms of deficiency such as the worship of other than Allah and unfounded religious innovation. All of that is included in the meaning of the word “faith” (īmān) according to mainstream Muslims who follow the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">About &#8220;and (they) fear none other besides Allah&#8221; in the verse, Ibn ‘Aṭiyyah says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It means the type of fear which is based on honor, worship, and obedience. And while it may be inevitable that people are afraid of worldly dangers, they must ultimately fear the decree and control of Allah alone regarding (the consequences) of such worldly dangers.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim ( رحمه الله ) says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Fear is worship of the heart, and it is not fitting to be given to others besides Allah, similar to repentance, love, reliance, hope, and other aspects of worship of the heart.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for &#8220;It is expected that those will be of the rightly guided&#8221;, Ibn Abī Ṭalḥah reported that Ibn ‘Abbās ( رضي الله عنه ) ماsaid, “He is saying, ‘They are the rightly guided.’ Any time the Arabic word ‘( عَسَىasá – “perhaps,” “it is expected,” etc.) is used in the Quran, it means it is something destined to happen.” [17]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">The Third Verse</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (تعالى ) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And of mankind are some who say, “We believe in Allah.” But if they are made to suffer for the sake of Allah, they consider the trial of mankind as (if it were equal to) the punishment of Allah.</span> [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Kathīr ( رحمه الله ) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (تعالى ) informs us about the characteristics of some people who dishonestly claim to believe, but their belief is only with their tongues and not firm in their hearts. For such people, when a trial or tribulation comes to them in this life, they believe it is from the resentment and wrath of Allah and then leave Islam. Ibn ‘Abbās ( رضي الله عنه ما ) said, “It becomes a tribulation from which he leaves his religion when harmed for the sake of Allah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim ( رحمه الله ) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When people are sent a messenger, they become one of two types of individuals: those who respond, “I believe,” and those who do not. Those who refuse continue on with their sin and disbelief. As for he who says he believes, he is then tested by his Lord with trial and affliction; the affliction is only a test however. This is to distinguish the truthful from the untruthful. As for those who do not believe (in the messenger), he should not think that Allah is incapable (of testing him), or that he will escape from Him. As a consequence, whoever believes in the messengers and obeys them, the messengers’ enemies will begin to show enmity toward him and afflict him with whatever will harm him (in this life). And those who neither believe in the messengers nor obey them, they will be recompensed in this life and in the hereafter and will still eventually experience what harms them. Yet their harm is greater and more lasting than that experienced in life by the messenger’s followers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So even though every soul will experience some type of harm, whether it believes or refuses belief, a believer is hurt in this life only as a trial for him then he will be rewarded for it both in this life and in the hereafter. But he who refuses to believe, he may experience his delight in this life, again only as a trial for him, then he experiences a permanent harm and everlasting pain (in the hereafter).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everyone must live among others and people have their own ideas and plans. People want other individuals to agree and conform to them in their plans. If one does not agree with them, choosing instead to contradict them, they seek to harm and punish him. Even if he were to conform to them, he would still be harmed, sometimes by the very people he agrees with, sometimes by others. For example, if a person of religion who is conscientious of Allah is among sinful or oppressive people, he may feel he has no way of escaping their wickedness and oppression except by either agreeing and conforming to what they are upon or at least by remaining silent regarding their evil. Were he to support them or remain silent, he may save himself from their evil and tribulations. But they will then have gained influence and power over him, humiliating him and perhaps harming him with affliction even greater than he had feared had he criticized them and differed from them. Even if he were safe from them, he may simply be humiliated and harmed by other than them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The solution is to remember what the Mother of the Believers, ‘Āishah ( رضي الله عنها ), said to Muā’wiyah ( رضي الله عنه ): Whoever seeks the pleasure of Allah by angering people, Allah will suffice him regarding people. And whoever seeks the pleasure of people by angering Allah, Allah will entrust him to people.” [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when Allah guides an individual, inspiring within him His guidance and saving him from the evil of his own soul, such a person would refuse to support and agree with others in sinful acts. He would patiently bear whatever enmity they show him for it. He will then have his reward in this life and the hereafter as did the messengers and their followers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (تعالى ) then informs us about those who enter the faith without true insight. When he is harmed for the sake of Allah, he considers the tribulation of people—and it is the hurt he feels from them and their hatred which the messengers and their followers always experience from those who oppose them—he makes such tribulation of people, by his fleeing from it and avoiding whatever upsets them, equal to the punishment of Allah from which believers should more rightfully flee with true faith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">True believers with complete insight, however, flee from the punishment of Allah toward belief in Him. They bear patiently with whatever temporary harm they may suffer (from people) for Him, harm from which they will soon escape. But the other individual (who refuses to differ from sinful people), from his weak insight and unclear understanding of faith, flees from the harm of those who oppose the messengers toward agreeing with them and following them. In doing so, he flees from the punishment of people and into the punishment of Allah. He equates the harm of people, by his action of fleeing from it in what angers Allah, with the punishment of Allah. How unbefitting it is that he seeks safety and refuge (from people’s harm) in the scorching fire, running away from the pain of an hour to the pain of eternity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in this verse is a refutation of the Murjiah Karrāmiyah sect (who claim that merely expressing faith with the tongue is sufficient to be saved). This is because such peoples’ statement, “We believe in Allah,” as mentioned in the verse, did not benefit them when they refused to patiently bear the harm of those who would hurt them for the sake of Allah. So proclaiming faith alone is of no benefit without actions. True religious faith of any person is only correct when it combines three aspects: belief in the heart and its actions (emotions in accordance with faith), statements with the tongue, and actions with the limbs. That is the position of all mainstream Muslims who follow the Sunnah, past and present, and Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such action (conforming to sinfulness, refusing to differ from it) is a form of flattering the creation despite the truth, and the only one saved from such action is one whom Allah saves.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">The Ḥadīth</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Āishah ( رضي الله عنه ) reported that Allah’s messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Whoever seeks the pleasure of Allah by angering people, Allah will suffice him regarding people. And whoever seeks the pleasure of people by angering Allah, Allah will entrust him to people.”</span> [20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Ḥibbān recorded this ḥadīth with that wording and al-Tirmidhī recorded it by way of a man from Medina who said that Mu’āwiyah ( رضي الله عنه ) wrote to ‘Āishah ( رضي الله عنها) : “Write and advise me but be concise.” She replied, greeting him with “Peace be on you,” then wrote that she heard the messenger of Allah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) say, “Whoever seeks the pleasure of Allah by angering people, Allah will suffice him regarding people. And whoever seeks the pleasure of people by angering Allah, Allah will entrust him to people.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholar of Islam (Ibn Taymiyyah) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Āishah wrote this ḥadīth to Mu’āwiyah and it has been reported from her in a marfū’ form [21] that she said, “Whoever seeks the pleasure of Allah by angering people, Allah will suffice him regarding people. And whoever seeks the pleasure of people by angering Allah, they will not protect him from Allah in any way.” That is the marfū’ form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has also been reported in a mawqūf form [22] that she said, “Whoever pleases Allah at the expense of angering people, Allah will be pleased with him and cause people to be pleased with him too. But whoever pleases people at the expense of angering Allah, He will make those who praise him revert back to criticizing him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the greatest understanding of religion. Whoever seeks to please Allah, even if it means angering people, he has rightfully feared Allah and has become His righteous worshipper. Allah in return assumes the responsibility of protecting the righteous and He is sufficient for his worshipper.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever fears Allah, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty), and He will provide him from (sources) he could never imagine</span>.[23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah will certainly suffice him from having to rely on people. As for trying to please all people, that is impossible anyway.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for, “seeking the pleasure of people by angering Allah,” in doing this, the person gives preference to people’s acceptance and happiness over that of Allah. This happens when the honor and respect for Allah and His greatness has not settled in his heart. If it had, it would have prevented him from seeking to gain the pleasure of the creation by gaining the anger of his creator, his Lord, and owner – the very One who controls all hearts, removes all difficulties, and forgives all sins. Based on this, such a choice (preferring to please people by angering Allah) is a form of associating others in worship with Allah because he considers pleasing the creation a higher priority than pleasing Allah. He seeks to get closer to creation by way of displeasing Allah. And no one is saved from this except one whom Allah saves and for whom He gives the success of truly knowing Him. This is attained by knowing what befits Allah by believing in His characteristics and rejecting any false notions which reduce His perfection and knowing tawḥīd of His lordship and sole right to worship. With Allah alone is success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Rajab ( رحمه الله ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one realizes that anyone of creation on earth—and the earth is merely dirt—is himself (created) from dirt, then why would someone give preference to obeying someone from dirt over obeying the Lord of lords? How can he please dirt by angering the Owner, the Bestower? That is certainly an amazing thing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this ḥadīth, there is a severe reprimand for whoever fears people, preferring their acceptance and pleasure over Allah. And perhaps his punishment for doing so may even be a test or affliction in his religion—we seek refuge with Allah from that—as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">So He punished them with hypocrisy in their hearts until the day they will meet Him because they failed Allah in what they promised Him and because they used to lie</span>. [24]</p>

[10] Recorded by Aḥmad (3/27, 29, 77), Ibn Ḥibbān (1845), Ibn Mājah (4017), and others. Shaykh ‘Abdul ‘Azīz Ibn Bāz said it is authentic in his checking of Fatḥ al-Majīd. Shaykh Nāṣir al-Dīn al-Albānī said the similar narration of Ibn Mājah is authentic in Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan Ibn Mājah (no. 3244).<br />

[17] Shaykh ‘Abdul ‘Azīz Ibn Bāz noted in his checking of Fatḥ al-Majīd that Ibn Kathīr mentioned that Ibn ‘Abbās also said, “It is similar to the verse in which Allah says to his prophet ( ): صلّى الله عليه وسلّم&#8221;It is expected that your Lord will resurrect you to a praised station&#8221; (Sūrah al-Isrá,17:79) and this refers to his intercession.” Muhammad Ibn Isḥāq Ibn Yassār said, “‘( عَسَىasá) mentioned in the Quran is truth from Allah.”<br />

[21] Muḥammad Ibn Ṣaliḥ al-‘Uthaymīn explains in his booklet Muṣṭalaḥ al-Ḥadīth that a marfū’ narration is one in which is either explicitly attributed to the prophet ( ) صلّى الله عليه وسلّمor considered to be attributed to him based on other ruling factors.<br />
[22] Ibn al-‘Uthaymīn explains also in Muṣṭalaḥ al-Ḥadīth that a mawqūf narration is one that is attributed only to the narrating companion and not raised to the status of being attributed to the prophet ( .) صلّى الله عليه وسلّم<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Ibn Baz Fatwas &#8211; (Part No. 1; Page No. 206,207)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Copper bracelets [1]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[1]This is another answer to a question about copper bracelets made to cure rheumatism</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Abdul-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz to my honorable brother, may Allah safeguard you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have received your noble letter, may Allah be pleased with you. I have also reviewed the enclosed documents on the properties of the copper bracelet recently made to cure rheumatism. I have considered the whole matter more than once and discussed it with a number of university lecturers. We exchanged opinions on the juristic ruling on the copper bracelet in question, but there were different opinions on the matter; some regard it permissible as it has properties of curing rheumatism, whereas others see that it is better not to wear it, on the ground that wearing it is like the practice of the people of Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic time of ignorance), who used to wear copper amulets and bracelets, thinking that they were a cure for many diseases and a reason for the safety of the person wearing them against envy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Uqbah ibn `Amir (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Anyone who wears an amulet, Allah will not fulfill their need, and anyone who wears a seashell, Allah will not give them peace</span>. [1]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to another narration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Anyone who hangs an amulet has committed Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). </span>[2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imran ibn Al-Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) also narrated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) saw a man with a brass bracelet on his hand. He (peace be upon him) asked him, &#8216;What is this?&#8217; The man replied, &#8216;A protection from weakness.&#8217; He (peace be upon him) said, &#8216;Cast it off, for verily it will only increase your weakness; and if you die wearing it, you will never succeed.&#8217; </span>[3]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to another Hadith:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) in one of his journeys sent a messenger to check the camels of the caravan, and ordered the cutting of all string necklaces hung around the necks of the camels which were thought by the people of Jahiliyyah to benefit and protect their camels. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These Hadiths and others show that a Muslim must not wear amulets, bracelets, strings, bones, beads or other things that are used by some people to prevent or remove evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In my opinion, it is better not to wear or use this copper bracelet to block any means to Shirk, and to not let the heart be attached to such things, and to direct Muslims with their hearts toward Allah Alone trustingly and confidently, and to restrict oneself to lawful means that are indisputably permissible. Surely, what Allah has made lawful and accessible is sufficient and dispenses with any need for what is forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) is authentically reported to have said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Anyone who guards themselves against doubtful matters keeps their religion and honor blameless, and anyone who indulges in doubtful matters indulges in unlawful matters, just as a shepherd who pastures his animals around a sanctuary will soon (transgress upon it and) pasture them in it. </span>[4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (peace be upon him) also said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Leave what causes you doubt and turn to what does not cause you doubt. </span>[5]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Undoubtedly, wearing a copper bracelet is similar to what was practiced by the people of Jahiliyyah. Wearing it constitutes either a prohibited matter of Shirk or a means leading to Shirk or at least a doubtful matter.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is better for a Muslim not to wear it and resort to lawful medical treatment. This is the opinion that seems correct to a group of scholars, shaykhs, and myself as well with regard to this issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah (Exalted be He) to guide you and us to what pleases Him, grant us good understanding of His Religion, and protect us against all that opposes His Laws. Indeed, He is Able to do all things. May Allah safeguard you. As-salamu `alaykum.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah , says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Oh, you People of the Book! Commit not excesses in your religion, nor say of Allah anything but the truth. The Messiah, `Eisa, the son of Maryam is no more than a Messenger of Allah, and His Word, which He bestowed upon Maryam, and a Spirit proceeding from Him: So believe in Allah and His Messengers. Say not &#8220;Three&#8221;-desist: It will be better for you: For Allah is one God, glory be to Him [Far exalted is He] above having a son. To him belong all things in the heavens and on earth. And enough is Allah as a Disposer of affairs&#8221;</span> </strong>(Qur&#8217;an 4:171)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported on the authority of `Umar (ra) that the Messenger of Allah <img src="https://i0.wp.com/web.archive.org/web/20081202232709im_/http%3A//abdurrahman.org/tawheed/KTwahab/images/saws.gif" alt="(may Peace Be Upon Him)" width="14" height="13" border="0" /> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Do not extoll me as the Christians extolled the son of Maryam (as ); I am no more than a slave (of Allah) and so (instead), say: Allah&#8217;s Slave and His Messenger.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhari.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Ahmad, An-Nassa&#8217;I and Ibn Majah</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">–</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>هـل نـسـتـغـفـر النبي؟</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;">Translated &amp; Compiled By Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What has been said about the Ayaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ إِذْ ظَلَمُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ جَاءُوكَ فَاسْتَغْفَرُوا اللَّهَ وَاسْتَغْفَرَ لَهُمُ الرَّسُولُ لَوَجَدُوا اللَّهَ تَوَّابًا رَحِيمًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> If they (hypocrites), when they had been unjust to themselves, had come to you (Muhammad) and begged Allaah’s Forgiveness, and the Messenger had begged forgiveness for them: indeed, they would have found Allaah All-Forgiving (One Who accepts repentance), Most Merciful</strong></span>.&gt;&gt;   [Nisa: 64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>1 – Shaykh ul-Islaam Ahmad bin AbdulHaleem Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) -Rahimullaah- said:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘From the people there are those who interpret the saying of Allaah Ta’ala :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ إِذْ ظَلَمُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ جَاءُوكَ فَاسْتَغْفَرُوا اللَّهَ وَاسْتَغْفَرَ لَهُمُ الرَّسُولُ لَوَجَدُوا اللَّهَ تَوَّابًا رَحِيمًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If they (hypocrites), when they had been unjust to themselves, had come to you (Muhammad) and begged Allaah’s Forgiveness, and the Messenger had begged forgiveness for them: indeed, they would have found Allaah All-Forgiving (One Who accepts repentance), Most Merciful.</strong></span>&gt;&gt; [Nisa: 64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They say : ‘If we seek forgiveness from the Messenger after his death then we are of the status of those who sought forgiveness from amongst the Companions.’  However, with this statement they oppose the Ijmaa (consensus) of the Companions and those who succeeded them with goodness and the rest of the Muslims, since not a single one of them sought from the Prophet –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– after his death that he intercede for them. Nor did they ask him anything and not a single one of the Imams mentioned this in their books.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Majmoo al-Fatawa 1/190]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>2 – Shaykh Allaama Saddeeq Hasan Khan (d. 1307 A.H.) said about this Ayaah :</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This ‘visiting/coming to the Prophet’ is specific to his  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam–  life time, and this does not mean that ‘this visiting /coming to’ is to  the enlightened place where he is buried after his death  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.  What indicates to this is what is mentioned in this Ayaah, as is affirmed in the book: ‘Saarim al-Munky’. This is why none from the Salaf of the Ummahand their Imams, not from  the Companions, Successors, nor from those who followed them in goodness ever took this extreme possibility [of seeking forgiveness from the Prophet –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– after his death.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Fath al-Bayan fee Maqasid al-Qur’aan 2/315]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">3 – Shaykh Abdul Muhsin bin Hamd al-Abbad al-Badr said:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for the saying of Allaah Ta’ala :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ إِذْ ظَلَمُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ جَاءُوكَ فَاسْتَغْفَرُوا اللَّهَ وَاسْتَغْفَرَ لَهُمُ الرَّسُولُ لَوَجَدُوا اللَّهَ تَوَّابًا رَحِيمًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If they (hypocrites), when they had been unjust to themselves, had come to you (Muhammad) and begged Allaah’s Forgiveness, and the Messenger had begged forgiveness for them: indeed, they would have found Allaah All-Forgiving (One Who accepts repentance), Most Merciful</strong></span>.&gt;&gt;   [Nisa: 64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then this Ayaah is in regard to the Munafiqeen, this becomes clear from what preceded this Ayaah and what came after it. ‘Coming to’ the Prophet  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– is specific to, in his lifetime. What is established in ‘Saheeh al-Bukhari’ from the Hadeeth of ‘Aeysha –Radhi Allaahu anha–that when she said: ‘O my head is hurting!’ The Messenger of Allaah –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– said to her:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>ذَاكِ لَوْ كَانَ وَأَنَا حَىٌّ، فَأَسْتَغْفِرُ لَكِ، وَأَدْعُو لَكِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘If you die and I am alive then I will seek forgiveness for you and I will pray for you. . . ‘</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the Prophet –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– was to seek forgiveness for anyone after his death then there would not have been a difference between him dying before her or her dying before him. Some of the people of Bida’ claim that which is much more than that, which is that the Prophet  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– brought his hand out of the grave and shook hands with one of the followers of the people of Bida’. What clearly invalidates this, is that the likes of this never occurred for the Companions –Radhi Allaahu anhum– and they are the best of this Ummah.  The Prophet  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>أَنَا سَيِّدُ وَلَدِ آدَمَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ وَأَوَّلُ مَنْ يَنْشَقُّ عَنْهُ الْقَبْرُ وَأَوَّلُ شَافِعٍ وَأَوَّلُ مُشَفَّعٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">‘I am the leader of the son of Adam on the Day of Judgement and I am the first for whom the grave will be opened and I am the first to intercede and the first to be interceded.’</span></strong> [Muslim] And this opening of the grave will be when the resurrection takes place. Allaah Ta’ala said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>ثُمَّ إِنَّكُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ تُبْعَثُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Then (again), surely, you will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection.</span></strong> &gt;&gt;[al-Muminun : 16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Butlaan Qisatay by AbdurRahmaan al-Umaysaan p.179-180]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaykh Abdul Muhsin bin Hamd al-Abbad al-Badr also said:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for the saying of Allaah -Tabarak wa Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ إِذْ ظَلَمُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ جَاءُوكَ فَاسْتَغْفَرُوا اللَّهَ وَاسْتَغْفَرَ لَهُمُ الرَّسُولُ لَوَجَدُوا اللَّهَ تَوَّابًا رَحِيمًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#000000;">If they (hypocrites), when they had been unjust to themselves, had come to you (Muhammad) and begged Allaah’s Forgiveness, and the Messenger had begged forgiveness for them: indeed, they would have found Allaah All-Forgiving (One Who accepts repentance), Most Merciful.</span></strong>&gt;&gt;   [Nisa: 64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the intent is not approaching his grave  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– after his death, but rather the intent is come to him during his lifetime  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– just as the Companions–Radhi Allaahu anhum– understood it.  I clarified this is in a booklet called ‘The Importance of Tawheed al-Eebaadah’ (p.69) where I said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The inmates of graves are visited and Dua is sought for them and they are not supplicated to. Allaah is requested for them and nothing is requested from them, not Dua’ nor cure nor to achieve benefit nor to repel harm. Since this is indeed requested from Allaah, Allaah -Subhanahu wa Ta’ala- is the One Who is supplicated to and to have hope in. Dua is made for anyone other than Allaah and is not supplicated to, the proof for this is that the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– used to request from him to make Dua during his lifetime and he would make Dua for them. After his death  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam–  during his life of the Barzakeeyah they would not go to his grave  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam–  and requested Dua from him. This is why  when the drought occurred at the time of Umar –Radhi Allaahu anha– he requested Dua for rain from al-Abbas–Radhi Allaahu anha– and Umar requested him to make Dua’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Bukhari collected in his book from Anas that Umar bin al-Khattab used to request Dua for rain from al-Abbas bin AbdulMuttalib, if there was a drought and he would say: ‘O Allaah indeed we used to come closer to You (make Tawassul) with Your Prophet –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– and You [Allaah] would give us rain, and indeed we come closer to You with his uncle, so give us rain,’ then the rain would come down.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if the request for Dua from the Prophet  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– after his death was permissible Umar –Radhi Allaahu anha– would not have turned away from it and requested Al-Abbas to make Dua’ for rain.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Neither Wealthy, Nor Knowledge of the Unseen, Nor an Angel<br />
By Shaykh ul-Islaam Ahmad bin AbdulHaleem Ibn Taymeeyah -Rahimullaah-</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">قُلْ لَا أَقُولُ لَكُمْ عِنْدِي خَزَائِنُ اللَّهِ وَلَا أَعْلَمُ الْغَيْبَ وَلَا أَقُولُ لَكُمْ إِنِّي مَلَكٌ إِنْ أَتَّبِعُ إِلَّا مَا يُوحَى إِلَيَّ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#000000;">Say (O Muhammad): “I don’t tell you that with me are the treasures of Allah, nor (that) I know the unseen; nor I tell you that I am an angel. I but follow what is revealed to me by inspiration.”</span></strong>&gt;&gt; [Soorah Ana’am : 50]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ahmad bin AbdulHaleem Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) -Rahimullaah- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed the Messenger –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– was ordered to free himself from claiming these three things with Allaah’s statement &lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Say : ‘I don’t tell you that with me are the treasures of Allaah, nor (that) I know the unseen; nor I tell you that I am an angel. I but follow what is revealed to me by inspiration.’</span></strong> &gt;&gt; This is also what Nuh -alayhi as-Salam- said and he was the first of the main Messengers, the first Messenger&nbsp;[1] whom Allaah Ta’ala sent to the people of the earth. Here, too now, is the seal of the Messengers and the seal of the main Messengers and they have both freed themselves from this claim. This is because people sometimes seek knowledge of the unseen from the Messenger–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, as in the saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَى هَذَا الْوَعْدُ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#000000;">They say: “When will this promise (i.e. the Day of Resurrection) come to pass? if you are telling the truth.”</span> </strong>&gt;&gt; [Mulk:25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ السَّاعَةِ أَيَّانَ مُرْسَاهَا قُلْ إِنَّمَا عِلْمُهَا عِنْدَ رَبِّي</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>They ask you about the Hour (Day of Resurrection): “When will be its appointed time?” Say: “The knowledge thereof is with my Lord (Alone)</strong></span>. &gt;&gt; [al-Aa’raaf: 187]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also they sometimes seek this knowledge to be persuaded of the truth, as in the saying of Allaah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَقَالُوا لَنْ نُؤْمِنَ لَكَ حَتَّى تَفْجُرَ لَنَا مِنَ الْأَرْضِ يَنْبُوعًا () أَوْ تَكُونَ لَكَ جَنَّةٌ مِنْ نَخِيلٍ وَعِنَبٍ فَتُفَجِّرَ الْأَنْهَارَ خِلَالَهَا تَفْجِيرًا () أَوْ تُسْقِطَ السَّمَاءَ كَمَا زَعَمْتَ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفًا أَوْ تَأْتِيَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْمَلَائِكَةِ قَبِيلًا () أَوْ يَكُونَ لَكَ بَيْتٌ مِنْ زُخْرُفٍ أَوْ تَرْقَى فِي السَّمَاءِ وَلَنْ نُؤْمِنَ لِرُقِيِّكَ حَتَّى تُنَزِّلَ عَلَيْنَا كِتَابًا نَقْرَؤُهُ قُلْ سُبْحَانَ رَبِّي هَلْ كُنْتُ إِلَّا بَشَرًا رَسُولًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#000000;">And they say: “We shall not believe in you, until you cause a spring to gush forth from the earth for us; “Or you have a garden of date-palms and grapes, and cause rivers to gush forth in their midst abundantly; “Or you cause the heaven to fall upon us in pieces, as you have pretended, or you bring Allaah and the angels before (us) face to face; “Or you have a house of adornable materials (like silver and pure gold, etc.), or you ascend up into the sky, and even then we will put no faith in your ascension until you bring down for us a Book that we would read.” Say : “Glorified (and Exalted) be my Lord (Allaah) above all that evil they (polytheists) associate with Him! Am I anything but a man, sent as a Messenger?”</span></strong>&gt;&gt; [al-Israa: 90-93]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sometimes, they would regard the human need a Messenger had as shameful, as in the saying of Allaah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَقَالُوا مَالِ هَذَا الرَّسُولِ يَأْكُلُ الطَّعَامَ وَيَمْشِي فِي الْأَسْوَاقِ لَوْلَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْهِ مَلَكٌ فَيَكُونَ مَعَهُ نَذِيرًا () أَوْ يُلْقَى إِلَيْهِ كَنْزٌ أَوْ تَكُونُ لَهُ جَنَّةٌ يَأْكُلُ مِنْهَا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And they say: “Why does this Messenger eat food, and walk about in the markets (like ourselves). Why is not an angel sent down to him to be a warner with him? “Or (why) has not a treasure been granted to him, or why has he not a garden whereof he may eat?”</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [Furqan : 7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, Allaah ordered the Messenger to inform them that he neither knew the unseen, nor did he possess the treasures of Allaah, nor was he an Angel who was not in need of eating or wealth. Rather, he was a follower of what was revealed to him, following that which was revealed to him is the Deen, which is obedience to Allaah and he was commanded to worship Him with knowledge and actions, both inward and outward. A person attains from those three things, according to the amount Allaah Ta’ala gives him. He learns from him what He has taught him and has ability according to what Allaah gives him the capability to do, and he suffices himself with that which Allaah enriched him with in matters which would otherwise oppose general practices or the practice of the majority of the people.’</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Translator: Mikail ibn Mahboob Ariff حفظه الله</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Esteemed Shaikh, what is the guiding principle with regard to the difference between texts concerning greater and lesser shirk?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This [is a] question a lot of people ask about, saying: what is the difference between lesser shirk and greater shirk?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Greater shirk is that which, when it takes place from a person, he leaves the religion [of Islam, becoming a disbeliever]; lesser is that which is less than that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So directing worship to other than Allāh is greater shirk, and revering [any of] creation as Allāh is due reverence, such that one [of creation] is given a right of divine lordship or revered as the Creator is revered, is greater shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whatever is less than that is lesser shirk, for example: the issue of swearing by other than Allāh is lesser shirk as an initial assumption. However, if there were in the heart of the one swearing, that the one he swore by was like Allāh, it becomes greater shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the guiding principle is that whatever the Shāri‘ [the One who lays down Islāmic law] calls shirk [that] does not [at the same time] take [one] out of the religion, is lesser shirk, [while] that which takes [one] out of the religion is greater shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And another question [still] remains for us: what is it that takes [one] out of the religion? And what is it that does not take [one] out?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This depends on the given text, so whoever gives one of creation a right that is only for the Creator, then this is greater shirk, and whatever is less than that is lesser shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I will give you an example: If a person respects his father greatly–every time he comes, he kisses his hand or kisses his forehead; sets his sandals down before him [to wear] and brings the car close to him [to save him having to walk]–this is showing great respect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he were to come to another person and did the same for him as he had done for his father, then this [person] has put other than his father [on] the same [level] as his father.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, had he only presented [this person other than his father] sandals [for him to wear], would he then be treating this other one as one equal to his father? Of course not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://tasfiyah.com/ibn-uthaimin-the-difference-between-lesser-and-greater-shirk-2/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://tasfiyah.com/ibn-uthaimin-the-difference-between-lesser-and-greater-shirk-2/</a></p>

<p>Posted from: <strong><a title="Beneficial Sayings from Kitaab ut-Tawheed – Dr. Saleh as Saleh [Audio|En]" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2014/09/22/beneficial-sayings-from-kitaab-ut-tawheed-dr-saleh-as-saleh/">The Beneficial Saying on The Book of Tawheed</a><br />
</strong>Book by Shaykh Muhammaad bin AbdulWahhaab at-Tamimi rahimahullaah,<br />
Explanation is based upon that of <strong>Shaykh Ibn Al-‘Uthaymeen</strong> rahimahullaah</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p><em>The below is posted from the book by dar-us-salam</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">CHAPTER No: 7</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>To wear a Ring, Twine, or anything similar to them for prevention or lifting of Harm or Affliction, is an act of Shirk</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Almighty said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Say: Tell me then, the things that you invoke besides Allah, -if Allah intended some harm for me, could they remove His harm, or if He (Allah) intended some mercy for me, could they withhold His Mercy? Say: Sufficient for me is Allah; in Him those who trust (i.e. believers) must put their trust.&#8221;</strong> </span>(39:38)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imran bin Husain (May Allah be pleased with him) narrated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Prophet (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) once saw a man with a brass ring on his hand and asked him, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; The man replied, &#8220;To overcome the weakness of old age.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Remove it, for, it can only add to your weakness. Should death overtake you while you are wearing it, you would never succeed.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[This Hadith was recorded by Ahmad (bin Hanbal) (May Allah be pleased with him) with a good chain of narrators.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also recorded a Marfu’ Hadith; Uqbah bin Aamir (May Allah be pleased with him) narrated that Prophet Muhammad (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Whoever wears talisman or an amulet would never see his wish fulfilled by Allah. And whoever hangs a sea shell would never get peace and rest.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In an another version the Prophet (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) is reported to have said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Whoever wears a talisman has committed Shirk (polytheism).&#8221; </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abi Hatim reported about Hudhaifah (May Allah be pleased with him):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> He saw a man with a piece of twine on his hand (as a protection or cure from fever) so he cut the twine and read the verse: &#8220;Most of them believe in Allah and still practise Shirk (polytheism).&#8221;</strong></span> (12: 106)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Chapter 11: <strong>Shaving the Head<br />
<a title="Lessons of Creed Acquired From The Hajj – By ‘AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-Badr" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2012/10/06/lessons-of-creed-acquired-from-the-hajj-by-abdurrazzaq-bin-abdul-muhsin-al-badr/">Lessons of Creed Acquired From The Hajj<br />
</a>By  Shaykh AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The actions of the day of an-Nahr, the tenth day of the month of Dhul-Hijjah, are indeed four well-known actions which are the stoning, the slaughter, shaving the head and then the Tawaaf. The discussion here will be about shaving the head or shortening the hair as worship for Allaah in obedience to Him and seeking closeness to Him on this great day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaving is completely removing the hair of the head while shortening is lessening the hair of the head all over. Shaving or shortening the hair is one of the obligations of Hajj and Umrah, it is not permissible to leave it, and the evidence is the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Certainly, you shall enter masjid al-Haram; if Allaah wills, secure, (some) having your heads shaved, and (some) having your head hair cut short, having no fear</strong></span>&gt;&gt; [Fath : 27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qadaamah –Rahimullaah- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘If it was not from the rites of Hajj, Allaah would not have described them this way.’</strong> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Bukhari and Muslim from the hadeeth of Ibn Abbas –RadhiAllaahu anhu- who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘When the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- came to Makkah he ordered his Companions to make Tawaaf of the House and of Safa and Marwa, then to come out of Ihraam and shave or shorten their hair.’</strong> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, it is one of the obligations of Hajj and Umrah. So whoever does not shave or shorten their hair, then it is necessary to atone for this by slaughtering a sacrificial animal. It (i.e. shaving/shortening) is a sign that the time period for Ihraam has ended and it imitates the actions of the Messenger &#8211; alayhi as-sallat wa sallam- where he shaved his head and ordered his Companions to shave their heads, casting aside their impurities and removing dishevelled hair. Shaving the head is the act of humbly placing the forehead in front of its Lord, due to His greatness, and in submission due to His Honour and it is from the most intense forms of Uboodiyah (worship) for Allaah Azza Wa Jal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when the Muslims performs this great act of obedience and important worship in reverence of Allaah and in imitation of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- it is obligatory upon him to <strong>know that shaving the head or shortening the hair is done to worship and seek closeness to Allaah and that it is not permissible to perform it for anyone other than Allaah –subhanahu wa Ta’ala</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great Imaam, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaykh-ul-Islaam ibn Taymeeyah -Rahimullaah–</strong></span> was asked about a people who shave their heads at the command of their shaykhs at such graves as they glorify while regarding it as a means seeking closeness to Allaah and worship: is all of this a Sunnah or a Bida? Is shaving the head, generally, a Sunnah or Bida?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He –Rahimullaah- replied: <strong>‘Shaving the head is of four types</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>One of them is shaving the head in Hajj and Umrah</strong></span> and this is from what Allaah and His Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- have ordered. It is legislated and ordered in the Book, the Sunnah and the consensus of the Ummah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#008000;">Certainly, you shall enter masjid al-Haram; if Allaah wills, secure, (some) having your heads shaved, and (some) having your head hair cut short, having no fear</span></strong>&gt;&gt; [Fath : 27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are multiple narrations on the authority of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallamthat he shaved his head in his Hajj and Umrah as did his Companions. From them were those who shaved their heads and some who shortened their hair. Shaving is better than shortening because <strong style="line-height:1.5;">the Prophet said: ‘O Allaah forgive those who shave their heads.’ The people said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and those who shorten their hair?’ He said ‘O Allaah forgive those who shave their heads.’ The people said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and those who shorten their hair?’ He said ‘O Allaah forgive those who shave their heads.’ The people said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and those who shorten their hair?’ He said: ‘And those who shorten their hair.’</strong><span style="line-height:1.5;"> [3]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the farewell Hajj he -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- commanded the Companions who had brought a sacrificial animal with them to shorten their hair if they had performed Tawaaf of the House and had walked between Safa and Marwa for Umrah and then to shave their heads once they had completed the Hajj. So (in this way) he combined for them, firstly, shortening their hair and, secondly, shaving their heads.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The second type of shaving the head</strong> </span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">is for a need</span>, such as shaving the head for treatment</strong>. This is also permissible according to the Book, the Sunnah and the consensus of the scholars. Indeed Allaah has permitted the Muhrim (pilgrim), for whom it is not usually allowed to have his head shaved until completion of the Hajj rites, to shave his head if he is suffering as Allaah Ta’ala mentions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>and do not shave your heads until the Hady (sacrificial animal) reaches the place of sacrifice. And whosoever of you is ill or has an ailment in his scalp (necessitating shaving), he must pay a Fidyah (ransom) of either observing Saum (fasts) (three days) or giving Sadaqah (charity &#8211; feeding six poor persons) or offering sacrifice (one sheep)</strong> </span>&gt;&gt; [Baqarah :196]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What has been established by agreement of the Muslims is the hadeeth of Ka’b bin Ujraah that when the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- passed by him in the Umrah of Al-Hudaybiyah lice were falling from his head, so the Prophet said to him: ‘Are your lice harming you?’ K’ab replied: ‘Yes.’ So the Prophet said: ‘Shave your head and sacrifice a sheep, or fast three days or feed a group of six needy people.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The authenticity of this Hadeeth is agreed upon and has been received with acceptance by all the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The third type of shaving the head is that which is done for worship, religion and Zuhd (abstention from loving worldly things) in other than Hajj or Umrah</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, some of the people command the one who repents, once he has repented to shave his head. Similar is the one who shaves the head as a sign of being from the people of rituals and religion or as a sign of the perfection of Zuhd and worship or as a sign that the one who shaves is better, more religious or has more Zuhd than the one who does not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there are those who adhere to certain shaykhs such that if they repent, they shave their heads or they cut some of his hair. So the shaykh specifies who should have the scissors and prayer rug so he can pray on that rug (and not with the Muslims). His cutting hair from the heads of the people is from the complete authority befitting him and someone who is imitated in order to make the people repent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So all of this is Bida’ which has neither been commanded by Allaah, nor by His Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</strong>. It is not obligatory nor has it been recommended by any one scholar of the Deen. Not one of the Companions did this, nor did any of those who followed the companions in goodness, neither the scholars of the Muslims who were well known for Zuhd and worship nor the Companions, the successors or those who came after them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There were those who accepted Islam at the time of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- but he never used to order them to shave their heads if they entered Islaam nor did he cut anyone’s hair. He didn’t pray on a rug but, rather, he used to pray as an Imaam with all the Muslims. He used to pray on what they used to pray, sit where they used to sit and he never used to make himself distinct from them by sitting on something special, whether a prayer rug or anything else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever takes this Bida’ -which is not obligatory or even recommended- as a means of seeking closeness and obedience or as a path to Allaah making it a completion of the Deen or orders the repentant to do it, both the Zahid (the one who abstains from loving worldly things) and the worshipper, then he is a misguided person outside the path of ar-Rahmaan (Allaah the Most Merciful), following the footsteps of the Shayateen.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Shaykh ul-Islaam –Rahimullaah- mentioned <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>the fourth type of shaving the head</strong></span> which is shaving the head as other than a ritual or for other than a need, neither seeking closeness to Allaah nor seeking to be religious. He mentions that the people of knowledge have two opinions regarding this, which are two narrations attributed to Imaam Ahmad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first is that it is disliked and this is the Madhab of Maalik and others. The second is that it is permissible and this is well known amongst the companions of Abu Haneefa and ash-Shafi&#8217;ee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Imaam Ahmad mentions the evidence that the scholars use for each of these sayings. [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim</strong> mentions a similar division to what has preceded in his book &#8216;Zaad al-Ma&#8217;ad&#8217;. He mentions that from the different types of shaving the head there is one that is Shirk and one that is Bida’. <strong>Shirk being the one shaving his head for other than Allaah –Subhaanhu- such as those who follow shaykhs and who shave their heads for their shaykhs</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of them will say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;I have shaved my head for so-and-so and you have shaved your head for soand-so.’ This is the same as saying: ‘I have done Sadjah (prostration) for so- and-so,’ because shaving the head is done with humility, in worship and with submissiveness and it is done for the completion of Hajj.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he mentions that the misguided shaykhs deceive their followers by causing them to shave their heads for them, just as they mislead them into prostrating to them. [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this is clear Shirk and a great lie, we ask Allaah for security.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 10</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Obligation of Having Sincerity When Slaughtering the Sacrificial Animal</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed from the great days of Allaah is the day of an-Nahr, the tenth day from the month of Dhul-Hijjah, the day of the blessed ‘Eid al-Adha. This day has been called the day of an-Nahr because the Muslims seek closeness to Allaah on that Day by slaughtering grazing livestock (sheep, camels, cattle, goats). Pilgrims on this day slaughter their sacrificial animals and the Muslims in every scattered part of the earth slaughter their sacrificial animals too, seeking closeness to Allaah by doing so, Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<em><span style="color:#008000;">And for every nation We have appointed religious ceremonies, that they may mention the Name of Allaah over the beast of cattle that He has given them for food. And your (God) is One (God &#8211; Allaah), so you must submit to Him Alone (in Islaam). And give glad tidings to the Mukhbitin [those who obey Allaah with humility and are humble from among the true believers of Islaamic Monotheism],</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Whose hearts are filled with fear when Allaah is mentioned; who patiently bear whatever may befall them (of calamities); and who perform the prayer and who spend (in Allaah&#8217;s Cause) out of what We have provided them.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And the Budn (cows, oxen, or camels driven to be offered as sacrifices by the pilgrims at the sanctuary of Makkah.) We have made for you as among the Symbols of Allaah, therein you have much good. So mention the Name of Allaah over them when they are drawn up in lines (for sacrifice). Then, when they are down on their sides (after slaughter), eat thereof, and feed the beggar who does not ask (men), and the beggar who asks (men). Thus have We made them subject to you that you may be grateful.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allaah, but it is piety from you that reaches Him. Thus have We made them subject to you that you may magnify Allaah for His Guidance to you. And give glad tidings to the Muhsinûn (doers of good).</span></em> &gt;&gt; [Hajj: 34-37]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of which is: The intent is not just slaughtering but, indeed what has been legislated for you is slaughtering this sacrifice so that you remember Allaah at the slaughter, as He indeed is The Creator and The Provider, it is not that He will take anything from its meat or its blood, for Allaah Ta’ala is in no need of other than Himself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&lt;&lt; but it is piety from you that reaches Him&gt;&gt;</span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of which is: to have sincerity, hope of gaining reward, a good intention and a desire for the Face of Allaah by performing good actions. In 1this is a great encouragement and motivation to have sincerity in slaughtering and that the intent should be the Face of Allaah alone, because Allaah Ta’ala does not accept actions except those that are sincere, with which one only desires the Face of Allaah –Subhanahu- as Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&lt;&lt;Say: &#8220;Verily, my prayer, my sacrifice, my living and my dying are for Allaah, The Lord of all that exists. He has no partner.  And of this I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims.&#8221;&gt;&gt;</span></em> [Anaam: 162-163]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer –Rahimullaah- said in explanation of this Ayaah: ‘Allaah Ta’ala commands the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- to inform the Mushrikeen who worship other than Allaah and slaughter in other than His name, that he is in opposition to them in this. Indeed his prayer is for Allaah and his sacrifices are in the name of Allaah alone, Who has no partner. This is like the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&lt;&lt;Verily, my prayer, my sacrifice&gt;&gt;</strong> [Anaam: 162]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">i.e. that your prayer and your slaughtering should be sincerely for Allaah. Indeed the Mushrikeen used to worship idols and slaughter for them, so Allaah Ta’ala ordered the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- to oppose them, to turn away from what they were upon and to face Allaah with purpose, intention and determination, doing so sincerely for Allaah Ta’ala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujahid said regarding Allaah’s saying <strong>&lt;&lt;my prayer, my sacrifice&gt;&gt;</strong> i.e. ritual: slaughtering in the Hajj and Umrah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ath-Thawri said on the authority of Sa’eed bin Jubair who said regarding the word:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&lt;&lt;my sacrifice&gt;&gt;</strong> : my slaughtering.</p>
<p>As-Saadi and Dhihaak also said the same thing.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Slaughtering is a great act from the different types of worship with which the Muslims seek nearness to their Lord –Azza wa Jal – fulfilling rites for the sake of Allaah Ta’ala from slaughtering the sacrificial animal to vows to other such things. So it is not permissible to direct these acts of worship to other than Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been established in the authentic book of hadeeth by Muslim from the hadeeth of the Ameer ul-Mumineen ‘Alee bin Abu Taalib –radhiAllaahu anhuwho said: the Messenger of Allaah-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- informed me of four statements:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> ‘Allaah’s curse is upon the one who slaughters for other than Allaah, Allaah’s curse is upon the one who curses his parents, Allaah’s curse is upon the one who gives shelter to an innovator and Allaah’s curse is upon the one who changes signposts which mark directions on the earth.’ [2]</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accursedness meaning exiled and being distant from the Mercy of Allaah. The most dangerous of these four matters, such that the one who does it is deserving of this punishment, is slaughtering for other than Allaah. This is why the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- mentioned it first, which shows the great danger of this matter, as slaughtering for other than Allaah is Shirk, whereas the other points mentioned are from the major sins but they do not reach the level of Shirk. Any type of slaughtering done for other than Allaah is Shirk even if what is slaughtered -seeking closeness to Allaah- is insignificant or small such as a fly or something similar to that. So how about the one seeking closeness while he sacrifices the best and the finest of animals?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been narrated by Imaam Ahmad in his book ‘az-Zuhd’, by Abu Na’eem in his book ‘al-Hileeya’ and in other places on the authority of Salman alFarsi –RadhiAllaahu anhu- with an authentic chain stopping at him, that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">‘A man entered Paradise due to a fly and another man entered the Fire due to a fly. They asked, ‘How is that?’ He replied: Two men from before your time passed by some people who had an idol and none could pass by them except that he had to sacrifice to their idol.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">They said to one of the two men: Sacrifice something.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">He said: I don’t have anything.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">They said: Sacrifice something, even if it is a fly.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">So he sacrificed a fly and passed by, then entered the Hell-fire.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">They said to the other man: Sacrifice something.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">He said: I never sacrifice anything for other than Allaah –Azza wa Jal. So they chopped his head off and he entered Paradise.’[3]</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This shows the wickedness of Shirk and the severity of its danger that, even if it is with something small, it obligates entry into Hell-fire. So, when the first man sacrificed a despicable and the vilest of animals, a fly, for the idol his reward was the Fire due to him committing Shirk in the worship of Allaah. If this is the case of the one who sacrificed by slaughtering a fly, then what is the state of the one who fattens a camel or a sacrificial animal then slaughters it for the one he worships other than Allaah such as graves, tombs, stones, trees or anything else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ash-Shawakaani –Rahimullaah- said in his book ‘Sharh as-Sadoor’: ‘This is from the causes of extreme evil, by which the evil companion is thrown behind the wall of Islaam from the highest point of the Deen and lands on his skull. So much so that many of them come with the best of the livestock they possess and the most excellent of what they have of sheep and cattle, then they slaughter them at the graves seeking closeness to them and hoping that this (closeness) can be attained from the graves. So they sacrifice for other than Allaah and, as a result, they worship one from amongst the idols, because there is no difference between slaughtering for the erected stones they call idols and slaughtering for and at the grave of the deceased calling it a grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A simple difference in description does not affect something’s being Halaal or being Haram. The one who calls alcohol by other than its true name and drinks it has the same ruling as the one who calls alcohol by its name and drinks it, there is no difference of opinion amongst any of the Muslims in this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that slaughtering is one type from the different types of worship for Allaah, similar to slaughtering the sacrificial animal and atonement. So the one who seeks closeness to the inhabitant of the grave and slaughters for it does not have any other intent in so-doing except to glorify and honour the grave, to seek to attain goodness from it and to fend off evil due to it. This is, no doubt, worship and it suffices as evil just to hear of it. There is no power or might except with Allaah, The Most High, The Most Great, to Allaah we belong and to Him is our return. The Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: ‘In Islaam there is no slaughtering animals near graves.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdur-Razzaq Sanaani said: ‘They used to slaughter at the grave, i.e. cows and sheep’ as narrated by Abu Daawood with an authentic chain of narration on the authority of Anas ibn Maalik.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Imaam ash-Shawakaani –Rahimullaah- was very eloquent in his advice and very good in warning against this dangerous issue. We ask Allaah, The Most Noble that He saves us all from falling into any of this and that He makes all our actions sincerely for His Noble Face, in accordance with the Sunnah of His Prophet Muhammad -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam. Indeed Allaah is The Most Generous and The Most Noble.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim (بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 59:</strong> <span style="color:#993300;">What is the affirmed and nullified intercession?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Ash-Shafaa’ah</em> is derived from <em>ash-Shaf’a</em> and it is the opposite of <em>witr</em> (one), and it is to make a single thing one of a pair or couple, for example to make the one two, the three four and so forth. This is as far as its linguistic derivation is concerned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Traditionally, however, it means the laying of a petition (interceding, mediating) with someone in favor of another, in procuring a benefit or warding off a harm, i.e. the intercessor lays down a mediation between the one on whose behalf an intercession is sought (al-mashfoo’ilahu) and the one pleaded with (al-mashfoo’ ilayh), in order to procure a benefit for al-mashoo’ilahu or repel from him something harmful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Intercession is<strong> two types</strong>, confirmed and correct intercession, and a false one that is of no benefit to its people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As to the confirmed and correct intercession, then it is the one which Allaah, The Most High, has confirmed in His Book, and which His Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) has confirmed. And it is approved only for the people of Tawheed and those of pure intentions. Since Aboo Hurayrah (رضي الله عنه) said: “<em><span style="color:#008000;">O Messenger of Allaah! Who will be the luckiest person, who will gain your intercession on the Day of Resurrection?</span></em>” He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: “<em><span style="color:#008000;">The one who says la ilaaha illallaah (none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah) purely from his heart</span></em>.” [83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this type of intercession has <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>three conditions</strong></span> to it:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First condition:</strong> Allaah being pleased with the intercessor.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second condition:</strong> Allaah being pleased with the one on whose behalf intercession is being sought, and the</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third condition:</strong> Allaah’s permission for the intercessor to intercede.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These conditions are collectively stated in the Saying of Allaah, The Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And there are many angels in the heavens, whose intercession will avail nothing except after Allaah has given leave for whom He Wills and is Pleased with.&#8221;</span></em> [Qur’aan, soorat an-Najm (53): 26].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they are mentioned in details in the following Sayings of Allaah, The Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Who is he that will intercede with Him except by His Permission?&#8221;</span></em> [Qur’aan, soorat al-Baqarah (2): 255)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;On that day no intercession shall avail, except the one for whom Ar-Rahmaan has given permission and whose word is acceptable to Him.&#8221;</em></span> [Qur’aan, soorat Taha (20): 109].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And they cannot intercede except for him with whom He is Pleased.&#8221;</span> </em>[Qur’aan, soorat al-Anbiyaa’ (21): 28].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is inevitable that these three conditions be met in order for intercession to take place. And based upon this, then we come to know the <strong><span style="color:#000000;">second type of intercession</span></strong>. And this is the <strong><span style="color:#000000;">annulled intercession</span></strong>, which avails not its people, and which the Mushriks (polytheists) claim to be the intercession of their gods for them, with Allaah (عز و جل). Indeed, this intercession avails them not, as Allaah, The Most High, Says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And so no intercession of intercessors will be of any use to them.&#8221;</span> </em>[Qur’aan, soorat al-Muddath-thir (74): 48].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is since Allaah, The Most High, accepts not the Shirk of those Mushriks, and that He would not give Permission for them to intercede. Since there is no intercession except for those whom Allaah is Pleased with, and Allaah accepts not Kufr for His servants and He Loves not mischief. So, the Mushrik’s attachment of importance on the gods that they worship whilst they say, “these are our intercessors with Allaah”, is false and has no benefit. Rather this will only keep them farther away from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the confirmed shafaa’ah, as the scholars, may Allaah’s Mercy be upon them, mentioned, is divided into two kinds: <strong>General</strong> and <strong>Special</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of <strong>General</strong> is that Allaah (عز و جل) Permits whom He Wishes from His righteous servants to intercede on behalf of those whom Allaah has given the Permission for intercession.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <strong>Special</strong> [means] the intercession particular to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), and the greatest of which is <strong>ash-Shafaa’atul-‘Uthmaa (the greatest intercession)</strong> and which takes place on the Day of Resurrection when the people will suffer such distress and trouble as they will not be able to tolerate. So they will look for someone who will intercede for them with Allaah (عز و جل) to relieve them from this greatly distressing and long-standing situation. So they go to Aadam, then to Noah, Ibraaheem, Moosaa, and then to ‘Eessa. None of them intercede, until the matter reaches Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم). So he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) stands up and intercedes with Allaah (عز و جل) to save His slaves from this immense situation. So Allaah responds to his supplication and accepts his intercession. And this is part of <strong>al-Maqaam al- Mahmood</strong> (the highest station of praise and glory) which Allaah, The Most High, has Promissed to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And in some parts of the night offer the salaat with it (i.e. recite the Qur’aan in the prayer), as an additional prayer (tahajjud) for you (O Muhammad). It may be that your Rabb will raise you to al-Maqaam al-Mahmood.&#8221;</span></em> [Qur’aan, soorat al- Israa’ (17): 79].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the intercession that is particular to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is his <strong>intercession for ahlul-Jannah</strong> (the people of Paradise) to enter al-Jannah. Because after they cross the siraat (the bridge over Hell) the people of al-Jannah will be stopped at a bridge between Paradise and Hell, and here their hearts will be rendered free from the wrongs they have committed against each other until they are cleaned and purified. Then after that they will be granted permission to enter into al-Jannah. However, they will not be admitted therein until after the Prophet’s (صلى الله عليه و سلم) intercession with Allaah for them to enter Paradise. Therefore the gates of al-Jannah will open by virtue of the Prophet’s (صلى الله عليه و سلم) intercession.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regard the <strong>general intercession by the Prophet</strong> (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and by others besides him from the righteous slaves of Allaah, then it is to intercede for the People of the Fire from the sinful believers who do not deserve the endless dwelling therein. He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) intercedes on their behalf for them to get out of the Fire. And this type of intercession is confirmed for him (صلى الله عليه و سلم) as well as for others from the Prophets, the martyrs, and the righteous, and Allaah knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim (بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The Incorrect and Futile Tawassul and its Types</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 58:</strong> Having known the Correct <em>Tawassul</em> and its Types, then it is inevitable for us to know the Incorrect <strong>Tawassul</strong> and its Types.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong> The incorrect and futile Tawassul is to use an unprescribed way, something which is not affirmed as a legal way by Sharee’ah, as a means of nearness to Allaah, The Most High. Since Tawassul in this manner is from nonsense and falsehood that contradicts the intellectual and textual proofs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from this is that a person uses the<span style="color:#000000;"> <strong>supplication of a deceased man as Tawassul to Allaah</strong></span> (عز و جل). He asks this deceased person to supplicate to Allaah for him. Then this is not a correct and prescribed means. Rather it is foolishness on the part of the one who asks this deceased man to supplicate to Allaah for him. Since once he dies, the actions of the deceased cease to exist, and it is impossible for him to supplicate to Allaah for anyone. Even the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), it is not possible that he supplicates to Allaah for anyone after his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) death. For this reason, the companions (Radi Allahu Anhum) did not use as Tawassul to Allaah by asking the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to invoke Allaah for them after his death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In fact, when the people suffered a drought at the time of ‘Umar Ibn al-Khattaab (رضي الله عنه), he said: “<em><span style="color:#008000;">O Allaah we used to ask Your Prophet to supplicate on our behalf to You and You would bless us with rain, and now we ask the uncle of our Prophet [i.e. al-‘Abbaas (رضي الله عنه)] to supplicate to You on our behalf, so bless us with rain</span></em>.” So al-‘Abbaas (رضي الله عنه) stood up and supplicated to Allaah (عز و جل). Had the matter of asking the deceased’s supplication to Allah been a permissible and correct way, then ‘Umar and those with him from the companions would have asked that from Allaah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم). Since the response to his supplication is more likely to take place than that of ‘al-‘Abbaas ibn ‘Abdul-Muttalib (رضي الله عنه). What is important, therefore, is that Tawassul to Allaah by means of asking supplication from the deceased is false and impermissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the incorrect type of Tawassul is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>to seek nearness to Allaah by means of the status of the Prophet</strong></span> (صلى الله عليه و سلم), saying: “<em><span style="color:#008000;">O Allaah, I ask you by the rank of Your Prophet [to grant me] such and such.</span></em>” This is since the status of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is not something of benefit to you. It is only beneficial to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), but as regard to you then it is of no benefit to you that you use as Tawassul to Allaah, The Most High. And as we have mentioned, Tawassul is seeking the correct means that is fruitful. So, what is of benefit to you in that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) has an honourable status with Allaah? And if you want to make correct Tawassul to Allaah, then say: <em><span style="color:#008000;">“O Allaah, I ask You by my Eemaan in Your Prophet, or by my love of Your Prophet”</span></em> or the like, then this is from the correct and beneficial means.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 50:</strong> What is the meaning of at-Taaghut and its derivations?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer</strong> by Shaykh ibn Uthaymeen رحمه الله:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">at-Taaghut is derived from <span style="color:#993300;"><em><strong>at-Tughyaan</strong></em></span> and at- Tughyaan means to go beyond the bounds, as occurs in the Saying of Allaah, The Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;When the water of the flood (taghaa) We carried you in the Ark.&#8221;</span></em><br />
[Qur’aan, sooarat al-Haaqah (69): 11],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">meaning that when the water of the flood rose beyond the normal bounds (taghaa), “We carried you in the Ark.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The best explanation of the term is what Ibnul Qayyim, rahimahullah, mentioned, that at-Taaghut is</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Anyone, regarding whom the servant goes beyond the due bounds, whether it is someone worshipped, obeyed, or followed.” </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the <strong>idols</strong> that are worshipped besides Allaah are Taaghoots; and the <strong>evil scholars</strong> who call to misguidance and to innovations and to making lawful that which Allaah has forbidden, or forbidding that which Allaah has made lawful, or those who present to the people in authority that it is acceptable to abandon the Sharee’ah of Islaam in favour of legislative systems introduced from outside that are contrary to the legislative system of Islaam, then they are Taaghoots also, since they have gone beyond their bounds. This is because the limit of the scholar is that he should be one who adheres to that which the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) came with, since the scholars are truly the inheritors of the Prophets. They inherit from them in knowledge, action, manners, the call to Allaah, and teaching, presenting this inheritance in their nations. If they go beyond this limit and begin to present it as acceptable to the rulers that they can abandon the Sharee’ah of Islaam in favour of such systems [introduced from the outside], then they are Taaghuts, since they have gone beyond that which was binding upon them, that they should adhere to the Sharee’ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his (ibnul Qayyim رحمه الله) saying [regarding the definition of Taaghut]: “<strong>or one obeyed</strong>,” then what he meant by that is those rulers who are obeyed due to that being required by Sharee’ah or because it is necessitated by way of this case they are to be obeyed due to that being required by Sharee’ah and necessitated Pre-decree (al-Qadar). <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So the rulers are to be obeyed as required by the Sharee’ah if they command that which is not contrary to the Command of Allaah and His Messenger</strong></span>. This is because the duty upon the people is to hear and obey when the ruler commands that which is not contrary to the Command of Allaah and His Messenger. In this situation and with this condition, their obedience to those in authority is obedience to Allaah (عز و جل). For this reason, we should bear in mind that when we carry out what the state authority has ordered from matters in which it must be obeyed, we are, in this respect, worshipping Allaah, The Most High, and drawing closer to Him through this obedience. So, bearing this in mind, our execution of the ruled matter will be something that draws us closer to Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic. It is something that we should be conscious of; because Allaah, The Most High, Says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O you who believe, obey Allaah, and obey his Messenger, and those of you in authority.&#8221;</span></em>[Qur’aan, soorat an-Nisaa’ (4): 59].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the obedience to those in authority because it is necessitated by way of Pre-decree (Qadaran), then if the rulers are strong in their authority then people will obey them because of the authoritative strength they possess, even if they are not motivated to do so by Eemaan. Since the matter of obedience to the ruler could be motivated by Eemaan, and in this case it is beneficial obedience to the rulers as well as the people. And it may come about because of the ruler&#8217;s authority and strength such that the people fear him and are intimidated by him due to the severe punishment he inflicts upon those who oppose him. For this reason we say that with regard to this matter the peoples situation regarding their rulers varies as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) Sometimes the motivation of Eemaan is strong, and the ruler&#8217;s authority is strong. This constitutes the most complete and highest situation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) Other times the motivation of Eemaan is weak, and the ruler’s authority is weak; and this is lowest state and the one most dangerous for the society–rulers and the ruled. Since in this state anarchy in thoughts, manners, and actions will take place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(iii) Sometimes the motivation of Eemaan is strong, and the ruler’s authority is weak. This represents a middle state whereupon if the ruler’s authority is strong then its manifestation will be better for the nation. But if the ruler’s authority in this case is absent, then do not ask about its state of corruption and evil actions! Because the motivation of Eemaan is weak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(iv) If the situation is such that the motivation of Eemaan is weak (strong), and the ruler’s authority is strong (weak), then the apparent situation will be weaker than the former state (iii). However, in terms of people’s relation with their Rabb (Allaah) it will be more beneficial to them than in the former case where the ruler’s authority is lacking.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are four states: Strong Eemaan and strong ruler, weak Eemaan and weak ruler, strong Eemaan and weak ruler, and strong ruler and weak Eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the important thing is that we say that when we carry out the commands of the ruler, we should believe that through this act we draw closer to Allaah, The Most Magnificent, Most High. And the reason why Ibnul Qayyim said that “<span style="color:#993300;"><em>at-Taaghut is anyone, regarding whom the servant goes beyond the due bounds, whether it is someone worshipped, obeyed, or followed</em></span>,” is because the ruler who is obeyed may command that which is contrary to the Command of Allaah and His Messenger. In this case there is neither hearing nor obeying, and it is not permissible for us to obey him in that which is disobedience to Allah (عز و جل). Since Allaah, The Most High, has deemed that their obedience be dependent upon the obedience of Allaah and His Messenger, as it is understood from the context of the aayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O you who believe, obey Allaah, and obey his Messenger, and those of you in authority.</span></em> &#8220;[Qur’aan, soorat an-Nisaa’ (4): 59].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He did not say (what signifies): “and obey those in authority.” So this indicates that obeying them is not something independent. Rather it is related to the obedience of Allaah and His Messenger. And it has been affirmed in the transmission from the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) that “<em><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, obedience (to somebody) is required when he enjoins what is Ma’roof</span></em>,” [71]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">meaning all that which is established by Sharee’ah. But as regard to that which is denied by the Sharee’ah, then it is forbidden to obey any created being even the father or the mother. If they command that which is disobedience to Allaah, then it is unlawful for you to obey them, since the obedience of Allaah takes precedence over any kind of obedience. <span style="color:#808000;">So, if a man obeys his ruler in that which is disobedience to Allaah, then he has gone beyond his bounds</span>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q : A brother from Dar&#8217;a, Syria asks: What is the correct opinion about the stories narrated from one of the famous leaders of Sufism, Al-Sayyid <strong>Ahmad Al-Rifa&#8217;y</strong> that he visited the Mosque of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in Al-Madinah and supplicated at the Prophet&#8217;s grave. The Messenger (peace be upon him) then stretched his hand out to him and he kissed it?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">This is a widespread belief among the followers of his Tariqah (Sufi order). It is a belief they hold firmly, even though he lived in the 6th century A.H. How true is this story?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph">A : This is false and baseless, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) died as decreed by Allah (Glorified be He) who says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Zumar, 39: 30" target="_blank" name="Verilyyou(OMuhammad%D8%B5%D9%84%D9%89%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Verily you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will die, and verily they (too) will die.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> [Surah Al-Zumar, 39: 30]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph">According to a Sahih Hadith, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph"><span id="ContentParagraph"><span style="color:#008000;">Allah has angels roaming around the land; if they find anyone greeting me, they carry back these greetings to me.</span></span><span style="color:#008000;">There is no one who sends greetings upon me but Allah will restore my soul to me so that I may return his greeting.</span></span><span id="ContentParagraph">[1]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (peace be upon him) said: <a name="Themostexcellentofyourdays"></a><span id="ContentParagraph"><span style="color:#008000;">The most excellent of your days is Friday; so invoke more blessings on me on that day, for your blessings will be submitted to me.</span> The people asked: O Messenger of Allah, how can it be that our blessings will be submitted to you while your body is decayed? He replied: <span style="color:#008000;">Allah, the Exalted, has prohibited the earth to consume the bodies of the prophets. </span></span><span id="ContentParagraph">[2]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Hadiths which say similar things but it is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>not narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said that he would shake hands with anybody</strong></span>. This indicates that this story is false. Even if we were to assume that it is true, then it could be that this was a <strong>shaytaan</strong> (devil) who shook hands with him in order to deceive him and lead him and others astray.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What all Muslims have to do is to fear Allah and adhere to His Shari`ah, which is indicated in His Noble Book and in the Sunnah of His trustworthy Messenger, and beware of anything that goes against that. May Allah reform the Muslims and grant them understanding of His religion and cause them to adhere to His Shari`ah, for He is the Most Generous, Most Kind.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">As sallamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A few days ago (13<sup>th</sup> Ramadaan), in the masjid of the Prophet (<i>sallalahu alahi  wa sallam</i>) in Medina, in his explanation of Usool-us-Sunnah of Imaam Ahmad, Sheikh Saaleh bin Sa’d as-Suhaymee (<i>hafidhahullah</i>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“My brothers, do not forget your brothers in Palestine, Syria, Iraq and in every place in your supplications because of these well-known conspiracies which have been agreed upon by all from amongst the disbelievers from the Jews and the Christians, the hizb-ul-Iblees (the party of Iblees), the Raafidah and other than them. They are agreed upon in concocting these conspiracies to divert the Muslims away from Tawheed and to put them to trial and so that they can reach their goals of completely eradicating the Muslims of Ahlus-Sunnah. </b><b><br />
</b></span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"> <b>However, they will bring in loss (upon themselves) – by the permission of Allah – whether it is the Jews and the Christians of the west and the east, or the party of Iblees, or the Raafidah or those who conspire with them against Ahlus-Sunnah, or the Khawaarij or other than them. All of these (groups) will come to an end – by the permission of Allah. Every time a tentacle from amongst them appears, it will be cut off, and Allah will cut off their tentacles – by the permission of Allah, The Most High&#8230;”</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh then stressed the importance of the Muslims returning back to Allah and to have reliance upon Him alone. He mentioned how the day before someone in Gaza had even called upon Salaah-ud-Deen al-Ayubee (<i>rahimahullah</i>) to help them and that this is the very essence of Shirk. The Sheikh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“How do you expect to be rescued (from these trials) whilst you are calling upon other than Allah?”</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then advised the Muslims to call upon Allah alone and not upon anyone else, including the Prophet (<i>sallalahu alahi wa sallam</i>). He then supplicated for the destruction of all these groups, whether it is the ‘devils’ of the Khawaarij and The Islamic state of Iraq and the Levant, or the ‘devils’ of the Jews and the Christians in the east and the west or the ‘devils’ of the Raafidah or the hizb of Iblees. He then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“&#8230;By Allah, the Jews and the Christians and the west and the east are not the enemies of the Raafidah. They are not the enemies of the Khawaarij. They are the ones who brought them in, they are the ones who armed them and they are the ones who sold weapons to them. This is because the goal which they have in mind is to completely eradicate Ahlus-Sunnah, the Salafees, Ahlus-Sunnah Wal Jammah. However, they will bring in loss, failure and disappointment (upon themselves) by the permission of Allah, The Most Merciful&#8230;”</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The transcription of the Sheikh’s words can be found at:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah save the Muslims from the conspiracies of the Jews and Christians, the Raafidah and the Khawaarij. Aameen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The difference between the <em>‘Aqeedah </em>of the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em> and the<em>‘Aqeedah</em> of the grave worshipping Soofis</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Compiled by Abbas Raheem<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The grave worshipping Soofis promote matters of <em>Shirk</em> and innovation by way of the media, and from those matters is <em>Isteegatha</em>(seeking closeness to Allaah) from the dead of the Prophets, and the righteous people.  This is a refutation against their falsehood and their trickery of the worshippers by mentioning what is ambiguous from the texts of Islaam, and using weak hadeeth and narrations, and their own understanding of the authentic hadeeth other than the understanding of the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em>.  This refutation also contains the position of the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em> regarding this issue, according to the<em>‘Aqeedah</em> of the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em>, and all capability is from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Isteegatha</em> linguistically means requesting aid and victory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Sharia’</em> definition: There is no difference with the linguistic meaning, since it means requesting help and relief from distress.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em>Isteegatha</em> is a type of <em>Dua’</em>(supplication), and <em>Dua’</em> is worship, as has been mentioned in the hadeeth of an-Numaan bin Basheer who said that the Messenger  of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said : ‘<em>Dua’</em> is worship.’  Narrated by Ahmad and Tirmidhee and he said the hadeeth was <em>hasan saheeh</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the principles of the <em>Sharia’</em> is that all worship, whether apparent or internal, is prohibited until there is an evidence from the<em>Sharia’</em> that makes the action permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once this is understood, then know – may Allaah have mercy upon you, and may He direct you to His obedience &#8211;   that making<em>Isteegatha</em> from the people is divided into two sections according to the <em>Salaf</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first</strong> :  The <em>Isteegatha</em> which is permissible : and that is seeking assistance in the time of need from a living person, with that which he has the ability to help with, without having to lower oneself to that person, or with humiliation in any form, or having submission in the same way that you ask from Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From amongst the evidences that show the permissibility of this type of <em>Isteegatha</em> is:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>a)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> regarding the story of Musa <em>– alayhi as-sallam &#8211;</em> : &lt;&lt;The man from his (own) party asked him for help against his foe&gt;&gt;</li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>b)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;Help one another in goodness and piety, and do not help one another in sin and transgression.&gt;&gt;</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second</strong>: The <em>Isteegatha</em> which is prohibited, is of two types:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>a)</strong> Seeking assistance from living people with that which only Allaah<em>Ta’ala</em> has the ability to help with, and there is agreement amongst the scholars, that this is prohibited.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from amongst the evidences for this issue, is the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;And invoke not besides Allaah, any that will neither profit you, nor hurt you…..&gt;&gt;</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>b)</strong> Making <em>Isteegatha</em> with the dead, from the Prophets or the righteous people.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the proofs of this prohibition is the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;And if My slaves ask you about Me, then I am close, and I answer the <em>Dua’</em> of the caller if he supplicates to Me.  So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So ponder – may Allaah look after you – about when the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> was faced with questions, and the answer would come from Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>, and Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> would make the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>  an intermediary to convey the answer, so Allaah would say to him : &lt;&lt;<strong>Say</strong>….&gt;&gt; meaning O Muhammad tell them.  The following are examples of that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;They ask you about the new moons.  <strong>Say</strong>: these are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage. &gt;&gt; 2:186</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> : &lt;&lt;They ask you concerning fighting in the Sacred Months (i.e. 1st, 7th, 11th and 12th months of the Islaamic calendar). Say, “Fighting therein is a great (transgression) but a greater (transgression) with Allaah is to prevent mankind from following the Way of Allaah, to disbelieve in Him,&gt;&gt; 2:217</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;They ask you (O Muhammad ) concerning alcoholic drink and gambling. Say: ‘In them is a great sin, and (some) benefit for men, but the sin of them is greater than their benefit.’ &gt;&gt; 2:219</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;They ask you what they should spend.  <strong>Say</strong> : whatever you spend of good&gt;&gt; 2 : 215</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>5)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;They ask you for a legal verdict. Say: ‘Allaah directs (thus) about <em>Al­Kalâlah</em> (those who leave neither descendants nor ascendants as heirs) &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>6)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;They ask you what is lawful for them as food. <strong> Say</strong> : lawful unto you are all kinds of <em>halaal</em> food. &gt;&gt; 5:4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>7)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;They ask you about the Hour (Day of Resurrection): ‘When will be its appointed time?’ Say: ‘The knowledge thereof is with my Lord (Alone). &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>8)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;They ask you about the spoils of war. <strong>Say</strong>: the spoils of war are for Allaah and the Messenger&gt;&gt; 8: 1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> was an intermediary to convey the message directed to him from Allaah <em>Ta’ala </em>by His saying : &lt;&lt;Say…&gt;&gt;, except in the issue of <em>Dua’</em>.  Indeed Allaah<em>Ta’ala</em> did not make the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> an intermediary for <em>Dua’</em>, but Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> Himself undertakes the answering of the<em>Dua’</em> directly without saying: &lt;&lt;Say…&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> was asked: ‘O Messenger of Allaah, is our Lord close so we can have intimate discourse with Him, or is He far, so that we have to call in a loud voice?’  Then Allaah revealed: &lt;&lt;And if My slaves ask you about Me, then I am close, and I answer the <em>Dua’</em> of the caller if he supplicates to Me.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Abdullaah bin Ahmad bin Hanbal in his book ‘Kitab as-Sunnah’1/ 277 and Ibn Hibban in his book ‘ath-Thiqaat’8/436, and at-Tabari mentioned it as a reason for the revelation of the <em>Ayaah</em> in his <em>Tafseer</em> book 2/158, and Ibn Katheer in his <em>Tafseer</em> book 1/219, and Qurtubi in his <em>Tafseer</em> book 2/308, and he mentioned it as a reason for it being revealed, on the authority of Hasan al-Basari – may Allaah have mercy upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is a divine indication that Allaah does not love that, nor is a slave in need of intermediaries or intercessors when he supplicates to his Lord <em>Azza wa Jaal</em>, rather he supplicates to Allaah directly and the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> &lt;&lt;So let them obey Me &gt;&gt; means : that they supplicate to Me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;Say O Muhammad: I do not possess anything for myself that will benefit me nor harm me.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">so indeed this <em>Ayaah</em> clearly explains that he (the Messenger of Allaah) does not control for himself that which will benefit him nor that which will harm him, so how can he possess that for anyone else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what confirms this point is the saying of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> : ‘O Fatima daughter of Muhammad, O Safiya, daughter of AbdulMuttalib, O tribe of AbdulMuttalib, I do not possess anything for you from Allaah, but ask me whatever you want from my wealth.’ Narrated by Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;Say (O Muhammad): ‘Call unto those besides Him whom you pretend [to be gods like angels, Iesa (Jesus), ‘Uzair (Ezra), etc.]. They have neither the power to remove adversity from you nor even to shift it from you to another person.’ &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the <em>Salaf</em> said that this <em>Ayaah </em>was revealed about groups of people who used to supplicate to <em>al-Azeez</em>, the Messiah and the angels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a person says that those people used to worship them (angels, prophets etc.)  and not worship Allaah, but as for us then we don’t worship them, rather,  we take them as intermediaries and intercessors with Allaah !!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the answer to them is: This statement of yours, is like the statement of the <em>Mushrikeen</em> at the time of the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;We do not worship them except that they bring us closer to Allaah&gt;&gt; and in spite of what they said, their claim was not accepted, nor did it benefit them, and the Messenger of Allaah fought against them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4)</strong> A fundamental principle is that the dead are not like the living, Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> says: &lt;&lt;The living and the dead are not the same&gt;&gt; fundamentally the dead do not hear the living.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> said: &lt;&lt;And you do not make those in the graves to hear.&gt;&gt; except where the evidence shows exceptions to this principle, and here are some examples:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>a)</strong> When the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> spoke to the dead of the<em>Mushrikeen</em> after the battle of <em>Badr</em>, while they were in the well before they were buried.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And about this Ibn Qudamah al-Maqdasee – may Allaah have mercy upon him – said: ‘and this was a miracle of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and a matter that was specific to him, so you cannot use for anyone other than him.’ Taken from ‘Kitaab al-Mughnee’10/63.</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>b)</strong> The dead hear the footsteps of his companions.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>c)</strong> The soul of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> is returned to him so that the angels can convey to him the <em>Sallam</em> of anyone who sends <em>Sallam</em> upon him.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>d)</strong> When the dead person hears the <em>Sallam</em> of the one who sends<em>Sallam</em> to him at his grave. This is according to those who authenticate this hadeeth.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no evidence to show that the dead person hears the living person who asks of him and makes a request from him, and if there is no evidence for this then the principle is that the issue remains as it is, that the dead cannot hear the living.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the fundamental principle is that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> is human, and the origin regarding the issue of death, is that he is like the rest of mankind. Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> says: &lt;&lt;Indeed you will die, and indeed they will die&gt;&gt; except for what the evidence exempts, that the earth does not eat up his body and that his soul is returned to him in the grave to receive the <em>Sallam</em> of the one who sends <em>Sallam</em> to him, and that the actions of his <em>Ummah</em>are presented to him, and this is according to those who authenticate the hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since the dead not being able to hear the living has been established about the leader of the sons of Adam <em>– alayhi as-Sallam –</em> then this more readily applies to other than the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>. If this is established that the Prophets do not hear the question of the one asking the question, then ponder over the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;And who is more astray than one who calls (invokes) besides Allaah, such as will not answer him till the Day of Resurrection, and who are (even) unaware of their calls (invocations) to them?&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>5</strong> – The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;So when you have finished, then stand up for Allaah’s worship.  And to your Lord turn all your invocations&gt;&gt; and He did not say ‘Turn your invocations to the Prophets and the righteous people.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam at-Tabaree, may Allaah have mercy upon him, said, ‘The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala:</em> &lt;&lt;And to your Lord turn all your invocations&gt;&gt;  Allaah mentions is : O Muhammad direct your fervent desires to your Lord, and not to any one from the creation since the <em>Mushrikeen</em> from your people have made their fervent desires to gods and their  associates. The people of <em>Tafseer</em> have also said similar to what we have just mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from the book <em>Tafseer</em> at-Tabaree 30 / 237.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>6</strong> – Indeed what the Companions <em>&#8211; radi Allaahu anhum &#8211;</em> knew and understood is that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> was not made as someone from who aid was sought after his death nor was he taken as an intermediary, and this is confirmed by what has been narrated by al-Bukhari 1 / 342 and others have also narrated this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Anas <em>&#8211; radi Allaahu anhu &#8211;</em>  and then on the authority of Umar bin al-Khattab  <em>&#8211; radi Allaahu anhu &#8211;</em>  if there was a drought, he would request rain by asking al-Abbas bin AbdulMuttalib, and he would say : ‘O Allaah indeed we used to come closer to You (make<em>Tawassul</em>) with Your Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and You would give us rain, and indeed we come closer to You with his uncle, so give us rain,’ then the rain would come down.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if you dear brother, dear reader, being unbiased, ponder that Umar and the senior Companions did not regard the permissibility of (<em>Tawassul</em>) coming closer to Allaah nor seeking assistance with the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> after his death, compared to when he was alive, in fact in their request for rain they used to make <em>Tawassul</em> with the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, but after he passed away they did not make <em>Tawassul</em> with him. Indeed Umar <em>&#8211; radi Allaahu anhu   &#8211;</em> said in his authentic, well-known and established supplication, agreed upon by the people of knowledge, which was said in the presence of the<em>Muhajiroon</em> and the <em>Ansaar</em> in the famous year of the Great Drought. When the drought became severe and the people requested rain, he said : ‘O Allaah we used to, if we suffered from a drought, we used to make <em>Tawassul</em> with Your Prophet, and You used to give us rain, and now we make <em>Tawassul</em> to You with his uncle, so give us rain , and they were given rain.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This well known supplication was accepted by all the Companions, not one of them denied it.  This is one of the clearest examples of (<em>Ijma’Sakootee</em>) silent agreement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, if <em>Tawassul</em> with the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> after his death was like the <em>Tawassul</em> during his lifetime, they would have said, why are we making <em>Tawassul</em> with al-Abbas while we don’t make it with the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, who is the best and greatest of creation with Allaah? Since not one of them said this, then this shows us that they knew <em>Tawassul</em> was only during the lifetime of the Prophet , and after his passing away, <em>Tawassul</em> is with the <em>Dua’ </em>of the righteous living people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> did not order any one of his Companions. if they had a need or were afflicted with a problem, that they turn to him and they seek assistance from him after his death. In fact the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said to Ibn Abbas <em>&#8211; radi Allaahu anhu – </em>: ‘If you ask of anyone, then ask Allaah, and if you seek help, then seek help from Allaah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by at-Tirmidhee and he said the hadeeth is <em>hasan saheeh</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is other evidence which shows that <em>Isteegatha</em> with the dead from the Prophets and the righteous people is not allowed according to Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Imaam Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab<br />
SOURCE: His short treatise “Ma’anaa at-Taaghoot wa Ru’oos Anwaa’ihi&#8221;<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know, may Allaah have mercy on you, that the first thing Allaah obligated on the Son of Adam is to reject the Taaghoot and believe in Allaah. The proof for this is Allaah’s saying: <b>“And We have indeed sent to every nation a messenger (saying to his people): ‘Worship Allaah alone and avoid the Taaghoot (false deities).”</b> [Surah An-Nahl: 36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the description of <b>Rejecting the Taaghoot</b>, then it is that you believe in the futility of worshipping other than Allaah, and that you abandon doing so and hate it, and that you reject and make enmity with does who do it. And as for the meaning of <b>Believing in Allaah</b>, then it is that you believe that Allaah is the only true God who deserves to be worshipped alone, apart from everything else besides Him. And it is that you make all types of worship – every act &#8211; sincerely for Allaah alone, while negating and rejecting that from everything else that is worshipped besides Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also entails that you love and show friendship to the people of Ikhlaas (i.e. Islaam), while hating and showing enmity to the people of Shirk. This is the Religion of Ibraaheem, of which those who turn away from it only fool themselves. And this is the good example that Allaah informs us of in His saying: <b>“There has indeed been an excellent example for you in Ibraaheem and those with him, when they said to their people: ‘Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allaah. We have rejected you and there has commenced between us and you, enmity and hatred forever, until you believe in Allaah alone.’” </b>[Surah Al-Mumtahanah: 4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word Taaghoot is general. So everything that is worshipped besides Allaah, while being pleased with this worship – whether it is something worshipped, someone followed, or someone obeyed in the absence of obedience to Allaah and His Messenger, then that is considered Taaghoot. The Tawaagheet (pl. of Taaghoot) are many, but their heads are five:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The First: </b>The Devil who calls the people to worship other than Allaah. The proof for this is Allaah’s saying: <b>“Did I not command you O children of Aadam, that you should not worship the Devil. Verily, he is a plain enemy to you.” </b>[Surah YaaSeen: 60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Second: </b>The tyrannical and oppressive ruler who changes Allaah’s rulings. The proof for this is Allaah’s saying: <b>“Have you not seen those (hypocrites) who claim to believe in that which has been revealed to you, and that which was revealed before you, and they wish to go for judgement (in their disputes) to the Taaghoot, when they have been ordered to reject them? But the Devil wishes to lead them far astray.” </b>[Surah An-Nisaa: 60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Third: </b>The one who judges by other than what Allaah has revealed, and the proof for this is Allaah’s saying: <b>“And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed, then they are the disbelievers.” </b>[Surah Al-Maa’idah: 44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Fourth: </b>The one who claims to have knowledge of the Unseen, apart from Allaah. The proof for this is Allaah’s saying: <b>“He alone is the All-Knower of the Unseen, and He does not disclose His Unseen matters to anyone.” </b>[Surah Al-Jinn: 26-27] And He says: <b>“And with Him lie the keys to the Unseen, no one knows them but He. And He knows whatever there is in the land and in the sea; not a leaf falls except that He knows about it. There is not a grain in the darkness of the earth, nor anything fresh or dry, but that it is written in a Clear Record.” </b>[Surah Al-Ana’aam: 59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Fifth: </b>The one who is worshipped apart from Allaah, while being pleased with being worshipped. The proof for this is Allaah’s saying: <b>“And whoever amongst them says: ‘Verily, I am a God besides Him (Allaah)’, then this person’s recompense will be the Hellfire. That is the way we recompense the wrongdoers.” </b>[Surah Al-Anbiyaa: 29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And know that man will never become a believer in Allaah unless he rejects and disbelieves in the Taaghoot. The proof for this is Allaah’s saying: <b>“There is no compulsion in the Religion. Verily, the right path has become distinct from the wrong path. So whoever disbelieves in the Taaghoot and believes in Allaah, then he has taken hold of the firmest handhold, that will never break. And Allaah is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.” </b>[Surah Al-Baqarah: 256]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <b>“right path”</b> here refers to the Religion of Muhammad (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>), while the <b>“wrong path” </b>refers to the Religion of Abu Jahl. The <b>“firmest handhold” </b>refers to the testimony that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah {<b><i>Laa Ilaaha Illallaah</i></b><i></i>). This testimony consists of a negation and an affirmation. It negates all types of worship from those worshipped besides Allaah, while affirming all types of worship done for Allaah alone, free from any partner.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1617.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The first to be judged on the Day of Resurrection will be a man who had died as a martyr. He will be brought forward. Allah will remind him of the favours He had bestowed upon him and the man will acknowledge them.

You fought so that people might call you courageous; and they have done so.&#8217; Command will then be issued about him and he will be dragged on his face and thrown into Hell. Next a man who had acquired and imparted knowledge and read the Qur&#8217;an will be brought forward, Allah will remind him of the favours He had bestowed upon him and the man will acknowledge them. Then He will ask him: `What did you do to express gratitude for it?&#8217; The man will reply: `I acquired knowledge and taught it, and read the Qur&#8217;an for Your sake.&#8217; Allah will say to him: `You have lied. You acquired knowledge so that people might call you a learned (man), and you read the Qur&#8217;an so that they might call you a reciter, and they have done so.&#8217; Command will then be issued about him, and he will be dragged on his face and thrown into Hell. Next a man whom Allah had made affluent and to whom Allah had given plenty of wealth, will be brought forward, Allah will remind him of the favours He had bestowed upon him and the man will acknowledge them. He will ask him: `What did you do to express gratitude for it?&#8217; The man will reply: `I did not neglect any of the ways You liked wealth to be spend liberally for Your sake&#8217;. Allah will say to him: `You have lied. You did it so that people might call you generous, and they have done so.&#8217; Command will then be issued about him and he will be dragged on his face and thrown into Hell.</span>&#8221;<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1618.</b> `Abdullah bin `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) said: <span style="color:#008000;">Some people told me, &#8220;We visit our rulers and we tell them things contrary to those which we say when we depart from them.&#8221; `Abdullah bin `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) replied: &#8220;In the era of the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) we considered this to be an act of hypocrisy.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>

Chapter 314<br />
Prohibition of Swearing in the name of anything besides Allah</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1707.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#000080;">Allah has prohibited you from taking an oath by your fathers. He who must take an oath, may do so by swearing in the Name of Allah or he should remain silent.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1708.</b> `Abdur-Rahman bin Samurah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Swear neither by the name of Taghut (i.e., false deities, false leaders, etc.) nor by your fathers.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1709.</b> Buraidah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who swears by Amanah (trust) is not one of us.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud with authentic Isnad].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1710.</b> Buraidah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">If anyone swears that in such and such case he will be free from Islam and afterwards he turns out to be a liar, he will be as he has sworn; but if he is speaking the truth, he will not revert safely to Islam.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1711.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) said: I heard a man saying: &#8220;No, by the Ka`bah.&#8221; I admonished him: &#8220;Do not swear by any thing besides Allah, for I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, `<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who swears by anyone or anything other than Allah, has indeed committed an act of Kufr or Shirk&#8217;</span>.&#8221;<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color:#000000;text-align:center;"><b>Avoiding recitations for healing or protection that violate Shari`ah</b></p>
<p>From<a id="ContentAnchor" href="http://alifta.com/Fatawa/MoftyDetails.aspx?languagename=en&amp;Type=Mofty&amp;section=tafseer&amp;ID=2" target="_blank" name="Abdul-AzizibnAbdullahibnBaz"> `Abdul-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz </a>to all Muslims in the district of Al-Far` and other districts of Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah, may Allah guide you to have insight into the religion of Islam, Amen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah&#8217;s peace, mercy and blessings be upon you. To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have been informed that in your district there is an incantation against scorpions and other poisonous creatures, and that this incantation contains statements of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). That is why I see I have to warn you against such Ruqyahs (recitations for healing or protection).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following is the text of some of such Ruqyahs referred to above:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">(In the Name of Allah! O Allah&#8217;s Words! By the seven heavens and the revealed Ayahs that rule but not ruled! O Sulayman Al-Rifa`y! O fighter of scorpions&#8217; poison! Call scorpions in the name of Al-Rifa`y, both female scorpions and male ones, both long scorpions and short ones, both red scorpions and white ones, and both big scorpions and small ones against the evil of scorpions creeping both in the evening and in the morning. I seek help against them from Allah, His Ayahs, ninety nine prophets, Fatimah, the Prophet&#8217;s daughter and her offspring).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These words are only some of the incantations I have been informed of. They have many formulas, which all involve Shirk. There could be no doubt that such incantations include <strong>statements of Shirk</strong>, such as, &#8220;<strong>By the seven heavens</strong>,&#8221; and, &#8220;<strong>O<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Sulayman Al-Rifa`y! </span>O fighter of scorpions&#8217; poison! Call scorpions in the name of</strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><strong> Al-Rifa`y</strong>,&#8221; </span>and, &#8220;<strong>I seek help against them from Allah, His Ayahs, ninety-nine prophets, and<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Fatimah, </span>the Prophet&#8217;s daughter and her offspring</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is worth mentioning that the Glorious Qur&#8217;an and the Prophetic Sunnah stress that Allah Alone is the only One worthy of worship and no one should be invoked or asked for help except Allah (Exalted be He).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">Allah (Glorified be He) says: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Fatihah, 1: 5" target="_blank" name="You(Alone)weworship,andYou"></a><span style="color:#008000;">You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything)</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">Allah (Glorified be He) also says: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Jinn, 72: 18" target="_blank" name="AndthemosquesareforAll%C3%A2h(Alone):"></a><span style="color:#008000;">And the mosques are for Allâh (Alone): so invoke not anyone along with Allâh</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <a style="color:blue;" name="Dua(supplication)is(theessenceof)worship"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="18029" class="tip"></span>Du&#8217;a` (supplication) is (the essence of) worship.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">He(peace be upon him) also said: <a style="color:blue;" name="Ifyoubeg,begofAllahAlone;"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="23001503" class="tip"></span>If you beg, beg of Allah Alone; and if you need assistance, supplicate to Allah Alone for help.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) and Prophetic Hadiths that stress this meaning. Moreover, Muslim scholars unanimously agree that appealing to the heavens, stars, idols, trees, and so on, for help is as an act of Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, they unanimously agree that it is not permissible to invoke the dead or seek their help whether they were prophets, righteous people or others. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <a style="color:blue;" name="Whenamandies,hisdeedscome"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="14124" class="tip"></span>When a man dies, his deeds come to an end, except for three: Sadaqah Jariyah (ongoing charity), knowledge by which people benefit, or a pious son who prays for him (the deceased).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">The Ruqyah referred to above includes some statements like asking the heavens, the dead, including prophets,<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Rifa`y, </span>and others for help. All this is regarded as an act of Shirk.</span> Thus, all Muslims should be cautious about such Ruqyahs and similar incantations that contain statements of Shirk. Moreover, Muslims should advise and warn one another against such Ruqyahs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They should resort to legal Ruqyahs (i.e. reciting Qur&#8217;an and saying supplications over the sick seeking healing), such as Ayat-ul-Kursy (the Qur&#8217;anic Verse of Allah&#8217;s Chair, Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:255), Surah Al-Ikhlas, Surah Al-Falaq, Surah Al-Nas and other Ayahs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is in addition to supplications for refuge and protection prescribed by Shari`ah (Islamic law), such as seeking refuge with Allah&#8217;s Perfect Words from the evil of His creation. Also, a Muslim can say three times in the morning and in the evening: <a style="color:blue;" name="IntheNameofAllah,withWhose"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="11111" class="tip"></span>In the Name of Allah, with Whose Name nothing can be harmful on the earth or in the heaven, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.</span> Also, there is the Islamic Ruqyah for the sick and for people who are stung in which a Muslim can say three times: <a style="color:blue;" name="Removetheaffliction,OLordof"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="11113" class="tip"></span>Remove the affliction, O Lord of mankind, and bring about healing, as You are the Healer. There is no healing but Your Healing; a healing that leaves behind no ailment.</span> <a style="color:blue;" name="IntheNameofAllahIperform"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="11191" class="tip"></span>In the Name of Allah I perform Ruqyah for you, from everything that may harm you; from the evil of any soul or envious eye. May Allah heal you. In the Name of Allah I perform Ruqyah for you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, reciting Surah Al-Fatihah over the sick and the people who are stung is one of the greatest causes of cure, especially when recitation is performed sincerely and truthfully asking Allah (Exalted be He) to grant healing with full faith that Allah (Exalted be He) is the Only One who Cures and that no one can cure people from a diseases except Him (Glorified be He).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">I ask Allah to guide us and all Muslims to have insight into His Religion and to steadfastly adhere to it. I ask Him to protect us from all that violates His Laws. Indeed, He is the Most Generous and the Most Beneficent. May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy and Blessings be upon you.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Ruling on restoration of monuments</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">All praise be to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah, his family and Companions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Some newspapers have published articles on reviving and paying attention to monuments, written by some authors, including Professor<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Salih Muhammad Jamal. </span>These articles have been responded to by His Eminence, Shaykh<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Abdullah ibn Muhammad ibn Humayd. </span>He efficiently and instructively answered to the claims included therein, may Allah reward him. However, Professor<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Anwar Abul-Jadayil, </span>may Allah guide and inspire him with what is right, was not satisfied with that reply or had not seen it. Therefore, he wrote an article on the subject, published by the &#8216;Madinah&#8217; newspaper, issue number 5448, dated 22/4/1402 A.H. In this article, which is entitled &#8220;The Way of the Two Hijrahs&#8221;, he stated: &#8220;This is a review of the word published in the &#8216;Madinah&#8217; newspaper, issue 5433, on 7/4/1402 A.H., by Professor<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Abdul-Quddus Al-Ansary, </span>as a commentary on the investigation done by the researcher and man of letters, Professor<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Abdul-`Aziz Al-Rifa`y, </span>of the sites which the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) passed through on his Hijrah (emigration) from<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Makkah </span>to<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah. </span>It urges us to stimulate officials to set signs indicating such posts such as, for example, two tents as close as possible to the two tents of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Um Ma`bad </span>with whatever else is suitable for the rest of posts, after taking the necessary precautions to prevent any transgression that could impart to them the tinge of sanctity or glory, and any deviation from the requirements of Shari`ah (Islamic law). For, the aim is to inform students, researchers and tourists who want to know about this path and these posts, to perceive the difficulties that the Messenger (peace be upon him) went through during this secret and covert trip.This is meant only to give lesson and example and inure people to hardships in Da`wah (calling people to Allah), following the example of the Prophet (peace be upon him).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">However, side roads should be built and paved, off the main roads, with rest houses for the tourists, making it easier for people to enter the places where the Prophet (peace be upon him) passed, starting with<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Hira&#8217; Cave, </span>then<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Thawr, </span>and the place where the Prophet (peace be upon him) was pursued by<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Suraqah ibn Malik, </span>until we reach<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Quba&#8217;. </span>This should also include the preceding sites in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Makkah Al-Mukarramah, </span>such as Dar<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Arqam ibn Abul-Arqam, </span>the pass where he and his family were boycotted, the pathway he assumed during the Conquest of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Makkah, </span>and then the places he stopped at in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Abtah, </span>and also in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Hudaybiyah, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Hunayn, </span>and<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Badr. </span>This also applies to sites he stopped at in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah, </span>the battlefields of the conquests, and his places of presence in their rural areas, then his path to<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Khaybar </span>and to<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Tabuk. </span>This is thus meant to provide people with more information about his unique efforts in spreading the Da`wah, and to teach them to follow the Prophet&#8217;s example in that regard.<strong> [End of quote]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Likewise, Dr.<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Faruq Akhdar </span>recommended in his article, published in Al-Jazirah newspaper, issue number 3354, dated 13/1/1402 A.H., the development of archaeological sites in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia by the Muslims on a continuing basis, to ensure income; as he alleged that petrol reserves would run out. Maintaining his viewpoint, he stated<em> &#8220;that Christian religious tourism in the Vatican is one of the main sources of income in Italian economy. Israel sold empty bottles to the Jews in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> America, </span>under the claim that such bottles were full of holy air from Al Quds.&#8221;</em> He also pointed out that among the benefits this will bring about is that it will<em> &#8220;Engrave knowledge about Islam in the minds of Muslim children&#8230;&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Due to the <strong>bad effects that reviving religious monuments have on the `Aqidah (creed)</strong>, I wanted to clarify the truth and corroborate the writings of scholars on this issue, cooperate with those scholars in righteousness and Taqwa (fear or wariness of offending Allah), advise people for the Sake of Allah, expose suspicious points, and illustrate supporting evidence. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">Hence, I would like to say that taking care of monuments in the way mentioned above <strong>would lead to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship)</strong>. This is because people&#8217;s souls are weak and are prone to cling to that which they deems beneficial. Besides, there are many types of Shirk, which are imperceptible for most people. Hence, those who stop at these monuments &#8211; whether they are real or fake monuments &#8211; will realize that ignorant people wipe themselves with the dirt of these places, and with the trees and stones therein. Those ignorant people also pray there and invoke those to whom the sites are attributed, thinking that this is a means of approaching Allah (Exalted be He), attaining Shafa`ah (intercession), and having theirs distresses relieved. Such an ignorance-based approach is maintained by misleading callers whose souls are impregnated with idolatry, and who exploit these monuments to misguide people and encourage them to visit these monuments in order to acquire some financial gains. Regretfully, there is no one at these monuments to inform people that they are meant only for people to derive an example. Rather, the opposite usually takes place. </span><span id="more-243"></span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">This is evident to the wise people in some countries that are afflicted with the obsessive attachment to shrines, where people are accustomed to worshipping them besides Allah, and circumambulating them in the same way Muslims circumambulate</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> the Ka`bah, </span><span style="color:#000000;">on the pretext that people entombed therein are Awliya&#8217; (pious people). So, how far worse would it be if they were told that such monuments are attributed to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), knowing that Satan unremittingly seizes the most suitable times to mislead people, and therefore Allah (Exalted be He) says about him: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Sad, 38: 82" target="_blank" name="Ibl%C3%AEs(Satan)]said:ByYourMight,"></a>[Iblîs (Satan)] said:<em> &#8220;By Your Might, then I will surely mislead them all,</em></span><em><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Sad, 38: 83" target="_blank" name="ExceptYourchosenslavesamongst"></a>&#8220;Except Your chosen slaves amongst them (i.e. faithful, obedient, true believers of Islâmic Monotheism).&#8221;</span></em><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> He (Exalted be He) also says about Satan, the enemy of Allah: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-A&#096;raf, 7: 16" target="_blank" name="Ibl%C3%AEs)said:BecauseYouhave"></a>(Iblîs) said:<em> &#8220;Because You have sent me astray, surely I will sit in wait against them (human beings) on Your Straight Path.</em></span><em><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></em><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-A&#096;raf, 7: 17" target="_blank" name="ThenIwillcometothemfrombefore"></a>&#8220;<em>Then I will come to them from before them and behind them, from their right and from their left, and You will not find most of them as thankful ones (i.e. they will not be dutiful to You).</em>&#8220;</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> Satan deceived Adam (peace be upon him) and caused him to be driven out of Jannah (Paradise), although Allah (Exalted be He) had warned Adam against Satan, and showed him that Satan was his enemy, as</span><span style="color:#000000;">Allah (Exalted be He) says in Surah (chapter) Ta-ha: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Ta­Ha, 20: 121" target="_blank" name="Thentheybothateofthetree,"></a><em>Thus did Adam disobey his Lord, so he went astray.</em></span><em><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Ta­Ha, 20: 122" target="_blank" name="ThenhisLordchosehim,andturned"></a>Then his Lord chose him, and turned to him with forgiveness, and gave him guidance.</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Another example is the <strong>story of</strong></span><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> the Children of Israel </span><span style="color:#000000;">with</span></strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"><strong> Al-Samiry</strong> </span><span style="color:#000000;">when he molded for them, out of their possessions, a calf to worship instead of Allah. Then, Satan made this act fair-seeming to them, although it was clearly false. It has been authentically reported in Jami` (Hadith Compilation of)</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Tirmidhy </span><span style="color:#000000;">and others through an authentic Isnad (chain of narrators) from</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Abu Waqid Al-Laythy </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;" name="WewentoutwiththeMessenger"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="10630" class="tip"></span>We went out with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) to Hunayn, when we had just recently left Kufr (disbelief). The Mushriks (those who associate others with Allah in worship) had a lote-tree which they would frequent and would hang their swords upon. They called it &#8216;Dhat Anwat&#8217;. When we passed by a lote-tree, we said, &#8216;O Messenger of Allah, assign for us a Dhat Anwat just like the one they have?&#8217; The Messenger (peace be upon him) said, &#8216;Allahu Akbar (Allah is the Most Great)! By the One (Allah) in Whose Hand is my soul, you have said what the Children of Israel said to Musa, &#8216;Make for us a god as they have gods.&#8217; Certainly, you will follow the ways of those who came before you.</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> Thus, the Prophet (peace be upon him) likened their saying: &#8220;Assign for us a Dhat Anwat just like the one they have&#8221; to that of</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> the Children of Israel </span><span style="color:#000000;">who said: &#8220;Make for us a god as they have gods.&#8221; This indicates that the meanings and purposes are what count, not merely the words. And due to the gravity of the crime of Shirk and its threats in ruining one&#8217;s work, we find the Khalil (beloved, close elect) of Allah, Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham, peace be upon him), invoke Allah to safeguard him and his children against Shirk. Allah (Exalted be He) says: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Ibrahim, 14: 35" target="_blank" name="And(remember)whenIbr%C3%A2h%C3%AEm(Abraham)"></a>And (remember) when Ibrâhîm (Abraham) said: &#8220;O my Lord!

Hence, they should be warned of it, and all the means leading to it should be blocked.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">No matter how much precautions or reservations the followers of the truth take, this will not protect the ignorant people from the corruptions that result from sanctifying monuments</span>. This is because people differ in terms of their understanding,</span><span style="color:#000000;">vulnerability, and their search for the truth to a great extent, and therefore</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> the people of Nuh</span><span style="color:#000000;">(peace be upon him) worshipped Wadd, Suwa`, Yaghuth, Ya`uq and Nasra (these are the names of their idols), although the original purpose of hewing them out was to remind people of the good deeds of those individuals and thus encourage them to emulate these persons, not to idolize or worship them besides Allah. However, Satan misguided those who came after those people who carved such sculptures, and led them to worship these idols instead of Allah. This was the reason of Shirk among the Children of Adam, as was reported by</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Bukhari </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be Merciful with him), in his Sahih.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Regarding</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">the Tafsir (exegesis of the meanings) of Allah&#8217;s saying: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Nuh, 71: 23" target="_blank" name="Andtheyhavesaid:%E2%80%98Youshall"></a>&#8220;<em>And they have said: ‘You shall not leave your gods: nor shall you leave Wadd, nor Suwâ‘, nor Yaghûth, nor Ya‘ûq nor Nasr’ (these are the names of their idols)</em>.</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> Ibn `Abbas was reported to have said that these are names of righteous men from</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> the <strong>people of Nuh</strong>.</span><span style="color:#000000;">He added that when they perished, Satan inspired their people to set statues in the seats where those righteous men used to sit, and to name the statues after the names of those people. Sure enough, they did it. Then, they were worshipped only after those who had made them perished and knowledge was discarded.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">As for examples from the <strong>practices of the Jews and Christians</strong>, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) ordered us to guard against their ways, because it is the path to aberration and loss. It is impermissible to imitate them in their ways since they contradict our Shari`ah. They were also known for their misguidance, following their own whims, distortion of what was revealed to them through their prophets. Due to these reasons and others, we are forbidden to imitate them or to copy their ways. Consequently, the corruption which would result from restoring and reviving monuments are inescapable, and none other than Allah (Exalted be He) can know the extent and types of their evil consequences. Therefore, it is Wajib (obligatory) to prevent the revival of monuments in order to avoid that which could lead to further corruption. It is known that the Companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him, and may Allah be pleased with them) were the most knowledgeable people regarding the Religion of Allah, the most loved by the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), and the best to give advice to the slaves of Allah. However, they did not revive or sanctify these monuments, or even advise others to revive them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">Rather, when<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Umar </span>(may Allah be pleased with him) saw some people travel to the tree by which the Companions pledged allegiance to the Prophet (peace be upon him), he orderedthat it be rooted out lest people would idolize it and thus stoop to worshipping it besides Allah. The Muslims thanked him for doing so and considered this as one of his commendable acts (may Allah be pleased with him).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Moreover, if reviving these monuments or visiting them were a lawful act, the Prophet (peace be upon him) would have done so in</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Makkah </span><span style="color:#000000;">and after the Hijrah (Prophet&#8217;s migration to Madinah) or ordered people to do so, or his Companions would have either done so themselves or recommended others to do it, knowing that it has been previously mentioned that they were the most knowledgeable among people of the Law of Allah, the most loved by the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), and the best to give advice to the servants of Allah. It has not been proven that he (peace be upon him) or his Companions visited Hira&#8217; Cave when they were in</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Makkah </span><span style="color:#000000;">or in</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Thawr Cave. </span><span style="color:#000000;">They did not even do so during the `Umrah (lesser pilgrimage), the Year of Conquest, or the Farewell Pilgrimage. Besides, they did not go to the place of the two tents of</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Um Ma`bad </span><span style="color:#000000;">or the place of the tree of the pledge. Therefore, it became known that visiting these places, and paving the roads which lead to them is a newly-invented practice (in religion), which has no basis in the Law of Allah, and is among the gravest things that lead to major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship that takes the Muslim out of Islam). Since establishing buildings on graves and using them as Masjids (mosques) is one of the gravest matters that lead to Shirk, the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade it, and he cursed the Jews and Christians for making the graves of their prophets places of worship, informing us that anyone who does so is the most evil of creatures.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">It was authentically reported in Sahih</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Muslim </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be merciful to him) on the authority of</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Jundub ibn `Abdullah Al-Bajaly </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;" name="Bewareofthosewhoprecededyou"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="10699" class="tip"></span>Beware of those who preceded you and used to take the graves of their prophets and righteous men as Masjids.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">In addition, the perfect Shari`ah has indicated the obligation of blocking all verbal and practical means leading to Shirk, and scholars corroborated this with countless proofs. Among these proofs, the scholar</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Ibn Al-Qayyim </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be merciful to him) mentioned in his book [I`lam Al-Muwaqi`in] ninety-nine proofs, all of which prove the obligation of blocking all the means leading to Shirk or to sins. Such proofs include Allah&#8217;s saying:</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-An&#096;am, 6: 108" target="_blank" name="Andinsultnotthosewhomthey"></a>And insult not those whom they (disbelievers) worship besides Allâh, lest they insult Allâh wrongfully without knowledge.</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> And the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him): </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;" name="NoSalah(Prayer)istobeoffered"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="24568" class="tip"></span>No Salah (Prayer) is to be offered after the Subh (Morning Prayer) until the sun rises, and no Salah is to be offered after `Asr (Afternoon Prayer) until the sun sets.</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> This is meant to block the means leading to worship of the sun instead of Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">It is also meant to prevent imitation of those who do such acts. Another mentioned proof is that the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade building Masjids over graves, and cursed those who do so. He (peace be upon him) also forbade the plastering of the graves, venerating them, and taking them as places of worship. Moreover, he forbade facing it in Salah or offering Salah there. Likewise, he (peace be upon him) ordered leveling them (to ground), and forbade that people light lamps on them or travel to them, so that this would not be a pretext to taking them as idols or associating them with Allah in worship. Indeed, this is deemed forbidden for all people, those who idolize them and those who do not mean to do so, in order to block the means leading evil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">What is Wajib for the Muslim scholars and governors is to follow in the footsteps of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) in this and other matters. They are also obliged to forbid whatever the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) forbade, and to prevent anything which could lead to Shirk, mischief, sin or idolization of the prophets and the Awliya&#8217; in order to protect Tawhid (monotheism) and block the means leading to Shirk. We ask Allah to mend the affairs of Muslims and grant them comprehension of the religion, and to guide Muslim scholars and governors to that which will bring about their prosperity and salvation in this world and the hereafter. We also ask Allah to guide the Muslim to act upon the Law of Allah in all affairs, and to place all Muslims on His Straight Path. Indeed, He is the Patron, Capable of all things. May the Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon His Servant and His Messenger, our Prophet Muhammad, and his family and Companions and those who uprightly follow his guidance until the Day of Judgment.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">From the excellent book (published by al-ibaanah) <strong><em>The Rules and Etiquettes of Ruqya</em></strong>, by Shaikh Saalih Aalush-Shaikh p.37-39 </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">“When Shaikh Abdullah Al-Qar’aawee<a style="color:#b85b5a;" href="http://us.mg4.mail.yahoo.com/dc/blank.html?bn=397.8&amp;.intl=us&amp;.lang=en-US#sdfootnote1sym" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" name="sdfootnote1anc"></a><sup>1</sup> came to our region, many people were suffering from illnesses; they were bed-ridden and couldn’t get up. And what was this due to? It was due to the Jinn and so on and so forth. They would go out and come across the Jinn at night in trees and upon the roads and so on, and the devils would take over them. This is because they were ignorant. They didn’t have any understanding of Tawheed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">So when he (i.e. Shaikh Al-Qar’aawee) came and spread Tawheed<strong>, </strong>not ruqyah or anything else, may Allah bless you, all of these things came to an end. All of these (possessions and illnesses) came to an end once Tawheed and knowledge spread. When Tawheed and knowledge spread, these things go away and come to an end. And when ignorance becomes widespread, sorcerers, soothsayers, devils and so on increase and cooperate with one another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I advised him to do as the good doers in the past did, which was to call to Tawheed and wage war against shirk and false superstitions such that the devils left them and they had no need for people to perform ruqyah on them from devils, sorcerers or anyone else….”</p>
<div id="sdfootnote1">
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]<strong>Translator’s Note:</strong>Shaikh Abdullah Al-Qar’aawee was born in 1315H in Saudi Arabia where he played a great role in reviving the call to Islaam, particularly in its southern regions, making Saamitah the center of his efforts. He studied under such Scholars as Shaikh Muhammad bin Ibtaheem, the former muftee of Saudi Arabia, and produced students of his own such as Shaikh Haafidh Al-Hakamee. He passed away in 1389H, may Allah have mercy on him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Warning against building Masjids over graves</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span id="ctl00_RedirectContronl1_lblTitle">Fatwas of Ibn Baz :</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">I was asked: Is it permissible to build a Masjid over the site of the People of the Cave? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allah, all praise be to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have read the article published in the third edition of the Islamic Sciences League magazine in the &#8220;Muslim News in a Month&#8221; section.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><span style="color:#808000;">The Islamic Sciences League, in<span id="ContentParagraph"> The Hashemite Kingdom of <strong>Jordan</strong>, </span>intends to build a Masjid over the site of the cave recently discovered in<span id="ContentParagraph"> the village of Al-Rahib, </span>which is said to be the cave where <span id="ContentParagraph">the People of the Cave </span>mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an slept</span>.</span> End Quote.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As it is my duty to advise for the sake of Allah and His servants, I thought it would be beneficial to say a word in the same magazine of the Islamic Sciences League published in<span id="ContentParagraph"> the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. </span>I must <strong>admonish</strong> the league to give up the intention of building a Masjid over the site of this cave, mainly and solely for the reason that <strong><span style="color:#000000;">building Masjids over the graves and remains of the Prophets and righteous people is utterly forbidden by the Shari`ah (Islamic law) and that those who do so are cursed</span></strong>. This is because such an act <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>may lead to Shirk</strong></span> (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and <strong><span style="color:#000000;">excessive veneration and over praising of the prophets and pious people</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reality bears witness to the validity of the texts of the Shari`ah and proves that it is revealed from Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He), and provides decisive proof of the truthfulness of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and the message sent down to him which he conveyed to the Ummah (nation). <span style="color:#ff6600;">Whoever is aware of the conditions that exist in the Islamic world and the acts of Shirk, excessive reverence of prophets and the pious that prevail due to establishing Masjids over shrines and glorifying them by means of lavish structures and the presence of custodians to collect money from people unlawfully, will certainly know that they are avenues leading to Shirk</span>. One of the outstanding virtues of Shari`ah is to forbid building of Masjids over graves and to warn sternly against it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Two Shaykhs,<span id="ContentParagraph"> Al-Bukhari </span>and<span id="ContentParagraph"> Muslim </span>(may Allah be merciful to them), narrated some Hadiths to this effect on the authority of<span id="ContentParagraph"> `Aishah </span>(may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a name="MayAllahcursetheJewsandthe"></a><span style="color:#339966;"><span id="ContentParagraph">May Allah curse the Jews and the Christians; they have taken the graves of their prophets as places of worship</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph">`Aishah </span>(may Allah be pleased with her) said: <span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;</span><span style="color:#339966;">He warned against what they did and had it not been for this, his grave would have been raised above the ground but he feared that it would be taken as a Masjid</span><span style="color:#000000;">.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim that <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a name="UmSalamahandUmHabibah(may"></a><span id="ContentParagraph"> </span><span id="ContentParagraph" style="color:#339966;">Um Salamah and Um Habibah (may Allah be pleased with them) mentioned a church they had seen in Abyssinia (Ethiopia) in which there were pictures. When they told the Prophet (peace be upon him) of this, he said, &#8216;When a pious person among these people died they built a place of worship over his grave and painted these pictures therein. They will be the worst of creation in the Sight of Allah</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is related in Sahih<span id="ContentParagraph"> Muslim </span>on the authority of<span id="ContentParagraph"> Jundub ibn `Abdullah </span>(may Allah be pleased with him) that he heard the Prophet (peace be upon him) five days before his death, stating: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a name="IstandfreeofblamebeforeAllah"></a><span style="color:#339966;"><span id="ContentParagraph"></span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Hadiths in this regard. Imams of Muslim scholars from the four Madh-habs (Schools of Jurisprudence) and others have stated the prohibition of building Masjids over graves. They issued the sternest warning against doing so, urging Muslims to observe the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and advising this Ummah lest it should fall into the same excessiveness and veneration of the prophets and pious people the way its predecessors from the extremist<span id="ContentParagraph"> Jews </span>and<span id="ContentParagraph"> Christians </span>and their like who deviated from the straight path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, it is incumbent upon the Islamic Sciences League in<span id="ContentParagraph"> Jordan </span>and Muslims to adhere to the Sunnah and the way of the righteous Imams, and to be cautious not to commit what Allah and His Messenger warned against. It is the only way that leads to people&#8217;s uprightness and happiness in this world and in the Hereafter. <span style="color:#ff6600;">It should be noted that some people formed their opinions based on the misinterpretation of Allah&#8217;s Statement in the story<span id="ContentParagraph"> of the People of the Cave: </span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Kahf, 18: 21" target="_blank" name="AndthusWemadetheircaseknown"></a>(then) those who won their point said (most probably the disbelievers): “We verily shall build a place of worship over them.”<img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer to this is that Allah (Praised and Exalted be He) informed us about the rulers and prominent people who announced this statement. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He told their story not by of expressing content and agreement with what they said, but rather as a kind of dispraise and expressing abhorrence of their action</strong></span>. This is even indicated by the Messenger (peace be upon him) to whom this Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse) was revealed and was the most knowledgeable of its interpretation, for he forbade his Ummah from building Masjids over the graves and cursed and dispraised those who do so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this had been permissible, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) would not have strongly affirmed its prohibition to the extent of cursing those who did it, or describing them as the worst creatures in the Sight of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He). This should be sufficient in pointing out the gravity implied in the matter and providing a convincing answer to those who seek the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Even if we supposed that building Masjids over graves was permissible for those who preceded us, still we are not permitted to follow their example because the Shari`ah (Islamic law) abrogates all previous laws, and our Prophet (peace be upon him) is the Last of the Messengers and the Shari`ah revealed to him is comprehensive</strong>. He (peace be upon him) forbade building Masjids over graves, and as such, we are not permitted to disobey him. We must follow his example and adhere to his Sunnah and abandon what contradicts it regarding the previous Shari`ahs (Divine laws) and favorable customs followed by some people, because Allah&#8217;s Shari`ah is perfect and comprehensive and no guidance is better than that of the Prophet (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah is the One Whom we invoke to grant all Muslims and us success and to keep us firm on the truth and help us adhere to the Sunnah of His Messenger, Muhammad (peace be upon him) in words and deeds, whether manifested or hidden, and in all our daily affairs until we meet Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He). Allah is the All-Hearer, Ever-Near and Responsive. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions and those who follow his guidance until the Day of Resurrection.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Origins of Shirk [1]<br />
Al-Ibaanah Magazine , Issue No.3 &#8211; Dhul-Qa’dah 1416H / April 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From that which has been established in the Sharee&#8217;ah (prescribed law) is that mankind was &#8211; in the beginning &#8211; a single nation upn true Tawheed, then Shirk (directing any part or form of worship, or anything else that is solely the right of Allaah, to other than Allaah) gradually overcame them. The basis for this is the saying of Allaah &#8211; the Most Blessed, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;Mankind was one Ummah, then Allaah sent prophets bringing good news and warnings.&#8221;</strong> (Soorah Baqarah 2:213)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbaas &#8211; radiallaahu &#8216;anhu &#8211; said: &#8220;Between Nooh (Noah) and Adam were ten generations, all of them were upon Sharee&#8217;ah (law) of the truth, then they differed. So Allaah sent prophets as bringers of good news and as warners.&#8221; [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Urwah al-Hanbalee (d.837 H) said: &#8220;This saying refutes those historians from the People of the Book who claim that Qaabil (Cain) and his sons were fire-worshippers.&#8221; [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: In it is also a refutation of some of the philosophers and atheists who claim that the (natural) basis of man is Shirk, and that Tawheed evolved in man! The preceeding aayah (verse) falsifies this claim, as do the two following authentic hadith:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Firstly: His (the prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) saying that he related from his Lord (Allaah) : <em> &#8220;I created all my servants upon the true Religion (upon Tawheed, free from Shirk). Then the devils came to them and led them astray from their true Religion. They made unlawful to people that which I had made lawful for them, and they commanded them to associate in worship with Me, that which I had sent down no authority.&#8221;</em> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Secondly: His (the prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) saying: <em> &#8220;Every child is born upon the Fitrah [5] but his parents make him a jew or a christian or a magian. It is like the way an animal gives birth to a natural offspring. have you noticed any born mutilated, before you mutilate them.&#8221; </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah said: Recite if you wish: <strong> &#8220;Allaah&#8217;s fitrah with which He created mankind. There is to be no change to the creation (Religion) of Allaah.&#8221;</strong> (Soorah ar-Rum 30:30) [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After this clear explanation, it is of the upmost importance for the Muslim to know how Shirk spread amongst the believers, after they were muwahhideen (people upon Tawheed). Concerning the saying of Allaah &#8211; the most perfect &#8211; about the people of Nooh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;And they have said : You shall not forsake your gods, nor shall you forsake Wadd, nor Suwaa&#8217;, nor Yaghooth, nor Ya&#8217;ooq, nor Nasr.&#8221;</strong> (Soorah Nooh 71:23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been related by a group from the Salaf (Pious Predecessors), in many narrations, that these five deities were righteous worshippers. However, when they died, Shaytaan (Satan) whispered into their people to retreat and sit at their graves. Then Shaytaan whispered to those who came after them that they should take them as idols, beautifying to them the idea that you will be reminded of them and thereby follow them in righteous conduct. Then Shaytaan suggested to the third generation that they should worship these idols besides Allaah &#8211; the most high &#8211; and he whispered to them that this is what their forefathers used to do!!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah sent to them Nooh alayhis-salaam, commanding them to worship Allaah alone. However none responded to hiscall except a few. Allaah &#8211; the mighty and majestic &#8211; related this whole incident in Soorah Nooh Ibn &#8216;Abbas relates: &#8220;Indeed these five names of righteous men from the people of Nooh. When they died Shataan whispered to their people to make statues of them and to place these statues in their places of gathering as a reminder of them, so they did this. However, none from amongst them worshipped these statues, until when they died and the purpose of the statues was forgotten. Then (the next generation) began to worship them.&#8221;[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The likes of this has also been related by Ibn Jareer at-Tabaree and others, from a number of the salaf (Pious Predecessors) &#8211; radiallaahu &#8216;anhum. In ad-Durral-Manthoor (6/269): &#8216;Abdullaah ibn Humaid relates from Abu Muttahar, who said: Yazeed ibn al-Muhallab was mentioned to Abu Ja&#8217;far al-Baaqir (d.11H), so he said: He was killed at the place where another besides Allaah was first worshipped. Then he mentioned Wadd and said: &#8220;Wadd was a Muslim man who was loved by his people. When he died, the people began to gather around his grave in the land of Baabil ( Babel ), lamenting and mourning. So when Iblees (Satan) saw them mourning and lamenting over him, he took the form of a man and came to them, saying : I see that you are mourning and lamenting over him. So why don&#8217;t you make a picture of him (i.e. a statue) and place it in your places of gatherings so that you maybe reminded of him. So they said: Yes, and they made a picture of him and put in their place of gathering; which reminded them of him. When Iblees saw how they were (excessively) remembering him, he said : &#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t every man amongst you make a similar picture to keep in your own houses, so that you can be (constantly) reminded of him.&#8221; So they all said &#8220;yes&#8221;. So each household made a picture of him, which they adored and venerated and which constantly reminded them of him. Abu Ja&#8217;far said: &#8220;Those from the later generation saw what the (pevious generation) had done and considered that&#8230;&#8230;..to the extent that they took him as an ilah (diety) to be worshipped besides Allaah. He then said :&#8221; This was the first idol worshipped other than Allaah, and they called this idol Wadd&#8221;[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus the wisdom of Allaah &#8211; the Blessed, the Most High &#8211; was fufilled, when he sent Muhammed sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam as the final prophet and made his Sharee&#8217;ah the completion of all divinely Prescribed Laws, in that He prohibited all means and avenues by which people may fall into Shirk &#8211; which is the greatest of sins. For this reason, building shrines over graves and intending to specifically travel to them, taking them as places of festivity and gathering and swearing an oath by the inmate of a grave; have all been prohibited. All of these lead to excessiveness and lead to the worship of other than Allaah &#8211; the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This being the case even more so in an age in which knowledge is diminishing, ignorance is increasing, thre are few sincere advisors ( to the truth) and shaytaan is co-operating with men and jinn to misguide mankind and to take them away from the worship of Allaah alone &#8211; the Blessed, the Most High.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Al-Istiqaamah Magazine, Issue No.7</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><b>[1]: MAN&#8217;S FITRAH (NATURAL DISPOSITION)</b></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is essential to know is that: &#8220;Allaah created the creation in order that they should worship Him. Furthermore, Allaah prepared for them &#8211; from His Provision &#8211; all that they would require. About this Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;I did not create jinn and mankind, except that they should worship Me. I do not seek any provisions from them, nor do I ask that they should feed me. Indeed Allaah is the Provider, the Possessor of Might and Strength.&#8221; </b>[Soorah adh-Dhaariyaat 51:56-58].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the soul &#8211; if left to its <i>Fitrah</i> (natural disposition and inclination) &#8211; would find itself acknowledging Allaah&#8217;s Divinity, loving Him and worshiping Him alone, without worshipping others along with Him. However, this <i>fitrah</i> becomes corrupted and it deviates away from the pure worship of Allaah, due to what the devils &#8211; from amongst mankind and jinn &#8211; whisper to some people, beautifying to them their whispers of deception. So Tawheed (to worship Allaah alone) is the core and root of man&#8217;s <i>fitrah</i>, whereas Shirk (directing any part of worship that belongs only to Allaah, to other than Allaah) is alien to it and is something that deceptively enters into it. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;So set your face to the <i>Haneef</i> Religion (the Religion of pure Tawheed), This is the <i>fitrah</i> of Allaah which He created mankind upon. There is to be no change in the creation (i.e, Religion) of Allaah. That is the straight and upright Religion. But most of mankind do not have knowledge.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Room 30:30].&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above Aayah (Verse) clearly refutes the false notion of the atheists; who claim that the natural basis of man is Shirk, and that Tawheed evolved in man! Not only does the previous Aayah refutes this falsehood, but so do the following two authentic narrations:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Firstly</b>: Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said, that his Lord said: <i>&#8220;I created all My Servants upon the true Religion (upon Tawheed, free from Shirk). Then the devils come to them end led them astray from their true Religion. They made unlawful to people that which I had mode lawful for them, and they commended them to associate in worship with Me, that for which I had sent down no authority.&#8221;</i>4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Secondly</b>: Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Every child is born upon the Fitrah (i.e. Islaam), but his parents make him a jew or a christian or a magian. It is like the way on animal gives birth to a natural offspring. Have you noticed any born mutilated, before you mutilate them.&#8221;</i> Abu Hurayrah said: Recite if you wish: <b>&#8220;Allaah&#8217;s fitrah with which He created mankind. There is to be no change to the creation (Religion) of Allaah.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Room 30:30].&#8221;3</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><b>[2]: THE BEGINNING OF IDOL-WORSHIP</b></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mankind was, in the beginning, a single Ummah (nation) upon <i>Tawheed</i>, the pure worship of Allaah alone. Then <i>Shirk</i> gradually overcame them. The basis for this belief is what Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Mankind was one Ummah (nation), then Allaah sent Prophets bringing good news and warnings.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:213].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Mankind was not except a single Ummah, then they differed.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Yoonus 12. 19].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbaas <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> said:<br />
&#8220;Between Noah and Aadam there were ten generations, all of them were upon the <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i> (Law) of the truth, then they differed. So Allaah sent Prophets as bringers of good news and as warners.&#8221;4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So: &#8220;During the time of the Prophet Noah<i> &#8216;alayhis-salaam</i>, <i>Shirk</i> appeared amongst his people, and they started worshipping idols along with worshipping Allaah. So Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>Indeed We sent Noah<i> &#8216;alayhis-salaam</i> to his people and he said to them: I have come to you as a clear warner; that you should worship only Allaah.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Hood 1 1:25-26].&#8221;5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After this clear explanation, it is of the utmost importance for the Muslims to know exactly how <i>Shirk</i> spread amongst the Believers, after they were people upon pure <i>Tawheed</i>?</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><b>[3]: THE ORIGINS OF SHIRK</b></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said about the people of Noah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And they said: You shall not forsake your</b> <b>deities / gods, nor shall you forsake Wadd, nor Suwaa&#8217;, nor Yaghooth, nor Ya&#8217;ooq, nor Nasr.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Nooh 71:23].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbaas <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> relates:<br />
&#8220;These were all idols from Noah&#8217;s nation, which eventually ended up amongst the Arabs. <i>Wadd</i> was the idol which was worshipped by the Kalb tribe in the region of Dawmatul-Jandal; <i>Suwaa&#8217;</i> was for the Hudhayl tribe; <i>Yaghooth</i> by the Ghutayf tribe at Jurf near the region of Sabaa; <i>Ya&#8217;ooq</i> for the Hamdaan tribe and <i>Nasr</i> was the idol worshipped by the Dhul-Kalaa of the Himayr tribe. <b>Indeed these five idols were the names of righteous men from the nation of Noah. When they died Shaytaan whispered to their people to make statues of them in honour of them, and to place these statues in their places of gathering as a reminder of them, so they did this. However, none from amongst them worshipped these statues, until when that generation passed away and the purpose of the statues was forgotten, the next generation then began worshipping them.</b>&#8220;6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad ibn Qays <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> said:<br />
&#8220;<i>Yaghooth</i>, <i>Ya&#8217;ooq</i> and <i>Nasr</i> were a group of righteous men, who were taken as examples to be followed by their people. So when they died their companions said: If we were to make pictures of them it would encourage us to do acts of worship and obedience to Allaah (as they did). So they made pictures of them. However, when they died and the next generation came, Shaytaan whispered to them saying: Your fore-fathers used to worship these righteous men, and it was due to them that it rained. So they began to worship them.&#8221;7</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the beginnings of Shirk lay in the excessive praise and respect given to certain dead pious Muslims, who &#8211; due to peoples&#8217; love for them &#8211; became idols that were worshipped and supplicated along with Allaah. So what needs to be understood is why people felt that they had to worship these righteous people along with worshipping Allaah.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><b>[4]: TAKING THE DEAD AS INTERCESSORS</b></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed We have sent down to you the Book in truth, so worship Allaah alone by making the Religion purely for Him. Surely the Religion, worship and obedience should be for Allaah alone. But those who take as <i>awliyaa</i> (friends and protectors) others along with Allaah say: We only worship them so that they may bring us closer to Allaah. Indeed Allaah will judge between them concerning that in which they differ. Indeed Allaah does not guide those who are liars and disbelievers.&#8221;</b> [Soorah az-Zumar 39:2-3].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And they worship those besides Allaah that can neither harm nor benefit them, and they say: These are our intercessors with Allaah. Say to them: Do you inform Allaah about that which He does not have knowledge in the heavens and the earth. Glory be to Allaah and how free He is from that which the associate as partners with Him.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Yoosuf 10:18].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;So Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; informed us in these two <i>Aayaat</i> (Verses) that the <i>mushriks</i> had taken others from the creation as <i>awliyaa</i> along with Allaah. They worshipped them along with Him, by offering <i>du&#8217;aa</i> (supplication) to them, and directing to them hope (of attaining safety or of being cured from some illness) and fear, sacrifice, vows, and their like claiming that directing such worship to these <i>awliyaa</i> would bring them closer to Allaah and that these <i>awliyaa</i> would then act as intercessors between them and Allaah. Yet Allaah &#8211; the the Most Perfect &#8211; rejected such claims and made clear its falseness and labeled those who claimed such a thing as being liars and disbelievers!&#8221;8</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Thus it should be clear to all who have intellect, that the cause of disbelief of the earlier <i>kuffaar</i> (disbelievers) was due to them taking the Prophets, <i>awliyaa</i>, trees, stones and other things from the creation, as intercessors between them and Allaah, believing that such intercessors would fulfill for them their needs and aspirations, without any permission from Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; nor His approval. They considered it to be similar to how ministers and advisors intercede on behalf of the people with the worldly kings. So they made a (false) analogy between Allaah &#8211; the Most Majestic &#8211; and the worldly kings and leaders, saying: lust as a person who wishes to present his needs to a king has to go through the king&#8217;s advisors and ministers, then likewise we draw closer to Allaah by making <i>du&#8217;aa</i> (supplication) to the Prophets and the <i>awliyaa</i>; taking them as intercessors between us and Allaah. However, this analogy is the height of futility and falsehood. Since Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects &#8211; has none that is comparable to Him, nor can analogies be made between Him and His creation. Indeed no one intercedes for His creation, except with His permission. and none will be granted <i>shafaa&#8217;a</i> (intercession), except the people of <i>Tawheed</i>. For Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; has knowledge and power over all things, and is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy. He does not fear anyone, nor is frightened by anyone, since He &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; has power and dominion over His slaves and disposes of their affairs as He Wills. This is contrary to the earthly kings and leaders, for they do not have power over everything, nor do they have knowledge about everything. This is why they are dependant upon advisers, ministers and armies to assist them in matters which they, by themselves, are unable to do. They are also in need of being informed about those who are in need, which is another reason for their being surrounded by ministers and advisors. But the Lord &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic, the One free from all defects and shortcomings &#8211; is free from any type of need or assistance from any of His creation. He is more merciful to them that their mothers and He is the Most Just. And according to His Wisdom, Knowledge and Power, He places all things in their proper place. It is therefore not permissible to compare Allaah with His creation in this manner.&#8221;9</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><b>[5]: DU&#8217;AA TO OTHER THAN ALLAAH IS SHIRK</b></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said:<br />
&#8220;Whosoever dies whilst making <i>du&#8217;aa</i> (invocation, supplication) to others besides Allaah, will enter the HellFire.&#8221;10</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><b>[6]: A PROOF FROM THE COMPANIONS</b></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> related:<br />
&#8220;In times of drought, &#8216;Umar ibn al-Khattaab <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> used to ask &#8216;Abbaas ibn &#8216;Abdul-Muttalib to pray for rain on their behalf. He himself would say: &#8220;O Allaah we used to ask Your Prophet to supplicate on our behalf to You, and You would bless us with rain. Now we ask the uncle of our Prophet to supplicate to You on our behalf, so bless us with rain.&#8221; Anas said: So they would be blessed with rain.&#8221;11</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sulaym ibn &#8216;Aamir al-Khabaairee relates:<br />
&#8220;That the sky withheld all rain, so Mu&#8217;aawiyah ibn Abee Sufyaan went out to pray for rain along with the people of Damascus. So when Mu&#8217;aawiyah sat upon the pulpit he said: &#8220;Where is Yazeed ibn al-Aswad al-Jurashee?&#8221; So the people called him and he came stepping between the people. Then Mu&#8217;aawiyah commanded him, so he ascended the pulpit and sat at his feet. Then Mu&#8217;aawiyah said: &#8220;O Allaah! Today we are asking the best and most noblest amongst us to supplicate to You for us. O Allaah, today we put Yazeed ibn al-Aswad al-Jurashee forward to supplicate to You for us. O Yazeed! Raise up your hands to Allaah.&#8221; So he raised up his hands and the people raised up their hands. Then rain-clouds, like large shields, came quickly from the west, and the winds blew, and it rained so much that people could hardly reach their houses.&#8221;12</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So why didn&#8217;t &#8216;Umar <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> and the rest of the Companions who were with him, go to the grave of our beloved Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>; or to the grave of the greatest of the <i>awliyaa</i> Abu Bakr <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i>, and make <i>du&#8217;aa</i> (supplication) to them for rain? Why? Because they knew that doing so would constitute <i>shirk</i>? Likewise, why didn&#8217;t Mu&#8217;aawiyah, and those of the righteous people with him, not delegate someone to go to Madeenah &#8211; to the grave of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, or any of the Companions buried there &#8211; or directly make <i>du&#8217;aa</i> to them from Damascus, in their time of distress and great need? Why? Because they knew that doing so would constitute <i>shirk</i>!</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><b>[7]: SOME POINTS OF BENEFIT</b></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Firstly</b>: That <i>Shirk</i> began during the time of Noah &#8216;alayhis-salaam, due to the excessive love and veneration that the people had for certain dead pious Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Qurtubee (d.654H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said: &#8220;The initial images that were made of these righteous men were done in order that the people could be reminded about their righteousness and so strive in being righteous; as they strove. So they worshipped Allaah by the graves of these righteous men. Then a people came after them who forgot the intent of their fore-fathers&#8217; actions. So Shaytaan whispered to them saying: Your fore-fathers used to worship these images and held them in great veneration.&#8221;13</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Secondly</b>: &#8220;That Shaytaan is eager to misguide mankind and to plot against them. He comes from the angle of exploiting man&#8217;s emotions, and lures them into doing acts that are (apparently) good. Thus, when Shaytaan saw amongst the people of Noah their great love and esteem for the righteous, he tricked them into going beyond the bounds in their love, and he got them to make and place statues of these dead pious Muslims in their places of gatherings. The objective of this was to make them swerve away from the right path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Thirdly</b>: That Shaytaan does not only observe the present generation, and seek to deceive only them; but he also wishes to misguide and deceive future generations. Thus, when he could not plunge the present generation, from the people of Noah, into Shirk, he eagerly awaited the next generation&#8217;s arrival, in order that he could misguide them.&#8221;14</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Fourthly</b>: That the worshipping of dead pious Muslims continues to be practiced amongst the <i>Ummah</i> even today. The difference being is that the names have changed. Thus, instead of worshipping <i>Wadd</i>, or <i>Yaghooth</i>, or <i>Ya&#8217;ooq</i>; people have instead directed the same practices of <i>Shirk</i> &#8211; like supplicating directly to the pious dead, and taking them as intercessors between them and Allaah &#8211; to others; such as to Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-Qaadir al-Jeelaanee in Iraaq, or al-Baydaawee in Eygypt, or Chishtee in India, etc. However, changing the name of a thing, does not change its reality.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5;"><strong>Question</strong>:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ud, may Allaah be pleased with him, said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) say: <em>Verily, incantations, amulets and Tiwalah are Shirk</em>. [1] Jabir, may Allaah be pleased with him, said:I had an uncle who used to treat people with incantations for the scorpion&#8217;s sting. When the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) forbade incantations, he came to him and asked him: O Messenger of Allaah, You have forbidden incantations, and I treat those who are stung by scorpions with incantations. He (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: He who can help his brother, let him do so. [2] How do we compromise between the Hadith which forbids, and that which permits? And what is the ruling on wearing an amulet containing Qur&#8217;anic words on the chest of the affected person?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The forbidden formulas for incantations are those containing Shirk, beseeching other than Allaah, or meaningless words. But incantations that are free from such things, are legitimate, and are among the great means of healing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: <span style="color:#008000;">There is no harm in incantations as long as they do not include Shirk.</span> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: <span style="color:#008000;">He who can help his brother, let him do so.</span>[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said: <span style="color:#008000;">No incantation for other than the envious eye or venomous sting.</span> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means the most affective and beneficial incantation is that which is used in these two cases. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) was himself treated with incantation, and he treated others with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for wearing <strong>amulets</strong> by children and patients, it is not permissible. Such are called <strong>trinkets</strong>. But the most valid opinion is that they are a form of Shirk, and unlawful, because the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: <span style="color:#008000;">He who wears an amulet; may Allaah not help him, and he who wears a shell; may Allaah not protect him.</span> [6] <span style="color:#008000;">He who wears an amulet commits Shirk</span>.[7] And he (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: <span style="color:#008000;">Verily, incantations, amulets and Tiwalah are Shirk.</span> [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars are at variance regarding the legality of wearing <strong>amulets containing Qur&#8217;anic Verses</strong>. The correct verdict is that they are unlawful, for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The general prohibition of wearing any kind of amulets according to the Prophetic traditions whether they contain Qur&#8217;anic Verses or not.</li>
<li>Leaving no room for formulas of Shirk, for if the amulets containing Qur&#8217;anic verses were allowed then they may be confused with the other amulets, and that will keep the door open to Shirk, and all kinds of amulets would be worn on that ground. It is known that closing the door to things that lead to Shirk and evil deeds is one of the greatest judicial objectives. It is Allaah who grants success.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second: Shirk (Shirk of Fear)</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>It is that the slave fears someone other than Allaah, such as the Jinn, a dead person or other than that, as he fears Allaah or greater.</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (ta’laa) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;">Have you not seen those who were told to hold back their hands (from fighting) and perform As-Salât (Iqâmat­as­Salât), and give Zakât, but when the fighting was ordained for them, behold! a section of them fear men as they fear Allâh or even more.</span> <span style="font-family:georgia;">(An-Nisa 4:77)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">It is only Shaitân (Satan) that suggests to you the fear of his Auliyâ&#8217; [supporters and friends (polytheists, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh and in His Messenger, Muhammad SAW)], so fear them not, but fear Me, if you are (true) believers.</span> (Aali Imran 3:175)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And our Lord (subhaana wa ta’laa) says:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;"> Therefore fear not men but fear Me</span> . (Al-Ma&#8217;idah 5:44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Explanation Of The Text By Shaykh Al-Wasaabee</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Explaining the verse in Sooratun-Nisaa’ (4:77), the shaykh mentioned that this verse was revealed concerning a group of Companions, who while they were in Makkah, were weak and oppressed in the land, and were not able to defend themselves and to fight in the path of Allaah (subhaana wa ta’laa). And then the Prophet (peace be upon him ) and His Companions were ordered to make Hijrah to Madeenah. And after they had made Hijrah, Allaah (subhaana wa ta’laa) ordered them to fight the kuffaar. And when this order came to them from Allaah (subhaana wa ta’laa), a group of them fell into association with Allaah (subhaana wa ta’laa) by fearing the people like they fear Allaah, or greater than they fear Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So it is not befitting for the creation of Allaah (subhaana wa ta’laa) to fear those who are like them, those who are also created</strong></span>. Those who are created from dust and clay, and those who are going to return to being clay.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Ibn Rajb (rahimahullaah) said that this is not permissible, and that it is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>not befitting for the people to fear the creation</strong></span> as they fear Allaah (subhaana wa ta’laa). How can they fear the creation when they have been created from clay, and from dust, and verily they are to return back to it. And they are only to fear Allaah (subhaana wa ta’laa), who is the King and Owner of everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Explaining the verse in Soorah Aali Imraan (3:175), the shaykh highlighted the context in which this verse was revealed by mentioning the two verses that precede this verse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (subhaana wa ta’laa) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Those (i.e. believers) unto whom the people (hypocrites) said, &#8220;Verily, the people (pagans) have gathered against you (a great army), therefore, fear them.&#8221; But it (only) increased them in Faith, and they said: &#8220;Allâh (Alone) is Sufficient for us, and He is the Best Disposer of affairs (for us).&#8221;</span> (Aali Imran 3:173)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">So they returned with Grace and Bounty from Allâh. No harm touched them; and they followed the good Pleasure of Allâh. And Allâh is the Owner of Great Bounty.</span> (Aali Imran 3:174)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">It is only Shaitân (Satan) that suggests to you the fear of his Auliyâ&#8217; [supporters and friends (polytheists, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh and in His Messenger, Muhammad (Peace be upon him)], so fear them not, but fear Me, if you are (true) believers.</span> (Aali Imran 3:175)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this verse informs us that the shaytaan tries to push the people to fear his allies. And Shaykh Ahmed mentioned that Allaah (subhaana wa ta’laa) is more entitled to be feared of, as He is the One who has created us, and has brought us from nothing in existence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Explaining the verse is Sooratul-Maa’idah (5:44), the shaykh mentioned again that it is not befitting for someone to fear the people as one fears Allaah (subhaana wa ta’laa).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Q 4: <span style="color:#993300;">Is it true that a person who testifies that Allah is the Creator and Provider,and that Muhammad (peace be upon him) is Allah&#8217;s Messenger, and performs Salah (Prayer) is a Muslim even if they make Sujud (Prostration) to their shaykh and offer sacrifices for people other than Allah?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Making Sujud and sacrificing for anyone other than Allah is Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). People who indulge in any of these practices after being aware of the ruling of doing so, are Mushriks (people who associate others with Allah in worship) and Kafirs (disbelievers). Allah will not accept any of their deeds even if they offer Sawm (Fast) and Salah. Deeds of Mushriks are rejected. Moreover, if they die in this case, Allah will not forgive them.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, Allâh forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah also says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, whosoever sets up partners (in worship) with Allâh, then Allâh has forbidden Paradise to him, and the Fire will be his abode. And for the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers) there are no helpers</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> But if they had joined in worship others with Allâh, all that they used to do would have been of no benefit to them. But if they return to Allah in sincere Tawbah (repentance to Allah) before death, Allah will forgive them</strong>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">as Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Say: “O ‘Ibâdî (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allâh: verily, Allâh forgives all sins</strong><span style="color:#008000;">.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim scholars unanimously agree that this Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse) speaks about repentant people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Ayah of Surah Al-Nissa&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Verily, Allâh forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills</strong> ,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">it speaks about the unrepentant people, namely, those who died in Kufr (disbelief) and sin. May Allah protect us from that.</p>
<p><span style="color:#888888;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shirk in Tawḥīd of Lordship</strong> is to believe that others besides Allah create or share control over his creation. This belief means that someone other than Allah can make good things happen or keep bad things from happening.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One <strong>example</strong> of this type of Shirk is to believe something brings good luck. People often have “good luck” rings or similar items they believe will help good things happen to them. Others tie special strings around them or their children, believing that if they recite the Quran over the strings, they will protect from bad things happening. However, only Allah can protect us from bad things and we should only seek his protection in ways he mentions in the Quran or the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) taught us in the ḥadīth</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Another common example</strong> of Shirk in Tawḥīd of Lordship today is when people believe others like themselves who are created and have no control in Allah’s universe can control what happens. Such people even wait until the ones they believe in are dead before worshipping them by praying to them. The act of praying to dead people is Shirk in Tawḥīd of Worship (which we will cover shortly), but the belief itself is also Shirk in Tawḥīd of Lordship because when people pray to dead people, they believe the souls of humans can control things in this life even after their death. This is completely wrong because the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) told us:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">إِذَا مَاتَ الإِنْاَانُ انْقَطَعَ عَنْهُ عَمَلُهُ إِلاَّ مِنْ ثَلاثَ ة إِلاَّ مِنْ صَدَقَ ة جَارِيَ ة أَوْ عِلْمٍ «<br />
». يُنْتَفَعُ بِهِ أَوْ وَلَ د صَالِحٍ يَدْعُو لَهُ</p>
<p style="text-align:center;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>When a person dies, his actions come to an end except for (receiving rewards for) three things: continuous charity, beneficial knowledge, or a righteous child who prays for him.</em></span><br />
<em>[Recorded by Muslim]</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While a person may still receive rewards from Allah for things he left behind after he died, the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) clearly told us that after death, a human being’s actions stop. So how can dead people control whether good and bad things happen in life when they are not even in life anymore? Still, some people continue to pray to the dead, asking for their help in changing events in this life although only Allah can do this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even if a dead person was a righteous worshipper of Allah, believing that dead people or anyone else controls things in this life is Shirk in Tawḥīd of Lordship.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The questioner asks O shaykh regarding at-tawassul ( a means of seeking nearness to Allaah with certain actions), it&#8217;s types and that is with the supplication of the righteous. </span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At-tawassul is of <strong>two types</strong>; the type that is legislated (allowed) and the type that is forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tawassul which is legislated is</p>
<ol>
<li>tawassul to Allaah by (using) His Names and Qualities or</li>
<li>tawassul by way of righteous actions or</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">tawassul in requesting supplication from a living person (who) is present, that he supplicates for you regarding your affairs; All this is permissible.</li>
</ol>
<p>The tawassul which is forbidden is</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">the tawassul done by the honor the creation, or by his right or by his personality or his uprightness.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the tawaasul which is forbidden. If the one who does so directs anything from worship to the one the tawaasul is made towards, then this is major shirk, just as that which the people of jaahiliyah were upon ( Allaah says) <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;they worship other than Allaah things that will not harm nor benefit them, they say these are our intercessors with Allaah&#8221;</span> (10:18) (also) Just as most of the grave worshippers are upon; those who seek nearness (to Allaah) by way of the deceased with different forms of worship and they say &#8220;these will intercede for us with Allaah&#8221; and this is major shirk!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">We should (truly) be afraid of the reality of shirk since Ibraaheem (`alayhis-salaam) was the Imaam of the monotheists, and he demolished the idols with his hands, yet still feared falling into shirk. If the Imaam of the monotheists, Ibraheem (`alayhis-salaam), feared shirk for his own being, should we not, as average every-day monotheists, be moreso afraid for ours?</p>

<p>Amma ba&#8217;d</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here is a fatwa from the Permanent Committee regarding the game, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Pokemon</strong></span>. In the <strong>question</strong>, many evils of the game including its references to the Shinto religion is mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>

Amma-ba&#8217;d</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Tremendous Advice from Shaikh Rabee&#8217; On The Importance of Reviewing Correct &#8216;Aqeedah &amp; Tawheed, Renewing one&#8217;s Eeman, and fearing Shirk and Hypocrisy! </strong></p>
<p>Shaikh Rabee&#8217; bin Haadee al-Madkhalee (hafidhahullaah Ta&#8217;aala) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Look at the Muslim world today; go to Egypt, or go to Sudan, or go to Pakistan, and you will see incredibly dangerous false practices. In this land of Sa&#8217;udia Arabia, we have eradicated these elevated and venerated graves connected with false worship &#8211; all praise is due to Allaah. However, today many callers make it easy for the people to go to these locations or places of disobedience of Allaah in other countries, while at the same time it is likely that they denounce the emphasis given by others to calling to the worship of Allaah alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oh brother, the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) would from time to time repeatedly call his companions to reaffirm their oath of allegiance to him that they would not associate anything with Allaah in their worship. He had Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar, Ibn Mas&#8217;ood, &#8216;Ubaidah Ibn as-Saamit (radiallaahu &#8216;anhum) and others again make the oath of allegiance to him that they would not associate or join anything else along with the worship of Allaah, as well as that they would establish the prayer, and so forth<span style="color:#888888;"><a href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-1yO" target="_blank"><span style="color:#888888;">.</span></a></span></p>
<p>Why would he reaffirm this oath of allegiance with the likes of Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar?</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Because our correct belief always requires being refreshed, rekindled, and renewed. As this correct belief, it is necessary that we plant it firmly within us as individuals, and among us collectively, and that we be reminded of its place and importance.&#8221; &#8230; </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Rabee&#8217; also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And if there is a caller today who correctly warns the people from this false practice of associating others with Allaah (in worship), the people will say, &#8216;Do you think we are idol worshippers?&#8217; But <span style="color:#993300;">why would the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) himself reaffirm this oath of allegiance with the likes of Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar, that they not associate anything with Allaah in their worship, yet you &#8216;callers&#8217; do not warn from this practice of joining others with Allaah in worship?!</span></p>
<p>Ibraheem (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said [in his du&#8217;aa to Allaah]:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">وَاجْنُبْنِي وَبَنِيَّ أَنْ نَعْبُدَ الأَصْنَامَ<br />
<em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;&#8230;and keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols.&#8221;</span></em> (Ibraaheem, ayah 35)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yes, Ibraaheem &#8211; the father of the Prophets &#8211; and Khaleel-ur-Rahmaan said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">وَاجْنُبْنِي وَبَنِيَّ أَنْ نَعْبُدَ الأَصْنَامَ رَبِّ إِنَّهُنَّ أَضْلَلْنَ كَثِيرا ً مِنَ النَّاسِ فَمَنْ تَبِعَنِي فَإِنَّه ُُ مِنِّي وَمَنْ عَصَانِي فَإِنَّكَ غَفُور ٌ رَحِيم</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;&#8230;and keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols. Oh my Lord! They have indeed led astray many among mankind. But whoso follows me, he verily is of me. And whoso disobeys me &#8211; still You are indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221;</span></em> (Ibraaheem, ayat 35-36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was aware that from among his descendants there would be many Prophets, yet despite this he still feared for them. So how can we consider ourselves safe and secure from this danger?!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><strong>Ya Muqqallib al-Qulloob Thabit Qulubuna &#8216;ala Deenik</strong><br />
</em>(Oh Turner of the hearts, make our hearts steadfast upon Your Religion).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) often made this supplication and taught his companions to say this supplication. Yet many of us today, we possess undeserved confidence that we will not fall into associating others with Allaah, nor fall into hypocrisy.</p>
<p>But the companions feared for themselves hypocrisy. Ibn Abee Malaikah (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;I encountered 30 of the companions of the Prophet Muhammad (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam), and all of them feared for themselves being hypocrites.&#8221;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Rabee&#8217; also said:</div>
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;As such, it is necessary that each of us fears falling into hypocrisy, and fears falling into matters of associating others with Allaah in worship, and fears for our hearts swerving away from the truth. </strong></div>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">رَبَّنَا لاَ تُزِغْ قُلُوبَنَا بَعْدَ إِذْ هَدَيْتَنَا وَهَبْ لَنَا مِنْ لَدُنْكَ رَحْمَة ً إِنَّكَ أَنْتَ الْوَهَّابُ<br />
<em><span style="color:#008000;">(They say): &#8220;Our Lord! Let not our hearts deviate (from the truth) after You have guided us, and grant us mercy from You. Truly, You are the Bestower.&#8221;</span></em> (Aali Imran, ayah 8) and the verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">فَلاَ يَأْمَنُ مَكْرَ اللَّهِ إِلاَّ الْقَوْمُ الْخَاسِرُونَ<br />
<em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;None feels secure from the Plan of Allaah except the people who are the losers.</span></em> (Al-A&#8217;raf, ayah 99)</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>So we have fear for that which might affect the steadfastness and the strength of our Eeman within ourselves.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must make every effort in bringing about the causes for steadfastness, from actions which are obedience to Allaah, from submission and compliance to Allaah, Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;aala, from seeking forgiveness of Allaah, Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;aala, during the day and night by always humbly seeking from Him and beseeching Him to make us firm upon Islaam, and that Allaah guide at our hands those who want the guidance of Allaah, Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;aala.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Rabee&#8217; also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;As for the danger of lying and hypocrisy, we will offer you some thoughts regarding that. Indeed many of the leading personalities of falsehood and misguidance wore the &#8216;garments&#8217; of Islaam, and made an outward show of worship and of striving to rectify affairs, as it is not possible for them to attempt to deceive the people except through adorning themselves in these &#8216;garments&#8217; of Islaam in which they present themselves giving the appearance of righteous Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in any case, if he reveals the characteristic of lying &#8211; even if he stands the night in prayer and fasts during the day &#8211; then that lying is a sign from the signs of hypocrisy. Moreover if he possesses &#8211; in addition to this &#8211; the characteristics of going against his word and excessiveness in his disputes, then clearly he stands as a pure hypocrite, and from this we seek refuge in Allaah.</p>
<p>Just as the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Signs of the hypocrites are three, when he speaks, he lies, when he promises, he breaks his word &#8211; or it is said when he gives a trust he is disloyal to it &#8211; and when he disputes, he goes to extremes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these four characteristics, if he possesses these four, then he is a pure hypocrite. And I say that the first three characteristics are those which are mentioned in the narration of Abu Hurrairah. However, the narration of &#8216;Abdullaah ibn &#8216;Umar mentions four characteristics. In any case, if he possesses all of these mentioned characteristics, then he is a pure hypocrite upon pure hypocrisy. And it may be that in regard to specific individuals, it would be restricted to the hypocrisy of deeds or actions, or it may be the full reality of hypocrisy in one&#8217;s inward belief which then takes him outside of the boundaries of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Previously it has been explained to you that some of the people today consider that the matter of hypocrisy as a reality has &#8216;ended.&#8217; They suppose that hypocrisy was &#8216;only&#8217; in the time of the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), but as for the latter ages, then they are &#8216;free&#8217; from hypocrisy occurring within them. This is clearly from their obvious ignorance and foolishness, and we seek refuge in Allaah from that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As indeed, the most knowledgeable of people regarding the hypocrites was the companion Hudhaifa ibn al-Yamaan (radiallaahu &#8216;anhu), and this companion who was the most knowledgeable of the hypocrites said: The hypocrisy today is worse and more evil than the hypocrisy in the time of the Messenger. They said, &#8216;Why is that?&#8217; He said: Because at that time, the hypocrites strove to conceal their hypocrisy, but as for the people today, they manifest it openly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these individuals openly showed their hypocrisy, and spoke about their shameful affair, in their opposition to the Muslims. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Specifically in the matter of calling to Allaah, the Blessed and the Most High, the one who fights against the call to the truth, engages in deceptions and fabricates things, then it is not something to be considered unlikely that many from among them are true complete hypocrites. And we ask Allaah for health and well being.&#8221;</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">by Rabee’ ibn Haadee al-Madkhalee<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p><strong>The Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">A lot of what we see in certain Masajid is ‘Ya Allaah &amp; Ya Muhammad’ (O Allaah &amp; O Muhammad) written on the Mihrab, is it permissible to pray in the likes of these Masajid?</span></p>
<p><strong>The answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is clear from what we have seen in Pakistan and Afghanistan – with great regret – I swear by Allaah we saw this written in the cars of the Mujahideen; actually those who claim to be Mujahideen! And they would not accept any advice, they would continue upon these aspects of <span style="color:#ff0000;">Shirk</span>! You would see it written in their shops and their Masajid: ‘<span style="color:#ff0000;">Ya Allaah, Ya Ali, Ya Ghawth, Ya Hussain, Ya AbdulQadir, Ya such and such!!</span>’ as well as other aspects of Shirk!</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Seeking aid from other than Allaah is Shirk; by saying ‘Ya Muhammad’, then this is committing Shirk with Allaah (associating partners to Allaah). Muhammad was the Messenger of Allaah, the slave of Allaah and His Messenger –alayhi as-Sallat wa Sallam. Therefore, if one says ‘Ya Allaah and Ya Muhammad’, then that person has made Muhammad as an equal to Allaah Tabaraka wa Ta’ala.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger –alayhi as-Sallat wa Sallam- did not come except to destroy this polytheism, and to rectify the deviated nation and at the head of what they had was committing Shirk (associating) with Allaah -Azza wa Jal. The Messenger came to purify the Dunyaa, the hearts, the minds and intellects from Shirk with Allaah –Azza wa Jal- and the filth connected with Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He –alayhi as-Sallat wa Sallam- taught us pure Tawheed with the texts of the Qur’aan, the texts of the Sunnah and practically implementing them. He –alayhi as-Sallat wa Sallam- ordered us to level the graves, and to destroy idols.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger –alayhi as-Sallat wa Sallam- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Do not undertake journeys except to three Masajid – only these, not to graves, nor any place [for worship] – the Masjid al-Haraam, and this masjid of mine, and Masjid al-Aqsa.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because these Masajid were built by the Prophets for the Tawheed of Allaah having Ikhlaas (Sincerity) of the Deen for Allaah – Azza wa Jal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This action of writing ‘Allaah &amp; Muhammad’ began in al-Madinah – since we know these things we can evaluate it – we knew the plots of the Ahl-ul-Bida’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a man named Siraaj Rahman a colleague of mine in the University and he was from the students of <strong>Abul-Hasan an-Nadawi</strong> – I don’t know whether – I saw this in Kenya or a story had been narrated to him that this had begun to spread in al-Madinah. Anyway, he mentioned that Abul-Hasan an-Nadawi said the statement: ‘Allaah &amp; Muhammad’ and this is disbelief, what they mean by this is that Muhammad is a partner to Allaah –Azza wa Jal; Allaah &amp; Muhammad are equal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah; I testify that there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah and I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah, I testify that there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah and I testify that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger; this is the highest status for this Noble Prophet –alayhi as-Sallat wa Sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Do not over praise me, like the Christians over praised the son of Maryam. Indeed I am a slave of Allaah and His Messenger.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have seen this clearly and I would have waged war against it, and if I saw it in a Masjid I would advise the Imam of the Masjid. Likewise in Masjid al-Qiblatayn – Masjid al-Amoodi -, I spoke to the Imam, but he did not do anything! So I spoke to al-Amoodi who was responsible for the Masjid, and he hastened – may Allaah reward him with goodness- and effaced these things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the Masjid near my home in al-Madina they had written ‘Allaah &amp; Muhammad’ so I advised the Imam and he said: ‘we will change it, we will change it.’ But he kept postponing it and did not change it! There was a good young man present who said: ‘I’ll sort it out.’ Then he went and covered it, and that was the end of that, and all praise be to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One day I was coming from Batthan and entered Madinah and there was a pickup truck in front of me and it had ‘Ya Allaah Ya Muhammad’ written on it in red. So I followed him and he began speeding up, he noticed that I was following him, so he began to speed up even more, so I gave chase and pursued him until we reached Qurban, he stopped his car and got out and said to me: ‘Shall I wipe it off?’ and I hadn’t even spoken to him yet! He knew and felt this is what I was pursuing him about, so I told him ‘Yes, wipe it off.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This confirms that there is a battle going on, the battle of these grave worshipping deviants in the land of Tawheed!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: Is it permissible to hang some of the Du`a&#8217;s (supplications) which are mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet) on the chest of a man or woman as protection for them from the Jinn (creatures created from fire) and devils? [1]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This is not permissible whether it be from the Qur&#8217;an, Sunnah or anything else. This is called <strong>&#8220;Tama&#8217;im (amulets)&#8221;</strong>, &#8220;<strong>Jami`at</strong>&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>Hujub</strong>&#8221; and it is not permitted to wear or hang them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said about this matter: <span style="color:#000000;">&lt;&lt;</span><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Anyone who ties an amulet, may Allah not fulfill his aim; and anyone who ties a seashell, may Allah not give him peace</span></strong><span style="color:#000000;">&gt;&gt;<b> </b>[2]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (peace be upon him) also said:<span style="color:#000000;"> &lt;&lt;<strong>Ruqyahs (recitations for healing or protection), amulets and love-charms are Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship)</strong>&gt;&gt; [3].</span> Ruqyah here is referring to any words recited that are unknown or involve Shirk or Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect), they are absolutely prohibited! All amulets are prohibited, that is, what is written on a paper or parchment and placed in a piece of cloth or a bag and tied to a child or a sick person, these are all forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This prohibition applies even if the amulets are made of Words of the Qur&#8217;an or lawful Du`a&#8217;s, they are still forbidden, because the correct scholarly opinion is that all amulets are absolutely prohibited. However, there is greater prohibition regarding the amulets which are not made using Words of the Qur&#8217;an. The prohibition of the amulets made using the Qur&#8217;an is to close any of the doors which may lead to sin or Shirk, as a Muslim is obliged to stay away from these acts, so that they do not fall into what Allah (Exalted be He) has made Haram (prohibited). Allah has made lawful for His Servants the things which lead to happiness, well-being and protection. He did not make lawful that which will harm them; rather, He made lawful that which will bring well-being and happiness in this life and the Hereafter. Humans are not permitted to introduce a Bid`ah (innovation in religion); hanging these things constitutes a Bid`ah, even if they contain Qur&#8217;an or Hadiths. The Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade the use of amulets and warned those who wear or hang them that Allah will not fulfill their aim; anyone who ties an amulet or a seashell, Allah will not fulfill their aim of wearing them. It is obligatory on every believing man and woman to protect themselves by reciting the Islamic supplications not by hanging them; supplications for recovery and well-being should be made for the sick and the children. Du`a&#8217; for protection should also be made on their behalf before sleeping by saying: <span style="color:#000000;">&lt;&lt;<strong>I seek refuge for you in the Perfect Words of Allah from the evil of what He has created</strong>&gt;&gt; [4]</span>. This is following the example of the Prophet (peace be upon him) because it is reported that: <span style="color:#000000;">&lt;&lt;<strong>The Prophet (peace be upon him) used to seek refuge with Allah for Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn, by saying, &#8216;I seek refuge for you both in the Perfect Words of Allah, from every devil and every poisonous vermin, and from every evil (envious) eye.&#8217;</strong>&gt;&gt; [5]</span> Muslims must accustom themselves to reciting Adhkar (invocations and Remembrances said at certain times on a regular basis) and supplications for refuge and protection, and should seek refuge with Allah, as long as they are a sane adult, before sleeping, when entering and leaving their house etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point is that there is no need to wear amulets. Some scholars have permitted wearing amulets which contain Qur&#8217;an or lawful invocations, and they said: It is a form of Ruqyah (recitation for healing or protection), and since Ruqyah is lawful if it is using the Qur&#8217;an and lawful supplications, an amulet made using the Qur&#8217;an and supplications is also lawful. The answer is that there is a difference between the two; we have evidence that the prophet (peace be upon him) performed Ruqyah and Ruqyah was performed for him. He (peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#000000;">&lt;&lt;<strong>There is nothing wrong with Ruqyah as long as it does not involve any Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship)</strong>.&gt;&gt; [6]</span> This is evidence of the exception of Islamically lawful Ruqyah (i.e., reciting Qur&#8217;an and saying supplications over the sick seeking healing), which is excluded from his saying: <span style="color:#000000;">&lt;&lt;<strong>Ruqyahs (recitations for healing or protection), amulets and love-charms are Shirk</strong>.&gt;&gt;[7]</span> This is based on the fact that the Prophet (peace be upon him) performed Ruqyah and Ruqyah was performed for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No exceptions were made for amulets and there is no evidence that the Prophet (peace be upon him) hung an amulet on anyone; therefore, it is not permissible to regard amulets the same as Ruqyahs; rather, all amulets are absolutely prohibited. Wearing amulets of the Qur&#8217;an and lawful supplications could lead to wearing all other amulets, while being unaware of which is right and which is wrong, and thus opens the door to Shirk and wearing charms. The Shari`ah (Islamic law) has closed all of the doors which may lead to Shirk, and the Hadiths stated regarding amulets are general and the prohibition applies to all. Closing the doors which may lead to Shirk is an obligation, consequently, this entails prohibiting all amulets, even if they contain Qur&#8217;an or lawful invocations. This is to block the means leading to Shirk and act upon the general meaning of the Hadiths, so that the believer grows accustomed to putting their trust in Allah, relying on Him, supplicating to Him, and asking Him to protect them from all evil and relieve them from any distress, and not to rely on an object which they wear around their neck or anywhere else.</p>
<p>The teachings of the Shari`ah sufficiently contain all goodness and well-being, for the young and old, sick and healthy. May Allah grant everyone success and guidance!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Some people commonly give their children names such as `Abdul-Nabiy (the servant of the Prophet), `Abdul-Hussayn (the servant of Al-Hussayn). What is the opinion of your Eminence on such names? Please advise us. May Allah reward you well.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is impermissible to give names indicating servitude to other than Allah (Exalted be He), i.e. it is prohibited to say <span style="color:#ff6600;">`Abdul-Nabiy, `Abd Aly, `Abdul-Hussayn</span> and so on. This is Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect), for such names should be denoting servitude to Allah Alone like `Abdul-Rahman (The Servant of The Most Compassionate), `Abdul-Rahim (The Servant of the Most Merciful), `Abdul-Malik (The Servant of The Sovereign), `Abdul-Quddus (The Servant of The Most Holy) etc. This is the right form of servitude, which is to be declared to None but Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn Hazm</strong> Abu Muhammad said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The widely-known opinion of scholars is to prohibit any name indicating servitude to other than Allah, such as <span style="color:#ff6600;">`Abd `Umar, `Abd Al-Ka`bah</span> and the like with the exception of <span style="color:#ff6600;">`Abdul-Muttalib</span>, as there is disagreement on that. In other words, scholars agree upon prohibiting this. Therefore, it is impermissible to give names showing servitude to other than Allah (Exalted be He) regardless of who the person is. Accordingly, it is impermissible to say: <span style="color:#ff6600;">`Abdul-Hussayn, `Abd `Umar, `Abdul-Nabiy, `Abdul-Ka`bah</span> and the like. Rather, a person should use either names signifying servitude to Allah (Exalted be He) or other names like Salih, Muhammad, Ahmad, Zayd, Khalid, Bakr and the like.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The following notes has been taken from  &#8220;<span style="color:#666699;">More than 1000 Sunan Every Day &amp; Night</span>&#8221; published by Dar-us-Salaam</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">(*)</span> There are two opinions on how this should be pronounced:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) The first opinion is that the word should be pronounced as <span style="color:#ff0000;">Shiraki</span>, which means plots and plans. So, this part of the supplication would read, &#8220;<em>I seek refuge in You from the evil of my soul and from the evil and plans of Shaytaan</em>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) The second opinion, which seems to be the strongest, is that it should be pronounced as <span style="color:#ff0000;">Shirki</span>; this refers to whatever the Shaytaan is calling you towards, in terms of acts of worship, which result in associating partners with Allah. It doesn&#8217;t meant that Shirk is being commited by Shaytaan himself. On the contrary it is the person who commits the shirk in obedienec to Shaytaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For a more detailed explanation, refer to TuhfatAl-Ahwadee, Volume 9, Hadeeth 3452, by Shaykh Muhammad Al-Mubaarakpuri.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">(**)</span> Shaykh Al-Albanee mentioned that the last part,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">..is from another narration is Sunan At-Tirmidhi, narrated by Abdullah bin Ammaar, and is not mentioned as part of this supplication, which is also from Sunan At-Tirmidhee, but narrated by Aboo Hurayrah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Impressions of Shaykh Safiur Rahman Mubarakpooree about Maududi.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A view of Maududi upon which he stood with firmness and the truth is that he laid the foundation for his Jamaat (group, i.e Jamat e islami) upon this view. And presented this view with such strength that even great scholars were influenced by him and they even accepted it, even though they did not enter him Jamaat, but they were influenced by his thoughts and accepted them. When these views came before me, even I was confused for a few days. But after that Allaah Ta&#8217;la opened this matter (mas&#8217;ala) in such a clear way that no type of doubt or confusion remained . Now I will present it before you, then there will be no doubt or confusion for you too Insha&#8217;Allaah. So clearly Allaah Ta&#8217;ala has opened it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The view of Maulana (Maududi) was that if there is continuous following (Ita&#8217;ah) of someone, then this is the worship (Ibadah) of that person .the Muslim is in continuous following (Ita&#8217;ah) of Allaah Ta&#8217;ala and he follow (Ita&#8217;ah) the Prophet SalAllaahu alaihiwasallam because Allaah Ta&#8217;ala ordered to follow him. Thus the following (Ita&#8217;ah) of the Prophet salAllaahu alaihiwasallam is in accordance to the following (Ita&#8217;ah) of Allaah Ta&#8217;ala, therefore when he SalAllaahu alaihiwasallam is followed it is the following of Allaah Ta&#8217;ala and this worship (Ibaadah) becomes the  worship (Ibaadah) of Allaah. Now from here he (Maududi) has raised another problem that if a government does not govern according to the law laid by Allaah Ta&#8217;ala then following that government will be worshipping  that government and this is Shirk. And this is where he (Maududi) took his view of Shirk in Haakimiyyah and presented it strongly, and many a people are busy in it till date. Now I will present its truth before you, I mean t say that books of about a hundered, two hundred, three hundred, four hundred, six hundred and in some cases eight hundred pages have been written by many people on this topic. The matter has been confused in such a way and with such long debates that it becomes difficult to imagine. That is why I present this matter before you in a few clear and firm way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span id="more-2315"></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is Ita&#8217;ah (following) the same as Ibaadah(worship). Or is Ibaadah something else and Ita&#8217;ah something else? Understand this well! To explain it I will present one or two examples before you. A youth of Jamaat-e-Islami came to me and started talking, I was also talking to him. Now he came to his Da&#8217;awah (Call) that Sir(Saheb), this is our Da&#8217;awah. I said: Yes, I know that. He wanted me to accept it so I said Look this Da&#8217;awah (Call) of yours is not Saheeh (right). He asked How is it not right? I said: If this quote of yours is right that if someone follows (Ita&#8217;ah) a government and that government does not govern according to the law laid down by Allaah then this following (Ita&#8217;ah) becomes worship (Ibaadah). If this is right then please do me a favour, go out and watch any muslim on the road, that if he is riding a bicycle on the left hand side of the road (in India vehicles need to keep left- keep left rule&#8217;) then tell him O Brother! do not ride your bicycle this way, it is shirk to ride your bicycle by left side of the road.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now he got violently irritated and asked Maulana (Shaikh) what are you saying ?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: I am saying the same thing you said , I am just showing you the consequences of your da&#8217;awah. He asked How? I said: this government of India.., ..is it&#8217;s governance in accordance to the laws laid down by Allaah or not? He said Its is not, it is being governed without accepting the law of Allaah. Then I said then this following its laws (of the Indian Governement) is Shirk, is&#8217;nt it? He said It will be (Shirk) then I said, The riding of bicycle on the left side is the part of the same law, therefore if someone rides a bicycle on the left side then he is following the government, and you call its following (Ita&#8217;ah) to be worship(Ibaadah). And Ibaadah (worship) of Ghayr Allaah (other than Allaah) is supposed to be shirk, therefore it (this following) becomes Shirk. Now he got extremely worried. He then said Sir (Saheb) now you show me what is right then and what is&#8217;nt right.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said &#8211; Now see Itaa&#8217;ah (following) is something else and Ibaadah(worship) is something else. <span style="color:#0000ff;">It is possible that sometimes a  deed (amal) is Ita&#8217;ah (following) and also Ibadah (worship) but it is also possible that a deed is Ita&#8217;ah but not ibaadah, and it is also possible that a deed is Ibaadah but not Ita&#8217;ah, all of this is possible.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He asked How come?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said You listen I will show you, Ibraheem alaihisalaam came to his people and asked what do you worship? the people said we worship idls and to them we are ever devoted. Now tell me that the idols the people were worshipping were they also following these idols? These idols were unable from the beginning  that they could order to do or not to do something, then these people who were worshipping it does mean worship but does no mean following over here. It must be agreed that these pople were not following but were worshipping.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He agreed to this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now a little more ahead, Allaah ta&#8217;ala has mentioned regarding Christians at many places ( meaning verses) in Al Qura&#8217;an Al Majid. Allah Ta&#8217;ala will ask Eesa alaihisalaam on the day of resurrection  Did you say to men: Worship me and my mother as two gods (Ilaah) besides Alaah so Eesa alaihisalaam will immediately deny this and will say I was a witness over them while I dwelt  amongst them, but when You took me up You were the watcher  over them and You are a Witness to all things:. This way he will deny all knowledge about their actions and will declare himself free from what they used to do. Well, and in the same Al Qura&#8217;an, it is shown regarding the Christians and those who used to worship Eesa alaihisalaam, that these people used to worship such a person who canot give them any gain nor any loss. So it is known that they used to worship Eesa alaihisalaam and Eesa alaihisalaam cannot givem them gain or loss. Now the matter is that, is their worship of Eesa alaihisalaam to be considered his following also? I asked him Their worship is proved, Al Qura&#8217;an also calls this action of theirs as worship. So  the Christians who worship Eesa alaihisalaam  were they also following him?  They were not following Eesa alaihisalam , as Eesa alaihisalaam never ordered them to worship him on the contrary he has ordered them not to worship him. So they were exaggerating in this matter, and instead of following him they were rebelling against him and it was worship. So for worship it is not necessary that the one being worshipped is being followed worship can be done without following and even on the condition of rebellion, will it not be worship?.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the matter which becomes thoroughly clear. Now that it is clear. What must you know? To accept someone&#8217;s orders and put them in action, this is  Ita&#8217;ah(following). And to seek nearness to someone I mean by pleasing him. And his pleasure is  not conditional upon reasons. Then to do something for his pleasure is Iba&#8217;dah (worship). So those people (Christians) used to work for the pleasure of Eesa alaihisalam , therefore this is worship (as they thought this would please him). Yet they were not obedient to him, so this is not Ita&#8217;ah (following). When we pray (offer salaah), we seek Allaah ta&#8217;ala&#8217;s pleasure and nearness in that sense this (Salaah) is worship. And we are acting upon the orders of Allaah in that sense this (salaah) is following. Ita&#8217;ah(following) is in a different meaning and ibaadah (worship) is in a different meaning. Salaah is a single act but it is a combination of both Ibaadah and Ita&#8217;ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now as Maulana Maududi has raised this point that continuous Ita&#8217;ah o f someone is Ibadah. Therefore he says that if a slave lives his life in following Allaah Ta&#8217;ala then the whole life becomes Ibadah. But it is apparent by relying on the view of Al Qura&#8217;an this whole life will not be Ibaadah whatsoever, but will be Ita&#8217;ah of the slave acts upon the orders of Allaah ta&#8217;ala, then he has followed for his whole life and this is worthy of being rewarded for which he will be rewarded (Insha&#8217;Allaah). But it will not be called Ibaadah, This is the right conclusion of meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#ff9900;">T</span><span style="color:#ff9900;">ranslated from urdu to english by brother Sameer ibn Haneef Semna. Urdu post made by brother Tariq Ali in noortv mailing list (which is transcript of speech made by Shaykh SafiurRahman Mubarakpuri rahimahullah).</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>An extract from letter of Shaykh Ibn Baz to Al-Mawdudy rahimahumullah concerning the difference between &#8216;Ibadah (worship) and obedience</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the name of Allah, the most Gracious, the most Merciful</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An extract from my letter I sent to His Excellency Shaykh Abu Al-A`la Al-Mawdudy concerning the difference between `Ibadah (worship) and obedience</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On 2/4//1392 AH, Abu Al-A`la Al-Mawdudy sent me a letter no. 1526, dated 2 Safar, 1392 A.H. explaining his case and Tufayl&#8217;s, his successor in the leadership of Islamic Group. I replied in the same year when I was the president of the Islamic university in Medinah and the following is some of my reply:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some brothers from Milbar living in the country told me that Your Eminence see that `Ibadah is clarified by obedience and that when someone obeys another, he worships him. `Ibadah is also interpreted as enslavement and idolization. Furthermore, Sheikh `Umar ibn Ahmad Al-Millibary, owner of Al-Salsabil Magazine, wrote to me concerning this issue asserting what is mentioned about you and the Group. He sent me a copy of a survey pertaining to this question. You will find an enclosed copy of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This question appears strange for me so I determined to write to you before I receive your letter to know whether these statements which are attributed to you are true. So, please let me know your opinion. I see that obedience has a wider scope than `Ibadah. Every act of `Ibadah a person does in compliance with Allah&#8217;s Shari`ah is seen as obedience, but not every act of obedience to anything other than Allah (may He be Exalted) is seen as `Ibadah. This matter needs more elaboration. Obedience to Allah (may He be Exalted) is seen as `Ibadah when a person seeks to please Him. However, it may be valid or corrupt depending on whether the requirements of `Ibadah are met.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Please tell me in details your view on this question. It adds further explanation that `Ibadah may be denied by when tainted with Shirk as Allah says concerning Mushrik (one who associates others with Allah in His Divinity or worship),(Surah Al-Kafirun, 109: 3) Nor will you worship that which I worship. `Ibadah is negated because of their acts of Shirk. It is known that they worship Allah (may He be Exalted) during times of hardships through showing Tawhid, performing Hajj and `Umrah, offering Sadaqah and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since these acts of `Ibadah are spoiled by Shirk, disbelief in the Hereafter and other kinds of disbelief during times of prosperity, it is permissible to negate the `Ibadah of people who show it. Furthermore, I would like to explain another point. The person who obeys the authorities or rulers in something forbidden by Allah (may He be Exalted) is not seen worshipping them when he does not believe in the permissibility of obedience to anyone in something opposing Allah&#8217;s Shari`ah. They rather obey these rules out of fear of their evils or vain desires while they know that they are sinful. Due to their act of obedience, such persons are sinners, not Mushriks, unless they obey such rulers in matters which involve Shirk. Examples of these matters include striking, killing, and taking someone&#8217;s money unjustly. There are many other examples that come under this heading. I think this view is known by the people of knowledge whose status is below yours. I find it imperative to ask you about this and know your detailed opinion so that I can refute any claim against you and support you with sure knowledge and show the truth concerning the Islamic Group to any one who seeks it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If what is attributed to you is true, we can discuss it thoroughly and examine the problematic issues using the evidence. The truth is the long-sought aim of everyone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah (may He be Exalted) to grant us success to do what pleases Him and to comprehend His Religion and to adhere to it. May Allah purify our hearts and deeds and make the truth our long-sought aim wherever we are, for He is the Most Generous! As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">None of Allah&#8217;s creatures is permitted to enslave any person of the slaves of Allah to other than Him. Therefore, it is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>not permissible</strong></span> to name somebody `Abdul-Fadeel, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>`Abdul-Naby, `Abdul-Rasul, `Abd Aly, `Abdul-Husayn, `Abdul-Zahra&#8217;, Ghulam Ahmad, Ghulam Mustafa</strong></span>, or any other name which implies enslaving a created being to another. This is because such names involve excessive reverence of pious and prominent people, and therefore, impudence against the Right of Allah (Exalted be He),and a means to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and transgression. Moreover, Ibn Hazm narrated the consensus of scholars regarding the prohibition of using names that imply enslaving people to other than Allah (Exalted be He).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Bearing the name &#8220;Ghulam Al-Rasul&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q: In brief, some one was granted Saudi nationality under his name, i.e. ghulamul-Rasul (lit. Servant of the Messenger). However, he does not feel comfortable with this name and wishes to change it unless it is permissible to be called as such.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Apparently, Ghulam according to the dilaect of those who name their children as such means servant. Thus, Ghulamul-Rasul means Servant (worshipper) of the Messenger. It is well-known that names such as Abdul-Rahman (lit. Servant of the Merciful), Abdullah (lit. Servant of Allah) and the like symbolizes the servant&#8217;s attachment to his Lord in the aspects of worship and submissiveness. Accordingly, a Muslim may not be called Servant of the Messenger, or the like, as it entails Shirk (associating others in worship with Allah). Therefore, the one seeking the fatwa must go to the proper authorities to change his name to a valid one.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The following is taken from : Taqwiyat-ul-Iman by Shah Ismail Shaheed (Rahmatullah Alehi)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The acts leading to polytheism:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In difficult times and situations people call upon saints, Prophets, Imam, martyrs, angels and fairies for assistance; make their vows to them, invoke them for the fulfillment of their wishes and even make so-called offerings to them so that their wishes may come true. To avoid ailments, they have no scruples about attributing their sons to those false deities by giving them such <span style="color:#800000;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">names as Abdun-Nabi, Ali Bakhsh, Hussain Bakhsh, Peer Bakhsh, Madar Bakhsh, Salar Bakhsh, Ghulam Muhiuddin and Ghulam Moinuddin etc</span>.</strong></span> Someone raises a plait of hair in the name of a deity, someone slaughters an animal in their names, someone invokes them in a distressed situation and someone swears an oath in their names. This means that the way non-Muslims treat their gods and goddesses, these so-called Muslims also give exactly a similar treatment to the Prophets, saints, Imam, martyrs, angels and fairies. Despite committing all the above sinful acts, they still claim to be Muslims. As Allah has rightfully said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And most of them believe not in Allah except that they attribute partners unto Him.&#8221;</span> (V.12: 106)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: <em>silsilat ul-hudaa wa nnoor – </em>the series of guidance and light &#8211; tape no. 727</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question #7: “Is every <em>mushrik</em> (one who associates partners with Allaah) a <em>kaafir</em>(disbeliever), but not every <em>kaafir</em> is a <em>mushrik</em>? Or are they the same?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is the established understanding in people’s minds, except few of them. I will explain that with an example: a man bears witness that none has the right to be worshiped but Allaah and that Muhammad [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] is the Messenger of Allaah, and he prays, fasts and so on, but he rejects an<em> aayah</em>from the Qur’aan. This (man) has disbelieved or not disbelieved? He has disbelieved. Has he associated partners with Allaah? That which is correct is that he has associated partners with Allaah. <strong>Every <em>kaafir</em> is a <em>mushrik</em> and every<em>mushrik</em> is a <em>kaafir</em></strong>; there is absolutely no difference between the two words…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever disbelieves has associated partners with Allaah, and whoever associates partners with Allaah has disbelieved; there is no confusion about that. The evidence for this is if we remember the conversation of the believer and the disbeliever in Surat ul-Kahf: {And put forward to them the example of two men: unto one of them We had given two gardens of grapes, and We had surrounded both with date-palms; and had put between them green crops (cultivated fields) / Each of those two gardens brought forth its produce, and failed not in the least therein, and We caused a river to gush forth in the midst of them / And he had property (or fruit) and he said to his companion, in the course of mutual talk: ‘I am more than you in wealth and stronger in respect of men’}[1] – pay attention now – {And he went into his garden while in a state (of pride and disbelief) unjust to himself. He said: ‘I think not that this will ever perish / And I think not the Hour will ever come-}.[2] According to your <strong>wrong</strong> understanding, this (man) has disbelieved but not associated partners with Allaah and he (only) denied the Resurrection. He (then) said: {-and if indeed I am brought back to my Lord, (on the Day of Resurrection), I surely shall find better than this when I return to Him’ / His companion said to him during the talk with him:-}[3] {-‘If you see me less than you in wealth, and children, / It may be that my Lord will give me something better than your garden, and will send on it Husbaan (torment, bolt) from the sky, then it will be a barren slippery earth / Or the water thereof (of the gardens) becomes deep-sunken (underground) so that you will never be able to seek it’ / So his fruits were encircled (with ruin). And he remained clapping his hands (with sorrow) over what he had spent upon it, while it was all destroyed on its trellises, and he could only say: ‘<strong>Would that I had ascribed no partners to my Lord</strong>!’}[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Therefore, when he denied the Resurrection, he associated partners with Allaah. </strong>So, whoever disbelieves in something that has come in the Book (Qur’aan) or the Sunnah, then he is (also) a <em>mushrik</em> during his state of disbelief; this is with respect to the Qur’aanic text. So what is the intellectual reason (for this)? The answer is that (Allaah), the Most High, said: {Have you seen him who takes his own lust (vain desires) as his<em> ilah</em> (god)?}[5] Therefore, whoever disbelieves with any type of disbelief is (also) a <em>mushrik</em>, because <strong>he himself made his logic to be a partner with His Lord</strong>, the Blessed and Most High. Thus, do not differentiate between <em>kufr </em>(disbelief) and <em>shirk</em> (associating partners with Allaah)…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, another <em>hadeeth</em> (mentions): ‘Whoever swears by other than Allaah has<strong>disbelieved</strong>’ and ‘whoever swears by other than Allaah has<strong> associated partners with Him</strong>.’[6] He has committed <em>kufr</em>, he has committed <em>shirk</em>. He has committed<em>shirk</em>, he has committed <em>kufr</em>. There is no difference between the two words with regard to terminology in the Islamic legislation. With regard to linguistic terminology, there is a difference no doubt, but the Islamic legislation opens our insight, thinking and understanding. Why is everyone who disbelieves in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, with any type of disbelief (also) a <em>mushrik</em>? Because he has made his logic to be a partner with His Lord, the Mighty and Majestic.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah made it obligatory upon all the servants to reject and disbelieve in at-taaghoot, and to believe in Allaah. Ibnul Qayyim (May Allaah have mercy upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“At-taaghoot is anyone whom the servants go beyond the due bounds, whether it is someone worshipped, obeyed or followed.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The taaghoot are many, and their heads are five:</p>
<p>1. Iblees (Satan), may Allaah’s curse be upon him.<br />
2. Whoever is worshipped and is pleased with that.<br />
3. Whoever calls the people to worship them.<br />
4. Whoever claims to possess anything from the knowledge of the affairs of the hidden and unseen.<br />
5. Whoever judges by other than what Allaah sent down.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof is the saying of Allaah, the Most High:<br />
“No one is to be compelled to enter the religion; true guidance has been made clear and distinct from falsehood. So whoever rejects at-taaghoot and truly believes and worships Allaah alone, then has grasped the firmest handhold that will never break.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the meaning of ‘laa ilaha illa Allaah’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is pointing to the fact that it is obligatory to worship Allaah alone and sincerely without any partners, because the first thing that Allaah commanded the servants with was to believe in Allaah and disbelieve in at-taaghoot. Moreover, they are many but their heads are five.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It means their leaders and those who a blindly followed by them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Iblees; he is the outcast and accursed Satan to whom Allaah said: “My curse is upon you till the day of resurrection.” [Saad 38:78]<br />
Iblees was with the angels, in their company and performing their actions. Then when he was commanded to prostrate to Aadam, the foulness, disdain and haughty pride within him was manifested and he refused to prostrate, became haughty and became from the disbelievers. So he was cast out from the Mercy of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Whoever is worshipped and pleased with that; he is the one who is worshipped besides Allaah and is pleased that he is being worshipped besides Allaah; he is one of the heads of the taaghoots and Allaah’s refuge is sought from that and it is the same whether he is worshipped in his lifetime or after his death, if he dies whilst having been pleased with that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Whoever calls people to the worship of himself; it is anyone who calls the people to worship him, even if they do not do so. He’s one of the heads of the taaghoots whether the people responded to his call or not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Whoever claims to possess anything from the knowledge of the affairs of the unseen and hidden; al-ghayb is whatever is hidden and unseen by man and it of two types: That which exists at present and that which lies in the future. What is hidden in the present is a relative matter, something may be known to one person and unknown to another. But the hidden and unseen of the future is something absolute and not know to anyone except Allaah alone, or to a messenger granted such knowledge by Allaah. So whoever claims such knowledge is a disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Whoever judges by other than what Allaah has revealed; judging by that which Allaah, the Most High, sent down is from the tawheed of Lordship (ar-rooboobiyyah) since it is applying the judgement of Allaah, which pertains to His Lordship and His complete sovereignty and authority.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore Allaah, the Most High, calls those who are followed upon other than what Allaah sent down ‘lords’ for their followers. He says:<br />
“They have taken their learned men and their rabbis as lord besides Allaah, and also the Messiah, the son of Mary. But they were not commanded except to worship Allaah alone. None has the right to be worshipped except Him. How free and far removed is Allaah from the partners they associate with Him.” [At-Tawbah 9:31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah calls those who are followed ‘lords’ since they are taken as legislators along with Allaah, the Most High, and He called them those who followed them their worshippers/devotees due to their having submitted to them and obeyed them in contradiction to the judgement of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. ‘Adiyy ibn Haatim said to Allaah’s Messenger (Peace be upon him) that they did not worship them, to which the Prophet replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Indeed they used to prohibit lawful things for them, and make lawful that which is forbidden for them, and they followed them &#8211; so that is their worship of them.” [Ahmad and Tirdmidhi] (Authenticated by Al-Albaanee)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">We joined a karate club in America, and when our trainer told us that we had to bow to him after he bowed to us, we refused, explaining to him that we couldnt because of our religion. He accepted our excuse but then he said that we had to bow our heads at least. He said that since he began the greeting by bowing, we had to respond. What is the ruling in this issue?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To greet somebody by bowing is unlawful, regardless whether that person is a Muslim or a disbeliever, and regardless whether you bow with our entire upper body or with your head only. This is because <strong>bowing is a kind of worship</strong>, and worship is for Allaah Almighty alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah send peace and blessing upon Muhammad, his family, and his Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: : Al-Istiqaamah Magazine, Issue No.7 &#8211; <a title="# The Beginnings of Deviation (Al Istiqaamah Magazine)" href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2014/01/17/beginnings_of_deviation/">The Beginnings of Deviation</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: That <em>Shirk</em> began during the time of Noah &#8216;alayhis-salaam, due to the excessive love and veneration that the people had for certain dead pious Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Qurtubee (d.654H) &#8211; <em>rahimahullaah</em> &#8211; said: &#8220;The initial images that were made of these righteous men were done in order that the people could be reminded about their righteousness and so strive in being righteous; as they strove. So they worshipped Allaah by the graves of these righteous men. Then a people came after them who forgot the intent of their fore-fathers&#8217; actions. So Shaytaan whispered to them saying: Your fore-fathers used to worship these images and held them in great veneration.&#8221;13</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: &#8220;That Shaytaan is eager to misguide mankind and to plot against them. He comes from the angle of exploiting man&#8217;s emotions, and lures them into doing acts that are (apparently) good. Thus, when Shaytaan saw amongst the people of Noah their great love and esteem for the righteous, he tricked them into going beyond the bounds in their love, and he got them to make and place statues of these dead pious Muslims in their places of gatherings. The objective of this was to make them swerve away from the right path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly</strong>: That Shaytaan does not only observe the present generation, and seek to deceive only them; but he also wishes to misguide and deceive future generations. Thus, when he could not plunge the present generation, from the people of Noah, into Shirk, he eagerly awaited the next generation&#8217;s arrival, in order that he could misguide them.&#8221;14</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourthly</strong>: That the worshipping of dead pious Muslims continues to be practiced amongst the <em>Ummah</em> even today. The difference being is that the names have changed. Thus, instead of worshipping <em>Wadd</em>, or <em>Yaghooth</em>, or <em>Ya&#8217;ooq</em>; people have instead directed the same practices of <em>Shirk</em> &#8211; like supplicating directly to the pious dead, and taking them as intercessors between them and Allaah &#8211; to others; such as to Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-Qaadir al-Jeelaanee in Iraaq, or al-Baydaawee in Eygypt, or Chishtee in India, etc. However, changing the name of a thing, does not change its reality.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">There are some people who write amulets for sick, insane, and psychiatric patients including in them parts of the Qurýan and Sunnah we never vouch for the sound creed of such people. We advised them against doing so, but they refused to listen, saying: We write only what is in the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam), which is not prohibited. Some of these amulets are worn by the patients themselves, or by an impure woman such as a menstruating woman, or a woman in her postnatal, or an insane, an under age child who does not know how to clean himself. Is this permissible?</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) permitted incantations with Qur&#8217;anic recitation, and supplications, as long as they do not include Shirk, or meaningless words. Muslim narrated in his Sahih that Auf bin Malik said: We used to use incantations in the pre-Islamic era, so we asked the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam): What formula should we recite for that purpose? He said: <span style="color:#008000;">Let me hear what you say. There is no harm in incantations as long as they do not include Shirk in them</span>. [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Scholars have unanimously agreed on the permissibility of incantations provided they meet the above condition, and believing that it has no effect without the Will of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is rather, Shirk according to the Hadith which is narrated by Imam Ahmad in which Imran bin Husain, may Allaah be pleased with him, reported that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) <span style="color:#008000;">saw a man wearing a copper bangle on his arm, and he asked him: What is this? He said: I am wearing it for cephalic weakness. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: Remove it, for it will not increase you in anything except weakness, and if you should die while you are wearing it, you would never be successful. </span>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another version narrated by Ahmad, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: <span style="color:#008000;">He who wears an amulet commits Shirk</span>. [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also narrated by Ahmad and others that Ibn Mas&#8217;ud, may Allaah be pleased with him, said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah saying: <span style="color:#008000;">Verily, incantations amulets and Tiwalah [5] are Shirk</span>. [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If the worn amulet contains Qur&#8217;anic words, then it is, prohibited according to the preponderant opinion for three reasons:</strong> </span></p>
<ol>
<li>The general prohibition of wearing any kind of amulets according to the Prophetic traditions with no exception.</li>
<li>Leaving no excuse for wearing amulets that contain other than Qur&#8217;anic formulas.</li>
<li>Amulets that are worn are usually subject to disrespect by taking them into washrooms, or wearing them during intercourse or the like.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">As for writing a Surah or a Verse on a slate or on a sheet, and washing the writing with water and saffron, to drink that water for the hope of gaining blessings, knowledge, wealth, good health, or the like, we have never heard that such was done by the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) for himself or for someone else.</span> He neither permitted any of his Companions to do so, nor did he give the permission to his Ummah to do so, even though the needs for doing so are existent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Based on the above, it is better to avoid doing so, and be content with what is authentically approved of incantations of Qur&#8217;anic recitation, the beautiful Names of Allaah, the authentic supplications, or the like, whose meaning are clear and they are free from the blemishes of Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should seek nearness to Allaah by doing only the permissible things for the hope of gaining reward, relief, and gaining beneficial knowledge. This should be sufficient, and he who is content with what Allaah has legitimized, Allaah renders him free from the need of someone else. It is only Allaah Who grants success.</p>
