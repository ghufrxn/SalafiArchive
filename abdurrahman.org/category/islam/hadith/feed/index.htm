<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“Sunan an-Nasaaee”</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">an-Nasaaee authored a collection which he titled: “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>as-Sunan al-Kubraa</strong></span>” in which he gathered authentic <em>Hadeeth</em> as well as those with defects in their chains. He then summarized his collection which is known as “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>as-Sunan as-Sughraa</strong></span>” although he actually called it “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>al-Mujtabaa</strong></span>”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this summarized collection, he gathered only those Hadeeth which he considered to be authentic; it is this collection that is referred to when a Hadeeth is generally attributed to anNasaaee. “al-Mujtabaa” has the least number of weak Hadeeth out of the other four collections (excluding “Saheeh al-Bukhaaree” and “Saheeh Muslim”). It also contains the least amount of chains including narrators that have been criticized (regarding their Hadeeth narrating). It occupies a status right after “Saheeh al-Bukhaaree” and “Saheeh Muslim”. From the point of only relying upon narrators that are completely void of any criticism, this collection exceeds “Sunan Abu Daawood” and “Sunan at-Tirmithee” due to an-Nasaaee’s severe scrutiny of narrators within his writings. al-Haafith Ibn Hajar said, “How numerous are the narrators that Abu Daawood and atTirmithee relied on, yet an-Nasaaee shunned recording their Hadeeth. He even avoided recording Hadeeth from some of the narrators relied upon in the two authentic collections (“Saheeh al-Bukhaaree” and “Saheeh Muslim”).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In summary, the conditions of an-Nasaaee in “al-Mujtabaa” are the strongest after the two authentic collections.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">an-Nasaaee</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is ‘Abdur-Rahmaan Ahmad Ibn Shu’ayb Ibn ‘Alee an-Nasaaee, and it is said his name is anNaswee, referring to Nasa, a famous place in Khuraasaan. He was born in 215 Hijrah in Nasa. He then traveled in search of Hadeeth, eventually hearing from and studying from the people of the Hijaaz (lands such as Syria, Palestine, etc.), Khuraasaan, ash-Shaam, the Arabian Peninsula and other lands. He resided for a long time in Egypt and his writings spread throughout there. Later he journeyed to Damascus where he met with trials and tribulations. He died in 303 Hijrah in Ramlah, Palestine when he was eighty-three years old.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He left behind him many great works of Hadeeth and the study of their defects. May Allaah have mercy on him and reward him on behalf of his contribution to the Muslims.</p>

<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color" style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First Point:</strong></p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">It should not be understood that “Saheeh al-Bukhaaree” and “Saheeh Muslim” encompass every authentically reported statement of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم). Rather, there are many authentic Hadeeth collected by other scholars that neither one of them (al-Bukhaaree &amp; Muslim) recorded in their collections.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>an-Nawawee said:</strong></p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">“The intent of both al-Bukhaaree and Muslim was only to collect a large number of authentic Hadeeth just as a book of Fiqh [2] may collect texts pertaining to many different issues, not encompass every possible issue. However, if there is a Hadeeth having an authentic chain of narration that one of them may have left out, or even both of them, then they would have had a reason to do so or they may have recorded a similar Hadeeth in its place. From what is well-known from them, it may be assumed that perhaps they felt it better not to record it, or perhaps they even forgot. They also may have left certain Hadeeth out in order not to make their collections even longer than they are, or they felt what they have recorded was sufficient pertaining to a certain topic. They may have had other reasons as well.”</p>



<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color" style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second Point:</strong></p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Scholars unanimously agree and consider “Saheeh al-Bukhaaree” and “Saheeh Muslim” to be the most authentic written works of Hadeeth. Regarding this, the famous scholar, Ibn Taymiyyah, said, “There is no Hadeeth they both agree to be authentic except that it is undoubtedly authentic.” He also said, “The vast majority of their narrations, the scholars of Hadeeth know with certainty that the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) actually said them.”</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Saheeh al-Bukhaaree” :</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This book was given the title: “<em><strong>al’Jaami’ as-Saheeh</strong></em>” by its author. In it, he recorded six hundred thousand <em>Hadeeth</em> and he exerted great effort in revising them, editing them, and scrutinizing them to determine their authenticity. He was so concerned that he would not place any <em>Hadeeth</em> within his collection without first washing and praying to units of prayer seeking Allaah’s guidance in the decision to include it. He did not include any report or narration unless it was authentically reported from the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) with a clear, connected chain of narrators, all known for their trustworthiness and preciseness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He completed his work over a span of sixteen years. After which, he presented it to <em>Imaam</em> Ahmad, Yahyaa Ibn Ma’een, ‘Alee Ibn al-Madeenee, and others. They admired it and approved of it and attested to its authenticity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since then, scholars of every time period have accepted this collection of <em>Hadeeth</em>. al-Haafith athThahabee said, “<strong>It is the best and most significant book in Islaam after the Book of Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى)</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This collection consists of seven thousand, three-hundred ninety-seven (7,397) <em>Hadeeth</em> including the ones that are repeated, yet placed in different chapters. Excluding the repeated <em>Hadeeth</em>, there are two thousand, six hundred two (2,602) individual <em>Hadeeth</em> as al-Haafith Ibn Hajar pointed out.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>al-Bukhaaree</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is Abu ‘Abdullaah Muhammad Ibn Ismaa’eel Ibn Ibraaheem Ibn al-Mugheerah Ibn Bardizbah [1] al-Ja’fee, originally of Persian origin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was born in Bukhaaraa (in present-day Uzbekistan) in the month of Shawwaal (the 10th month of the Islaamic calendar) in the year 194 <em>Hijrah</em>. He was raised as an orphan (without his father) in the care of his mother. He began traveling throughout different lands, seeking out <em>Hadeeth</em> in the year 210. He resided for six years in various lands including ash-Shaam (the lands of Palestine, Syria, Jordan, etc.), Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, Basra, Koofah, and Baghdad (all three in Iraaq). He was very proficient in memorizing and it was even said that he was able to memorize a book after seeing it only once. He was one who abstained from useless worldly things. He was pious and did not mix much with the kings, princes, or leaders. Yet, he was brave and generous. Scholars of his time and thereafter have praised him. <em>Imaam</em> Ahmad said of him, “<strong>No one even close to him has ever come from (the land of) Khuraasaan</strong>.” Ibn Khuzaymah said, “<strong>There is no one under the sky more knowledgeable of <em>Hadeeth</em> of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم), nor one having memorized more than Muhammad Ibn Ismaa’eel al-Bukhaaree</strong>.” He was also diligent in deducing rulings and had an amazing ability to derive rulings and benefits from <em>Hadeeth</em> as can be witnessed from the manner in which he organized his authentic collection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He died in a place known as Khartank near Samarqand (in Uzbekistan) on the night of <em>‘Eed al-Fitr</em> (the Islaamic holiday to conclude fasting in the month of Ramadhaan) in the year 256 <em>Hijrah</em>. He was thirteen days away from the age of sixty-two years old. He left an enormous amount of knowledge behind in his writings. May Allaah have mercy upon him an reward him on behalf of his contribution to the Muslims.</p>

<p>Here’s a narration which I just read today which I found to be very deep. I thought I’d share it with you all.</p>
<p>The Prophet (<i>sallalahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</i>) said:</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“Instruct your dying ones to say ‘None has the right to be worshipped but Allah’, for indeed the soul of a believer departs through perspiration, and the soul of a disbeliever departs from the corner of his mouth just as the soul of the donkey departs.”</b></span></p>
<p>Reported by at-Tabaraanee in <i>Al-Kabeer</i> (1/77/3) as mentioned by Sheikh al-Albaanee (<i>rahimahullah</i>) in <i>As-Saheehah</i> No. 2151</p>
<p>After mentioning its chain of narration, the Sheikh said:</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><b>‘And this chain of narration is hasan (good)’</b>.</span> See <i>As-Saheehah</i> No. 2151.</p>
<p>May Allah make our last words ‘none has the right to be worshipped but Allah’. Aameen.</p>

<p>Based upon the hadeeth qudsi ‘O My slaves’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Dharr al-Ghifari (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) is that among the sayings he relates from his Lord (may He be glorified) is that He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O My servants, I have forbidden oppression for Myself and have made it forbidden amongst you, so do not oppress one another. O My servants, all of you are astray except for those I have guided, so seek guidance of Me and I shall guide you, O My servants, all of you are hungry except for those I have fed, so seek food of Me and I shall feed you. O My servants, all of you are naked except for those I have clothed, so seek clothing of Me and I shall clothe you. O My servants, you sin by night and by day, and I forgive all sins, so seek forgiveness of Me and I shall forgive you. O My servants, you will not attain harming Me so as to harm Me, and will not attain benefitting Me so as to benefit Me. O My servants, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to be as pious as the most pious heart of any one man of you, that would not increase My kingdom in anything. O My servants, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to be as wicked as the most wicked heart of any one man of you, that would not decrease My kingdom in anything. O My servants, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to rise up in one place and make a request of Me, and were I to give everyone what he requested, that would not decrease what I have, any more that a needle decreases the sea if put into it. O My servants, it is but your deeds that I reckon up for you and then recompense you for, so let him finds good praise Allah and let him who finds other that blame no one but himself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was related by <strong>Muslim</strong> (also by at-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">From Shaykh, <em>Allaama, Mufti</em> of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Abdul Azeez bin Abdullaah Bin Baz</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">by Umm Yahya </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Noble Shaykh Bin Baz <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The reward for reciting the Book of Allaah is evident. Is there a reward for reading Hadeeth too?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is a great reward for reading the Noble Qur’an in terms of coming closer to Allaah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala, as is reading and memorizing the Hadeeth of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>. And this is because it is worship of Allaah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala (in pursuit of) acquiring knowledge and a greater understanding of the religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Evidence in the <em>Shariah</em> indicates that seeking knowledge and gaining an understanding of the religion is obligatory in order for the slave to worship His Lord upon firm knowledge (<em>Baseerah</em>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of this evidence is the saying of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever Allaah wills good for He grants them the understanding of the Deen (religion)’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The best of you are those who learn the Qur’aan and teach it’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever treads a path seeking knowledge on that path, then Allaah makes the path to paradise easy for him due to his seeking knowledge, and no group of people gather in one of the houses of Allah reciting the Book of Allaah and studying it, except tranquility descends and they are covered with Mercy and the angels surround them and Allaah mentions them to those who are close to Him’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there are many Hadeeth regarding the virtues of reciting the Qur’aan such as the saying of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Recite the Qur’aan for verily it will come as an intercession for the one who recites it on the Day of Resurrection’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And one day the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> came out and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Who would like to go to <em>Bathaan</em> (a valley in Medina) or to <em>al-Aqeeq</em> (a valley in Makkah) and return with two great female camels, without sinning and without severing the ties of kinship?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O Messenger of Allaah we would love that’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If one of you went to the masjid and learnt or read two <em>Ayaat</em> from the Book of Allah Azza wa Jal  (that) is better for him than two female camels and three <em>Ayaat</em> are better than four female camels and in addition to that the same amount in male camels’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As is collected by Imam Muslim in ‘Saheeh Muslim’ and this is an evidence concerning the virtue of reciting the Qur’aan and teaching it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is (another) famous Hadeeth from Ibn Mas’ood which is collected in ‘Jamia Tirmidhi’ with a <em>Hassan</em> (good) chain of narrators that the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever reads one letter from the Book of Allaah he gets one reward for it and one reward is equivalent to ten times the reward of it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is the same for reading the Sunnah, if a believer learns it by reading the<em>Ahadeeth</em> and studying them and memorizing them, distinguishing the authentic from the non authentic, then he will receive a great reward. This is because this is considered acquiring knowledge, concerning which the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever treads a path seeking knowledge on that path, then Allaah makes the path to paradise easy for him due to his seeking knowledge, and no group of people gather in one of the houses of Allaah reciting the Book of Allaah and studying it, except tranquility descends and they are covered with Mercy and the angels surround them and Allaah mentions them to those who are close to Him’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is proof of reading the <em>Ayaat</em> and reflecting upon them, studying Hadeeth and memorizing them, desiring knowledge and (desiring) an understanding of the religion and acting upon it (consequently) is from (one of the reasons) for entering paradise and being saved from the hell-fire. As the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever Allah wills good for He grants them the understanding of the Deen (religion)’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a consensus with regard to its authenticity and it clarifies the virtue of knowledge and seeking it, and that is a sign of goodness as we clarified earlier. And the understanding of the <em>Deen</em> is attained through the Book (The Qur’aan) and through the Sunnah (Hadeeth) therefore (attaining the) understanding the Sunnah is a sign that Allah has intended goodness for His slave, there is a lot of evidence to substantiate (this point).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is for Allah Lord of the worlds</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">Taken from  ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">By the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 175  – From Abu Huraira who said: the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘One of you should not dare drink standing up.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Abu Huraira said: from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>: that he saw a man drinking standing up, so the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Vomit it out.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man asked: ‘Why?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Would it please you that a cat drank along with you?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man answered: ‘No.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘For indeed, someone more evil than a cat drank along with you! Shaytan!!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ahmad, Darmi and Tahawi , and Al-Albaani said this chain is Saheeh.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 176/2175 – From Abu Huraira who said that Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If the person who drank whilst standing knew what was in his stomach, he would vomit it out.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ahmad and Albaani said it was Saheeh]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 177 – From Anas from the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>: that ‘he prohibited’ – and in another wording: ‘rebuked us’ – from drinking while standing.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Muslim, Abu Dawood, Tirmidhi, Darmi, Ibn Majah &amp; Tahawi]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani commented:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The evident prohibition in these Ahadeeth acknowledge the prohibition of drinking whilst standing if you do not have an excuse. There are many Ahadeeth which mention that the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>drank standing up, so the scholars have differed in bringing harmony between the two different types of Ahadeeth.  The majority of the scholars hold the opinion that the prohibition is not a total prohibition, and that the command of vomiting after having drank is only a recommended action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hazm opposed them in this, and went with the ruling of the prohibition to drink standing up, and perhaps this opinion is closer to being correct.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the opinion that it is not a total prohibition then the wording ‘rebuked’ does not support that opinion, nor does the command ‘to vomit’, and what I mean by this is, that vomiting is a severe hardship upon humans, and I am not aware of such a hardship in the Sharia’ as a consequence for being lax about a recommended action! Likewise the saying of the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>: ‘Indeed Shaytan drank with you.’  Then this is a strict deterrent from drinking whilst standing up, and it cannot be inferred from this, that it is possible to say that, not sitting whilst drinking is merely leaving a recommended action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Ahadeeth which mention drinking whilst standing up, then we can assume that this is when there is an excuse for it, like if there is no space to sit, or that it is a hanging water skin and you need to reach it and this point has been indicated in some Ahadeeth, and Allaah knows Best.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from Silsilah Ahadeeth as-Saheehah  by Shaykh al-Albaani (No. 175 &#8211; 177)]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Obey the one whom Allaah places as a ruler over you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I prohibit you from gossip, asking too many questions and wasting wealth.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 685</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- 206 -On the authority of Jaabir bin Sulayman or Saleem that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I came to the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> while he was sitting with his Companions, I asked: ‘Which one of you is the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>? Either the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> gestured to himself or the people motioned to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was sitting with his knees against his chest with a garment and its trimming had covered his feet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah! I am ignorant about things so teach me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Fear Allaah <em>&#8211; Azza wa Jal &#8211;</em>, do not scorn any good deed even if you pour from a bucket into a vessel for the person who serves drinks.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Beware of arrogance! Indeed Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabarak wa Ta’ala &#8211;</em> does not love arrogance. If a person curses you and disgraces you with something which he knows about you, then do not disgrace him with something you know about him, so you will have his reward and he will have his sin. Don’t you dare ever curse anyone.’</p>

The most beloved of actions to Allaah <em>–Azza wa Jal-</em> are to cause happiness to reach a Muslim, to relieve him from a hardship, to settle a debt for a Muslim or to repel hunger from him. For me to walk with a brother in order to assist him is more beloved to me than to make <em>‘Itikaf</em> in this <em>Masjid</em> (<em>Masjid</em> al-Madeenah) for a month.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever holds back his anger then Allaah hides his mistakes. Whoever suppresses his anger – even though he is not scared to show it, but withholds due to the truth – Allaah fills his heart with hope on the day of Judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever walks with his brother to assist him with a need until he has helped him completely, then Allaah plants his feet firmly on the day people will not stand firmly. Indeed bad behaviour spoils good actions, just as vinegar spoils honey.’</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em> revealed miracles as an evidence against the people. One of the great miracles which Allaah showed the people was of the three who spoke in the cradle. This has been authentically narrated without a shadow of doubt. It was collected, authentically by the two great scholars of hadeeth, Imaam Bukhari and Imaam Muslim in their authentic books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following narration is the authentic one:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Abu Huraira <em>&#8211; radiAllaah anhu &#8211;</em> that the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> said, “None spoke in cradle but three: (The first was) Jesus, (the second was), there a man from Bani Israel called Juraij. While he was offering his prayers, his mother came and called him. He said (to himself), ‘Shall I answer her or keep on praying?” (He went on praying) and did not answer her, his mother said, “O Allaah! Do not let him die till he sees the faces of prostitutes.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So while he was in his hermitage, a lady came and sought to seduce him, but he refused. So she went to a shepherd and presented herself to him to commit illegal sexual intercourse with her and then later she gave birth to a child and claimed that it belonged to Juraij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people, therefore, came to him and dismantled his hermitage and expelled him out of it and abused him. Juraij performed the ablution and offered prayer, and then came to the child and said, ‘O child! Who is your father?’ The child replied, ‘The shepherd.’ (After hearing this) the people said, ‘We shall rebuild your hermitage of gold,’ but he said, ‘No, of nothing but mud.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The third was the hero of the following story) A lady from Bani Israel was nursing her child at her breast when a handsome rider passed by her. She said, ‘O Allaah ! Make my child like him.’ On that the child left her breast, and facing the rider said, ‘O Allaah! Do not make me like him.’ The child then started to suck her breast again. (Abu Huraira further said, “As if I were now looking at the Prophet sucking his finger (in way of demonstration.”) After a while the people passed by, with a lady slave and she (i.e. the child’s mother) said, ‘O Allaah! Do not make my child like this (slave girl)!, On that the child left her breast and said, ‘O Allaah! Make me like her.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When she asked why, the child replied, ‘The rider is one of the tyrants while this slave girl is falsely accused of theft and illegal sexual intercourse.” Authentically reported in Saheeh al-Bukhari</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the story of the hairdresser of the daughter of Pharaoh, which is not authentic, but it is weak (<em>Da’eef</em>) is narrated as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[ It was narrated that Ibn Abbas <em>-radiAllaah anhu-</em> said: The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> said: On the night on which I was taken on the Night Journey, a beautiful fragrance came to me. I said: O Jibreel, what is this beautiful fragrance? He said: This is the fragrance of the hairdresser of Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter and her children. I said: What is their story? He said: Whilst she was combing the hair of Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter one day, the iron comb fell from her hand and she said, <em>Bismillaah</em> (in the name of Allaah). The daughter of Pharaoh said: You mean my father? She said: No. My Lord and the Lord of your father is Allaah. She said: I will tell him about that. She said: Yes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So she told him and he summoned her and said: O So and so, do you have a Lord other than me? She said: Yes, my Lord and your Lord is Allaah. He ordered that a cow made of copper be heated up, then he ordered that she and her children be thrown into it. She said: I have a request to make of you. He said: What is your request? She said: I would like my bones and my children&#8217;s bones to be gathered together in one cloth and buried. He said: This will be done for you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He ordered that her children be thrown into it in front of her, one by one, until they came to the last one who was an infant boy who was still being breastfed. It was as if she wavered because of him, but he said: O mother, go ahead, for the punishment of this world is easier to bear than the punishment of the hereafter. So she went ahead. Ibn Abbas <em>-radiAllaah anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: Four infants spoke: Eesa ibn Maryam <em>-alayhi Sallam</em>, the companion of Jurayj, the witness of Yoosuf and the son of the hairdresser of Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter.]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been narrated by Ibn Abbas and collected by Imaam Ahmad in his ‘Musnad’ and Hakim in ‘al-Mustadrak’. Ad-Dhahabi and Ibn Katheer had authenticated it. And from the contemporary scholars, the likes of Ahmad Shaakir and al-Arnaoot have also followed them and authenticated this story.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the <em>Muhadith</em> of Sham, Shaykh Muhammad Nasur uddeen al-Albaani disputes their claim. The Shaykh discusses this narration in his amazing work entitled ‘Silsilah ahadeeth ad-Daeefah’. He says that this wording is <em>Batil</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following is a summary of his research:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1-The hadeeth of Hakim has two narrators in its <em>isnaad</em> who do not have biographies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- The Shaykh said it is <em>batil</em> for two reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) The narration firstly mentions there were three who spoke in the cradle, but then mentions the names of four individuals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) This narration is different to the wording in the authentic hadeeth of Bukhari and Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- All the other narrations have defects in their <em>Asaneed</em>. Here the Shaykh begins to discuss a lot of technical detail.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- The Shaykh said: ‘I did not find any authentic hadeeth which negates the number of babies who spoke in cradle are mentioned in the hadeeth of Bukhari and Muslim. Except what is in the story of the boy of the people of the ditch, where he said to his mother, ‘o mother be patient, since indeed you are upon the truth.’ as narrated by Ahmad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5- The Shaykh continues later on by saying: ‘then, what is apparent in the Qur’aan from the story of the witness to what happened to Prophet Yusuf <em>-alayhi as-Sallam &#8211;</em> is that the witness was a man not a baby child in the cradle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it had been a baby then just the baby saying that she is a liar would be sufficient as absolute evidence, since it would have been a miracle. There would be no need for saying &lt;&lt;and a witness of her household bore witness&gt;&gt;, nor any need for living proof of the innocence of Yusuf <em>-alayhi as-Sallam &#8211;</em> which is the saying from the verse. &lt;&lt;If it be that his shirt is torn from the front, then her tale is true and he is a liar! But if it be that his shirt is torn from the back….. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jareer narrates an <em>isnaad</em> where all the narrators are trustworthy on the authority of Ibn Abbas that the person who witnessed what happened to Prophet was a man who had a beard, and this the stronger opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6- The Shaykh mentions:<br />
(benefit): what has been mentioned in some <em>Tafseer</em> books and other than them, that from those who also spoke in the cradle were Ibraheem, Yahya and Muhammad <em>-alayhim as-Sallam ajmaeen-</em> there is nothing narrated from the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>. This is what you should know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one requires more detailed information then they can refer to ‘Silsilah ahadeeth ad-Daeefah’ 2/880</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Compiled and Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Indeed Allaah hates every person who is arrogant, rude, rough, and is greedy, thinks he knows it all and shouts loudly in the market places, who is like a corpse during the night and a donkey during the day, knowledgeable about worldly affairs, ignorant about the matters of the hereafter.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Da’eef</em> – ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth ad-Da’eefah’ no. 2304</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth which has been narrated by Ibn Hibban and al-Bayhaqi, it has been declared weak by Shaykh al-Albaani.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Initially the Shaykh had authenticated this hadeeth in ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth as-Saheehah’ no.195.  However, the Shaykh retracted and declared it to be weak.  He removed it from ‘Silsilah as-Saheehah’ and placed it in ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth ad-Da’eefah’ no.2304.  The Shaykh also declared it <em>Da’eef</em> in his book ‘Daeef Targheeb wa Tarheeb’ no.378.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Although this hadeeth can be found authenticated in his book ‘Saheeh al-Jami as-Sagheer’, the Shaykh didn’t rely upon this book since it had been in the hands of untrustworthy publishers.  The Shaykh never amended the book. However the Shaykh in latter part of his life began a journey to divide the Ahadeeth of ‘Saheeh  al-Jami as-Sagheer’  into a more precise division of hadeeth  terminology of<em>‘Saheeh  li dhaatihi</em>‘ ( authentic by itself) and <em>‘Saheeh li ghayreehi</em>‘ (authentic due to other hadeeth) and <em>‘hasan li dhaatihi</em>‘ (hasan by itself) and <em>‘hasan li ghayreehi’</em> (<em>hasan</em> due to other hadeeth).  This is a colossal task in itself. The Shaykh – may Allah have mercy on him- was sadly unable to complete this work.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh commented on the hadeeth after declaring it weak by saying: “how applicable is this hadeeth – even though it is weak – to those <em>kuffar</em> who do not pay any importance to their hereafter, despite them having knowledge of many worldly affairs, Allaah<em>Ta’ala</em>  says about them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong>They know only the outside appearance of the life of the world, and they are heedless of the Hereafter.</strong>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ Soorah ar-Rum : 7 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many Muslims have a large percentage of this characteristic in them. Those who spend their days roaming around in the market places, shouting and yelling in those places, and they neglect the obligatory actions and prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&lt;&lt; So woe unto those performers of prayers (hypocrites), who delay their <em>Salaat</em> from their stated fixed times, those who do good deeds only to be seen (of men), and refuse <em>Al-Ma’un</em>(small kindnesses</strong>)&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Soorah Maa&#8217;oon : 4-7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from: ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth ad-Da’eefah’ no. 2304</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">A Selection of Ahaadeeth and their benefits taken from ‘Silsilah al-Ahadeeth as-Saheehah’<br />
By The Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ Muhammad Nasur uddeen al-Albaani<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Part one</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sufficing with one <em>Tasleem</em> in the prayer</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>316</strong> – “He used to give one Tasleem.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Summarizing the statement: That this hadeeth is authentic, and it is the most authentic of the Ahadeeth that mention giving one <em>Tasleem</em>in the prayer. Bayhaqi quotes a portion of these ahaadeeth, but none of those <em>asaneed</em> are without a weakness. However, in general they support this hadeeth. Bayhaqi said at the end: ‘It has been narrated on a group of the Companions <em>– radiAllaahu anhum –</em> that they gave one<em>Tasleem</em>, and this is from the differences that are permissible, and that can be limited to being allowed.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And at-Tirmidhee mentions something similar about the Companions, then he says: ‘Ash-Shafiee said: If you wish you can give one <em>Tasleem</em>, and if you wish you can give two Tasleems.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: The giving of one <em>Tasleem</em> is obligatory, which must be done, due to his <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> saying: “….exiting oneself from the prayer is by giving <em>Tasleem</em>.” And giving two Tasleems is Sunnah, and it is permissible to leave the second <em>Tasleem</em>, sometimes due to this hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the guidance of the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> the method of exiting from the prayer thus follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 – Limiting to one <em>Tasleem</em>, as was previously mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 – To say on his right hand side: ‘assalamu alaykum wa rahmatullaahi’, and to say on his left side: ‘assalamu alaykum.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – Like the <em>Tasleem</em> before, except that you also add ‘wa rahmatullaahi’in the second <em>Tasleem</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 – Just like the <em>Tasleem</em> before, except that you add ‘wa barakatuhu’ in the first <em>Tasleem</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of these are established in the ahaadeeth and I have mentioned their sources in ‘sifaat as-salaat an-Nabi &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>’ so whoever wishes can refer back to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>516</strong>&#8211; On the authority of Abdullaah bin ‘Amr, on the authority of the Prophet &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said: ‘The pleasure of your Lord is in the pleasure of your father and the anger of your Lord is in the anger of your father.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>792</strong>&#8211; On the authority of Abdullaah bin Amr – in a narration ascribed to the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>: “Indeed the most beloved of you to me is the best of you in manners.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>From the Prophet’s – sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –humility</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1002</strong>&#8211; On the authority of Abu Huraira who said: Jibraeel sat with the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and he looked up to the sky, and there was an angel descending. Jibraeel said to the Prophet: This angel has never descended until this time since he was created.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when the angel descended he said: ‘O Muhammad, your Lord has sent me to you: Shall I make you a king or slave &amp; Messenger?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jibraeel said to him: ’Be humble for your Lord O Muhammad!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘No, but rather a slave &amp; Messenger.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1047</strong> – On the authority of Muhammad bin Saad, on his father in a narration ascribed to the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>: ‘There are three things that are from happiness, and the three things from happiness are: A wife, who you are pleased with what you find from her, and if you are away from her she keeps herself and your wealth secure. And a riding beast which is quick and easy, so it can take you to your friends. And a house which is spacious and has many visitors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the wretched things: A wife, who you are upset with from what you find from her, and she talks badly about you, and if you are away from her she does not secure herself nor your wealth. And a riding beast which is slow, so if you beat it you just tire yourself out, and if you leave it, it will not take you to your friends. And a house which is cramped and has few visitors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1802</strong>&#8211; The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘There are three destructive things, and three successful things’, then he said: ‘The three destructive things are: miserliness which is obeyed, and a desire which is followed, and a person is amazed by his own self.And the three successful things: having fear of Allaah in secret and in the open, and having a balance in poverty and richness, and doing justice at the time of anger and at the time of happiness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The virtue of Abu Ubayda and using <em>Khabar al-Ahad</em> as a proof</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1964 –</strong> “<strong>This is the trustworthy one of this <em>Ummah</em>. Meaning Abu Ubayda</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Muslim (1297) and Hakim (3/267) and Ahmad (3/125) and Abu Yaa’la (2/831) from the different routes on the authority of Hamad bin Salama on the authority of ‘Anas: “The people of Yemen came to the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and said : Send a man with us who will teach us the Sunnah and al-Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Messenger took the hand of Abu Ubayda and said: “ This is the trustworthy one of this <em>Ummah</em>. ” Then the Messenger mentioned him. This wording is from Muslim, and from the wording of Haakim, ‘teach us the Qur’aan.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Haakim said: ‘Authentic according to the conditions of Muslim, but Muslim &amp; Bukhari did not narrate this hadeeth with mentioning the word: ‘Qur’aan.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say : and in this hadeeth there is an important benefit, the <em>Khabar al-Ahad</em> is used as a proof in <em>‘Aqeedah</em>, like it is used as a proof in Fiqh rulings, since we know – out of necessity that the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> did not send Abu Ubayda to the people of Yemen just to teach them <em>fiqh</em> rulings, but also to teach the <em>‘Aqeedah</em>. So if the <em>khabar al-Ahad</em> did not necessitate knowledge of the <em>Sharia’</em> in<em>‘Aqeedah</em>, then sending Abu Ubayda to teach them by himself would be similar to mockery. And this is what the One who established the<em>Sharia’</em> is free from. So it is established with certainty that the <em>Khabar al-Ahad</em> necessitates knowledge, and that is my intent. I have two well-known booklets, which have been printed many times regarding this important issue, so anyone who wants a further explanation can refer back to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1939</strong> – On the authority of Hani : When he came to the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>, and said : ‘O Messenger of Allaah what obligates Paradise for me? He said: “Have good speech and give food.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>From the best advice of the Messenger of Allaah – sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam for Abu Dharr</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2166</strong> – On the authority of Abu Dharr, who said: ‘My friend – Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> ordered me with seven things : He commanded me to love the poor, and to come close to them.And he commanded me to look at the one who is lower than me, and not look at the one above me. And he commanded me to have good ties with my family even if they turn away. And he commanded me not to ask anyone for anything. And he commanded me to speak the truth even if it is bitter. And he commanded me not to fear for Allaah the blame of those who rebuke, and he commanded me to say :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no capability nor is there any power except with Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">La hawla wa la quwwata illa billaa</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">often, as it is indeed from the treasures from under the ‘Arsh. [ And in a narration : indeed it is a treasure from the treasures of Paradise.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3258</strong> – On the authority of Rabeeyah al-Asslamee who said : I used to serve the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and he gave me some land, and he gave Abu Bakr some land, and when it came to dividing the land, we differed over a cluster of dates from a date palm tree. Abu Bakr said : this is on my side of the land! And I said : It is on my side! There used to be a problem between me and Abu Bakr, and Abu Bakr said a statement to me which I hated but he regretted saying it, so he said to me: ‘O Rabeeyah! Say something to me similar to what I said to you, so that it can be a requital.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I said : ‘I will not say it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr said : ‘You will say it or I will request the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> to order you to say it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I said : ‘I will not say it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr left that portion of the land for me and went off to the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and I followed him. The people from my tribe followed us and said to me: ‘May Allaah have mercy on Abu Bakr, why is he going to the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>about you, and he said what he said about you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I said : ‘Do you know who this is?? This is Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq, he is one of the two who were in the cave, he is one who has grown old as a Muslim ( one of the elders of the Muslims), beware he does not turn around and see you assisting me against him and becomes angry and he meets the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> , and the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> will become angry due to him being angry, and then Allaah Azza wa Jal becomes angry due to them being angry and then Rabeeyah will be destroyed.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said : ‘What do you order us to do?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said : ‘Go back.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> went off to the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> , so I followed him by myself, until he reached the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and he told him the story as it was. The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> raised his head towards me and said: ‘O Rabeeyah what’s the matter between you and as-Siddeeq?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said : ‘O Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> such and such happened, and he said a statement to me which I disliked, then he said to me, say something similar to what I said to you so that it can be requited, but I refused.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Yes, do not say a word back to him, but say: May Allaah forgive you O Abu Bakr. May Allaah forgive you O Abu Bakr.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hasan said: ‘Abu Bakr turned around and he was crying.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Hadeeth taken from ‘Saheeh al-Kalima at-Tayyib’</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">By <strong>Shaykhul Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah</strong><br />
And Checked by<strong> Shaykh Muhammad Nasir-rudeen al-Albani</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Compiled by Hajaj bin Abdullaah al-Areeni<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise belongs to Allaah, Lord of all the worlds. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, upon his family, his Companions and all those who follow his guidance until the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then to proceed, indeed Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> sent Muhammad <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> with the most eloquent of speech, Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And he does not speak from his own desire, indeed it is revelation sent down to him</span></strong>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Whatever the Messenger gave you then take it, and whatever he prohibits you from then keep away from it</span></strong>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Whoever obeys the Messenger then he has obeyed Allaah</span></strong>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has blessed this <em>Ummah</em> with the guidance of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and from the greatest of these blessings of guidance, is the ease of worship, coupled with the great reward for fulfilling that worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> mentioned, in many hadith, actions and sayings, which, if performed grant us great and well-known results. This is to encourage good actions and sayings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This collection of hadeeth, contain some of the valuable pearls of sayings, from the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>. They yield immense rewards, in return of easy &amp; effortless actions, for those whom Allaah has made them easy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have chosen these hadeeth from the book <em>S<strong>aheeh al-kalima at-Tayyib </strong></em>by the Shaykh Muhammad Nasir-rudeen al-Albaani <em>-Rahimullaah</em>. This book consists of authentic hadeeth from the book of Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> called <strong><em>al-kalima at-Tayib</em></strong>. All of the hadeeth mentioned in this pamphlet have been graded authentic from the research of Shaykh al-Albaani <em>-Rahimullaah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This pamphlet has only been only limited to the texts of the hadeeth, since not more than the text is required. I have named this collection <strong><em>Hawiz ala jawaiz</em></strong> (Gaining Rewards). Because these chosen hadeeth, which yield great rewards or great known results which the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> informed us of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It would be of great benefit, if someone by Allaah’s permission could carry out research similar to this. Delving into the books of hadeeth to bring forth knowledge guidance &amp; good works to the people.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Hadeeth</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever says: –</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَه،ُ لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْد،ُ وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah Alone, He has no partners, to Him belongs the Dominion and for Him is all praise, and He is capable of all things.’ –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">La ilaha ‘illa Allaahu wahdahu la shareeka lahu, lahul mulku wa lahul hamdu wa huwa ala kulli shayin qadeer</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One hundred times in one day, then it is equivalent to him freeing ten slaves, a hundred good deeds are written for him, a hundred bad deeds are erased, it is a protection for him against shaytaan during that day until the evening, and no one comes with a better deed than him except for the man who does more actions than him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever says: &#8211;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">‘Far is Allaah from imperfection and all praise is for Him’</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Subhana allaahi wa bihamdihi</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One hundred times in one day, then his mistakes / sins are cancelled out, even if they are like the foam on the ocean.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are two words which are gentle on the tongue, heavy on the scales, and beloved to ar-Rahmaan: &#8211;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ ، سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ الْعَظِيمِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">‘Far is Allaah from imperfection and praise is for Him, Far is Allaah The Sublime from imperfection</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Subhana allaahi wa bihamdihi, Subhana allaahil atheem</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed that I say:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ ، وَالْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ ، وَلَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ ، وَاللَّهُ أَكْبَرُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">‘Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest,’</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Subhana allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu akbar</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; is more beloved to me than what the sun rose upon.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is one of you so weak that he cannot acquire a thousand good deeds everyday? So a questioner from amongst those sitting there asked him: How can anyone of us gain a thousand rewards?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: say:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8211; Far is Allaah from imperfection –</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Subhana allaahi</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A hundred times, so a thousand good deeds are written for him or a thousand sins are cancelled for him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shall I not inform you of a statement, which is a treasure from the treasures of Paradise? I said: Yes O Messenger of Allaah, may my father and mother be sacrificed for you! He said: say:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">لَا حَوْلَ وَلَا قُوَّةَ إِلَّا بِاللَّهِ</h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">There is no capability nor is there any power except with Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">La hawla wa la quwwata illa billaa</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">7 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoso ever, reaches the morning &amp; reaches the evening and he says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">-‘Allaah is far from imperfection and all praise is for Him’ –</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Subhana allaahi wa bihamdihi</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One hundred times, then no one brings anything better than him on the day of judgment, than what he has brought. Except the one who says what he has said, or has said more than him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">8 – On the authority of Mua’ad bin Abdillaah ibn Khubayb on the authority of his father who said we went out on a very dark and rainy night searching for the Messenger of Allaah so that he could pray for us, then I found him and he <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said : Recite. So I did not say anything, then he said: Recite. So I did not say anything, and he said: Recite, so I said: what should I recite? He said: recite:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">“قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ”</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">‘Say that Allaah is the One.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the last two Soorahs (<em>al-muawaathatayan</em>) in the evening and the morning, three times for it will suffice you for everything.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">9 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the major supplication for forgiveness is to say</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُمَّ أَنْتَ رَبِّي لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ خَلَقْتَنِي وَأَنَا عَبْدُكَ وَأَنَا عَلَى عَهْدِكَ وَوَعْدِكَ مَا اسْتَطَعْتُ أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّ مَا صَنَعْتُ أَبُوءُ لَكَ بِذَنْبِي وَأَبُوءُ لَكَ بِنِعْمَتِكَ عَلَيَّ فَاغْفِرْ لِي فَإِنَّهُ لَا يَغْفِرُ الذُّنُوبَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">O Allaah You are my Lord, there is none worthy of worship in truth except You, You created me and I am Your slave and I abide to Your covenant and promise as best as I can, I seek refuge in You from the evil that I have committed, I profess to you my sins and I acknowledge Your favour upon me, so forgive me verily no one forgives sins except you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Allaahumma anta rabbee, la ilaha illa anta, Khalaqtanee, wa ana abduka, wa ana ala ahdika wa wa’dika mastata’tu, a’outhu bika min sharri ma sanatu, aboo’u laka bini’matika alayya, wa aboo’u bee thambee, faghfirlee fa’innahu la yaghfiru ath-thunooba ‘illa ‘anta</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if the worshipper says this when the morning arrives, truly believing in it and he dies, enters Paradise, and if he says this when the evening arrives truly believing in it enters Paradise.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">10 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is not one from amongst the worshippers, that if he says, in the morning of everyday and the evening of every night: <em>&#8211;</em></p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الَّذِي لَا يَضُرُّ مَعَ اسْمِهِ شَيْءٌ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَلَا فِي السَّمَاءِ وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">In the name of Allaah with whose name nothing is harmed what so ever, on this earth nor in the heavens whatsoever, and He is the All Hearing and All Knowing</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Bismil-lahil-lathee la yadhurru ma’a ‘issmihi shay’un fil ‘ardhi wa la fissama’i wa huwa ‘as-samee’ul –‘aleem</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Three times nothing harms him what so ever.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">11 – On the authority of Abu Huraira <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em>, the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> had placed Abu Huraira to look after the charity, some one came to him to take from the charity – and this person came night after night, so on the third night Abu Huraira said to him: I will take you to the Messenger of Allaah. So he said Why don’t you leave me and I will teach you some words that Allaah will benefit you by – and Abu Huraira was of those who were very attentive regarding good deeds – so the person said to him: When you go to bed, read Ayaat ul-Kursi:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">(الله لا إلهَ إلا هُوَ الحيُ القَيُومَ )</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Allaah, none has the right to be worshipped except Him The Ever living, The One Who sustains and protects all that exists&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[verse 255 from Soorah Baqarah]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Until the end of the <em>Ayaah</em>, then this will continue to be a protection for you from Allaah, and Shaytan will not be able to come near you until the morning arrives. The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: He spoke the truth even though he is a liar, [that was Shaytan].</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">12 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who ever recites the last two <em>Ayaat </em>from <em>Soorah al-Baqarah</em> at night, then those two verses will be sufficient for him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">13 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shall I not show you what will be better for you than a servant? When you lie down on your bed, say SubhanAllaah 33 times, say al-hamdulillaah 33 times and say Allaahu akbar 34 times.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">14 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who ever wakes up at night, and says: &#8211;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَه،ُ لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْد،ُ وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ،الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ ،وَ سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ ، وَلَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ ، وَاللَّهُ أَكْبَرُ ،وَ لَا حَوْلَ وَلَا قُوَّةَ إِلَّا بِاللَّهِ العليِ الْعَظِيمِ.</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah Alone, He has no partners, He has the Dominion and for Him is all praise, and He is capable of all things, praise is for Him, and Far is Allaah from imperfection, and There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest, there is no capability nor is there any power except with Allaah the Most High the ‘Atheem.’ (Supreme)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">La ilaha ‘illa Allaahu wahdahu la shareeka lahu, lahul mulku wa lahul hamdu wa huwa ala kulli shayin qadeer Subhana allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu akbar</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">La hawla wa la quwwata illa billaa</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he says : <strong>اللهمَ اغْفِرْلي</strong> <em>O Allaah forgive me </em>(Allaahumma aghfirlee), or he supplicates and his supplication is answered, and if he makes <em>Wudu</em> and prays then his prayer is accepted.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">15- The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who ever goes to bed with purification….there is not an hour of the night that he asks Allaah for something of good from this world and the hereafter, except that Allaah grants him that which he asked for.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">16 – Abu Salma said that he heard Abu Qatada say that he heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A good dream is from Allaah <em>–Tabaraka wa Ta’ala</em>&#8211; and a bad dream is from Shaytaan, so if anyone sees something in his dream which he dislikes, then he should spit on his left side 3 times when he awakens, and he should seek refuge with Allaah from its evil, then it will not harm him if Allaah so wills.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">17 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A good dream is from Allaah, so if any one of you sees something in his dream that he likes, then he should not relate it to anyone except the one whom he loves, and if he sees that which he dislikes, then he should not relate it to anyone, rather he should spit on his left side 3 times, and he should seek refuge with Allaah from the evil of the accursed shaytaan, and the evil of what he saw, then it will not harm him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">18- The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Lord <em>–Tabarak wa Ta’ala-</em> descends every night to the lowest heavens, when there remains the last third part of the night, and He says who is there that supplicates to me so that I may answer his supplication, who is there that asks of me so that I may grant him what he asks for, who is there that seeks my forgiveness so that I may forgive him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">19 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, there is an hour from the night, which if a Muslim asks Allaah in that time from the good of the affairs of this world and the hereafter, then Allaah gives him of it, and that is in every night.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">20 – On the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever says, as he leaves from his house:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ ، تَوَكَّلْتُ عَلَى اللَّهِ ،ولَا حَوْلَ وَلَا قُوَّةَ إِلَّا بِاللَّهِ تعالى</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">In the name of Allaah, I have placed my trust in Allaah, and there is no capability nor is there any power except with Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Bismillaahi tawwakaltu alalaahi wa la hawla wa la quwwata illa billahi taa’la</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">then it is said to him: indeed you have been saved, and you have been protected, and you have been guided, and shaytaan has been kept away from him, so another shaytaan says: how can you affect a man who has indeed been guided and saved and been protected.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">21 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a man enters his home, and he remembers Allaah when he enters and when he eats his food, the shaytaan says: there is no place for you to spend the night nor is there any dinner. And if he does not remember Allaah when he enters his house then the shaytaan says: you have found a place to spend the night and if he does not remember Allaah while he is eating his food then he says you have found food to eat.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">22 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O my son if you enter your home then say <em>Salaam</em> it will be a blessing for you and your family.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">23 – When the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> would enter the <em>Masjid</em> he would say:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَعُوذُ بِاللَّهِ الْعَظِيمِ وَبِوَجْهِهِ الْكَرِيمِ وَسُلْطَانِهِ الْقَدِيمِ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8211; I seek refuge with Allaah The Supreme and with His Noble Face, and His eternal authority from the accursed shaytaan –</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">A’outhu bil-lahil ‘atheem, wa bi-wajhihil-kareem, wa bi-sultanihil-qadeem min ‘ash-shayanir-rajeemi</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said: if he says this supplication then the shaytaan says: this person has been protected from me for the rest of the day.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">24 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the people knew what was there (in benefit for them) in the call to prayer and praying in the front row, and they could not get to it except by drawing lots, then they would draw lots.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">25- The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is none from the <em>Jinn</em>, mankind and anything else that hears the reach of the <em>Muaddthin’s</em> (the caller to prayer) voice except that they will testify for him on the day of Resurrection.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">26 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you hear the <em>Muaddthin</em>, then repeat what he says, then send prayers upon me, since indeed the one who sends prayers upon me once, Allaah sends ten prayers upon him. Then ask Allaah for me to be an intercessor since it is a high station in Paradise, which is not befitting except for a servant from the servants of Allaah and I hope that I am the one, so whoever asks intercession for me then intercession will take place for him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">27 -The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who ever says, when he hears the call to prayer:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُمَّ رَبَّ هَذِهِ الدَّعْوَةِ التَّامَّةِ وَالصَّلَاةِ الْقَائِمَةِ آتِ مُحَمَّدًا الْوَسِيلَةَ وَالْفَضِيلَةَ وَابْعَثْهُ مَقَامًا مَحْمُودًا الَّذِي وَعَدْتَهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; O Allaah Lord of this perfect call to prayer and Owner of this prayer to be performed, bestow upon Muhammad a station in Paradise and a rank above the rest of creation and give him the honorable station which you have promised him –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaahumma rabba hathihi ‘addawatittamati, was-salatil qa’imati, ‘ati Muhammadan ál-waseelata wal faaheelata, wab’ath-hu maqqaman mahmoodan ‘allathee wa’adtahu</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">then my intercession occurs for him on the day of Judgment.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">28- A man said O Messenger of Allaah indeed the callers to the prayer are more favored than we are. So the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: repeat what they say, and when you finish ask, and you will be given.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">29 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A supplication that is made between the Adhaan and the Iqama is not rejected.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">31 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Two things which are not rejected, or rarely rejected: A supplication made at the time of the call to prayer, and at the time when the battle becomes severe.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">31 -The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shall I not teach you something, which the people who proceeded you attained, and those who come after you will proceed you with, and there will be no-one better than you except the one who does what you do? They said of course O Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>. So he said: say: – far is Allaah from imperfection, Allaah is the Greatest and Praise is to Allaah – SubanAllaah and Allaahu akbar and Alhamdulillaah at the end of every prayer 33 times each.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">32 -The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever says SubhanAllaah at the end of every prayer 33 times, says al-hamdulillaah 33 times, and says Allaahu akbar 33 times, then this adds up to 99, and if he says –</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ِ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ ، لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah Alone, He has no partners, He has the Dominion and for Him is all praise, and He is capable of all things’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">La ilaha ‘illa Allaahu wahdahu la shareeka lahu, lahul mulku wa lahul hamdu wa huwa ala kulli shayin qadeer</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To complete a hundred, then his mistakes/sins are forgiven even if they were equivalent to the foam on the sea.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">34 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are two characteristics or two qualities that if a Muslim slave of Allaah is continuous upon, will enter Paradise, they are simple but those who do them are few. To say SubhanAllaah at the end of every prayer ten times, says alhamdulillah ten times and says Allaahu akbar ten times, which is equivalent to 150 times on the tongue and 1500 on the scales. And he says Allaahu Akbar 34 times when he goes to bed and he says alhamdulillah 33 times and says SubhanAllaah 33 times, and that is equivalent to 100 on the tongue and 1000 on the scales.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">34 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> used to teach us <em>al-Istikharah</em> (a prayer said for aid in making a decision) for all matters, just like he used to teach us a chapter from the Qur’aan, he would say: If any of you intends to undertake a matter then he should pray two <em>Rakah</em> other than an obligatory prayer then he should say</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَسْتَخِيرُكَ بِعِلْمِكَ وَأَسْتَقْدِرُكَ بِقُدْرَتِكَ وَأَسْأَلُكَ مِنْ فَضْلِكَ الْعَظِيمِ ، فَإِنَّكَ تَقْدِرُ وَلَا أَقْدِرُ ، وَتَعْلَمُ وَلَا أَعْلَمُ وَأَنْتَ عَلَّامُ الْغُيُوبِ ، اللَّهُمَّ إِنْ كُنْتَ تَعْلَمُ أَنَّ هَذَا الْأَمْرَ خَيْرٌ لِي فِي دِينِي وَمَعَاشِي وَعَاقِبَةِ أَمْرِي أَوْ قَالَ عَاجِلِ أَمْرِي وَآجِلِهِ فَاقْدُرْهُ لِي وَيَسِّرْهُ لِي ثُمَّ بَارِكْ لِي فِيهِ وَإِنْ كُنْتَ تَعْلَمُ أَنَّ هَذَا الْأَمْرَ شَرٌّ لِي فِي دِينِي وَمَعَاشِي وَعَاقِبَةِ أَمْرِي أَوْ قَالَ فِي عَاجِلِ أَمْرِي وَآجِلِهِ فَاصْرِفْهُ عَنِّي وَاصْرِفْنِي عَنْهُ وَاقْدُرْ لِيَ الْخَيْرَ حَيْثُ كَانَ ثُمَّ أَرْضِنِي بِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah I request of You with Your knowledge, and by Your Power I seek capability, and I ask of you of your great favour, since indeed You are the One who is able while I am not, and You know and I do not, and You are the One who knows the unseen. O Allaah if You know that this matter – here he mentions his need – is good for me in this world and for my living and for the matters of my hereafter – or he said, for my affairs now and the future – then decree it for me and make it easy for me and bless it for me. And if You know that this matter is evil for me in this world and for my life and for the matters of my hereafter – or he said, for my affairs now and the affairs of my future – then turn it away from me and turn me away from it, and decree goodness for me where ever it may be and make me pleased with it.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">35 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The supplication of Yunas, when he supplicated while he was in the belly of the whale:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ سُبْحَانَكَ إِنِّي كُنْتُ مِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; There is none worthy of worship in truth except You, far are You from imperfection, indeed I am from amongst the <em>Thalimoon</em>(oppressors) –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">La ilaha ‘illa ‘anta, subhanaka ‘innee kuntu minath-thalimeena</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No Muslim ever supplicates with this for anything except that Allaah responds to him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">36 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah does not afflict a slave with grief nor sadness, except that if the slave says: &#8211;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي عَبْدُكَ وَابْنُ عَبْدِكَ وَابْنُ أَمَتِكَ نَاصِيَتِي بِيَدِكَ مَاضٍ فِيَّ حُكْمُكَ ، عَدْلٌ فِيَّ قَضَاؤُكَ ، أَسْأَلُكَ بِكُلِّ اسْمٍ هُوَ لَكَ سَمَّيْتَ بِهِ نَفْسَكَ أَوْ عَلَّمْتَهُ أَحَدًا مِنْ خَلْقِكَ أَوْ أَنْزَلْتَهُ فِي كِتَابِكَ أَوِ اسْتَأْثَرْتَ بِهِ فِي عِلْمِ الْغَيْبِ عِنْدَكَ أَنْ تَجْعَلَ الْقُرْآنَ رَبِيعَ قَلْبِي وَنُورَ صَدْرِي وَجِلَاءَ حُزْنِي وَذَهَابَ هَمِّي</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah indeed I am Your slave, and the son of Your slave, and the son of Your female slave, my forelock is in Your Hand, Your command over me is forever executed and Your decree over me is just. I ask of You with all Your names, which belong to You, which You have named Yourself with, or which You have taught someone from Your creation or revealed it in Your Book or that which You have taken unto Your self with the knowledge of the unseen with You, that You make the Qur’aan the life of my heart and light of my breast and keep away from me my sadness, and that my grief goes away –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaahumma ‘innee ‘abduka, wabnu ‘abdika, wabnu amatika, nasiyatee biyadika, madhin fiyya hukmuka, adlun fiyya qadha’uka, asaluka bikulli ismin huwa laka, sammayta bihi nafsaka, aw anzaltahu fee kitabika, ‘aw allamthu ahadan min khaliqika, aw ista’tharta bihi fee ilmil ghaybi ‘indaka, án taj’alal-qurana rabee’a qalbee, wa noora sadree, wa jala’a huznee, wa thahaba hammee</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah takes away his grief and sadness and replaces it with happiness.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">37 – Uthman ibn al-Aas came to the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and said: O Messenger of Allaah indeed the shaytaan comes between me and my prayer, and my recitation becomes confusing? The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: This is a shaytaan called <em>khunsabun</em>, so if you sense his presence then seek refuge in Allaah from him and spit on your left hand side three times. Uthman said: I did that and Allaah kept him away from me.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">39 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no one from among Allaah’s servants, who is afflicted with an affliction except that he says: –</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"> إِنَّا لِلَّهِ وَإِنَّا إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُونَ  اللَّهُمَّ أْجُرْنِي فِي مُصِيبَتِي وَأَخْلِفْ لِي خَيْرًا مِنْهَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, we belong to Allaah and indeed to Him is our return – O Allaah recompense me for my affliction and replace it with something better than that</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Inna lil-lahi wa inna ‘ilayhi raji’oona, ‘allahumma’jurnee fee museebatee, wa ákhliflee khayran minha</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Except that Allaah compensates him in what he has been afflicted with, and gives him that which is better than the previous thing.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">40 – ‘Alee <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shall I not teach you words that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> taught me that even if you have an equivalent of a mountain of debt upon you that Allaah will pay it off on you behalf? Say: –</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">َ اللَّهُمَّ اكْفِنِي بِحَلَالِكَ عَنْ حَرَامِكَ وَأَغْنِنِي بِفَضْلِكَ عَمَّنْ سِوَاكَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah make what You have made lawful sufficient for me, as opposed to what You have made unlawful, and spare me by Your grace, from the need of others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allahumma ikfeenee bihalalieeka ‘an harameeka wa ‘aghninee bifadhlieeka ‘amman siwaka</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">41 – Uthmaan bin Abee al-Aaas complained to the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> about a pain he had in his body since he had become Muslim, so the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>said to him: place your hand on the part of your body that pains you and then say: &#8211;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">بِاسْمِ اللَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the name of Allaah, – three times,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and say seven times : –</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I seek refuge with Allaah and with His Capability from the evil that I feel and wary of</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah The ‘Atheem (The Supreme), Lord of the magnificent ‘Arsh to cure you &#8211;</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">أَعُوذُ بِكَلِمَاتِ اللَّهِ التَّامَّاتِ مِنْ شَرِّ مَا خَلَقَ</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allaah from the evil of what He has created –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A’outhu bikalimatil-lahi ‘at-tammati min sharri ma khalaqa</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">nothing will harm him until he leaves from that place.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ ، لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ يُحْيِي وَيُمِيتُ وَهُوَ حَيٌّ لَا يَمُوتُ بِيَدِهِ الْخَيْرُ وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah Alone, He has no partners, He has the Dominion and for Him is all praise, He gives life and He takes life and He is the Ever living and does not die, in His Hand is goodness and He is capable of all things.’ –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">La ilaha ‘illa Allaahu wahdahu la shareeka lahu, lahul mulku wa lahul hamdu yuhyee wa youmeet wa huwa hayun la yamoot biyadihi alkhair wa huwa ala kulli shayin qadeer</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">then Allaah writes a thousand thousand good deeds for him, and erases a thousand thousand bad deeds for him, and He raises him up a thousand thousand grades.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The virtue of Abu Ubayda and using Khabar al-Ahad as a proof</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1964 – “<strong>This is the trustworthy one of this Ummah. Meaning Abu Ubayda</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Muslim (1297) and Hakim (3/267) and Ahmad (3/125) and Abu Yaa’la (2/831) from the different routes on the authority of Hamad bin Salama on the authority of ‘Anas :  “The people of Yemen came to the Messenger – sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – and said : Send a man with us who will teach us the Sunnah and   al-Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Messenger took the hand of Abu Ubayda and said : “ This is the trustworthy one of this Ummah. ” Then the Messenger mentioned him.  This wording is from Muslim, and from the wording of Haakim, ‘teach us the Qur’aan.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Haakim said : ‘Authentic according to the conditions of Muslim, but Muslim &amp; Bukhari did not narrate this hadeeth with mentioning the word: ‘Qur’aan.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say : and in this hadeeth there is an important benefit, the Khabar al-Ahad is used as a proof in ‘Aqeedah, like it is used as a proof in Fiqh rulings, since we know – out of necessity that the Prophet – sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – did not send Abu Ubayda  to the people of Yemen just to teach them fiqh rulings, but also to teach the ‘Aqeedah.  So if the khabar al-Ahad did not necessitate knowledge of the Sharia in ‘Aqeedah, then sending Abu Ubayda to teach them by himself would be similar to mockery. And this is what the One who established the Sharia’ is free from.  So it is established with certainty that the Khabar al-Ahad necessitates knowledge, and that is my intent.  I have two well known booklets which have been printed many times regarding this important issue, so anyone who wants a further explanation can refer back to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Silsilah al-Ahadeeth as-Saheehah vol. 4 hadeeth no. 1964 – By Shaykh Muhammad Nasur-Deen  al-Albaani</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Imaam Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee<br />
SOURCE: &#8220;Kayfa yajibu &#8216;alaynaa an Nufassir al-Qur&#8217;aan&#8221; (pg. 11-17)<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[3] Question:</b> There are some who say that if a hadeeth contradicts an ayah in the Qur’aan, it should be rejected no matter what level of authenticity it has. Then they use as an example the hadeeth:<b>“Indeed the deceased person will be punished due to the weeping (i.e. wailing) of his family over him”</b>[1] and use the statement of ‘Aa’ishah in which she quoted Allaah’s saying to refute this hadeeth: <b>“And no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another.”</b> [Surah Faatir: 18] So how do we respond to those who say this?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[3] Answer:</b> Rejecting this hadeeth falls under the issues related to rejecting the Sunnah by way of the Qur’aan. So this shows the deviation of this way of thinking.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the response to this hadeeth – and I am referring here particularly to those who use the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah, may Allaah be pleased with her – then it is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>First:<br />
From a Hadeeth Standpoint:</b> There is no way to reject this hadeeth from a hadeeth standpoint due to two reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. It has been reported through an authentic chain of narration from Ibn ‘Umar (<i>radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</i>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Ibn ‘Umar (<i>radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</i>) is not alone in reporting it since he was followed in that by ‘Umar bin Al-Khattaab (<i>radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</i>). Furthermore, he and his son are both not alone in reporting it either, for they were also followed in that by Al-Mugheerah bin Shu’bah (<i>radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</i>). This is what comes to my mind at this time since the reports of all three of these Companions can be found in the two <i>Saheeh</i> Collections.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Additionally, if a person were to conduct an exclusive research on this hadeeth, he would find other paths of narration for it. These three ahaadeeth all have authentic chains of narration. So they cannot be rejected merely on the claim that they “contradict” the noble Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Second:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>From a Tafseer Standpoint:</b> This is since the scholars have explained this hadeeth in two ways:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. This hadeeth only applies to a deceased person who knew during the course of his life that his family would commit oppositions to the Religion after his death but yet he did not advise them. So (for example) he did not direct them to not weep over him since this weeping would serve as a means for him being punished in the grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The usage of the word <b>“the”</b> when referring to the <b>“deceased person”</b> is not all-encompassing and inclusive. So the hadeeth does not mean that <i>every</i> deceased person will be punished due to the crying of his family members. Rather, the word <b>“the”</b> here is for a specific designation, meaning it refers to only those who do not advise others to not commit what opposes the Religion after his death. So this is the type of person who will be punished by the weeping of his family over him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who takes charge of advising his family and directing them with religious guidelines such as not to wail over him and not to commit the offenses that are done particularly in these times, then such a person will not be punished. However, if he does not direct and advise (his family) with this, he will be punished.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the detailed breakdown that we must be aware of with regard to the first explanation. It is in accordance with the interpretation of many well known and famous scholars such as An-Nawawee and others. So when we come to comprehend this detailed breakdown, it becomes clear that there is in fact no contradiction between this hadeeth and Allaah’s statement: <b>“And no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another.”</b> [Surah Al-An’aam: 164]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A contradiction only arises if the word <b>“the”</b> in the word <b>“the deceased person”</b> is understood to be all-inclusive, meaning that it encompasses everyone who dies. This is where the hadeeth becomes obscure and contradicts the noble ayah in the Qur’aan. But if we understand the (true) meaning of the hadeeth that we just mentioned previously, then there is no more contradictions or obscurities since we would come to realize that the one who is being punished is only that way because he failed to advise and direct his family members (before his death). This is the first manner in which this hadeeth has been interpreted in order to repel this so-called “contradiction.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. A second interpretation has been mentioned by Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah, may Allaah have mercy on him, in some of his writings. And it is that the punishment here does not refer to the punishment in the grave or the punishment in the Hereafter but rather that it refers to pain and sorrow. Meaning: When a dead person hears his family members weeping over him, he will feel bad and sorrowful for their grief over his loss.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah said. If it were correct, it would remove the misconception from its root. However, I say: Such an explanation goes against two facts, which is why we can only rely on the first explanation of this hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The First Fact:</b> The report from Al-Mugheerah bin Shu’abah (<i>radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</i>) that I indicated previously has an addition to it, which clarifies that the punishment here does not refer to just pain and sorrow but rather to actual punishment, i.e. punishment in the Hellfire, unless Allaah grants His forgiveness. This is clearly stated in Allaah’s saying: <b>“Verily, Allaah does not forgive that partners be associated with Him (in worship), but He forgives what is less than that to whom He wills.”</b> [Surah An-Nisaa: 48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the narration of Al-Mugheerah (<i>radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</i>) it states: <b>“Indeed, the deceased person will be punished due to the weeping of his family over him on the Day of Judgement.”</b> So this clearly states that the deceased will be punished due to his family crying over him on the Day of Judgement and not in his grave, which is what Ibn Taimiyyah explained as meaning pain and sorrow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Second Fact:</b> When a person dies, he no longer has a sense of anything that goes on around him whether good or bad, as indicated by evidences from the Qur’aan and Sunnah, except in certain cases, which have been mentioned in some ahaadeeth either as a rule for every deceased person or for only some, such as those whom Allaah enables to hear certain things that will cause them pain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So firstly there is the hadeeth reported by Al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh from Anas bin Maalik (<i>radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</i>) in which he narrated that the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“Verily, when a servant (of Allaah) is placed in his grave, and his companions depart from him – at the point where he can still hear their footsteps – two angels come to him.”</b>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This authentic hadeeth affirms a special type of hearing that the deceased will have at the time of his burial while the people are walking away from him. This means that at the time the two angels come to sit by him, his soul returns to his body and in this state of being, he is able to hear the footsteps (of his loved ones walking away). So the hadeeth does not mean on the outset that this deceased person and all deceased people will have their souls returned to them and that they will remain with the ability to hear the footsteps of the people passing by the graves up until the day that they are resurrected. No.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a specific circumstance and a special type of hearing on the part of the deceased since his soul has come back to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, if we were to go by the interpretation of Ibn Taimiyyah, we would then be forced to expand the senses of the deceased person to include everything that goes on around him whether at the time he is being transferred to his grave before burial or after he is placed in his grave so that he can hear his living family members weeping over him. Such a claim requires textual proof, which is not present. This is the first point.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Secondly, some texts from the Qur’aan and the authentic Sunnah indicate that the deceased cannot hear. This is a vast topic and it requires an in-depth discussion. However I will mention one hadeeth with which I will conclude the answer to this question. And it is the statement of the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) in which he said: <b>“Verily, Allaah has angels that roam throughout earth who convey to me the greetings (of Salaam) on behalf of my ummah.”</b> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is meant by <b>“roam”</b> here is that they frequent gatherings. So every time a Muslim sends Salaat (praises) on the Prophet, there is an assigned angel that conveys this greeting from that Muslim to the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>). Therefore, if the deceased were able to hear, the one with the most right to hear out of all of those deceased would be our Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) due to Allaah’s favoring him and particularizing him with special qualities and attributes over all of the prophets, messengers, and rest of mankind. So if anyone had the ability to hear, it would be the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>). And furthermore, if the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) were able to hear anything after his death, he would hear the Salaat (praises) of his ummah on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So here we come to understand the error, or the deviation, of those who ask assistance – not from the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) – but rather from those less than him, whether messengers, prophets or righteous people. This is since if they were to ask assistance from the Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>), he would not be able to hear them as is clearly stated in the Qur’aan: <b>“And those whom you call besides Allaah are servants (of Allaah) just like you.”</b> [Surah Al-A’raaf: 194]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in His saying: <b>“If you supplicate to them, they cannot hear your supplication.”</b> [Surah Faatir: 14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, after they die, the deceased cannot hear unless there is some text that applies to a particular issue – as I mentioned before – such as the deceased hearing the footsteps. This concludes the answer to this question.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Imaam Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee<br />
SOURCE: Al-Asaalah Magazine (Issue # 7)<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[21] Question:</b> What is the relationship between the Science of Fiqh and the Science of Hadeeth? And is a Muhaddith required to be a Faqeeh or just a Muhaddith only?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer:</b> A Faqeeh is required to be a Muhaddith while a Muhaddith is not required to be a Faqeeh. This is since a Muhaddith is a Faqeeh automatically due to the nature of his condition. Did the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger, <i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, used to study Fiqh or not? And what was the Fiqh that they used to study? It is that which they used to take from the Messenger of Allaah, <i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> (i.e. the hadeeth). So they were in fact studying the Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those Fuqahaa who study the opinions of the scholars and their Fiqh, while not studying the Hadeeth of their Prophet, <i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, who is the source of (all) Fiqh, it must be said to them: &#8220;You must study the Science of Hadeeth.&#8221; This is since we cannot imagine there being a correct Fiqh without knowledge of the Hadeeth, memorizing them, authenticating them and declaring them weak. And at the same time, we cannot imagine there being a Muhaddith that is not a Faqeeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah are the source for all of the Fiqh. As for the Fiqh that is commonly known today then it is the Fiqh of the scholars and not the Fiqh of the Book and the Sunnah. Yes, some of it exists in the Book and the Sunnah, but some of it consists purely of opinions and scholarly deductions. However, in much of these (opinions and deductions), there is a contradiction on their part with the hadeeth, for they were not able to encompass all the knowledge of it. [Al-Asaalah, Issue #7]</p>

<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 1: Water</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira[1] (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) Said regarding the sea, &#8220;Its water is purifying and its dead (animals) are lawful (to eat)&#8221;.<br />
[Al-Arba&#8217;a[2] and Ibn Abu Shaiba reported it, version is of the latter. Ibn Khuzaima and At-Tirmidhi graded it Sahih (sound). Malik, Ash-Shafi’i and Ahmad reported it].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri[3] (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Water is purer[4] and nothing can make it impure.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Ath-Thalatha[5], and Ahmad graded it Sahih (sound)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Umama Al-Bahili[6] (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Water cannot be rendered impure by anything except something which changes its smell, taste and color[7]&#8221;.<br />
[Ibn Majah reported it and Abu Hatim described it as Da&#8217;if (weak)]. And Al-Baihaqi reported: &#8220;Water is pure unless any impure thing is added which changes its smell, taste and color.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar[8] (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;If there is enough water to fill two pots (Qulla)[9], it carries no impurity.&#8221; Another version has: &#8220;it does not become unclean&#8221;.<br />
[AI-Arba&#8217;a reported it. Ibn Khuzaima, Ibn Hibban and Al-Hakim graded it Sahih (sound)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم), said, &#8220;None of you should take bath in stagnant water when he is sexually impure.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim reported it].<br />
Another version of Al-Bukhari has: &#8220;None of you should urinate in stagnant water that is not flowing, then take bath in it.[10] &#8220;A version of Muslim has the words: &#8220;from it (i.e. the water)&#8221;.<br />
A version of Abu Da’ud has: &#8220;One should not take bath in it from sexual impurity.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man[11] who accompanied the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) narrated: Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) forbade a woman to bathe with the water left over by a man, and that a man should not bathe with the water left over by a woman, (and instead) they should both take scoopfuls of the water together.<br />
[Reported by Abu Da’ud and An-Nasa’i and its chain of narrators is Sahih (authentic)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas (رضي الله عنه)[12]: The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to bath with the water left over by Maimuna (رضي الله عنه) [Muslim reported it]. And Ashab As-Sunan (compilers of the Prophet&#8217;s sayings) reported that one of the wives of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) took bath from a vessel, then came the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and when he wanted to take bath from that (vessel), she[13] said, &#8220;I was sexually impure.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Water does not become sexually impure.&#8221;<br />
[At- Tirmidhi and Ibn Khuzaima graded it Sahih (sound)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said &#8220;The cleansing of the utensil belonging to one of you, after it has been licked by dog, is to wash it seven[14] times, using soil for cleaning at the first time.<br />
[Muslim reported it· Another version has: &#8220;he should spill the contents]&#8221;<br />
Al-Tirmidhi&#8217;s version has: &#8220;using soil at the first or last time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Qadata[15] (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) Said about the cat that, &#8220;It is not unclean, but is one of those who intermingle with you<br />
[Reported by Al-Arba’a[16]. At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Khuzaima graded it Sahih (sound)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik[17] رضي الله عنه): A Bedouin came and urinated in one corner of the mosque, and the people shouted at him, but Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) stopped them, and when he finished urinating, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ordered for a bucket of water which was split[18] over it.<br />
[Agreed upon][19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn ‘&#8217;Umar (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) &#8216;said, &#8220;Two types of dead animals and two types of bloods have been made lawful for us, the two types of dead animals are locusts and fish (seafood), while the two types of bloods are the liver and the spleen.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Ahmad and Ibn Majah, and this Hadith has some weakness.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;When a fly falls in the drink of one of you, he should fully dip it and then throw it away because there is disease in one of its wings and cure in the other[20].<br />
[Reported by Al-Bukhari and Abu Da’ud who added: &#8220;It (the fly) protects itself with the diseased wing (by dipping it first in a drink)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Waqid Al-Laithi[21] (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Whatever (portion) is cut off from an animal when it is alive is dead (meat).<br />
[Reported by Abu Da’ud and At-Tirmidhi who graded it Hasan (fair), and this version is of Tirmidhi].</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]           His real name is &#8216;Abdullah or &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Sakhr Ad-Dausi, and was one of the greatest Sahaba (Companions of the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم) and reported the largest number of Ahadith. More than 800 men narrated from him. He became a Muslim in the year of Khaibar (7 H.) and stayed in the company of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) until he (the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم) died. He was appointed a Mufti (scholar of Islamic verdicts) during the caliphate of&#8217; Umar and later became the governor of Al-Madina during the reign of Mawan bin Al-Hakam. He died in 59 H. and was buried at Al-Baqi&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]           The collectors of Hadith: Abu Da’ud, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa&#8217;i and Ibn Majah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]           His name is Sa&#8217;d bin Malik bin Sinan Al-Khazraji Al-Ansari. He was one of the learned Sahaba, reported many Ahadith and gave religious opinions for some time. He died at the beginning of 74H at the age of 86 years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]           It is reported in Ahmad, At-Tirmidhi and Abu Da’ud that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said these words answering a question about the well of Bud&#8217;a, which is located in the vicinity of Al-Madina, and was always filled with filth. This well was situated in a low-lying area and the rainwater would carry all the dirt and garbage into it. These words are certainly about this well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]           The collectors of Hadith: Abu Da&#8217;ud, At-Tirmidhi, and An-Nasa&#8217;i.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]           His name is Suday bin &#8216;Ajlan, one of the Sahaba who reported many Ahadith. He lived in Egypt then moved to Hims (now in Syria) and died there at the age of 81 or 86 years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]           Some of the people remark that water may be less or more in quantity, if filth alters its one quality out of three (its colors, odor and taste), it would become impure. But the proper view in this connection is that if water is less than 227 kilograms (two Qulla) then mere filth makes it impure, whether there is a change in any one of its quality or not, but when water is more than the said quantity, it does not get impure, until there is a change at least in one quality.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]           He was among the most ascetic and most knowledgeable Sahaba. He became a Muslim at Makka while a small boy, and mi grated to Al-Medina. He first participated in the battle of Al-Khandaq, died in 73AH, and was buried at Dhi Tuwa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]           <i>Qulla</i> is a large earthen pot, which may contain water up to two and a half water-skins, viz., and one hundred and thirteen kilograms.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]         It means less quantity of water; if water is in abundance, it will be regarded as flowing water, which is not an impure one and is good for bathing. It has been prohibited to urinate in the stagnant water on the ground that one may not make it a habit and pollute the water. Condition of the stagnant water is only because flowing water is always clean and never becomes impure, even dirt and filth do not make it impure.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]         This man is one of the Sahaba, and failure to mention his name does not harm because the Sahaba are all trust worthy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12]         He is ‘Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas bin &#8216;Abdul-Muttalib, the Prophet&#8217;s cousin and the scholar of the Muslim Ummah. He was born 3 years before Al-Hijra and died at Ta&#8217;if in 67 AH.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13]         This Hadith apparently seems to be in contradiction with the first, but actually it is not, because the order is not of absolute prohibition, but is only of suggestive prohibition to avoid any trace of impurity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14]         It must be clear that just to clean a thing from impurity, it is not necessary to wash a for seven times. The philosophy of cleaning a thing for seven times is different from that of simple purification. Physicians of today say that mostly in the intestines of dogs there are germs and small worms approximately 4 mm. in length, and these move out from intestines with the excrement and stick to the hair around the anus· When dogs clean this place with tongue, it gets soiled with these organisms If a dog licks a pot or someone kisses the dog, as the European and American ladies do, these ate transferred from dog to the pot or to the mouth of the woman and then to the stomach These organisms keep on moving, and penetrate into blood cells causing many fatal diseases· As the detection of these germs is not possible without microscopic tests, the Shari&#8217;a (Islamic law) declared the dog&#8217;s saliva an inherently impure thing by a general command, and whatever a thing is polluted with dog&#8217;s saliva, must be cleaned seven times (which in one time should be with the soil) to be sure of its purity. For more details please see the footnotes of the book Ahkam-ul-Ahsan, Sharh Umdat-ul-Ahkam].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15]         He is Al-Harith bin Rib&#8217;i Al-Ansari, the prophet&#8217;s horseman. He fought the battle of Uhud and those, which followed. It is said he died at Al-Madina or Kufa in 54H</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[16]         Abu Da’ud, Tirmidhi, Nasa’i and Ibn Majah·</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[17]         He was the Prophet’s servant from the time he came to Al-Madina till his death. He is known as Abu Hamza and was Khazraji· He lived in Basra during Umar&#8217;s Caliphate and died in it at the age of 99 or 103 years in 91 or 92 or 93 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[18]         This Hadith proves that earth gets pure when dried up, as Ibn Abi Shaiba has narrated, specially when you let the water flow over the spot.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[19]         Al-Bukhari and Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[20]         It is evident from this Hadith that if a fly drops into water or syrup, it will not become impure, and the creatures of this family who&#8217;s blood does not flow, like mosquito, wasp and spider, etc, do not make the water impure if fallen or died into it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[21]         His name is Al-Harith bin &#8216;Auf and is a descendant of Banu &#8216;Aamir bin Laith. He became a Muslim very early and is counted among the people of Al-Madina. It is said that he fought at Badr, lived in Makka and died in it in 65H or 68H at the age· of 57 and was buried at Funj.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 2: Utensils</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hudhaifa bin Al-Yaman[1] (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Do not drink in silver or gold utensils, and do not eat in plates of such metals,[2] for such things are for them (the disbelievers) in this worldly life and for you in the Hereafter.&#8221;<br />
[Agreed upon][3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Umm Salama[4] (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم)· Said, &#8220;He who drinks in a silver utensil is only swallowing Hell-fire in his stomach.&#8221;<br />
[Agreed upon].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;When the skin is tanned it becomes purified[5]&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Muslim]<br />
AI-Arba &#8216;a have the words: &#8220;Any skiI1 that is tanned…”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salama bin Al-Muhabbiq[6] (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;The tanning of a dead animal&#8217;s skin purifies it.&#8221;<br />
[Ibn Hibban graded it Sahih (sound)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Maimuna (رضي الله عنه): Some people dragging a (dead) goat passed by the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم). He told them, &#8220;Had you better taken its skin.” They said, &#8220;It is dead&#8221;. He said, &#8220;Water and the leaves of the Acacia tree will purify it.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Abu Da’ud and An-Nasa’i].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Tha’laba Al-Khushni[7] (رضي الله عنه): I said, &#8220;O Allah’s Messenger! We are living in a land inhabited by the people of the Scriptures, can we take our meals in their utensils?&#8221; He said, &#8220;If you can get utensils other than theirs, do not eat in theirs[8] but if you cannot get other than theirs, wash them and eat in them.&#8221;<br />
[Agreed upon].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Imran bin Husain[9] (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and his Companions performed Wudu (ablution) from a skin water container[10] belonging to a polytheist woman.<br />
[Agreed upon]. (It is an extract of a long Hadith)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik (رضي الله عنه): When the cup of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) got broken, he fixed it with a silver wire[11] at the crack.<br />
[Reported by Al-Bukhari]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]           He is nicknamed Abu Abdullah, both him and his father were Sahaba and he became famous for being the confidant of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) He died at Midian (Madain) forty nights after the killing of &#8216;Uthman in the year 35H or 36 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]           This Hadith is mentioned here with a purpose to clarify that if it is prohibited to eat and drink in gold and silver utensils, then performing ablution is also prohibited with using gold and silver utensils, otherwise this Hadith would have been placed in the chapter of eating and drinking Eating, drinking and performing ablution in utensils studded with rubies and diamonds is permissible</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]           Al-Bukhari and Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]           She is Hind bint Abu &#8216;Umaiya. She was married to Abu Salama, she immigrated with him to Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and came with him to Al-Madina When Abu Salama died from an injury, he had sustained during the battle of Uhud the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) married her in Shawwal 4 H· It is said that she died in 59H or 62 H at the age of 84 years and was buried at Al-Baqi&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]           This Hadith approves that a hide, after tanning becomes pure and clean, may be the hide is of an animal which is (haram) prohibited to eat or (halal) lawful to eat and whether the animal is slaughtered or died. But the skins of human beings and some of the animals are unlawful and not permitted for use. The skin of man is unlawful due to his sacredness and reverence and the skins of animals like dog and pig are unlawful and not permitted for use because they are inherently impure and unclean. It should also be remembered that hair, teeth and horns of permitted animals are also lawful for use and trade.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]           He is nicknamed Abu Sinan of Hudhali tribe. He is considered as a resident of Basra and Al-Hasan Al-Basri took the Hadith from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]           He is a Sahabi (Companion of the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم.) descending from Khushain bin An-Nimir of Quda&#8217;a tribe. He was one of the Ashab Ash-Shajara who entered a covenant with the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) on the day of Al-Hudaibiya. He was sent to his people and they accepted Islam. He settled in Sham and died there in 75H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]           This Hadith makes it clear that if the utensils from a Muslim are available then the utensils of a non-Muslim should not be used for eating, drinking or cooking. If it is certain about a non-Muslim that he does not eat something unlawful or prohibited, then his utensils may be used, but even then one should be careful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]           He is nicknamed Abu Nujeid and is from the Khuza&#8217;a tribe. He accepted Islam in the year of Khaibar. He settled in Basra and died there in 52H or 53H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]         This Hadith clarifies that such utensils of the polytheists may be used without any hesitations, about which there is no probability of being impure.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]         This Hadith proves that if this much amount of gold or silver is present m any utensil, then making ablution with it or eating and drinking in it is not prohibited.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 3: The Nature and Cleansing of An-Najasah</h2>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">(The Impurities)</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was asked about making vinegar out of wine. He said, &#8220;No (it is prohibited)&#8221;.[1]<br />
[Reported by Muslim, and At-Tirmidhi and the latter graded it Hasan-Sahih (fair and sound)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated (Anas bin Malik) (رضي الله عنه): On the day of Khaibar, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) commanded Abu Talha[2] to announce: &#8220;Allah and His Messenger have prohibited for you (eating of) the flesh of the donkeys, for it is unclean.&#8221;[3]<br />
[Agreed upon.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amr bin Kharija[4] (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) delivered a Khutba (religious talk) to us at Mina while mounted on his camel and its saliva was pouring on my[5] shoulders.<br />
[Reported by Ahmad and At-Tirmidhi and the latter graded it Sahih (sound)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha[6] (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to wash the semen[7] and then go out for prayer in that (very) garment, and I could still see the trace of the washing on it.<br />
[Agreed upon].<br />
In the version of Muslim: &#8220;I used to scrape it (the semen) off the garment of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and then he offered prayer with it.&#8221;<br />
In yet another version of Muslim: &#8220;Verily! I (&#8216;Aisha) used to scrape it (the semen) off his garment with my nails while it was dry&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu As-Samh[8] (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;The urine of a baby girl should be washed off and the urine of a baby boy should be sprinkled[9] with water).&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud and An-Nasa’i and Al-Hakim graded it Sahih (sound)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Asma&#8217; bint Abu Bakr[10] (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said regarding menstruation blood that smears a garment, &#8220;She should scrape it, rub it with water, then wash it and then she may pray in it&#8221;.<br />
[Agreed upon].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): Khaula[11] said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, suppose the (trace of) the blood does not go?&#8221; He said, &#8220;(Washing it with) water will suffice you and its trace won&#8217;t harm you.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by At- Tirmidhi, and its <i>Sanad</i> (chain of narrators) is weak].</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]           Making of vinegar from wine by adding something in it is prohibited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]           He is Zaid bin Sahl bin Al-Aswad bin Haram Al-Ansari An-Najari who was one of the senior Sahaba. He attended the &#8216;Aqaba Covenant and all the battles. He fought bravely during the battle of Uhud and defended the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) till his hand got paralyzed. He also killed 20 men in the battle of Hunain. He died in the year 34 H. or 51 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]           Leftover water of a donkey is pure and usable</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]           He is &#8216;Amr bin Kharija bin Al-Muntafiq Al-Asadi. He was an ally of Abu Sufyan. He is regarded as being from the clan of Al-Ash&#8217;ar. He is among the Sahaba who settled in Sham and this Hadith was reported by the people of Basra.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]           From this Hadith we come to know that the saliva of a Halal [lawful to eat] animal is also pure. This Hadith was approved by the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]           She is the daughter of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq and the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) married her 2 years before the Hijra in the month of Shawwal, but wedded her in 1 H. at the age of9 years. She was very learned and reported many Ahadith. She died on 17 Ramadan 57 H or 58 H. Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه) offered her Funeral prayer and she was buried at Al-Baqi&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]           There is a difference of opinion concerning the human semen, whether it is impure or not. Some religious elites consider it like saliva or nasal secretion, and according to others it is necessary to wash it. Former group gives its reason from the Hadith of scraping it when dried, and the latter group argues from the Hadith of washing the semen. In fact, semen is impure and it must be cleaned by washing, scraping, rubbing or wiping. (See the book Nail-ul-Autar by Imam Shaukani)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]           His name is Iyya’d. He was a manumitted slave and servant of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم). Ibn Abdul-Bar said that he was reported to be lost and nobody knew where he died.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]           It means that there is difference in the urine of a boy and a girl. In the suckling period, girl&#8217;s urine is more impure than the boy&#8217;s urine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]         She is the mother of&#8217; Abdullah bin Az-Zubair and the elder sister of&#8217; Aisha. She became a Muslim very early in Makka and migrated to Al-Madina. She died less than a month after the killing of her son Ibn Az-Zubair in 73H at the age of about 100 years, yet she neither lost a tooth nor had any mental problem.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]         Khaula bint Yasar was a Sahabiya and Abu Salama bin &#8216;Abdur-Rahman narrated the Hadith from her.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 4: Wudu (Ablution)</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">29.  Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Had I not feared burdening my Ummah (followers), I would have commanded them to use Siwak[1] (stick toothbrush) before every Salat (prayer).&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Malik, Ahmad and An-Nasa’i. Ibn Khuzaima graded it Sahih (sound) and Al-Bukhari mentioned as a Mu&#8217;allaq (suspended &#8212; without its chain of narrators)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">30.  Narrated Humran[2], the manumitted slave of &#8216;Uthman[3] (RA): &#8216;Uthman (رضي الله عنه) called for water to perform ablution. He washed palms of his hands three times, then rinsed his mouth and sniffed water in his nose and then blew it out. He then washed his face three times. Thereafter he washed his right hand up to his elbow three times[4] then the left one likewise, then he passed wet hands on his head. Then he washed his right foot up to the ankle three times, then the left one likewise. He then said, &#8220;I saw Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) performing ablution like this ablution of mine.&#8221; [Agreed upon]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">31.  Narrated &#8216;Ali[5] (رضي الله عنه), regarding the description of the ablution of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم): He (the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم) wiped his head (with water) only once[6].<br />
[Reported by Abu Da’ud, An-Nasa’i, At-Tirmidhi with a Sahih Sanad (authentic chain of narrators). At-Tirmidhi said, &#8220;It&#8217;s the most sound Hadith on this subject&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">32.  Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Zaid bin &#8216;Aasim[7] (رضي الله عنه) describing the nature of ablution performance: Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) wiped his head from the forehead to the back of his head and then back to the forehead[8] with his (wet) hands.<br />
[Agreed upon].<br />
And in another version of theirs: &#8220;He began from the front of his head and took them (his wet hands) to the back of his head and then returned them to the place he had begun from.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">33.  Narrated Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr[9] (رضي الله عنه), regarding the description of the ablution: &#8220;Then he (Allah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم) wiped his head, inserted his index finger in his ears and wiped the exterior of his ears with his thumbs.&#8221;[10]<br />
[Reported by Abu Da’ud and An-Nasa’i and Ibn Khuzaima graded it Sahih (sound)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">34.  Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;When one of you wakes up from his sleep, he must blow off his nose three times, for the Satan spends the night inside one&#8217;s nostrils&#8221;<br />
[11][Agreed upon]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">35.  Narrated (Abu Huraira رضي الله عنه): (Allah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم said,) &#8220;When one of you wakes up from his sleep, he must not put his hand in a utensil till he has washed it three times[12], for he does not know where his hand was (while he slept).&#8221;<br />
[Agreed upon. This is Muslim&#8217;s version]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">36.  Narrated Laqit bin Sabra (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Perform a perfect Wudu (ablution), run (your fingers) through the fingers of the hands and the toes[13], and if not fasting, sniff water up well inside the nose.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Al-Arba &#8216;a[14], and Ibn Khuzaima graded it Sahih (sound)]<br />
In another version of Abu Da’ud is: &#8220;If you perform ablution rinse your mouth.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">37.  Narrated &#8216;Uthman (رضي الله عنه): While performing Wudu, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) would run (his) fingers through his beard[15].<br />
[Reported by At-Tirmidhi, and Ibn Khuzaima graded it Sahih (sound)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">38.  Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Zaid (رضي الله عنه): Two-thirds of a <i>Mudd[16]</i> (of water) was brought to the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم (for ablution) so he began rubbing his arms.<br />
[Reported by Ahmad, and Ibn Khuzaima graded it Sahih (sound)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">39.  Narrated (&#8216;Abdullah bin Zaid رضي الله عنه): He saw the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم taking some water to wipe his ears other than the water he had taken to wipe his head.<br />
[Reported by Al-Baihaqi, who said that its <i>Isnad</i> (chain of narrators) is authentic, At-Tirmidhi also graded it Sahih (sound)]<br />
And the words of the Muslim version are: &#8220;he wiped his head taking extra water from that he had taken for the washing of the hands,&#8221; and this Hadith is Al-Mahfuz.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">40.  Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه):I heard Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) saying, &#8220;My people will come on the Day of Resurrection with bright faces, hands and feet from the traces of Wudu (ablution). If any of you can lengthen his brightness[17], let him do so.&#8221;<br />
[Agreed upon and this is Muslim&#8217;s version]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">41.  Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم· loved to begin with the right while putting on his shoes, combing his hair, in his purification and in all his affairs[18].<br />
[Agreed upon]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">42.  Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم said, &#8220;When you perform ablution, begin with your right limbs.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Al-Arba&#8217;a[19] and graded Sahih (sound) by Ibn Khuzaima]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">43.  Narrated Al-Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba[20][](رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) performed ablution and passed wet hands on his forelock, over the turban and over the two leather socks[21].<br />
[Reported by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">44.  Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah[22] (رضي الله عنه) regarding the Hajj (pilgrimage) of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم): He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Begin with what Allah had begun with.&#8221;[23]<br />
[Reported by An- Nasa’i in this commanding version while Muslim has reported it in the reporting[24] one]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">45.  Narrated (Jabir bin Abdullah رضي الله عنه): The Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم used to run the water down his elbows while performing ablution.<br />
[Reported by Ad-Daraqutni with a weak chain of narrators]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">46.  Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;There is no Wudu (ablution) for one who does not mention Allah&#8217;s Name upon it[25].&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Ahmad, Abu Da&#8217;ud and Ibn Majah with a weak chain of narrators].<br />
At-Tirmidhi reported something similar to the above from Sa&#8217;id bin Zaid[26], and Abu Sa&#8217;id like this, and Ahmad said that nothing is authenticated in it]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">47.  Narrated Talha bin Musarrif[27] quoting his father on the authority of his grandfather[28]: &#8220;I saw Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) rinsing his mouth and sniffing up and blowing his nose with separate scoops[29] of water.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Abi Da&#8217;ud with a weak chain of narrators].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">48.  Narrated &#8216;Ali (رضي الله عنه), regarding performance of Wudu (ablution): The Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم, rinsed his mouth and sniffed and blew (his nose) with water three times. He sniffed up and blew his nose with the same hand from which he took the water.<br />
[Reported by Abu Da’ud and An-Nasa&#8217;i]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">49.  Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Zaid (رضي الله عنه) regarding Wudu (ablution): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) put his hand (in the utensil) rinsed (his mouth) and sniffed up and blew (his nose) from one scoop (of water). He did that three times.<br />
[Agreed upon].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">50.  Narrated Anas (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) saw a man on whose foot appeared a portion like the size of a nail, which was not touched by water. He then said, &#8220;Go back and perform your Wudu (ablution) properly[30].&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Abu Da’ud and An-Nasa’i].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">51.  Narrated (Anas رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) · used only one <i>Mudd[31]</i> of water for ablution and one Sa'[32] to five Mudd of water for his bath.<br />
[Agreed upon].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">52.  Narrated Umar[33] (رضي الله عنه): &#8216;Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;If one after performing ablution completely recites the following supplication: (<i>Ash-hadu an la ilaha ill-Allau wahdahu 1a sharika lahu, wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan &#8216;abduhu wa Rasuluhu</i>) &#8216;I testify that there is no one worthy of worship but Allah, He is Alone and has no partner and Muhammad is His slave and Messenger,&#8217; all the eight gates of Paradise will be opened for him and he may enter through any gate he wishes.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Muslim and At-Tirmidhi who added the following words to the supplication: (<i>Allahumma aj &#8216;alni minAl-tawwabina waj&#8217;alni minAl-mutatahhirina</i>) &#8220;Oh Allah! Include me among those who repent and those who keep themselves pure&#8221;]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]           It means that the use of <i>Siwak</i> (tooth cleaning stick from the tree or the toothbrush) with every ablution is Sunna [the way of the noble Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم] and the Hadith reported by Muslim tells us that Siwak should be used before every prayer. It means that if anybody is going to offer prayers with ablution performed previously, even then he should use Siwak. These Ahadith prove extreme emphasis on the constant use of Siwak for the cleaning of teeth. It is Sunna (supererogatory) and not <i>Wajib</i> (compulsory).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]           Humran bin Aban was caught by Khalid bin Al-Walid in a war during Abu Bakr&#8217;s caliphate, and he sent him to serve &#8216;Uthman who freed him. He is trustworthy of the 2nd grade in the reporting of Ahadith. He died in 75 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]           The third Guided Caliph. He accepted Islam early and married Ruqaiya and then Umm Kulthum, daughters of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and was therefore nicknamed Dhun-Nuirain (the possessor of the two lights, i.e. the daughters of the Prophet h صلى الله عليه و سلم). He was killed as a martyr on Friday, 18th Dhul Hijja, 35H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]           In this Hadith washing of face, hands and feet is stated to be done three times each, whereas in others, two times and one time washing is regarded as enough. Imam Nawawi has written the consensus of opinions that washing once is Fard (obligatory).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]           The fourth Guided Caliph. He fought all the battles except Tabuk, for the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) had left him as in charge in Al-Madina. An evildoer called &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Muljam killed him as a martyr on Friday morning 17th Ramadan 40 H. at Kufa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]           It means that wiping of head (doing Mash) only once is obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]           He was an Ansari belonging to Bani Mazin from An-Najar clan. He fought at Uhud and killed Musailima Al-Kadhdhab together with Wahshi on Al-Yamama Day. He was killed on the day of Al-Harrah in 63 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]           This Hadith tells us that <i>Mash</i> (wiping) of head should be started from the front.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]           He is the son of&#8217; Amr bin Al&#8217;-Aas Al-Qurashi. He became a Muslim before his father who was older than him by 13 years. He was an Aalim (learned), memorized Ahadith and was very pious. He died in the 63 H. or 70 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]         It means that ears are to be wiped internally and externally. The side close to the head is external and near the face is internal. Tirmidhi after narrating the Hadith concerning wiping of ears internally and externally, says that religious scholars follow the same practice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]         Spending the night of Satan inside the nostrils of a man is plausible, but its actual state is better known to Allah and His Messenger. May be this is a figurative expression, because bad excretions gather in the nose and cause laziness, indolence, slackness and negligence. All these states are satanic dispositions</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12]         It means that hands should not be dipped in the ablution water container, as the word &#8216;ablution&#8217; is present in some of the Ahadith narrated by Bukhari. Allamah Ibn Hajar, in his book Fath Al-Bari, says: Though this Hadith apparently seems to be related with the utensils of ablution but it includes all other utensils and bathing water containers. But if there is a big pool or tank of water then it is permissible to put hands in it</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13]         It means that the fingers of hands and feet should be washed completely and carefully.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14]         Abu Da’ud, Tirmidhi, Nasa’i and Ibn Majah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15]         During the performance of ablution, combing of beard with fingers is Sunnah (supererogatory) and not Wajib (compulsory).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[16]         In some Ahadith, a full Mudd has been mentioned. One Mudd is a little more than six hundred grams. This is the least quantity of water mentioned for ablution; otherwise it will be very difficult to perform ablution with small amount of water. Maximum limit of water has not been ordained, any amount of water may be used for ablution and bath, but water should not be wasted</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[17]         It may have more than one meaning. It may mean washing of limbs more than the minimum limits, for example, washing of hands up to shoulders and washing of feet up to knees; Abu Huraira رضي الله عنه assumes this meaning. It may also mean that every limb should be washed three times, instead of washing it for one time &#8212; the minimum limit for washing. It may also mean to perform ablution again and again or to remain with ablution all the time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[18]         This mode of action of the noble Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم was for noble actions, for other actions like coming out of mosque and entering a toilet etc., one should put his left feet first.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[19]         Abu Da’ud, Tirmidhi, Nasa’i and Ibn Majah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[20]         Abu Abdullah or Abu Iesa, Al-Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba bin Mas&#8217;ud Ath-Thaqafi was a prominent Sahabi. He became a Muslim in the year of the Khandaq (trench) and migrated. He first participated in Al-Hudaibiya. He died in 50 H. in Kufa</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[21]         This Hadith makes it clear that wiping over turban (cap) is also correct. There are two forms of it. First, to wipe partly on the turban and partly on the head. There is no difference of opinion on this form of action. Secondly, to wipe only on turban. There is a difference of opinion on this, but this is also proved by Sahih Hadith narrated by Tirmidhi</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[22]         Jabir was an Ansari from Sulami clan and he was nicknamed Abu &#8216;Abdullah. He was among the eminent Sahaba. He fought at Badr though some said that he did not witness neither Badr nor Uhud, but took part in those battles that followed them. He was also at Siffin. He was among the memorizers of many Ahadith. He became blind towards the end of his life, and died in 74 H at the age of 94 years. It is reported that he was the last Sahabi to die at Al-Madina.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[23]         Noble Quran has mentioned As-Safa in the first place between As-Safa and Al-Marwa. The</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Noble Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) Started Sa&#8217;i (running between the Safa and Marwa during Hajj and &#8216;Umrah) from the Safa side, so start ablution in the same manner, starting from washing of the face, then hands up to elbows; then wipe the head and wash the feet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[24]         In this Hadith the word (bada) has been used in Arabic text, in the sense of giving information instead of order</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[25]         In this regard, there exist contradictory Ahadith, which indicate opposing views about saying (Bismillah) before performing ablution. Correct answer of this issue is to say <i>Bismillah</i> is Sunna.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[26]         He is Sa&#8217;id bin Zaid bin &#8216;Amr Al-Qurashi, nicknamed Abu Al-A&#8217;war and is one of the ten who were promised Paradise. He accepted Islam very early and was married to Fatima, the sister of &#8216;Umar, and they were both instrumental to &#8216;Umar becoming a Muslim. He fought all the battles except Badr, because he was away looking for the caravan. He died in 51 H. and was buried at Al-Baqi&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[27]         He is Abu Muhammad or Abu &#8216;Abdullah Talha bin Musarrif. He was a reliable Tabi&#8217;i (see glossary) of the 5th grade. He was a righteous reciter of the Quran, and died in 112 H. His father Musarrif is unknown and that has made this Hadith Da&#8217;if</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[28]         He is called Ka&#8217;b bin &#8216;Amr or Amr bin Ka&#8217;b bin Juhdub Al-Yami &#8212; descending from a Yamani tribe called Yam of Hamadan. Ibn &#8216;Abdul-Bar said he (Ka&#8217;b) settled in Kufa and is a Sahabi.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[29]         It means that the noble Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), used to take water separately for cleaning the nose and rinsing the mouth. According to the author, this Hadith is Da&#8217;if (weak). According to Al-Bukhari and Muslim, the noble Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم used a single handful of water for cleaning the nose and rinsing the mouth. Imam Nawawi has stated its five forms and regarded sound the one, Al-Bukhari and Muslim has stated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[30]         This Hadith makes it clear that washing of the whole foot is obligatory. In a Hadith recorded by Muslim, it is stated that it is Fire for that part of the foot, which is dry. In this Hadith, there is repudiation for those who consider the Mash (wiping) of foot as proper and acceptable; or those who consider the Mash (wiping) and Ghusl (washing) both compulsory; or those who consider Mash and Ghusl both permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[31]         One Mudd is equal to six hundred grams approx., and one Sa&#8217; is equal to a little more than two and a half kilograms, and this is the least quantity to be used. It means that one should be very careful in the use of water.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[32]         One Sa &#8216; is equivalent to 4 Mudd or 2660 grams</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[33]         The second Guided Caliph who was unique throughout history. He filled the world with wisdom, justice and conquests. He was Qurash&#8217;s ambassador during the <i>Jahiliya</i> (ignorance) period. He accepted Islam in Dhul Hijja, the 6th year of the Prophet-hood and fought all the battles. He made conquests in Iraq, Persia, Sham, Egypt and other places. He was killed by Abu Lu&#8217;lu&#8217;a, a slave of Al-Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba and died as a martyr on 1st Muharram 24H.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 5: Mash (Wiping) Over Khuffain<br />
(Two Leather Socks)</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba (رضي الله عنه): Once I was in the company of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), he then performed ablution and I dashed to take off his socks (Khuffain). He said, &#8220;Leave them for I had put them on after performing ablution[1].&#8221; So he wiped over them.<br />
[Agreed upon].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Al-Arba’a except An-Nasa’i: The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) wiped over the upper part of the leather socks and the under part of it.<br />
[In its chain of narrators there is weakness]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali (رضي الله عنه): If the religion were based on opinion,[2] it would be more important to wipe over the under parts of the leather socks than the upper, but I have seen Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) wiping over the upper parts of his leather socks.<br />
[Reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud with good Isnad (chain of narrators)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Safwan bin &#8216;Assal[3] (رضي الله عنه): When we were on a journey,[4] the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to command us to wear our leather socks for three days and three nights,[5] whether we had to answer the call of nature or slept. However, in case of ejaculation or sexual impurity, he commanded us to remove the leather socks.<br />
[Reported by An-Nasa&#8217;i and At-Tirmidhi, version is of the latter. With them Ibn Khuzaima graded it Sahih (sound)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) fixed the period of Mash (wiping) over the leather socks (Khuffain &#8212; plural of Khuff) for three days and nights for a traveler and one day and a night for the resident person in a town<br />
[Reported by Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Thawban[6] (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) sent out a military expedition and commanded them to wipe over the turbans[7] and leather socks.<br />
[Reported by Ahmad and Abu Da’ud. Al-Hakim graded it Sahih (sound)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Umar (رضي الله عنه) in a Mawquf (untraceable) and Anas in a Marfu &#8216; (traceable) Hadith: &#8220;If one of you performs ablution and puts on his two leather socks, let him perform Mash (wipe) over them (with water) and pray in them, and he may not take them off if he so wishes[8] except after ejaculation or sexual impurity.<br />
[Reported by Ad-Daraqutni and Al-Hakim and graded Sahih (sound) by him]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra[9] (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) gave permission for the traveler to perform Mash (wiping) over his leather socks for three days and nights and for a non-traveler for a day and a night, if he had put them on in a state of purity.<br />
[Reported by Ad-Daraqutni, and graded Sahih (sound) by Ibn Khuzaima]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ubai bin &#8216;Imara[10] (رضي الله عنه): I asked, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, may I wipe over the Khuffain (leather socks)?&#8221; The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) replied, &#8220;Yes&#8221;. I asked, &#8220;For one day?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;For one day&#8221;. I again asked, &#8220;And for two days?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;For two days too&#8221;. I again asked, &#8220;And for three days?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Yes, as long as you wish&#8221;.[11]<br />
[Reported by Abu Da’ud, who said, &#8220;It is not strong.&#8221;[12]]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]           Mash (wiping) over the socks is conditioned. One should have put on the socks after performing ablution, if socks have been worn without performing an ablution then wiping over the socks is not permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]           It means that the religious commands and prohibitions are based on Revelation and not on prudence. One cannot accept or reject the orders on their comprehension or incomprehension. It does not mean that the commands and prohibitions of religion are against the intellect and wisdom. It also proves that in the presence of a Sahih (authentic and sound) Hadith, giving a verdict against it is not allowed, that is why it has been clarified in Islamic Jurisprudence and its principles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]           Safwan bin ‘Assal Al-Muradi Al-Jumali was a well-known Sahabi who had accompanied the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) in twelve Ghazwat (expeditions). He settled at Kufa and it is said that among the Sahaba, only &#8216;Abdullah bin Mas’ud reported a Hadith from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]           Mash (wiping) over the socks is right, and permitted by Ahadith. There are more than eighty (80) Companions of the noble Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) who have narrated and spoke about this topic. &#8216;Ashra-e-Mubashshara (ten most pious companions of the noble Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم, who were given the glad tiding of Paradise in this world) are also included in the list of reporters. Ibn &#8216;Abdul-Barr has related the consensus of opinion concerning this issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]           It means that Mash (wiping) is allowed for a traveler up to three days and for a resident up to thirty-four hours. The time period for Mash starts from the nullification of ablution and not from the time of wearing the socks. The way of carrying out Mash (wiping) is to soak the hands with water and starting from the fingers, drawing it up to the calf of the leg. After the completion of permitted time and by passing of the wind, urine, etc., Mash nullifies, and is also cancelled by all those things, which cancel or nullify the ablution.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]           He is Thawban bin Bujdud bin Jahdar, who was nicknamed Abu &#8216;Abdullah. He was an inhabitant of As-Surat, which is a place between Makka and Al-Madina. It was also said that he was from Himyar. He stayed with the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) throughout his life, then settled in Sham and later on moved to Hims, in which he died in 54 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]           In Arabic text the word Asa&#8217;ib stands for a bandage, which is used for dressing of wounds; or in case of broken leg or arm, over the wooden strips around the broken bone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]           ‘If he so wishes&#8217; means within the permitted time for Mash (wiping). After the completion of Mash time, it is a must to take off the socks and perform ablution afresh and wash the feet too and put on the socks again then the time for Mash will start anew.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]           His name is Nufai&#8217; bin Al-Harith or bin Al-Masuh. He descended from Ta&#8217;if Fort together with a group of slaves and became a Muslim, whereupon the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) freed him. He was among the virtuous Sahaba and died at Basra in 51 H or 52 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]         Ubai bin &#8216;Imara was a Sahabi from the Ansar of Al-Madina. He settled in Egypt. Ibn Hibban said, &#8220;He prayed to the two Qiblah, but I do not take his report as a complete chain of narrators.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]         Sanad (transmitted chain) of this Hadith is not sound. That Hadith in which the period of one day (twenty-four hours) for a resident and three days for a traveler is granted is sound.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12]         This Hadith was not taken as evidence for its weakness and for contradicting the sound and good Hadith that fixed the durations. An-Nawawi has mentioned in Sharh Al- Muhadhdhab that the Imam have agreed on the weakness of this Hadith and Ahmad said, &#8221; Its narrators are unknown.&#8221;</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 6: The Nullification[1] of Wudu (Ablution)</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas (رضي الله عنه): The Companions of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) in his lifetime used to wait for the &#8216;<i>Isha</i> (night) prayer, so much so that their heads were lowered down (by dozing)[2]. They would then pray without performing ablution.[3]<br />
[Reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud and Ad- Daraqutni graded it Sahih (sound). Its origin is in Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): Fatima bint Abu Hubaish[4] came to the Prophet r (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, I am a woman whose blood keeps flowing (even after the menstruation period).[5] I am never purified; should I, therefore, stop praying?&#8221; He (the Prophet) said, &#8220;No, for that is only a vein, and is not menstruation. So when the menstruation comes, abstain from prayers, and when it ends, wash the blood from your self and then pray.&#8221;<br />
[Agreed upon].<br />
Al-Bukhari’s version adds: &#8220;Then perform ablution for every prayer,&#8221;[6] and Muslim admitted that he dropped this addition deliberately.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali bin Abi Talib (رضي الله عنه): I was one whose <i>Madhi</i> (urethral discharge)[7] flowed readily and asked Miqdad[8] to ask the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) about it. He (the Prophet) said: &#8220;One should perform Wudu (ablution) in this case.&#8221;<br />
[Agreed upon and this is Al-Bukhari&#8217;s version]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) kissed[9] one of his wives and went to pray without performing (fresh) ablution.<br />
[Reported by Ahmad, and Al-Bukhari graded it Da’if (weak)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;If one of you feels disturbance in his stomach and doubts whether he has released some air or not, then he should not leave the mosque unless he hears its sound or smells (its) odor.[10]&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Talq bin &#8216;Ali[11] (رضي الله عنه): A man said: &#8220;I touched my penis&#8221; or he said, &#8220;Does a man who touch his penis during the prayer should perform <i>Wudu</i> (ablution)?&#8221; The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), replied, &#8220;No, it is only a part of your body.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Al-Khamsa[12]. Ibn Hibban graded it Sahih (sound) and Ibn Al-Madini said, &#8220;It is better than the Hadith of Busra&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Busra bint Safwan[13] (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;He who touches his penis should perform ablution.&#8221;[14]<br />
[Reported by Al-Khamsa, and At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Hibban graded it Sahih (sound), and Al-Bukhari said, &#8220;It is the most authentic (Hadith) in this chapter&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Whoever vomits, bleeds through the nose[15], or releases <i>Madhi</i>(urethral discharge) should go, perform ablution and then complete his <i>Salat</i> (prayer)[16] (by continuing from where he had stopped at) on condition that he does not speak in the process.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Ibn Majah, and Ahmad and others graded it Da&#8217;if].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin Samura[17] (رضي الله عنه): A man asked the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), &#8220;Should I perform ablution after eating mutton?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;If you wish so&#8221;, he then asked, &#8220;Should I perform ablution after eating camel meat?[18] He(صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: &#8220;Whoever washes a dead person[19] should take a bath (thereafter); and whoever carries it should perform ablution.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Ahmad, An-Nasa’i and At-Tirmidhi who graded it Hasan (fair). And Ahmad said that there is no authentic <i>Hadith</i> in this chapter]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah bin Abu &#8216;Bakr[20] (رضي الله عنه): The book written by Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) for &#8216;Amr bin Hazm[21] also contained: &#8220;None except a pure person should touch the Quran[22].<br />
[Reported by Malik as a <i>Mursal</i> and by An-Nasa’i and Ibn Hibban as <i>Mawsul</i>. And it is graded as <i>Ma&#8217;lul</i> (defective)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to mention A11ah&#8217;s Name (praise Him) at all times.[23]<br />
[Reported by Muslim and Al-Bukhari recorded it as Mu&#8217;allaq (suspended)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) had blood extracted from his body[24] and offered the prayer and did not perform (a new) ablution.<br />
[Reported by Ad-Daraqutni who graded it Da’if (weak)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Mu’awiya[25] (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;The eye (when awake) is the string of anus (to stop air escaping), and if the two eyes sleep the string is untied.&#8221;[26]<br />
[Reported by Ahmad and At-Tabardni who added, &#8220;Whoever sleeps should perform ablution.]&#8221; Also reported by Abu Da’ud mentioning the above addition without the words &#8220;the string is untied&#8221;, but both versions are weak]. And Ibn &#8216;Abbas (رضي الله عنه), narrated in a <i>Marfu&#8217;</i> (traceable) Hadith that: &#8220;Ablution is necessary for one who sleeps while he is lying flat[27].&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud and there is weakness in its chain of narrators]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Satan comes to one of you in Salat (prayer) and blows air in his bottom, so he imagines that he has released air yet he did not. So if he gets that feeling he should not leave his prayer unless he hears the sound (of the air) or smells its odor.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Al-Bazzar] . It is originally from the <i>Sahihain</i> of Bukhari and Muslim as the Hadith narrated by &#8216;Abdullah bin Zaid. And Muslim reported by Abu Huraira likewise. And Abu Sa&#8217;id narrated in a Marfu&#8217; Hadith: &#8220;If Satan comes to one of you and says: &#8216;You have nullified your ablution (by releasing air)&#8217;, let him say: &#8216;You have lied.'&#8221; [Reported by Al-Hakim]. Ibn Hibban also reported the above Hadith with the version: &#8220;Let him say in his heart&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]           All those causes which invalidate the Wudu (ablution) also invalidate the <i>Tayammum </i>(purification with clean soil in case the water is not available).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]           It proves that ablution is not cancelled by dozing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]           Sleep invalidates the ablution or not, is a controversial issue. In this matter final decision is that with a sound sleep ablution is nullified, otherwise not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]           Fatima bint Abu Hubaish is a <i>Sahabiya</i> from <i>Quraish</i> and then <i>Asad</i>. Her father is Qais bin &#8216;Abdul-Muttalib bin Asad bin &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Uzza bin Qusai. She was a renowned <i>Muhajira</i> and was married to &#8216;Abdullah bin Jahsh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]           Vaginal bleeding is of three types: 1) <i>Haid</i> &#8211; Blood of regular monthly menstrual course which starts at the age of puberty. This type of blood ceases during the period of pregnancy. 2) <i>Nifas</i> &#8211; Puerperal blood coming after the childbirth, it lasts maximum for forty days. 3) <i>Istihada</i> &#8211; The blood which may happen to come differently from the above two types. Here it means the last mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]           It means that the <i>Istihada</i> blood invalidates the ablution, that is why the noble Prophet (PUH), ordered to perform a fresh ablution for every prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]           Madhi is a white water like lubricant, which oozes out involuntarily at the time of sexual desire. This urethral discharge invalidates the ablution, but is not a cause for obligatory bath</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]           Miqdad bin &#8216;Amr bin Tha&#8217;laba Al-Bahrani was nicknamed Abul-Aswad or Abu &#8216;Amr and is known as Al-Miqdad bin Al-Aswad. Al-Aswad bin Yaghuth Az-Zuhri had fostered and entered into a defense agreement with Miqdad in the Jahiliya days. He was among the virtuous, wise and eminent Sahaba. He was the sixth Muslim, made the two migrations and attended all the major battles. He was a horseman during Badr and participated in the conquest of Egypt. He died at the age of 70 in 33 H. at Al-Jauf, three miles from Al- Madina so he was carried to Al-Madina, &#8216;Uthman offered his Funeral prayer, and was buried at Al-Baqi&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]           This Hadith confirms that ablution is not cancelled by touching a woman with or without lust. This is supported by a reporting of Imam Bukhari narrated by &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was praying in the darkness and I was laying at rest while my feet were at the place where the Prophet prostrated (on his prayer mat). At the time of prostration he would touch my feet and I would remove them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]         This Hadith points out an important principle that everything remains at its command until there is something certain against it. Suspicion carries no weight, whether one is in prayer or not</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]         He is Abi Ali Talq bin Ali bin Talq bin &#8216;Amr Al-Hanafi As-Siheimi Al-Yamami. He visited the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) as soon as he arrived at Al-Madina and worked with him in building the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12]         Ahmad, Abu Da’ud, Tirmidhi, Nasa’i and Ibn Majah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13]         Busra bint Safwan bin Naufal bin Asad bin &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Uzza Al-Qurashiya Al-Asadiya was a Sahabiya, among the first Muslims, migrated early and lived till the caliphate of <i>Mu&#8217;awiya</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14]         Foregoing Hadith of Talq bin Ali seems to be contradictory to this, but infect it is not. If the organ is touched uncovered or with lustful intention, then the ablution is nullified, otherwise not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15]         This Hadith is Da’if (weak), and there is no Sahih (sound) Hadith concerning this issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[16]         It means that if a man prayed two <i>Rak&#8217;a</i> with the <i>Imam</i> (leader of prayer) and it happens that his ablution is cancelled. He leaves the prayer and after making a fresh ablution joins again with the <i>Imam</i> in the same part of prayer where he left, then he should finish the prayer with <i>Imam</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[17]         He is a famous Sahabi and the son of Sa&#8217;d bin Abi Waqqas&#8217; sister. He settled at Kufa and built a house there. He died in 74 H. or 66 H. His father Samura bin Junada As-Sawai Al. &#8216;Aamiri is also a Sahabi.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[18]         Some people mean by this the complete ablution and others mean only the rinsing of mouth. Latter view is correct because the noble Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) pointed out fat as its cause and fat always sticks in the mouth only.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[19]     Concerning this issue there is no authentic Hadith. Some say that bath is compulsory on one who bathes the dead body, some others are of the opinion that it is just desirable; while to others ablution is compulsory, and there are still others who consider it also not necessary.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[20]         &#8216;Abdullah bin Abu Bakr bin Muhammad bin &#8216;Amr bin Hazm Al-Ansari Al-Madani Al- Qadi was a Tabi&#8217;i of the 5th grade. He died in 135 H. at the age of 70 years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[21]         He is a Khazraji, a Najari and is nicknamed Abu Ad-Dahhak. He first took part in Al-Khandaq and the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) sent him to Najran to teach the people about the religion and collect their <i>Sadaqat</i>. He wrote for them a book containing the obligatory and voluntary acts, the <i>Sadaqat</i> and the blood wit, and this is the book mentioned in the Hadith. He died in Al-Madina after the fifties</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[22]         <i>Hadath</i> <i>Akbar</i> (sexual discharge) and <i>Hadath</i> <i>Asghar</i> (passing wind, urine or defecation) both make the purification due, if Hadath (impurity) is the result of coition then it is unanimously agreed not to touch the noble Quran, but there is a difference of opinion in doing that without ablution.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[23]         The times of answering the call of nature, urination and coition are not included. In the state of being impure by coition, remembrance and pronouncing the Name of Allah is permissible, but touching and reciting the noble Quran is prohibited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[24]         This Hadith clarifies that bleeding except from two (vagina and anus) does not invalidate the ablution. Ahadith of same class have also been narrated by Ibn &#8216;Umar, Ibn &#8216;Abbas and Abi Aufa (رضي الله عنه)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[25]         Both him and his father Abu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb became Muslims at the conquest of Makka. &#8216;Umar appointed him as the governor of Sham after the death of his brother Yazid bin Abu Sufyan and he remained so until &#8216;Ali came out in order to dispose him by force and he was sworn as the caliph when Al-Hasan stepped down in his favor in the year 40 H. He died in <i>Rajab</i> 60 H. at the age of 78 years</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[26]         It means sleep is a cause of Hadath (impurity) and not Hadath itself</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[27]         It means that sleeping in the flat position results in the invalidation of ablution, whereas in the foregoing Hadith mere sleep is described as the factor of invalidation. Sleeping in the flat position is an indication of sound sleep, when all the organs of body are at rest, it enhances the possibility of uncontrolled passing of wind; while in a light sleep or napping one is not completely unconscious.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 7: The Manners of Answering<br />
the Call of Nature</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to remove his ring[1] when entering the lavatory.<br />
[Reported by Al-Arba&#8217;a[2], and it is defective]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated (Anas) (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) on entering the lavatory used to say[3]: [<i>Alla’humma inni a&#8217;udhu bika minal khubthi wal khaba&#8217;ithi</i>] &#8220;O Allah, I seek refuge with you from devils &#8211; males and females (or all offensive and wicked things, evil deeds and evil spirits, etc.).&#8221;<br />
[Reported by As-Sab&#8217;a].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated (Anas) (رضي الله عنه): Whenever Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) went to the privy, a servant and I used to carry a skin water container and a spear, and he would cleanse himself with the water[4]<br />
[Agreed upon]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) told me, &#8220;Take the skin water container&#8221;, he then went forward till he disappeared[5] from me and relieved himself.<br />
[Agreed upon].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Safeguard your selves from the two matters which cause ac cursing that befalls the one who relieves himself on people&#8217;s path-ways[6] and under the shades.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Muslim]<br />
Narrated Mu’adh[7] (رضي الله عنه): He (the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: &#8220;Guard against the three things which cause curse (i.e.) defecating at the watering places, on the roadbeds and in the shades.&#8221;[8]<br />
[Reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud]. Ahmad reported from Ibn Abbas (رضي الله عنه) that defecation is prohibited also at the place where water collects.<br />
[And both the two (i.e. the previous and this Hadith) have weakness.<br />
And Ibn &#8216;Umar (رضي الله عنه) the prohibition of relieving oneself under fruity trees and on the bank of a flowing river.<br />
[Reported by At-Tabardni with a weak chain of narrators]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;When two people go together to relieve themselves they should disappear from each other and do not talk, for Allah detests that.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Ahmad; Ibn As-Sakan and Ibn Al-Qattan graded it Sahih (sound) but &#8216;it is defective[9]].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Qatada (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Nobody should touch his penis with his right hand[10] when urinating, and should not clean himself (from defecation or urine) using his right hand and should not breathe in the utensil (he is drinking from).&#8221;<br />
[Agreed upon. This version is of Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salman[11] (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) forbade us to face the <i>Qiblah</i> when defecating or urinating, or to clean ourselves using the right hand, or to clean ourselves with less than three stones, or to clean ourselves with dung or a bone.<br />
[Reported by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Ayub[12] (رضي الله عنه): (Allah&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم said,) &#8220;Neither face nor turn your back to the Qiblah[13] while defecating or urinating, but turn towards the east or the west.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by the As-Sab&#8217;a]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;If anyone goes to relieve himself, he should conceal himself.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated (&#8216;Aisha رضي الله عنه): When the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) came out of the privy, he used to say, &#8220;<i>Ghufra’naka</i> (O Allah! Grant me Your forgiveness).&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Al-Khamsa[14]. Abu Hatim and Al-Hakim graded it Sahih (sound)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Mas’ud (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) went out to answer the call of nature and asked me to bring three stones. I found two stones and searched for the third but could not find it. So I took a dried piece of dung and brought it to him. He took the two stones and threw away the dung[15] and said, &#8220;This is a filthy thing&#8221;.<br />
[Reported by Al-Bukhari. And in the version of Ahmad and Ad-Daraqutni it is added: &#8220;Bring me more[16] (something other than dung)&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) forbade us to use a bone or dung for cleaning and said, &#8220;These two things do not purify.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Ad-Daraqutni who graded it Sahih (sound)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): A11ah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Beware of (smearing yourselves with) urine, because it is the main cause of punishment in the grave.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Ad-Daraqutni]<br />
and Al-Hakim reported that: &#8220;Urination is the main cause of punishment in the grave&#8221;.<br />
[Its chain of narrators is authentic]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sura’qa bin Malik[17] (رضي الله عنه): A11ah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) educated us about lavatory (manners) that we should sit on our left foot[18] and keep erect our right foot.<br />
[Reported by Al-Baihaqi through a chain of weak narrators][19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Iesa bin Yazdad[20] from his father (رضي الله عنه,): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;When one of you passes urine, he should empty his penis three times.&#8221;<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) asked the residents of Quba’ that what had earned them the Praise of Allah and they replied, &#8220;We use water after (cleaning ourselves with) stones.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Al-Bazzar with <i>Da&#8217;if</i> chain of narrators and its <i>Asl</i> (original source) is in Abu Da’ud and At-Tirmidhi, and Ibn Khuzaima graded it Sahih (sound) through Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه) without mentioning the &#8220;stones.&#8221;]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]           On that ring “Allah’s Messenger Muhammad” (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was carved in three lines. It means that Names of Allah and the verses of noble Quran in the written form should not be carried to the lavatory or while going out to answer the call of nature.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]           Abu Da’ud, Tirmidhi, Nasa’i and Ibn Majah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]           Usually <i>jinns</i> live in such filthy places, for that reason the noble Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) sought the refuge of Allah. Before entering the lavatory one should recite this prayer in an audible voice. According to the narration of Anas (رضي الله عنه), in wilds or in jungle, one should recite this prayer before sitting for the call of nature. During the call of nature one should also be careful about one&#8217;s body and clothes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]           Most of the people [religious scholars] prefer to purify with clod of mud and water both.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]           This action of the noble Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) guides that while going out for the call of nature, it is necessary to arrange some kind of privacy and be hidden from others. In another Hadith, it is stated that in an open space, a mound of soil or a heap of sand should be made for the purpose of screening. If someone eases himself in an open, Satan will laugh at his buttocks and will make him a laughing stock of people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]           It is prohibited to answer the call of nature near pathways or near the ways in the vicinity of populated areas. Sites of abandoned road or deserted place can be used for the purpose</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]           Mu’adh is an <i>Ansari</i> of Al-Khazraj tribe and was one of the virtuous, noble and most learned Sahaba. He attended Al-&#8216;Aqaba, Badr and other major battles. The Prophet ·(صلى الله عليه و سلم) appointed him as his representative in Yemen. Then &#8216;Umar appointed him as the governor of Sham after Abu &#8216;Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah. He died in the plague of <i>Amwa’s</i> in 17H or 18 H at the age of 38.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]           Altogether these are six places. It is forbidden in a <i>Hadith</i> to answer the call of nature or to urinate near the gates of the mosques.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]           This is confirmed by other authentic <i>Ahadith</i>, so it is correct.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]         Handling the male organ with right hand during urination or washing, and breathing in the utensils during drinking is prohibited according to some, while according to others it is undesirable. Breathing in the utensil is harmful because this is the cause of transmission of germs from one to another, and the Hadith which informs about three pauses while drinking means drink should be taken slowly and not at a gulp.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]         He was known as &#8220;Salman the benevolent&#8221; and was nicknamed Abu &#8216;Abdullah. His origin is from Persia. He traveled in search of a religion and became a Christian. Then he moved to Al-Madina and believed in the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) as soon as he arrived at Al-Madina He was a leader in Islam and died in Al-Madina in 50 H or 32 H. It is reported that he lived long for either 250 or 350 years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12]         His name is Khalid bin Zaid bin Kulaib. He hosted the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) when he first arrived in Al-Madina. He was one of the senior and most great <i>Sahaba</i>. He attended Badr and was martyred while taking part in an expedition against the Byzantinians in 50 H. His grave, situated at the walls of Istanbul, is well known and visited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13]         In this issue &#8216;Forbiddance&#8217; is for open places, it is not forbidden in inside the building where there are walls around. As there is a Hadith narrated by &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar (رضي الله عنه). He narrates: &#8220;In the house of my sister Hafsa, I went upstairs on the roof, I saw the noble Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) answering the call of nature, he was facing towards Sham.&#8221; This Hadith is of Sahih Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14]         The Collectors of Hadith: Ahmad, Abu Da’ud, An-Nasa’i, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15]         It is known from this Hadith that one should not clean the private parts with dung or excrement of animals, and so it is forbidden to clean with bones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[16]         The mentioned addition proves that for cleanliness three clods of mud are needed, even though two may suffice, but the condition of three is a must. More than three may be used if needed, but the number should be odd. This Hadith also proves that dung cannot be used for cleaning private parts, likewise cleaning by bones is also prohibited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[17]         Sura’qa bin Malik bin Ju&#8217;shum Al-Mudlaji Al-Kinani, nicknamed Abu Sufyan was a prominent Sahabi. He was the one who traced Allah’s Messenger (رضي الله عنه) on his way to migration whereupon the forelegs of his horse sunk into the ground up to the knees. He died in 24 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[18]         There is always advisability in every command of Islam, whether we comprehend it or not The noble Prophet b (صلى الله عليه و سلم) instructed us to sit on the left foot (to put weight of the body on left foot) while sitting for answering the call of nature; as the stomach is on the left side, it makes the action easy; and the constipation, the mother of diseases, is also eradicated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[19]         This Hadith is weak because there are unknown narrators in its chain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[20]         &#8216;Iesa and his father Yazdad are both unknown. Ibn Ma&#8217;in said, &#8221; &#8216;Iesa and his father are unknown.”</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 8: Taking Ghusl (Bath) and the Precepts Regarding Sexual Impurity.</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: &#8220;The water (of the Ghusl is due to the water (of sexual emission)”[1].<br />
[Reported by Muslim and its <i>Asl</i> (origin) is in Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): AllahÐh&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said that, &#8220;If one of you sits between her legs (of a woman) and penetrates her[2], Ghusl (bath) is obligatory.&#8221;<br />
[Agreed upon]<br />
And Muslim added: &#8220;Even if he does not ejaculate.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Umm Salama (رضي الله عنه): Umm Sulaim[3], the wife of Abu Talha said, &#8220;O Allah’s Messenger! (صلى الله عليه و سلم) A11ah is not ashamed of the truth. Is a Ghusl (bath) compulsory for a woman when she has a sexual dream.&#8221;[4] He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) replied, &#8220;Yes! When she sees signs of liquid.&#8221;<br />
[Agreed upon.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) Said about the precept of a woman having ejaculation during sleep like a man, &#8220;She should take a Ghusl (bath)&#8221;.<br />
[Agreed upon]<br />
Added Muslim: Umm Salama said, &#8220;Does this happen (to a woman)?&#8221; He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Yes, otherwise where does the resemblance (of a child to its mother) come from)[5]?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to take a bath from four things; after sexual intercourse, on Fridays, after extracting blood from his body and after washing a dead body.[6].<br />
[Reported by Abu Da’ud and Ibn Khuzaima graded it Sahih (sound)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه), regarding the story of Thumama bin Utha’l[7] when he embraced Islam: The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ordered him to take a bath.[8]<br />
[Narrated by Abdur- Razzaq and its origin is in Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">100. Narrated Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Taking a bath on Friday is a must for every adult&#8221;.<br />
[Reported by As-Sab&#8217;a[9]].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">101. Narrated Samura[10] [2] (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Whoever performs ablution on Friday has done a good thing and he who takes bath, taking bath is better (for him).&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Al-Khamsa[11] and At-Tirmidhi graded it Hasan (fair)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">102. Narrated &#8216;Ali (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to teach us the Quran except when he was in a state of sexual impurity[12].<br />
[Reported by Ahmad and Al-Arba’a·. This is the version of At-Tirmidhi who graded it Hasan (fair). And Ibn Hibban graded it Sahih (sound)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">103. Narrated Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;If one of you has sexual intercourse with his wife, and wishes to repeat he should perform ablution [1] [13]between them.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Muslim.]<br />
Al-Hakim added: &#8220;Ablution makes one active for repeating (the sexual act).&#8221;<br />
Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to sleep in the state of sexual impurity without touching water[14].<br />
[Reported by Al-Arba &#8216;a. This Hadith is defective.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">104. Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): Whenever Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) took Ghusl (bath) after sexual intercourse, he would begin by washing his hands, then pour water with his right hand on his left hand and wash his sexual organ. He would then perform ablution, then take some water and run his fingers through the roots of his hair. Then he would pour three handfuls on his head, then pour water over the rest of his body and subsequently wash his feet.<br />
[Agreed upon and this version is of Muslim]. Narrated Maimuna (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) poured water over his private parts and washed them with his left hand. He then struck his hand against the earth. In another version: &#8216;He rubbed it on the earth.&#8217; And in the last of this version: “Then I brought him a towel[15] but he returned it and kept wiping off the water with his hand.”<br />
[Agreed upon].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">105. Narrated Umm Salama (رضي الله عنه): I said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, I am a woman with tightly plaited hair on my head; should I undo it for taking a bath from sexual intercourse?<br />
&#8220;In another version is: &#8220;from menstruation?&#8221; He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;No, it is enough for you to throw three handfuls of water[16] on your head&#8221;.<br />
[Reported by Muslim.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">106. Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;I do not permit a woman in menstrual condition[17][3] or anyone in a state of sexual impurity to (enter) the mosque&#8221;.[18]<br />
[Reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud and Ibn Khuzaima graded it Sahih (sound)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">107.     Narrated (&#8216;Aisha رضي الله عنه): I and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) took a Ghusl (bath) due to sexual impurity from the same vessel and our hands alternated into it.<br />
[Agreed upon.] Ibn Hibban added &#8220;and (our hands) met.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">108. Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;There is sexual impurity under every hair[19], so wash the hair and cleanse the skin.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud and At-Tirmidhi who both graded it Da&#8217;if (weak); and in the version of Ahmad, a similar Hadith is narrated by &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه), and in the chain is one narrator who is <i>Majhul</i> (unknown)].</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]           It means after seminal discharge, taking of bath is essential and obligatory. This Hadith is linked only with &#8216;night discharge&#8217; and not with coition. Most of the religious scholars believe in it. Ubai bin K&#8217;ab said that in the early period of Islam, in case of coition, taking of bath was not obligatory until the seminal discharge happened, but afterwards this order was abrogated. Some of the research scholars have reported the consensus of Muslims on this issue that as soon as coition is started, taking of Ghusl (bath) becomes obligatory, whether seminal discharge occurs or not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]           It means that with the start of coitus, taking of Ghusl (bath) becomes obligatory. This Hadith cancels the previous one, if linked with coition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]           Her name is Ar-Rumaisa&#8217; or Al-Ghumaisa&#8217; bint Milha’n, Anas bin Malik&#8217;s mother. She was among the virtuous Sahabiyat. She was married to Malik bin An-Nasr, then she became a Muslim and invited him to Islam, but he became angry and went to Sham where he died. She was then proposed to by Abu Talha while still a Mushrik, but she made a condition that he should become a Muslim, so he became one and married her. She died during the caliphate of&#8217; Uthman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]           As Men, women also have “wet dreams”, so taking bath is obligatory for them too.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]           It means that women also have seminal discharge otherwise how a child can take after the mother? Resemblance of children to their parents is on account of potency of semen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] Among all these four, taking bath after coition is <i>Fard</i> (obligatory), on Friday is <i>Sunna </i>(the way of noble Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم) and the rest of the two are <i>Mustahab </i>(desirable). Ahadith regarding obligation of Friday bath are more authentic, therefore, those are to be followed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]           Thumama bin Utha’l was from Banu Hanifa and the chief of Al-Yamama people. He went to perform &#8216;Umrah while still a Mushrik and was captured by some horsemen of the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم). They brought him to Al-Madina and tied him to one of the mosque&#8217;s pillars. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) released him after three days. He then became a devoted Muslim and stood firm, during the <i>Ridda</i> (apostasy) days, against his people who were cheated by Musailima Al-Kadhdhab.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]           When a non-Muslim embraces Islam, it is obligatory for him to take a bath. Abu Da’ud reported that the noble Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ordered Thumama to take a bath, when he embraced Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]           Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Da’ud, Tirmidhi, Nasa’i, Ibn Majah and Musnad Ahmad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] Samura bin Jundub is a well-known Sahabi nicknamed Abu .Abdullah. He was a Fazari and an ally of the <i>Ansar</i>. He was also one of the memorizers who narrated many Ahadith. He settled at Basra and was very harsh against Al-Haruriya. He died rewards the end of the year 59 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] Abu Da’ud, Tirmidhi, Nasa’i, Ibn Majah and Musnad Ahmad</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12] From this Hadith and from others it is proved that reading of noble Quran for a person, needing post-coition Ghusl (bath) is not right.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] This ablution is desirable and not essential, it also brings about a pleasure and freshness in mood. It is reported that if the noble Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to his different wives in one night, he used to take a Ghusl (bath) after going to each of them. It is also reported that he performed ablution in between and sometimes he did not. So, in this matter one can choose any mode.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14] It means that before going to sleep, ablution is not essential for a <i>Junubi</i> (a man in the post-discharge state). There is a Hadith from Bukhari regarding this issue that the noble Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to perform ablution before eating, drinking or sleeping. Therefore, it is better to follow the way of the noble Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) though it is merely preferable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15] The issue of drying the limbs after performing ablution is discretionary, therefore, it depends on the choice whether to dry or not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[16] This Hadith makes it clear that for a menstruating woman and Junubi (a man in the post-discharge state) it is not essential to unravel the hair. There is another Hadith from &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه), in which untying of hair is reported. Both the Ahadith are for different occasions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[17] A menstruating woman is not allowed to enter a mosque and circumambulate the Sacred Ka&#8217;ba. She should not pray or fast in this period. Prayers of this period are pardoned but she must fast later on. Reading and touching the noble Quran is also prohibited. She should also not recite a complete verse .f Quran at a time. Remembrance of Allah is allowed to her. She can participate in invocation upon Allah with other Muslims. She is allowed to go to the place of Eid prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[18] It means that a menstruating woman and a man in post-discharge state is not allowed to stay in a mosque but passing through is allowed. If somebody gets discharged as a result of wet dream during a sleep in a mosque, it is essential for him to go out. This is unanimously agreed upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[19] We come to know by this Hadith that it is obligatory to wash the whole body after having a sexual intercourse except rinsing of mouth and putting water in the nose because these two are controversial.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 9: Tayammum (Purification with Soil)</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">109.    Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;I have been given five things which were not given to anyone else before me. Allah made me victorious by awe (of frightening my enemies) for a distance of one month&#8217;s journey. The earth has been made for me (and my followers) a place for praying and purification (performing <i>Tayammum</i>). Therefore, anyone (of my followers) should pray wherever the time of Salat (prayer)[1] becomes due.&#8221;[2]<br />
In the version of Muslim narrated by Hudhaifa: &#8220;The soil[3] of the earth has been made for us as a means of purification when we do not find water.&#8221;<br />
In the version of Ahmad narrated by &#8216;Ali (رضي الله عنه): &#8220;The soil has been made for us a means of cleansing.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ammar bin Yasir[4] (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) sent me on an errand, then I had ejaculation (in my sleep) and I did not find water. (For performing Tayammum) I rolled on the soil like an animal. Then I returned to the Prophet and mentioned that to him. He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;It was sufficient for you to do with your hands this way&#8221;. He then struck his hands once on the soil and then rubbed the left hand on the right and the exterior part of his palms and his face.<br />
[Agreed upon. The version is that of Muslim].<br />
And in the version of Al-Bukhari: &#8216;He (Allah&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم) struck the earth with his palms of both hands[5] and then blew the dust and rubbed his palms of both hands over his face and hands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Tayammum (purifying with the soil) consists of two strikings[6], of the soil, one for the face and one for the hands up to the elbows.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Ad-Daraqutni, and the <i>Imam</i> graded it <i>Sahih</i> as Mawquf</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;The soil is a means of ablution for a believing Muslim, even if he does not find water for ten years[7]; but when he finds water he should guard against disobeying Allah and let it touch his skin.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by AI-Bazzar, and Al-Qattan graded it <i>Sahih</i>  (sound).  But Ad-Daraqutni approved it as <i>Mursal</i>, At-Tirmidhi also reported a similar version on the authority of Abu Dhar,[8] which he authenticated and so did Al-Hakim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri (رضي الله عنه): Two men set out on a journey and when the time of Salat (prayer) came they had no water. They performed Tayammum with clean earth and prayed. Later on they found water within the time of the prayer.  One of them repeated the prayer and ablution but the other did not repeat. Then they came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم), and related the matter to him. Addressing himself to the one who did not repeat, he said, &#8220;You followed the Sunna and your (first) prayer was enough for you.&#8221;[9] He said to the one who performed ablution and repeated: &#8220;For you there is a double reward&#8221;.[10]<br />
[Reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud and An-Nasa&#8217;i]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas (رضي الله عنه) regarding the explanation of the Words of Allah “And if you are ill[11] or on a journey&#8230;” If a man sustains a wound in the cause of Allah and an injury, then becomes sexually impure and fears death if he takes Ghusl (bath), he should perform Tayammum.<br />
[Reported by Ad- Daraqutni in a <i>Mawqu</i>f (untraceable) <i>Hadith</i> and Al-Bazzar in a <i>Marfu&#8217;</i> (traceable) one. Ibn Khuzaima and Al-Hakim graded it <i>Sahih</i> (sound)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali (رضي الله عنه): One of my forearms was broken. Then I asked Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and he ordered me to wipe over the bandages.[12]<br />
[Reported by Ibn Majah with a very weak chain of narrators].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir (رضي الله عنه) concerning the man who had sustained a cut on his head and took a bath and died: (Allah&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم said) &#8220;It was enough for him to perform Tayammum then bind a bandage over the wound and wipe water on it and then wash the rest of his body.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud, its chain is <i>Da&#8217;if</i> and there is disagreement concerning its narrator].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas (رضي الله عنه): It is the Sunna that a person should not pray more than once [13]with a (one) Tayammum and he should perform Tayammum for the next Salat (prayer).<br />
[Reported by Ad-Daraqutni with a very weak chain of narrators][14]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]           It means that if water is not available, one should not miss the first part of prayer time in search of water.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]           Other three things are: a) Booty has been made lawful; b) Intercession on the Day of Judgment; c) Messengership for the whole universe</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]           Soil and all other things from the kind of soil are regarded as same and <i>Tayammum</i> is permissible with them, but things like lime, antimony and arsenic, etc. do not fall in the kind of soil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]           &#8216;Ammar was nicknamed Abul-Yaqzan, and was among the most senior and early Muslims, and was tortured in Makka for his Faith. He made the two migrations and took part in Badr and all the other important battles. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) told him, &#8220;O &#8216;Ammar, the transgressive party will kill you.&#8221; This happened in Siffin in 36 H. when he was with &#8216;Ali and he was killed by some soldiers of Mu’awiya at the age of 73 years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]           This Hadith argues about Tayammum (purification with soil). Religious elites are of the opinion that one stroke on earth is enough for face and both hands. Some others say that two strokes are essential, one for face and the other for hands as is mentioned in the next Hadith. But all Ahadith, which mention ‘two strokes’, are Da’if (weak).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]           The scholars of Ahadith have regarded this Hadith as <i>Da’if</i> (weak), and all its chains are also weak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]           It means that at the time of necessity soil is a complete substitute of water and fulfills all purposes of purification whether it concerns ablution, or <i>Ghusl</i> (bath). With one <i>Tayammum</i> many obligatory acts can be performed, if there is no factor, which nullifies it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]           Abu Dhar&#8217;s name was Jundub bin Junada, and he was among the most prominent Sahaba and an ascetic. He became a Muslim very early at Makka. Then went back to his people. He came to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), at Al-Madina and later settled and died at Rabdha in 32 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]           It means that if somebody has already prayed a certain prayer by performing Tayammum, then there is no need to repeat the prayer, even afterwards water is found and still there is time for the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]         It was not necessary to pray again, if the prayer had been offered by performing Tayammum. The second person got double reward not for the reason that he prayed again but for the exercise of judgment regarding the problem, which was although wrong but there is one reward for a wrong judgment. Second reason for earning double reward may be that he prayed twice, once with <i>Tayammum</i> and once with ablution</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]         It means that when you intend for prayer and there is some hindrance in performing ablution or having <i>Ghusl</i> (bath), the <i>Tayammum</i> is essential. Here illness means some serious disease and not the ordinary boils and eruptions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12]     Ðp;    The word in Arabic is <i>Jaba&#8217;ir</i> used for those wooden strips, which are placed around the broken arm or leg for support and to keep it straight.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13]         Since Tayammum (purification with soil) is a substitute for ablution, it works the same. Many prayers can be offered with one ablution, in the same way many prayers can be offered with one Tayammum. Some people after performing Tayammum for coition or wet dream hesitate to enter the mosque or to recite the Quran. This is only an evil apprehension and a satanic distraction and should not be cared for. In this Hadith Hasan bin &#8216;Ammar is weak in the chain of narrators. There are two other Ahadith on the same issue and both of them are <i>Da’if (</i>weak).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14]         This Hadith is weak because it was narrated by Hasan bin &#8216;Ammar who was weak, and due to this fact the Hadith scholars did not rely on it, but said that, &#8220;Allah has permitted for us the use of soil in the absence of water and since ablution becomes obligatory after passing urine, excreting or releasing air, so is the case of Tayammum.&#8221;</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 10: Menstruation</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">118. Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): Fatima bint Abu Hubaish had a prolonged flow of blood[1] and Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم)· told her, &#8220;The menstruation blood is a dark recognizable blood, so if that comes then avoid prayer. And if it is the other  (light colored blood), then perform <i>Wudu</i> (ablution) and offer <i>Salat</i>  (prayer) (for that is blood of a vein).&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud and An-Nasa’i. Ibn Hibban and Al-Hakim graded it Sahih (sound). Abu Hatim termed it <i>Munkar</i> (unusual)]<br />
And in the Hadith of Asma bint ‘Umais[2] (رضي الله عنه) reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud, (the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم said:) &#8220;She should sit in a tub, and when she sees yellowish color on the top of the water, she should take a bath once for the <i>Zuhr</i> and <i>Asr</i> prayers, and take another bath for the <i>Maghrib</i> and <i>Isha</i> prayers, and take a bath once for the <i>Fajr</i> prayer, and in between these times she should perform ablution.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">119. Narrated Hamna bint Jahsh[3](رضي الله عنه): MY menstruation was too much and severe. So I came to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to ask for his (religious) opinion. He said, &#8220;This is a stroke of the devil, so observe your menses for six or seven days, then take a bath and when you see that you are purified and quite clean, pray for twenty-three or twenty-four days, and fast and pray for that will suffice you. And do so every month just as the other women menstruate  (and are purified).  But if you are strong enough[4] to delay the Zuhr prayer and advance the Asr prayer then take a bath and combine the Zuhr and the Asr prayer; then delay the Maghrib prayer and advance the Isha prayer then take a bath and combine the two prayers, do so; and take a bath at Fajr.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم said of the two types of actions: &#8220;This one appeals more to my liking (i.e. taking a bath for every prayer)&#8221;.<br />
[Reported by Al-Khamsa except An- Nasa’i, At-Tirmidhi graded it Sahih (sound) and Al-Bukhari graded it Hasan (fair)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">120. Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): Umm Habiba bint Jahsh[5] complained to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) about the blood (which flows beyond the menstruation period). He said, &#8220;Keep away (from prayer) the length of time that your menses prevented you, then take a bath (and offer prayers)&#8221;. And she used to take a bath for every prayer[6].<br />
[Reported by Muslim.]<br />
In a version of Al-Bukhari is: &#8220;Perform ablution for every Salat (prayer)&#8221;. It has been reported by Abu Da’ud and others in another version</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">121. Narrated Umm Atiya[7] (رضي الله عنه): We considered it nothing (as impure) the muddiness and yellowness (of the fluids) after purification[8] (from menstruation).<br />
[Reported by Al-Bukhari and Abu Da&#8217;ud and version is of the latter].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">122. Narrated Anas (رضي الله عنه): The Jews used not to eat with a woman during her menstruation period, so the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Do every thing else apart from sexual intercourse (with your wives)&#8221;.<br />
[Reported by Muslim.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">123. Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم), used to order me to put on an <i>Izar[9]</i> and then caress[10] me while menstruating.<br />
[Agreed upon]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">124. Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said regarding a husband who has sexual intercourse with his wife during her menstruation period, &#8220;He should give out (as atonement) one Dinar or ½ Dinar as alms”<br />
[Reported by Al-Khamsa. Al-Hakim and Ibn Al-Qattan graded it Sahih (sound). And others considered it to be Mawquf (untraceable)][11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">125. Narrated Abu Sa&#8217;id AI-Khudri (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Is it not the case that a woman in her menstruation period neither prays nor fasts?&#8221;[12]<br />
[Agreed upon. It is part of a long Hadith]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">126. Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): When we came to a place called Sarif, I menstruated and the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) told me, &#8220;Do what a pilgrim does except that you don&#8217;t circumambulate round the Ka&#8217;ba until you are purified&#8221;.<br />
[Agreed upon and it is part of a long Hadith.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">127. Narrated Mu&#8217;adh (رضي الله عنه): He asked the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), “What is lawful for a man regarding his wife when she is menstruating?&#8221; and he replied, &#8220;What is above the waist wrapper (Izar).”[13]<br />
[Reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud and graded it Da&#8217;if.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">128. Narrated Umm Salama (رضي الله عنه): During the time of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) the women having bleeding after delivery (postnatal or puerperal blood) would refrain (from prayer) for forty days.[14]<br />
[Reported  by Al-Khamsa except An-Nasa’i, and the version is that of Abu Da’ud].<br />
And in another version of Abu Da’ud: &#8220;The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not command her to repeat the prayers (abandoned during the period of bleeding).&#8221; And Al-Hakim graded it Sahih (sound).</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]           <i>Istihada</i> may be either prolonged puerperium or prolonged menstruation period (and is regarded as bleeding between the periods). Period of menstruation, according to some scholars is from one to fifteen days; and according to others, its duration is from three to ten days. Experience confirms the later assertion. Every woman knows her period if bleeding exceeds the normal time then it would be <i>Istihada</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]           She was the wife of Jafar bin Abu Talib. She had migrated with him to Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and bore him there children, among them was &#8216;Abdullah. Then Abu Bakr As-Siddiq married her after the martyrdom of Jafar at the battle of Mu&#8217;ta, and she bore him Muhammad. Ali bin Abu Talib also married her after the death of Abu Bakr and she bore him Yahya &#8216;Umar used to ask her the interpretation of dreams. She died after the death of &#8216;Ali.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]           Hamna bint Jahsh is the sister of the &#8216;Mother of the Believers&#8217; Zainab bint Jahsh. She was married to Mus&#8217;ab bin &#8216;Umair, who was martyred during the battle of Uhud after which she was married by Talha bin &#8216;Ubaidullah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]           In this Hadith, Hamna was ordered to take a bath three times a day. One bath for Zuhr and Asr prayers; second for Maghrib and Isha; and third for Fajr. In the preceding Hadith Fatima bint Abu Hubaish was ordered merely to perform ablution before every prayer. It means in case of Istihada taking a bath is not compulsory but performing ablution is obligatory for every prayer. Taking a bath is preferable if weather conditions and health allows, otherwise there is no need to take bath.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]           Habiba bint Jahsh was another sister of Zainab bint Jahsh,&#8217;the Mother of the Believers&#8217; and she was married to &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf Muslim narrated that she had a prolonged flow of blood for seven years. She died in 44H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]           It was only a precautionary or voluntary act of Umm Habiba to take a bath for every prayer. Authentic decision regarding this issue is to take a post-menstruation Ghusl (bath) and purify oneself. Concerning prolonged bleeding, there is an order to wash the blood and perform ablution for every prayer</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]           Her name was Nusaiba bint Ka&#8217;b or bint Al-Harith Al-Ansariya. She was among the prominent Sahabiya women, and she used to accompany Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to battles, nursing the sick and treating the injured. She fought during the battle of Uhud like heroes. She witnessed the washing of the body of the daughter of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), which she perfected and narrated, and a number of Sahaba and Tabi’i Ulama at Basra recorded that from her. Her Hadith is considered to be the basis of washing the dead. She was counted to be among the Sahabiya who settled at Basra.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]           In the narration of&#8217; Aisha (رضي الله عنه), yellow and dusty colored water is considered as menses, but this Hadith states: &#8220;We considered it nothing.&#8221; Apparently both Ahadith appear to be opposing each other, but actually both are correct in their context. If the yellow or dusty color water oozes out in the menstruation period, it will be considered as &#8216;menses&#8217;; and if it percolates after the period, it is &#8216;nothing&#8217; as the word <i>B &#8216;ad At-Tuhr</i> gives the clue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]           A cloth worn from the waistline downwards like a skirt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] Those who do not believe in the Ahadith (i.e. deniers of Sunna), create ambiguity and doubt at this point, and make the people suspicious about the Ahadith. They assert that sexual intercourse in menstruation periods is prohibited by the noble Quran but according to this Hadith the Prophet would do it during that period, therefore, Hadith is not true. Literal meaning of <i>Mubasharat</i> is to touch and rub the body with the body, and speaking metaphorically it means coition.  In other Ahadith it has been clarified that sexual intercourse is strictly forbidden during menstruation, thus, it is quite a dishonesty to translate the word Mubasharat as sexual intercourse instead of &#8216;fondling&#8217; and create the suspicion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] This is a Da&#8217;if (weak) Hadith, therefore, most of the religious scholars do not deem it necessary to expiate, although some of the scholars are in favor of this opinion; but first opinion is correct because order is only for encouraging charity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12] This is a small portion of a long Hadith. The noble Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), while delivering a Khutba (religious talk) to the women, told them that their religion was imperfect. They asked, &#8220;How?&#8221; In the answer to their question, he spoke these words, which mean that a menstruating women should not pray or fast.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] &#8220;Everything above the Izar (dress worn below the waist)&#8221; may have two meanings: First, the Izar may be a figurative speech for &#8216;sexual intercourse&#8217;, in other words, except sexual intercourse everything is permitted. Secondly, it may metaphorically mean the portion of body related to Izar. But this meaning will contradict the other Hadith stating: &#8220;Do everything except intercourse·” Therefore, first meaning is preferable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14] It means the maximum period of puerperal blood is forty days and minimum time for it is not fixed. If it continues more than forty days, it will be regarded as <i>Istihada</i> (bleeding between periods), which is not a hindrance for prayer, fasting and having sexual intercourse. Every command of the puerperium is identical to that of menstruation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">How Did Your Affair Begin, O Messenger of Allaah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ad-Daarimee reported (1/8-9), and al-Haakim (2/616-617), and Ahmad (4/184) from `Utbah ibn Mas`ood as-Sulamee, and he was from the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam), that he narrated that: A man said to Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam):  &#8220;How did your affair begin, O Messenger of Allaah?&#8221;</p>
<p>So he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; I was being taken care of by a woman from Banoo Sa`d ibn Bakr. So I went off with a son of hers along with some of our goats, and we did not take any provision along with us. So I said: &#8220;O my brother, go and bring us some provision from our mother.&#8221; So my brother went off and I remained with the goats. Then two white beings that were flying came, being as if they were two eagles. Then one of them said to the other: &#8220;Is it him?&#8221; The other one replied; &#8220;Yes&#8221;. So they hastened to me, took hold of me, and threw me upon the ground on my back. Then they split open my chest and extracted two black clots from it, and one of them said to his companion: &#8220;Bring me ice-water&#8221;, and he washed my insides with it. Then he said: &#8220;Bring me snow-water&#8221;, and he washed my heart with it. Then he said: &#8220;Bring me tranquillity&#8221;. And he planted it in my heart. Then one of them said to his companion: &#8220;Sew it up&#8221;, so he sewed it up and sealed it with the seal of Prophethood. Then one of them said to the other: &#8220;Place him upon a scale, and place a thousand of his nation upon another scale.&#8221; &gt;&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; &#8220;So I saw a thousand people above me and feared that some of them were going to fall upon me.&#8221; He said: &#8220;If his whole nation were weighed against him he would outweigh them.&#8221; Then they went off and left me. &gt;&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And I became very afraid, and I went back to my mother and informed her of what I had experienced. So I wished that I had been mistaken for someone else. She said: &#8220;I entrust you to Allaah&#8217;s protection&#8221;. So she prepared a camel of hers for riding, placed me upon the saddle, and rode behind me until we reached my (true) mother. Then she said: &#8220;I have fulfilled my trust and my responsibility, and she told her what had happened to me, and this did not alarm her. She said: &#8220;When he came out from me I saw light which shone and revealed the palaces of Shaam.&#8221;&gt;&gt;</p>
</blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the authority of &#8216;Abdullaah ibn Mas&#8217;ood (radhiyallaahu &#8216;anhu), the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam) said:</p>

The most hated speech to Allaah is when a man says to another man, &#8216;Fear Allaah!&#8217; and he replies, &#8216;Worry about your own self!&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was reported by Al-Asbahaanee in At-Targheeb (739), and Al-Albaanee authenticated it in Silsilatul-Ahaadeethis-Saheehah (2598).</p>

<p>Reported by Abu dawood, An-Nisã&#8217;ee , and At-Tirmithi and he said it was comely-sound.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Khâlid b. ‘Umayr Al-’Adawî reports, ‘Utbah b. Ghazwân – Allâh be pleased with him – once gave us a sermon. He praised Allâh, then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The life of this world has announced its departure and is quickly turning away, and nothing remains of it save the likes of the last drop of water in a vessel as its possessor tries to catch it. You are moving on to an abode that has no end, so move on with the best [deeds] that you have. For it has been said to us that a rock can be dropped from the edge of Hell and fall for seventy years without reaching the bottom. Yet, by Allâh, it will be filled. Do you not then wonder? And it has been said to us that a single entrance to Paradise is as wide as a journey of forty years, yet there will come a day when it will be crowded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have seen myself as the seventh of seven [followers of] Allâh’s Messenger – Allâh’s peace and blessings be upon him; we had no food save the leaves of trees which put sores round our mouths. I once got a cloak which I tore in half to share with Sa’d b. Mâlik: I used half as my waist-wrap and he used the other. And yet today, there is not one of us except he has become a governor over some city – and I seek refuge with Allâh that I consider myself great and important when I am small in front of Allâh. Verily there was never prophet-hood except that it gradually changed until it ended up being a kingship, and verily you will see what the governors after us are like.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#808080;">From last hadith in The Book of Revelation of the 1st Volume of Sahih Bukhari:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sufyan bin Harb informed me that Heraclius had sent a messenger to him while he had been accompanying a caravan from Quraish. They were merchants doing business in Sham (Syria, Palestine, Lebanon and Jordan), at the time when Allaah&#8217;s Messenger had truce with Abu Sufyan and Quraish infidels. So Abu Sufyan and his companions went to Heraclius at Ilya (Jerusalem). Heraclius called them in the court and he had all the senior Roman dignitaries around him. He called for his translator who, translating Heraclius&#8217;s question said to them, &#8220;Who amongst you is closely related to that man who claims to be a Prophet?&#8221; Abu Sufyan replied, &#8220;I am the nearest relative to him (amongst the group).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Heraclius said, &#8220;Bring him (Abu Sufyan) close to me and make his companions stand behind him.&#8221; Abu Sufyan added, Heraclius told his translator to tell my companions that he wanted to put some questions to me regarding that man (The Prophet) and that if I told a lie they (my companions) should contradict me.&#8221; Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;By Allaah! Had I not been afraid of my companions labeling me a liar, I would not have spoken the truth about the Prophet. The first question he asked me about him was:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;What is his family status amongst you?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;He belongs to a good (noble) family amongst us.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Heraclius further asked, &#8216;Has anybody amongst you ever claimed the same (i.e. to be a Prophet) before him?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;No.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8216;Was anybody amongst his ancestors a king?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;No.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Heraclius asked, &#8216;Do the nobles or the poor follow him?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;It is the poor who follow him.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8216;Are his followers increasing decreasing (day by day)?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;They are increasing.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then asked, &#8216;Does anybody amongst those who embrace his religion become displeased and renounce the religion afterwards?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;No.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Heraclius said, &#8216;Have you ever accused him of telling lies before his claim (to be a Prophet)?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;No. &#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Heraclius said, &#8216;Does he break his promises?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;No. We are at truce with him but we do not know what he will do in it.&#8217; I could not find opportunity to say anything against him except that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Heraclius asked, &#8216;Have you ever had a war with him?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;Yes.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said, &#8216;What was the outcome of the battles?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;Sometimes he was victorious and sometimes we.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Heraclius said, &#8216;What does he order you to do?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, <strong>&#8216;He tells us to worship Allaah and Allaah alone and not to worship anything along with Him, and to renounce all that our ancestors had said. He orders us to pray, to speak the truth, to be chaste and to keep good relations with our Kith and kin.&#8217;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Heraclius asked the translator to convey to me the following, I asked you about his family and your reply was that he belonged to a very noble family. In fact all the Messengers come from noble families amongst their respective peoples. I questioned you whether anybody else amongst you claimed such a thing, your reply was in the negative. If the answer had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that this man was following the previous man&#8217;s statement. Then I asked you whether anyone of his ancestors was a king. Your reply was in the negative, and if it had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that this man wanted to take back his ancestral kingdom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I further asked whether he was ever accused of telling lies before he said what he said, and your reply was in the negative. <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>So I wondered how a person who does not tell a lie about others could ever tell a lie about Allaah.</strong></span> I, then asked you whether the rich people followed him or the poor. You replied that it was the poor who followed him. And in fact all the Messengers have been followed by this very class of people. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing. You replied that they were increasing, and in fact this is the way of true faith, till it is complete in all respects. I further asked you whether there was anybody, who, after embracing his religion, became displeased and discarded his religion. Your reply was in the negative, and in fact this is (the sign of) true faith, when its delight enters the hearts and mixes with them completely. I asked you whether he had ever betrayed. You replied in the negative and likewise the Messengers never betray. Then I asked you what he ordered you to do. You replied that he ordered you to worship Allaah and Allaah alone and not to worship any thing along with Him and forbade you to worship idols and ordered you to pray, to speak the truth and to be chaste. If what you have said is true, he will very soon occupy this place underneath my feet and I knew it (from the scriptures) that he was going to appear but I did not know that he would be from you, and if I could reach him definitely, I would go immediately to meet him and if I were with him, I would certainly wash his feet.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Heraclius then asked for the letter addressed by Allaah&#8217;s Messenger which was delivered by Dihya to the Governor of Busra, who forwarded it to Heraclius to read. The contents of the letter were as follows: &#8220;In the name of Allaah the Beneficent, the Merciful (This letter is) from Muhammad the slave of Allaah and His Messenger to Heraclius the ruler of Byzantine. Peace be upon him, who follows the right path. Furthermore I invite you to Islam, and if you become a Muslim you will be safe, and Allaah will double your reward, and if you reject this invitation of Islam you will be committing a sin by misguiding your Arisiyin (peasants). (And I recite to you Allaah&#8217;s Statement:)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>O people of the scripture! Come to a word common to you and us that we worship none but Allaah and that we associate nothing in worship with Him, and that none of us shall take others as Lords beside Allaah. Then, if they turn away, say: Bear witness that we are Muslims (those who have surrendered to Allaah).</strong> (3:64)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sufyan then added, &#8220;When Heraclius had finished his speech and had read the letter, there was a great hue and cry in the Royal Court. So we were turned out of the court. I told my companions that the question of Ibn-Abi-Kabsha) (the Prophet Muhammad) has become so prominent that even the King of Bani Al-Asfar (Byzantine) is afraid of him. Then I started to become sure that he (the Prophet) would be the conqueror in the near future till I embraced Islam (i.e. Allaah guided me to it).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sub narrator adds, &#8220;Ibn An-Natur was the Governor of llya&#8217; (Jerusalem) and Heraclius was the head of the Christians of Sham. Ibn An-Natur narrates that once while Heraclius was visiting ilya&#8217; (Jerusalem), he got up in the morning with a sad mood. Some of his priests asked him why he was in that mood? Heraclius was a foreteller and an astrologer. He replied, &#8216;At night when I looked at the stars, I saw that the leader of those who practice circumcision had appeared (become the conqueror). Who are they who practice circumcision?&#8217; The people replied, &#8216;Except the Jews nobody practices circumcision, so you should not be afraid of them (Jews).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Just Issue orders to kill every Jew present in the country.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While they were discussing it, a messenger sent by the king of Ghassan to convey the news of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger to Heraclius was brought in. Having heard the news, he (Heraclius) ordered the people to go and see whether the messenger of Ghassan was circumcised. The people, after seeing him, told Heraclius that he was circumcised. Heraclius then asked him about the Arabs. The messenger replied, &#8216;Arabs also practice circumcision.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(After hearing that) Heraclius remarked that sovereignty of the &#8216;Arabs had appeared. Heraclius then wrote a letter to his friend in Rome who was as good as Heraclius in knowledge. Heraclius then left for Homs. (a town in Syrian and stayed there till he received the reply of his letter from his friend who agreed with him in his opinion about the emergence of the Prophet and the fact that he was a Prophet. On that Heraclius invited all the heads of the Byzantines to assemble in his palace at Homs. When they assembled, he ordered that all the doors of his palace be closed. Then he came out and said, &#8216;O Byzantines! If success is your desire and if you seek right guidance and want your empire to remain then give a pledge of allegiance to this Prophet (i.e. embrace Islam).&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(On hearing the views of Heraclius) the people ran towards the gates of the palace like onagers but found the doors closed. Heraclius realized their hatred towards Islam and when he lost the hope of their embracing Islam, he ordered that they should be brought back in audience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When they returned) he said, &#8216;What already said was just to test the strength of your conviction and I have seen it.&#8217; The people prostrated before him and became pleased with him, and this was the end of Heraclius&#8217;s story (in connection with his faith).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#993300;">Sahih Bukhari , Volume 4, Book 56, Number 814:</span></p>
<p>Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a Christian who embraced Islam and read <em>Surat-al-Baqara</em> and <em>Al-Imran,</em> and he used to write (the revelations) for the Prophet. Later on he returned to Christianity again and he used to say: &#8220;Muhammad knows nothing but what I have written for him.&#8221; Then Allah caused him to die, and the people buried him, but in the morning they saw that the earth had thrown his body out. They said, &#8220;This is the act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our companion and took his body out of it because he had run away from them.&#8221; They again dug the grave deeply for him, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown his body out. They said, &#8220;This is an act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our companion and threw his body outside it, for he had run away from them.&#8221; They dug the grave for him as deep as they could, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown his body out. So they believed that what had befallen him was not done by human beings and had to leave him thrown (on the ground).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Jabir b. Abdullah reported that Allah&#8217;s Apostle (Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam) happened to walk through the bazar coming from the side of &#8216;Aliya and the people were on both his sides.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There he found a dead lamb with very short ears. He took hold of his ear and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who amongst you would like to have this for a dirham?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: We do not like to have it even for less than that as it is of no use to us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: Do you wish to have it (free of any cost)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: By Allah, even if it were alive (we would not have liked to possess that), for there is detect in it as its ear is very short; now it is dead also.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: By Allah, this world is more insignificant in the eye of Allah as it (this dead lamb) is in your eye.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a Christian who embraced Islam and read Surat-al-Baqara and Al-Imran, and he used to write (the revelations) for the Prophet. Later on he returned to Christianity again and he used to say: &#8220;Muhammad knows nothing but what I have written for him.&#8221; Then Allah caused him to die, and the people buried him, but in the morning they saw that the earth had thrown his body out. They said, &#8220;This is the act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our companion and took his body out of it because he had run away from them.&#8221; They again dug the grave deeply for him, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown his body out. They said, &#8220;This is an act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our companion and threw his body outside it, for he had run away from them.&#8221; They dug the grave for him as deep as they could, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown his body out. So they believed that what had befallen him was not done by human beings and had to leave him thrown (on the ground).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam once climbed the mountain of Uhud with Abu Bakr, &#8216;Umar and &#8216;Uthman radhiallahu `anhum. The mountain shook with them. The Prophet said (to the mountain), &#8220;Be firm, O Uhud! For on you there are no more than a Prophet, a Siddiq and two martyrs.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">( Sahih Bukhari Companions of the Prophet [VOL 5: Hadith No. 1-119] )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ashari:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I performed ablution in my house and then went out and said, &#8220;Today I shall stick to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and stay with him all this day of mine (in his service).&#8221; I went to the Mosque and asked about the Prophet . They said, &#8220;He had gone in this direction.&#8221; So I followed his way, asking about him till he entered a place called Bir Aris. I sat at its gate that was made of date-palm leaves till the Prophet finished answering the call of nature and performed ablution. Then I went up to him to see him sitting at the well of Aris at the middle of its edge with his legs uncovered, hanging in the well. I greeted him and went back and sat at the gate. I said, &#8220;Today I will be the gatekeeper of the Prophet.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr came and pushed the gate. I asked, &#8220;Who is it?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Abu Bakr.&#8221; I told him to wait, went in and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Abu Bakr asks for permission to enter.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Admit him and give him the glad tidings that he will be in Paradise.&#8221; So I went out and said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;Come in, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle gives you the glad tidings that you will be in Paradise&#8221; Abu Bakr entered and sat on the right side of Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the built edge of the well and hung his legs n the well as the Prophet did and uncovered his legs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I then returned and sat (at the gate). I had left my brother performing ablution and he intended to follow me. So I said (to myself). &#8220;If Allah wants good for so-and-so (i.e. my brother) He will bring him here.&#8221; Suddenly somebody moved the door. I asked, &#8220;Who is it?&#8221; He said, &#8220;&#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab.&#8221; I asked him to wait, went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, greeted him and said, &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks the permission to enter.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Admit him, and give him the glad tidings that he will be in Paradise.&#8221; I went to &#8220;Umar and said &#8220;Come in, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle, gives you the glad tidings that you will be in Paradise.&#8221; So he entered and sat beside Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the built edge of the well on the left side and hung his legs in the well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I returned and sat (at the gate) and said, (to myself), &#8220;If Allah wants good for so-and-so, He will bring him here.&#8221; Somebody came and moved the door. I asked &#8220;Who is it?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Uthman bin Affan.&#8221; I asked him to wait and went to the Prophet and informed him. He said, &#8220;Admit him, and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise after a calamity that will befall him.&#8221; So I went up to him and said to him, &#8220;Come in; Allah&#8217;s Apostle gives you the glad tidings of entering Paradise after a calamity that will befall you. &#8220;Uthman then came in and found that the built edge of the well was occupied, so he sat opposite to the Prophet on the other side. Said bin Al-Musaiyab said, &#8220;I interpret this (narration) in terms of their graves.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported in the Musnad of Ahmad from Anas, radi Allahu anhu, that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;We were sitting in the presence of Rasulullah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam one day and he said, &#8216;A person is about to arrive from this mountain path who is from the people of Paradise.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a person from the Ansar arrived, his beard dripping with water from wudoo and holding his sandals in his left hand, and he gave us the salaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then next day the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam said words of similar import and the same person appeared in the same condition. On the third day Rasulullah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam again said words of similar import and again this person appeared in the same condition, so when Rasulullah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam left, &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr bin al-Aas followed this person and said, &#8216;Indeed I have abused my father and I swear that I would not go to him for three days so if you would let me stay with you until those three days expire, I would do so.&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Yes.'&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas continued saying, &#8220;So &#8216;Abdullah told us that he spent three nights with this person yet he did not see him stand for the night prayer at all. All he did was <strong>when he turned sides on his bed he would mention Allah and make takbeer and would do this until he stood for fajr prayer</strong>.&#8217; Abdullah said, &#8216;<strong>Except that I never hear him speak except good</strong>&#8216;. So when the three days were over I was eager to make little of his actions. I said, &#8216;O servant of Allah there was no hatred or disassociation between my father and me but I heard Rasulullah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam saying on three occasions, &#8220;A person is about to arrive who is from the people of Paradise,&#8221; and you arrived on those three occasions, so I wished to stay with you so that I may look at your actions and emulate them. But I have not seen you perform a great deal of actions, so what is it that has reached you to make Rasulullah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam say what he said?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;It is nothing more than what you have seen, except that <strong>I do not find in myself any disloyalty to any of the Muslims, and neither do I find any jealousy for the wealth that Allah has bestowed upon them</strong>.&#8217; Abdullah said, &#8216;This is that which has reached you and is something that we cannot endure.'&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>This hadith is authentic and classified as hassan. It is narrated in Musnad Imam Ahmed, and Albazar as well as others in many different chains.</em></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Narrated <strong>Abu Huraira</strong>, that he heard Rasulullah sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah willed to test three who were a leper, a blind man and a bald-headed man.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, he sent them an angel who came to the leper and said, &#8220;What thing do you like most?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Good color and good skin, for the people have a strong aversion to me.&#8221; The angel touched him and his illness was cured, and he was given a good color and beautiful skin. The angel asked him, &#8220;What kind of property do you like best?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Camels (or cows).&#8221; (The narrator is in doubt, for either the leper or the bald-headed man demanded camels and the other demanded cows.) So he (i.e. the leper) was given a pregnant she-camel, and the angel said (to him), &#8220;May Allah bless you in it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The angel then went to the bald-headed man and said, &#8220;What thing do you like most?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I like good hair and wish to be cured of this disease, for the people feel repulsion for me.&#8221; The angel touched him and his illness was cured, and he was given good hair. The angel asked (him), &#8220;What kind of property do you like best?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Cows.&#8221; The angel gave him a pregnant cow and said, &#8220;May Allah bless you in it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The angel went to the blind man and asked, &#8216;What thing do you like best?&#8217; He said, &#8220;(I like) that Allah may restore my eye-sight to me so that I may see the people.&#8221; The angel touched his eyes and Allah gave him back his eye-sight. The angel asked him, &#8220;What kind of property do you like best?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Sheep.&#8221; The angel gave him a pregnant sheep.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Afterwards, all the three pregnant animals gave birth to young ones, and multiplied and brought forth so much that one of the (three) men had a herd of camels filling a valley, and one had a herd of cows filling a valley, and one had a flock of sheep filling a valley.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the angel, disguised in the shape and appearance of a leper, went to the leper and said, &#8220;I am a poor man, who has lost all means of livelihood while on a journey. So none will satisfy my need except Allah and then you. In the Name of Him Who has given you such nice color and beautiful skin, and so much property, I ask you to give me a camel so that I may reach my destination.&#8221; The man replied, &#8220;I have many obligations (so I cannot give you).&#8221; The angel said, &#8220;I think I know you; were you not a leper to whom the people had a strong aversion? Weren&#8217;t you a poor man, and then Allah gave you (all this property)?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;(This is all wrong), I got this property through inheritance from my fore-fathers.&#8221; The angel said, &#8220;If you are telling a lie, then let Allah make you as you were before.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the angel, disguised in the shape and appearance of a bald man, went to the bald man and said to him the same as he told the first one, and he too answered the same as the first one did. The angel said, &#8220;If you are telling a lie, then let Allah make you as you were before.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The angel, disguised in the shape of a blind man, went to the blind man and said, &#8220;I am a poor man and a traveler, whose means of livelihood have been exhausted while on a journey. I have nobody to help me except Allah, and after Him, you yourself. I ask you in the Name of Him Who has given you back your eye-sight to give me a sheep, so that with its help, I may complete my journey.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;No doubt, I was blind and Allah gave me back my eye-sight; I was poor and Allah made me rich; so take anything you wish from my property. By Allah, I will not stop you for taking anything (you need) of my property which you may take for Allah&#8217;s sake.&#8221; The angel replied, &#8220;Keep your property with you. You (i.e., the three men) have been tested and Allah is pleased with you and is angry with your two companions.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas radhiallahu `anhu:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My uncle Anas bin An-Nadr was absent from the battle of Badr. He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! I was absent from the first battle you fought against the pagans. (By Allah) if Allah gives me a chance to fight the pagans, no doubt Allah will see how (bravely) I will fight.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the day of Uhud, when the Muslims turned their backs and fled, he said, &#8220;O Allah! I apologise to You for what these (i.e., his companions) have done, and I denounce what these (i.e., the pagans) have done.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he advanced and Sa`d bin Mu`adh met him. He said, &#8220;O Sa&#8217;d bin Mu`adh! By the Lord of An-Nadhr, Paradise! I am smelling its aroma coming from before (the mountain of) Uhud.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Later on, Sa`d said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! I cannot achieve or do what he (i.e., Anas bin An-Nadhr) did. <strong>We found more than eighty wounds by swords and arrows on his body. We found him dead and his body was mutilated so badly that none except his sister could recognize him by his fingers</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We used to think that the following verse was revealed concerning him and other men of his sort: &#8220;Among the believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Allah.&#8221; [Surah Al-Ahzab 33:23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~ <strong>Sahih Bukhari</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8220;Abu Dharr said: I was a man from the tribe of Ghifar. We heard that a man had appeared in Makkah claiming to be a Prophet. I said to my brother, &#8216;Go talk to that man and talk to him and bring me his news.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He set out, met him and returned. I asked him, &#8216;What is the news with you?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8216;By Allah, I saw a man enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to him, &#8216;You have not satisfied me with this information.&#8217; So, I took a a waterskin and a stick and proceeded towards Makkah. Neither did I know him (i.e. the Prophet ), nor did I like to ask anyone about him. I kept on drinking zam zam water and staying in the Mosque.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then `Ali radhiallahu `anhu passed by me and said, &#8216;It seems you are a stranger?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He proceeded to his house and I accompanied him. Neither did he ask me anything, nor did I tell him anything. The next morning, I went to the Mosque to ask about the Prophet but no-one told me anything about him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Ali passed by me again and asked, &#8216;Hasn&#8217;t the man recognized his dwelling place yet?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Come along with me.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He asked me, &#8216;What is your business? What has brought you to this town?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to him, &#8216;If you keep my secret, I will tell you.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8216;I will do.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to him, &#8216;We have heard that a person has appeared here, claiming to be a Prophet. I sent my brother to speak to him and when he returned, he did not bring a satisfactory report; so I thought of meeting him personally.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Ali said (to Abu Dharr), &#8216;You have reached your goal; I am going to him just now, so follow me, and wherever I enter, enter after me. If I should see someone who may cause you trouble, I will stand near a wall pretending to mend my shoes (as a warning), and you should go away then.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Ali proceeded and I accompanied him till he entered a place, and I entered with him to the Prophet sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam to whom I said, &#8216;Present (the principles of) Islam to me.&#8217; When he did, I embraced Islam immediately.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said to me, &#8216;O Abu Dharr! Keep your conversion as a secret and return to your town; and when you hear of our victory, return to us. &#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8216;By Him Who has sent you with the Truth, I will announce my conversion to Islam publicly amongst them (i.e. the infidels).&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Dharr went to the Mosque, where some people from Quraish were present, and said, &#8216;O folk of Quraish! I testify that None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and I (also) testify that Muhammad is Allah&#8217;s Slave and His Apostle.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Hearing that) the Quraishi men said, &#8216;Get at this Sabi (i.e. Muslim)!&#8217; They got up and beat me nearly to death. Al-`Abbas saw me and threw himself over me to protect me. He then faced them and said, &#8216;Woe to you! You want to kill a man from the tribe of Ghifar, although your trade and your communications are through the territory of Ghifar?&#8217; They therefore left me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The next morning, I returned (to the Mosque) and said the same as I have said on the previous day. They again said, &#8216;Get at this Sabi!&#8217; I was treated in the same way as on the previous day, and again Al-`Abbas found me and threw himself over me to protect me and told them the same as he had said the day before.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, that was the conversion of Abu Dharr radhiallahu `anhu to Islam.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The story of Uwais Al-Qarni was mentioned in Sahih Muslim as well as in other books. Now even though he was from the Tabi&#8217;een and did not see the Messenger [Salah Allahu Alaihi wa salam], the Messenger [Salah Allahu Alaihi wa salam] had advised &#8216;Umar ibn Al-Khatab [Radiya Allahu &#8216;Anhu] that if he meets [Uwais] then he, &#8216;Umar, should ask [Uwais] to ask Allah to forgive him and to make supplication for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Asir ibn Jaabir radhiallahu `anhu narrated</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever people would come from Yemen, `Umar radhiallahu `anhu would ask them, &#8220;Is Uways Al-Qaranee amongst you?&#8221; until, one year, he met Uways.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8220;Are you Uways Al-Qaranee?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Umar continued, &#8220;From Muraad, then Qaran?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Umar then asked, &#8220;Were you once afflicted with leprosy and your skin healed except for a dirham&#8217;s area?&#8221; Uways said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Umar finally asked, &#8220;Do you have a mother (that is alive)?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Umar then said, &#8220;I heard the Messenger of Allah – sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam &#8211; say, &#8216;Uways ibn Aamir will come to you with the delegations from Yemen, from Muraad, then from Qaran. He was once afflicted with leprosy and his skin healed except for a dirham&#8217;s area. <strong>He has a mother, and he treats her kindly</strong>. If he was to ever swear by Allah (for something) Allah would fulfill his oath. If you can, request that he ask forgiveness for you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Umar then requested from Uways, &#8220;Ask forgiveness for me.&#8221; And Uways Al-Qaranee did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>~</em><strong>Sahih Muslim</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah radhiallahu `anhu has said that the Messenger of Allah sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam mentioned a man of the Bani Israel saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He asked another to lend him a thousand dinars. The lender asked him to bring witnesses but the borrower said, &#8220;Allah is sufficient as a witness.&#8221; The lender asked him to furnish a surety but the borrower again asserted, &#8220;Allah is sufficient as a surety.&#8221; The lender agreed, &#8220;You are correct,&#8221; and lent him money for a specified period.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The debtor went across the sea. When he had finished his work, he looked for a conveyance to take him back for the punctual repayment of his debt, but he did not find any conveyance. So he took a piece of wood and made a hole in it. He inserted in it the one thousand dinars and a letter to the lender and closed the hole tightly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He took the piece of wood to the sea and said, &#8220;O Allah! You know well that I took a loan of one thousand dinars from so-and-so. He demanded a surety from me but I told him that Allah&#8217;s surety was enough and he accepted Your Guarantee. He then demanded a witness and I told him that Allah was sufficient as a witness. No doubt I have tried much to find a conveyance so that I might pay back his money but could not find one, so I hand this money over to you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saying that, he threw the piece of wood into the sea till it went far out into it, and then he went away. Meanwhile he kept looking for a conveyance to take him to the lender&#8217;s place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One day, the lender came out of his house to see whether a ship had arrived bringing his money, and all of a sudden, he saw a piece of wood in which was the money. He took it home to use as firewood. When he sawed it, he found his money and the letter inside it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shortly after that, the debtor came with a thousand dinars and said, &#8220;By Allah! I had been trying to get a boat so I could bring you your money but failed to get one before the one I have come by.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The lender said, &#8220;Allah has delivered on your behalf the money you sent in the piece of wood. So you may keep your thousand dinars and go, guided on the right path.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~ <strong>Sahih Bukhari</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Bukhari </strong>recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, &#8220;A man came to the Prophet and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! Poverty has stuck me.&#8217; The Prophet sent a messenger to his wives (to bring something for that man to eat) but they said that they had nothing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger said, &#8216;Who will invite this person or entertain him as a guest tonight; may Allah grant His mercy to him who does so.&#8217; An Ansari man said, &#8216;I, O Allah&#8217;s Messenger!&#8217; So he took him to his wife and said to her, &#8216;Entertain the guest of Allah&#8217;s Messenger generously.&#8217; She said, &#8216;By Allah ! We have nothing except the meal for my children.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Let your children sleep if they ask for supper. Then turn off the lamp and we go to bed tonight while hungry.&#8217; She did what he asked her to do.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;In the morning the Ansari went to Allah&#8217;s Messenger who said, &#8216;Allah wondered (favorably) or laughed at the action of so-and-so and his wife.&#8217; Then Allah revealed, &#8216;and they give them preference over themselves even though they were in need of that.&#8217; (Surah al-Hashr:9)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith in another part of his Sahih. Muslim, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa&#8217;i collected this Hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration for this Hadith, the Companion&#8217;s name was mentioned, it was <strong>Abu Talhah Al-Ansari</strong>, may Allah be pleased with him</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imams Bukhari and Muslim</strong> reported that the Messenger sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Three persons of a people before you, were on a journey when they were overtaken by a storm and therefore they took shelter in a cave. A rock slipped down from the mountain and blocked the exit from cave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of them said: &#8220;The only way for deliverance left is to beseech Allah in the name of some virtuous deed.&#8221; Thereupon one of them supplicated, &#8220;O Lord, my parents were very old, I used to offer them their nightly drink of milk before my children and the other members of the family. One day I went astray far away in search of green trees and could return only after my parent had gone to sleep. When I had milked the animals and brought their nightly drink to them, They were fast asleep, but I did not like to disturb them, nor would give any part of the milk to my children and other members of the family till after my parents had their drink. Thus, with the vessel in hand, I awaited their awakening till the flush of dawn, While the children cried out of hunger at my feet. When they woke up, they had their drink. O Lord, if I did this thing seeking only your pleasure, then do relieve us of the distress wrought upon us by this rock.&#8221; Thereupon, The rock moved a little but that not enough to let them pass out.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the second man supplicated: &#8220;O Lord, I had a cousin whom I loved her more passionately than any loves a woman. I tried to seduce her but she would have none of me, till in a season of great hardship due to famine, she approached me (for help) and I gave her one hundred and twenty Dinars on condition that she would have sexual intercourse with me. She agreed, and when we got together and I was just going to have intercourse with her, she pleaded: &#8216;Fear Allah, and do not break the seal unlawfully&#8217;; whereupon I moved away from her, despite the fact that I desired her most passionately; and I let her keep the money I had given her. O Lord, if I did this thing seeking only your pleasure, then do move the distress in which we find ourselves.&#8221; Again the rock moved a little but not enough to let them pass out.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the third supplicated: &#8220;O Lord, I hired some laborers and paid them their dues, but one of them left leaving behind what was due to him. I invested it in business and the business prospered greatly.&#8221; After a time the laborer came Back and said: &#8216;O servant of Allah, hand over to me my wages.&#8217; I said to him: &#8216;All that you see is yours &#8211; camels, cattle, goats and slaves.&#8217; He said: &#8216;Don&#8217;t play joke with me, O servant of Allah.&#8217; I assured him: &#8216;I am mot joking.&#8217; So he took all of it sparing nothing. O Lord, If I did this seeking only for your pleasure, do relieve us of our distress.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The rock then moved away, and all the three came out of the cave safe and sound.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>Sahih Bukhari</strong> and <strong>Sahih Muslim</strong> )</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Sahih Muslim <em>Book 004, Number 1812: </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Amr b. &#8216;Abasa Sulami reported: I in the state of the Ignorance (before embracing Islam) used to think that the people were in error and they were not on anything (which may be called the right path) and worshipped the idols. In the meanwhile I heard of a man in Mecca who was giving news (on the basis of his prophetic knowledge) ; so I sat on my ride and went to him. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was at that time hiding as his people had made life hard for him. I adopted a friendly attitude (towards the Meccans and thus managed) to enter Mecca and go to him (the Holy Prophet) and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to him: <strong>Who are you?</strong> He said: <strong>I am a Prophet (of Allah)</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I again said: <strong>Who is a Prophet?</strong> He said: <strong>(I am a Prophet in the sense that) I have been sent by Allah</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: <strong>What is that which you have been sent with?</strong> He said: I have been sent to join ties of relationship (with kindness and affection), to break the Idols, and to proclaim the oneness of Allah (in a manner that) nothing is to be associated with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: <strong>Who is with you in this (in these beliefs and practices)?</strong> He said: A free man and a slave. He (the narrator) said: Abu Bakr and Bilal were there with him among those who had embraced Islam by that time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: <strong>I intend to follow you</strong>. He said: During these days you would not be able to do so. Don&#8217;t you see the (hard) condition under which I and (my) people are living? You better go back to your people and when you hear that I have been granted victory, you come to me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I went to my family. I was in my home when the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) came to Medina. I was among my people and used to seek news and ask people when he arrived in Medina. Then a group of people belonging to Yathrib (Medina) came. I said (to them): How is that person getting on who has come to Medina? They said: The people are hastening to him, while his people (the polytheists of Mecca) planned to kill him, but they could not do so. I (on hearing It) came to Medina and went to him and said: Messenger of Allah, do you recognise me? He said: Yes, you are the same man who met me at Mecca. I said: It is so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I again said: <strong>Prophet of Allah, tell me that which Allah has taught you and which I do not know, tell me about the prayer</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: Observe the dawn prayer, then stop praying when the sun is rising till it Is fully up, for when it rises it comes up between the horns of Satan, and the unbelievers prostrate themselves to it at that time. Then pray, for the prayer is witnessed and attended (by angels) till the shadow becomes about the length of a lance; then cease prayer, for at that time Hell is heated up. Then when the shadow moves forward, pray, for the prayer is witnessed and attended by angels, till you pray the afternoon prayer, then cease prayer till the sun sets, for it sets between the horns of devil, and at that time the unbelievers prostrate themselves before it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: <strong>Apostle of Allah, tell me about ablution also</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: None of you who uses water for ablution and rinses his mouth, snuffs up water and blows it, but the sins of his face, and his mouth and his nostrils fall out. When he washes his face, as Allah has commanded him, the sins of his face fall out from the end of his beard with water. Then (when) he washes his forearms up to the elbows, the sins of his arms fall out along with water from his finger-tips. And when he wipes his head, the sins of his head fall out from the points of his hair along with water. And (when) he washes his feet up to the ankles, the sins of his feet fall out from his toes along with water. And if he stands to pray and praises Allah, lauds Him and glorifies Him with what becomes Him and shows wholehearted devotion to Allah, his sins would depart leaving him (as innocent) as he was on the day his mother bore him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Amr b. &#8216;Abasa narrated this hadith to Abu Umama, a Companion of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), and Abu Umama said to him: &#8216;Amr b. &#8216;Abasa, think what you are saying that such (a great reward) is given to a man at one place (only in the act of ablution and prayer). Upon this &#8216;Amr said: Abu Umama, I have grown old and my bones have become weak and I am at the door of death; what impetus is there for me to attribute a lie to Allah and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)? Had I heard it from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) once, twice, or three times (even seven times), I would have never narrated it, but I have heard it from him on occasions more than these.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Sahih Bukhari</strong> Volume 4, Book 55, Number 583: </em></p>
<p>Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first lady to use a girdle was the mother of Ishmael. She used a girdle so that she might hide her tracks from Sarah. Abraham brought her and her son Ishmael while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka&#8217;ba under a tree on the spot of Zam-zam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in Mecca, nor was there any water So he made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Ishmael&#8217;s mother followed him saying, &#8220;<em><span style="color:#008000;">O Abraham! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?</span></em>&#8221; She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her Then she asked him, <em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Has Allah ordered you to do so?&#8221;</span></em> He said, <span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</em> </span>She said, <em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Then He will not neglect us,&#8221;</span></em> and returned while Abraham proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniya where they could not see him, he faced the Ka&#8217;ba, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Your Sacred House (Kaba at Mecca) in order, O our Lord, that they may offer prayer perfectly. So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks.&#8217;</span> </em>(14.37) Ishmael&#8217;s mother went on suckling Ishmael and drinking from the water (she had).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him (i.e. Ishmael) tossing in agony; She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached the Marwa mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between Safa and Marwa) seven times.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, <em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;This is the source of the tradition of the walking of people between them (i.e. Safa and Marwa).&#8221; </span></em>When she reached the Marwa (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, &#8216;O, (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?&#8221; And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zam-zam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet added, <em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;May Allah bestow Mercy on Ishmael&#8217;s mother! Had she let the Zam-zam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zam-zam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet further added, <em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, &#8216;Don&#8217;t be afraid of being neglected, for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah never neglects His people.&#8217;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The House (i.e. Kaba) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kada&#8217;. They landed in the lower part of Mecca where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said, &#8216;This bird must be flying around water, though we know that there is no water in this valley.&#8217; They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came (towards the water).&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;Ishmael&#8217;s mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, &#8216;Do you allow us to stay with you?&#8221; She replied, &#8216;Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water.&#8217; They agreed to that.&#8221; The Prophet further said, &#8220;Ishmael&#8217;s mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent residents there. The child (i.e. Ishmael) grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After Ishmael&#8217;s mother had died, Abraham came after Ishmael&#8217;s marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmael&#8217;s wife about him, she replied, &#8216;He has gone in search of our livelihood.&#8217; Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied, &#8216;We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution,&#8217; complaining to him. He said, &#8216;When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house).&#8217; When Ishmael came, he seemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, &#8216;Has anyone visited you?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;Yes, an old man of so-and-so description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were living in a hardship and poverty.&#8217; On that Ishmael said, &#8216;Did he advise you anything?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the threshold of your gate.&#8217; Ishmael said, &#8216;It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family.&#8217; So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (i.e. Jurhum).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmael&#8217;s wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, &#8216;He has gone in search of our livelihood.&#8217; Abraham asked her, &#8216;How are you getting on?&#8217; asking her about their sustenance and living. She replied, &#8216;We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance).&#8217; Then she thanked Allah&#8217; Abraham said, &#8216;What kind of food do you eat?&#8217; She said. &#8216;Meat.&#8217; He said, &#8216;What do you drink?&#8217; She said, &#8216;Water.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Allah! Bless their meat and water.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca.&#8221; The Prophet added,&#8221; Then Abraham said Ishmael&#8217;s wife, &#8220;When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate.&#8217; When Ishmael came back, he asked his wife, &#8216;Did anyone call on you?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;Yes, a good-looking old man came to me,&#8217; so she praised him and added. &#8216;He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in a good condition.&#8217; Ishmael asked her, &#8216;Did he give you any piece of advice?&#8217; She said, &#8216;Yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate.&#8217; On that Ishmael said, &#8216;It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to keep you with me.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them afterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Abraham, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father). Abraham said, &#8216;O Ishmael! Allah has given me an order.&#8217; Ishmael said, &#8216;Do what your Lord has ordered you to do.&#8217; Abraham asked, &#8216;Will you help me?&#8217; Ishmael said, &#8216;I will help you.&#8217; Abraham said, Allah has ordered me to build a house here,&#8217; pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. the Ka&#8217;ba). Ishmael brought the stones and Abraham was building, and when the walls became high, Ishmael brought this stone and put it for Abraham who stood over it and carried on building, while Ishmael was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, &#8216;O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.&#8217; The Prophet added, <em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Then both of them went on building and going round the Ka&#8217;ba saying: O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.&#8221;</span></em> (2.127)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Saheeh al Bukhaaree</strong> : Volume 5, Book 59, Number 702</p>
<p>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah ibn Kab bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who, from among Kab&#8217;s sons, was the guide of Kab when he became blind: I heard Kab bin Malik narrating the <strong>story of (the Ghazwa of) Tabuk</strong> in which he failed to take part.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kab said, &#8220;I did not remain behind Allah&#8217;s Apostle in any Ghazwa that he fought except the Ghazwa of Tabuk, and I failed to take part in the Ghazwa of Badr, but Allah did not admonish anyone who had not participated in it, for in fact, Allah&#8217;s Apostle had gone out in search of the caravan of Quraish till Allah made them (i.e. the Muslims) and their enemy meet without any appointment. I witnessed the night of Al-&#8216;Aqaba (pledge) with Allah&#8217;s Apostle when we pledged for Islam, and I would not exchange it for the Badr battle although the Badr battle is more popular amongst the people than it (i.e. Al-&#8216;Aqaba pledge). As for my news (in this battle of Tabuk), I had never been stronger or wealthier than I was when I remained behind the Prophet in that Ghazwa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By Allah, never had I two she-camels before, but I had then at the time of this Ghazwa. Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle wanted to make a Ghazwa, he used to hide his intention by apparently referring to different Ghazwa till it was the time of that Ghazwa (of Tabuk) which Allah&#8217;s Apostle fought in severe heat, facing, a long journey, desert, and the great number of enemy. So the Prophet announced to the Muslims clearly (their destination) so that they might get prepared for their Ghazwa. So he informed them clearly of the destination he was going to. Allah&#8217;s Apostle was accompanied by a large number of Muslims who could not be listed in a book namely, a register.&#8221; Ka&#8217;b added, &#8220;Any man who intended to be absent would think that the matter would remain hidden unless Allah revealed it through Divine Revelation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allah&#8217;s Apostle fought that Ghazwa at the time when the fruits had ripened and the shade looked pleasant. Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his companions prepared for the battle and I started to go out in order to get myself ready along with them, but I returned without doing anything. I would say to myself, &#8216;I can do that.&#8217; So I kept on delaying it every now and then till the people got ready and Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the Muslims along with him departed, and I had not prepared anything for my departure, and I said, I will prepare myself (for departure) one or two days after him, and then join them.&#8217; In the morning following their departure, I went out to get myself ready but returned having done nothing. Then again in the next morning, I went out to get ready but returned without doing anything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such was the case with me till they hurried away and the battle was missed (by me). Even then I intended to depart to take them over. I wish I had done so! But it was not in my luck. So, after the departure of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, whenever I went out and walked amongst the people (i.e, the remaining persons), it grieved me that I could see none around me, but one accused of hypocrisy or one of those weak men whom Allah had excused.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not remember me till he reached Tabuk. So while he was sitting amongst the people in Tabuk, he said, &#8216;What did Ka&#8217;b do?&#8217; A man from Banu Salama said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He has been stopped by his two Burdas (i.e. garments) and his looking at his own flanks with pride.&#8217; Then Mu&#8217;adh bin Jabal said, &#8216;What a bad thing you have said! By Allah! O Allahs Apostle! We know nothing about him but good.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle kept silent.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kab bin Malik added, &#8220;When I heard that he (i.e. the Prophet ) was on his way back to Medina. I got dipped in my concern, and began to think of false excuses, saying to myself, &#8216;How can I avoid his anger tomorrow?&#8217; And I took the advice of wise member of my family in this matter. When it was said that Allah&#8217;s Apostle, had come near all the evil false excuses abandoned from my mind and I knew well that I could never come out of this problem by forging a false statement. Then I decided firmly to speak the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allah&#8217;s Apostle arrived in the morning, and whenever he returned from a journey., he used to visit the Mosque first of all and offer a two-Rak&#8217;at prayer therein and then sit for the people. So when he had done all that (this time), those who had failed to join the battle (of Tabuk) came and started offering (false) excuses and taking oaths before him. They were something over eighty men; Allah&#8217;s Apostle accepted the excuses they had expressed, took their pledge of allegiance asked for Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness for them, and left the secrets of their hearts for Allah to judge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I came to him, and when I greeted him, he smiled a smile of an angry person and then said, &#8216;Come on.&#8217; So I came walking till I sat before him. He said to me, &#8216;What stopped you from joining us. Had you not purchased an animal for carrying you?&#8217; I answered, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! But by Allah, if I were sitting before any person from among the people of the world other than you, I would have avoided his anger with an excuse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By Allah, I have been bestowed with the power of speaking fluently and eloquently, but by Allah, I knew well that if today I tell you a lie to seek your favour, Allah would surely make you angry with me in the near future, but if I tell you the truth, though you will get angry because of it, I hope for Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness. Really, by Allah, there was no excuse for me. By Allah, I had never been stronger or wealthier than I was when I remained behind you.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;As regards this man, he has surely told the truth. So get up till Allah decides your case.&#8217; I got up, and many men of Banu Salama followed me and said to me. &#8216;By Allah, we never witnessed you doing any sin before this. Surely, you failed to offer excuse to Allah&#8217;s Apostle as the others who did not join him, have offered. The prayer of Allah&#8217;s Apostle to Allah to forgive you would have been sufficient for you.&#8217; By Allah, they continued blaming me so much that I intended to return (to the Prophet) and accuse myself of having told a lie, but I said to them, &#8216;Is there anybody else who has met the same fate as I have?&#8217; They replied, &#8216;Yes, there are two men who have said the same thing as you have, and to both of them was given the same order as given to you.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Who are they?&#8217; They replied, Murara bin Ar-Rabi Al-Amri and Hilal bin Umaiya Al-Waqifi.&#8217; By that they mentioned to me two pious men who had attended the Ghazwa (Battle) of Badr, and in whom there was an example for me. So I did not change my mind when they mentioned them to me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle forbade all the Muslims to talk to us, the three aforesaid persons out of all those who had remained behind in that Ghazwa. So we kept away from the people and they changed their attitude towards us till the very land (where I lived) appeared strange to me as if I did not know it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We remained in that condition for fifty nights. As regards my two fellows, they remained in their houses and kept on weeping, but I was the youngest of them and the firmest of them, so I used to go out and witness the prayers along with the Muslims and roam about in the markets, but none would talk to me, and I would come to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and greet him while he was sitting In his gathering after the prayer, and I would wonder whether the Prophet did move his lips in return to my greetings or not. Then I would offer my prayer near to him and look at him stealthily. When I was busy with my prayer, he would turn his face towards me, but when I turned my face to him, he would turn his face away from me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When this harsh attitude of the people lasted long, I walked till I scaled the wall of the garden of Abu Qatada who was my cousin and dearest person to me, and I offered my greetings to him. By Allah, he did not return my greetings. I said, &#8216;O Abu Qatada! I beseech you by Allah! Do you know that I love Allah and His Apostle?&#8217; He kept quiet. I asked him again, beseeching him by Allah, but he remained silent. Then I asked him again in the Name of Allah. He said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know it better.&#8217; Thereupon my eyes flowed with tears and I returned and jumped over the wall.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ka&#8217;b added, &#8220;While I was walking in the market of Medina, suddenly I saw a Nabati (i.e. a Christian farmer) from the Nabatis of Sham who came to sell his grains in Medina, saying, &#8216;Who will lead me to Kab bin Malik?&#8217; The people began to point (me) out for him till he came to me and handed me a letter from the king of Ghassan in which the following was written:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;To proceed, I have been informed that your friend (i.e. the Prophet ) has treated you harshly. Anyhow, Allah does not let you live at a place where you feel inferior and your right is lost. So join us, and we will console you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I read it, I said to myself, &#8216;This is also a sort of a test.&#8217; Then I took the letter to the oven and made a fire therein by burning it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When fourty out of the fifty nights elapsed, behold ! There came to me the messenger of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8216;Allah&#8217;s Apostle orders you to keep away from your wife,&#8217; I said, &#8216;Should I divorce her; or else! what should I do?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No, only keep aloof from her and do not cohabit her.&#8217; The Prophet sent the same message to my two fellows. Then I said to my wife. &#8216;Go to your parents and remain with them till Allah gives His Verdict in this matter.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kab added, &#8220;The wife of Hilal bin Umaiya came to Apostle and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Hilal bin Umaiya is a helpless old man who has no servant to attend on him. Do you dislike that I should serve him? &#8216; He said, &#8216;No (you can serve him) but he should not come near you.&#8217; She said, &#8216;By Allah, he has no desire for anything. By, Allah, he has never ceased weeping till his case began till this day of his.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On that, some of my family members said to me, &#8216;Will you also ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle to permit your wife (to serve you) as he has permitted the wife of Hilal bin Umaiya to serve him?&#8217; I said, &#8216;By Allah, I will not ask the permission of Allah&#8217;s Apostle regarding her, for I do not know What Allah&#8217;s Apostle would say if I asked him to permit her (to serve me) while I am a young man.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I remained in that state for ten more nights after that till the period of fifty nights was completed starting from the time when Allah&#8217;s Apostle prohibited the people from talking to us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I had offered the Fajr prayer on the 50th morning on the roof of one of our houses and while I was sitting in the condition which Allah described (in the Qur&#8217;an) i.e. my very soul seemed straitened to me and even the earth seemed narrow to me for all its spaciousness, there I heard the voice of one who had ascended the mountain of Sala&#8217; calling with his loudest voice, &#8216;O Kab bin Malik! Be happy (by receiving good tidings).&#8217; I fell down in prostration before Allah, realizing that relief has come. Allah&#8217;s Apostle had announced the acceptance of our repentance by Allah when he had offered the Fajr prayer. The people then went out to congratulate us. Some bringers of good tidings went out to my two fellows, and a horseman came to me in haste, and a man of Banu Aslam came running and ascended the mountain and his voice was swifter than the horse. When he (i.e. the man) whose voice I had heard, came to me conveying the good tidings, I took off my garments and dressed him with them; and by Allah, I owned no other garments than them on that day. Then I borrowed two garments and wore them and went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.<br />
The people started receiving me in batches, congratulating me on Allah&#8217;s Acceptance of my repentance, saying, &#8216;We congratulate you on Allah&#8217;s Acceptance of your repentance.&#8221; Kab further said, &#8220;When I entered the Mosque. I saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle sitting with the people around him. Talha bin Ubaidullah swiftly came to me, shook hands with me and congratulated me. By Allah, none of the Muhajirin (i.e. Emigrants) got up for me except him (i.e. Talha), and I will never forget this for Talha.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kab added, &#8220;When I greeted Allah&#8217;s Apostle he, his face being bright with joy, said &#8220;Be happy with the best day that you have got ever since your mother delivered you.&#8221; Kab added, &#8220;I said to the Prophet &#8216;Is this forgiveness from you or from Allah?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No, it is from Allah.&#8217; Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle became happy, his face would shine as if it were a piece of moon, and we all knew that characteristic of him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I sat before him, I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Because of the acceptance of my repentance I will give up all my wealth as alms for the Sake of Allah and His Apostle. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Keep some of your wealth, as it will be better for you.&#8217; I said, &#8216;So I will keep my share from Khaibar with me,&#8217; and added, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah has saved me for telling the truth; so it is a part of my repentance not to tell but the truth as long as I am alive.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By Allah, I do not know anyone of the Muslims whom Allah has helped fortelling the truth more than me. Since I have mentioned that truth to Allah&#8217;s Apostle till today, I have never intended to tell a lie. I hope that Allah will also save me (from telling lies) the rest of my life. So Allah revealed to His Apostle the Verse: &#8220;Verily, Allah has forgiven the Prophet, the Muhajirin (i.e. Emigrants (up to His Saying) And be with those who are true (in word and deed).&#8221; (9.117-119)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By Allah, Allah has never bestowed upon me, apart from His guiding me to Islam, a Greater blessing than the fact that I did not tell a lie to Allah&#8217;s Apostle which would have caused me to perish as those who have told a lie perished, for Allah described those who told lies with the worst description He ever attributed to anybody else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said:&#8211; &#8220;They (i.e. the hypocrites) will swear by Allah to you when you return to them (up to His Saying) Certainly Allah is not pleased with the rebellious people&#8211;&#8221; (9.95-96) Kab added, &#8220;We, the three persons, differed altogether from those whose excuses Allah&#8217;s Apostle accepted when they swore to him. He took their pledge of allegiance and asked Allah to forgive them, but Allah&#8217;s Apostle left our case pending till Allah gave His Judgment about it. As for that Allah said):&#8211; And to the three (He did forgive also) who remained behind.&#8221; (9.118) What Allah said (in this Verse) does not indicate our failure to take part in the Ghazwa, but it refers to the deferment of making a decision by the Prophet about our case in contrast to the case of those who had taken an oath before him and he excused them by accepting their excuses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Date Palm Tree:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah radi Allahu anhu:The Prophet sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam used to stand by a tree or a date-palm on Friday. Then an Ansari woman or man said. &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall we make a pulpit for you?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;If you wish.&#8221; So they made a pulpit for him and when it was Friday, he proceeded towards the pulpit (for delivering the sermon). The date-palm cried like a child! The Prophet descended (the pulpit) and embraced it while it continued moaning like a child being quietened. The Prophet said, &#8220;It was crying for (missing) what it used to hear of religious knowledge given near to it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Umar radi Allahu anhuma narrated: The Prophet sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam used to deliver his sermons while standing beside a trunk of a datepalm. When he had the pulpit made, he used it instead. The trunk started crying and the Prophet went to it, rubbing his hand over it (to stop its crying).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: The Prophet sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam used to stand by a stem of a date-palm tree (while delivering a sermon). When the pulpit was placed for him we heard that stem crying like a pregnant she-camel till the Prophet got down from the pulpit and placed his hand over it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These ahadeeth are classified as <strong>mutawaatir</strong>, meaning so many sahaba narrated it that it cannot be fabricated. The different narrations show that they all witnessed it in the masjid. This is a miracle of the Prophet sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam, and the narrations of the sahaba are all authentic, found in Bukhari and Muslim. This tree trunk, which seems like a lifeless being to us, is actually alive and was so affected by the Prophet sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Read More :<a title="# Miracle of the Crying of the Tree Trunk" href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2014/01/30/cryingtrunk/">Miracle of the Crying of the Tree Trunk Regarding the Remembrance of Allah</a> &#8211; DarusSalam. Extracted from the book &#8220;Miracles of the Messenger (peace be upon him)&#8221; published by dar-us-salam.com]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Mount Uhud </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas radi Allahu anhu: Allah&#8217;s Apostle sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam ascended the (mountain) of Uhud with Abu Bakr and &#8216;Uthman and it shook. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Be calm, O Uhud!&#8221; I think he stroked it with his foot and added, &#8220;There is none on you but a Prophet, a Siddiq and two martyrs.&#8221; (Sahih Bukhari)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam was traveling one time: &#8220;and when Uhud was within sight, he said: This is the mountain which loves us and we love it.&#8221; (Sahih Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a mountain, made up of rocks and stones, yet we are made of flesh and have been given hearts that beat&#8230;do we love the Prophet sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam as this mountain? Do we shake like this mountain out of love for him?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A Stone </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jabir b. Samura reported Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: I recognise the stone in Mecca which used to pay me salutations before my advent as a Prophet and I recognise that even now. (Sahih Muslim: <em><a>Book 030, Number 5654: </a></em>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How often do we salute/send salawaat on the Prophet sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam? The Prophet knew this stone, and if we send salawaat on him, especially on Fridays, they will be presented to him from us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Ref: Sahih Muslim &#8211;  <a title="Sahih Muslim : Book  30: The Book Pertaining to the Excellent Qualities of the Holy  Prophet (may Peace be upon them) and His Companions (Kitab Al-Fada’il)" href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2014/09/04/sahih-muslim-book-030/">The Book Pertaining to the Excellent Qualities of the Holy Prophet (may Peace be upon them) and His Companions (Kitab Al-Fada&#8217;il</a>)</p>
