<p>The Softening of the Heart in Ramadhan | Shaykh Abdussalam al-Shuway&#8217;ir حفظه الله [Video | En subtitles] &#8211; <a href="https://youtu.be/AqHUQX3cJAc">https://youtu.be/AqHUQX3cJAc</a> [3:43 min]</p>



<p>From the tremendous characteristics acquired during this month is what is related to the softening of the heart. Indeed, this month is a means for the softening of the heart. And the softness of the heart is from the characteristics of the believer. And from the effects of the softness of the heart is that it brings about tears.</p>



<p>Indeed, if the heart softens, the eyes flow with tears.</p>



<p>And it comes down out of the fear of Allah ﷻ. Due to this, our Lord said in Al-Ma&#8217;idah:83:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-small-font-size">When they listen to what has been sent down to the Messenger you see their eyes overflowing with tears…</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If an individual reads the Speech of Allah abundantly, and contemplates over its meanings. Indeed, his heart will soften, and his eyes will relent. The greatest month wherein the Qur&#8217;an is read is the month of Ramadhan.</p>



<p>Due to this, Allah coupled the Qur&#8217;an with this month. He said in Al-Baqarah:185:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-small-font-size">The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Qur&#8217;an, a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the criterion.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the Sahih from the Hadith of Ibn Abbas رضي الله عنه, who said that the Prophet ﷺ was the most generous of people. And the most generous he would be was during Ramadhan when Jibril would come to him and study the Qur&#8217;an with him. Jibril would study the Qur&#8217;an with the Prophet. He would read the Qur&#8217;an once every Ramadhan, except the year he passed away, wherein he studied it with Jibril twice.</p>



<p>Therefore, this month is the month of the Qur&#8217;an. The Qur&#8217;an is read and recited in this month. And in it, the greatest stories are mentioned. And in it, the greatest narrations are mentioned, in reading the beginning of the Book of Allah. </p>



<p>Muhammad Nasr al-Marwazi spoke extensively about the narrations of the Salaf in their recitation of the Qur&#8217;an in this month specifically. And the scholars recommend that the month of Ramadhan should not be devoid of a completion of the Qur&#8217;an. And that the Tarawih prayers should not be devoid of a completion of the Qur&#8217;an.</p>



<p>Whoever reads the Qur&#8217;an in the month of Ramadhan and his heart is not softened, and tears don&#8217;t come down from his eyes, then it is feared that he has a hard heart. Therefore, Hasan al-Basri رَحِمَهُ ٱللَّٰهُ said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-small-font-size">The people continue to cry when they remember Allah and when they read the Qur&#8217;an.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>What he meant by: &#8216;The people&#8217; are the companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Therefore, this is one of the tremendous objectives, which is refining the character and softening the heart.</p>



<p>And the more an individual&#8217;s eyes flows with tears, the more of an effect it will have upon his heart, since there is a connection between the eyes and the heart. Listen to the Statement of Allah, Al-Ghafir:19:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-small-font-size">Allah knows the fraud of the eyes, and all that the breasts conceal </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Some of the people of knowledge derive from this that there is a connection between the eyes and the heart.  Verily, if the heart has fear, then the eyes will shed tears. And the affair of the heart is hidden and what the eyes see are hidden. And other than that which the people of knowledge derive from this tremendous verse.</p>

<p>When the Hearts Are Not Filled With the Love of Allah &#8211; Shaykh Saleh Ale ash Shaykh حفظه الله [Video|En subtitles] &#8211; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTEyqTpu3ho">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTEyqTpu3ho</a> [1:32 min]<br /><br />Shortcomings in worship, the absence of humility and submission, committing evil actions, falling into the impermissible, and falling short in the obligations only occur when the love of Allah is not filled in the hearts.</p>



<p>And when He is not exalted with the utmost exaltation and He is not feared.</p>



<p>The more the individual contemplates and looks, the more he will know the signs that show that Allah alone is the Lord and He is the One administering, meaning, that which is included in Tawhid al-Rububiyyah- and that everything is in His Hands.</p>



<p>The more these hearts are filled and are submissive and humbled, even if all of mankind plotted, they wouldn&#8217;t pay any attention to it.</p>



<p>The absence of giving importance to the understanding of Tawhid al-Rububiyyah leads to weakness in the hearts towards the people and weakness in the hearts in holding fast to the religion.</p>



<p>And one&#8217;s submission will be weak because he doesn&#8217;t exalt Allah and he doesn&#8217;t see the marvelous creation of Allah in everything.</p>



<p>And the individual said well when he said: And in everything has a sign that shows that He is One.</p>

<p><strong>The practice of the Salaf in removing doubts by asking the scholars.</strong></p>



<p>He said: The practice of the Salaf in removing doubts by asking the scholars.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Not by asking Google, not that an individual searches the websites when he has doubts. No! If you were able to be safe from doubts it wouldn&#8217;t have intruded in your heart! So this individual is unable to remove it. Rather, the one that is able to remove it is the one who inherited from the Prophet ﷺ in explaining the religion. You should go back to a scholar and put forth this doubt to him in order for him to remove it for you. Don&#8217;t go back to other than him because if you went back to other than him, the doubt will increase and it will be established your heart.</p>



<p>Afterwards, he said:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>The scholars will answer it with what will remove the doubt from him. And this is because they only ascribe the statement to the Messenger</strong> ﷺ</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">How will the scholar remove the doubt? With proofs, not with their opinions, or with desires, or with what the people of the land were brought up upon. No! Rather these doubts are removed with proofs. So none has the ability to remove doubts unless he has with him an army of proofs. If he doesn&#8217;t have an army of proofs, he will be from the humiliated. So the strong from the scholars is the one who is strengthened by an army of proofs from the Statements of Allah and the statements of His Messenger ﷺ. If a doubt takes over the heart of the creation, then he has the weapons that he can repel these doubts from himself and the Muslims. So when a doubt befalls the slave, then he is commanded to ask a firmly grounded scholar about it. And the firmly grounded scholar is commanded to repel these doubts with the Statement of Allah and the statement of His Messenger ﷺ.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Exerting Efforts Towards Accomplishing Sincere Righteous Actions</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another cause for the increase and strengthening of eemaan is for the Muslim to exert efforts towards enacting sincere righteous actions for the countenance of Allaah; he should try to do more (good) deeds and to do them on a regular basis.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because for every action that Allaah has legislated, which the Muslim undertakes and with which he makes his intention behind it sincere, it increases him in eemaan, since eemaan increases because of obedience and ample acts of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the servitude that Allaah has enjoined on His slaves and demanded them to enact, the obligatory and voluntary of them, are distributed among the heart, the tongue and the limbs. Each of them has a servitude specific to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Examples of the servitude of the heart that are specific to it are sincerity, love, <em>tawakkul</em>, <em>inaabah</em>, hope, fear, reverence, awe, contentment, patience and other actions of the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Examples of servitude of the tongue that are specific to it are reading the Qur&#8217;aan, <em>takbeer</em>, <em>tasbeeh</em>, <em>tahleel</em>, seeking forgiveness, praising and commending Allaah, sending <em>salaah</em> and salaam upon His Messenger and other actions that can only be done by the tongue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the servitude of the limbs that are specific to it, examples of this are <em>sadaqah</em>, hajj, prayer, ablution, proceeding towards the mosque and other such actions that are only possible with the use of the limbs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, these actions of the heart as well as those of the tongue and the limbs are all from eemaan and are inherently present within the true meaning of the word eemaan. To perform such actions and to increase in them will therefore result in an increase of eemaan and to neglect them and to lessen the performance of them will result in a deficiency of eemaan.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>i. Actions of the Heart</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In reality, actions of the heart are <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>the</strong> <strong>foundation of the religion</strong></span>. They are its uppermost part and the most important of ordinances. In fact, apparent [<span style="color:#999999;">i.e., actions of the limbs and tongue, which are sensed. [t]</span>] actions are not accepted if they are void of any actions of the heart; the reason being that the acceptance of all actions are stipulated by sincerity to Allaah and sincerity is an action of the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why actions of the heart are mandatory upon everyone and the abandonment of such actions can never be deemed praiseworthy under any condition whatsoever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People are of three levels with regard to the accomplishment of these actions, similar to the case with actions of the body: one who oppresses his own self, one who suffices with that which is obligatory and one who chases after the good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consequently, it is imperative of every Muslim that he starts with the purification and rectification of his heart and with having concern for it, before he concentrates with the rectification of his exterior, as no consideration is given to the rectification of the outer whilst the inner is corrupt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, when the Muslim does rectify his heart with purifying actions, sincerity, truthfulness and love for Allaah and His Messenger, his limbs will turn upright as in the hadeeth of an-Nu&#8217;maan Ibn Basheer that is recorded in the two Saheehs. He said: &#8220;I heard the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallallahu alaihe wa-sallam &#8211; say: <i>&#8220;</i><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8230; Indeed, and within the body is a morsel of flesh; if it is sound, then the whole body will be sound and if it is corrupt, then the whole body will be corrupt. Indeed, it is the heart</strong></span><i>.&#8221;</i>&#8221; [Al-Bukhaaree. (1/127 Fath) and Muslim, 3/1220]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth contains the greatest indication that the rectification of the slave&#8217;s outer movements is directly connected to the rectification of the activity of his heart and inner soul.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If his heart is pure, there being only love of Allaah, love of that which Allaah loves, fear of Him and of falling into that which He hates, the movements of his limbs will all become sound. This is in sharp contrast to a corrupt heart which is conquered by a love for desires, chasing lusts and placing the wants of the self first. Whoever is in such a predicament, the movements of his limbs will all be corrupt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For this reason, it is said that <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>the heart is the king of the limbs</strong> </span>and that the rest of the limbs are its soldiers. In addition to this, the limbs are an obedient army to the heart; they race to its obedience and towards the execution of its commands, not opposing it in any matter whatsoever. Thus, if the king is righteous, this army will be a righteous one. If on the other hand, the king is corrupt, the army will, because of this resemblance, also be corrupt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Only the heart that is pure is of benefit before Allaah, as Allaah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">يَوْمَ لَا يَنفَعُ مَالٌ وَلَا بَنُونَ إِلَّا مَنْ أَتَى اللَّهَ بِقَلْبٍ سَلِيمٍ</span> </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#003300;"><span style="color:#000000;">The Day whereon neither wealth nor sons will avail, except for the one who comes to Allaah with a pure heart</span>.</span>&#8220;</b> [Soorah ash-Shu&#8217;araa&#8217; (26):88-89]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The pure heart is the one that is free of all diseases, blights and distasteful matters. It is the heart that contains nothing but love of Allaah, fear of Him and fear of anything that will distance him from Allaah. [<span style="color:#999999;">See Jaami&#8217; al-&#8216;Uloom wa al-Hikam of Ibn Rajab, page 71</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Islaam says: &#8220;<strong>Moreover, the heart is the foundation. If it embodies knowledge and intention, this will take effect on the body without fail. It is not possible for the body to play truant to what the heart desires&#8230; so if the heart is righteous as a result of its knowledge and action on eemaan, this absolutely necessitates the rectification of the body in apparent speech and action in accordance with complete eemaan</strong>.&#8221; [al-Fataawaa, 7/187]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consequently, for one to endeavor to fully fight his self in rectifying his heart and to fill it with love of Allaah and of statements and actions that Allaah loves, is one of the most formidable ways in which one increases his outer and inner eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Rajab says: &#8220;<strong>&#8230;the heart cannot be rectified unless there settles within it knowledge of Allaah, His greatness, love of Him, fear and awe of Him, hope and <em>tawakkul</em> in Him and for it to be overflowing with this. This is the reality of tawheed and the meaning of&#8217; none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah</strong>.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there can be no question for the rectification of the hearts until its deity, which it worships, knows, loves and fears is one deity, having no partner. If there were in the heavens and the earth a deity being worshipped other than Allaah, the heavens and earth would as a result become corrupt, as Allaah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَوْ كَانَ فِيهِمَا آلِهَةٌ إِلَّا اللَّهُ لَفَسَدَتَا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;">Had there been therein </span></b><span style="color:#000000;">(i.e., the heavens and earth) </span><b><span style="color:#000000;">deities besides Allaah, then for sure both would have been ruined&#8230;</span>&#8220;</b> [Soorah al-Anbiyaa&#8217; (21):22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One concludes from this that righteousness cannot be attained by the celestial and earthly worlds until the activity of its inhabitants are made all for Allaah. The movement of the body is dependent on the activity of the heart and its intention. If therefore, the heart&#8217;s movement and desire are for Allaah alone, it will become sound and all the movements of the body will become sound. If, however, the movement and intent of the heart are for other than Allaah, it will become corrupt and the activity of the body will also become corrupt in accordance to the (level of) corruption within the activity of the heart.&#8221; [Jaami&#8217; al-&#8216;Uloom wa al-Hikam, page 71. See al-Waabil as-Sayyib of Ibn al-Qayyim, page 12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been authenticated on the Prophet that he said: <i>&#8220;</i><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Whoever loves for Allaah, hates for Allaah, gives for Allaah and withholds for Allaah has indeed perfected eemaan</strong></span><i>.&#8221;</i> [Related by Aboo Daawood, 4/220, at-Tabaraanee in al-Kabeer, number 7737, Ibn Battah in al-Ibaanah, 2/658 and others. Al-Albaanee declared it saheeh, see as-Silsilah as-Saheehah, 1/658]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;The meaning of this is that with all the motions of the heart and limbs, if they are all for Allaah, the eemaan of the servant, both the interior and exterior, will be complete and the goodness of the activity of the heart necessitate goodness of the activity of the limbs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, if the heart is good, there being only desire of Allaah and of that which He desires, the limbs will only proceed towards that which Allaah desires. Consequently, the limbs hasten towards that which incurs the pleasure of Allaah, they refrain from what Allaah dislikes or what is feared that would be disliked by Allaah even if it is not sure of that.&#8217; [Jaami&#8217; al &#8216;Uloom wa al-Hikam, page 72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever the hearts become righteous with eemaan, truthfulness, sincerity and love and no desire for other than Allaah is left in the heart, all the limbs will attain righteousness and they will not move except for Allaah and only in areas that His pleasure will be attained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the heart is always occupied in thought, either about its essential afterlife and its betterment, or about the welfare of its worldly life and living, or its thoughts center on misgivings, false aspirations and hypothetical circumstances.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sum and substance of the rectification of the heart is that you occupy it with thoughts on that which constitute its welfare and true and actual success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, in the area of knowledge and conceptions, one occupies it with knowledge of what binds one of <em>Tawheed</em> and its rights, of death and what leads on from it up until entering Paradise and Hellfire and of the ill actions and the ways to protect oneself from committing them. In the area of intentions and resolutions, one occupies it with desires of that which will cause one benefit and to reject desires that which will bring harm upon him. [See al-Fawaa&#8217;id of ibn al-Qayyim, page 310 and 311]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, of immense assistance to the servant in this regard is to increase the beneficial observations, which are enacted in the heart, so that his attachment with Allaah strengthens, as the existence of righteous actions is associated to the establishment and great number of these observations in the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Ibn al-Qayyim</strong></span>, may Allaah have mercy upon him, said: &#8220;We will by the aid and tawfeeq granted by Allaah, point out these observations in a manner that will make known the reality of this matter:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The first observation of the traveler to Allaah and the home of the hereafter</strong></span>, is that there exists in his heart an observation of this world and its insignificance, its trivial fulfillment, extensive futility, vile participants and rapid demise&#8230; Thus, if the servant undertakes this observation of the world, his heart will migrate from this world and it will travel to seek the home of the hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At this moment, an observation of the hereafter and its continuity is enacted in his heart. That it is in all truth, <b>the real life</b>. Its inhabitants will never migrate or depart from it. Rather, it is the place of settling, the last stopping point of all travelers and the end of the journey&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereafter, <strong><span style="color:#000000;">an observation of the Fire is made in his heart</span></strong>, of its combustion, blaze and the depth of its pit; its intense heat and the immense torment of its inhabitants. He observes them as they are brought forth to it with blackened faces, blue eyed with iron chains and fetters around their necks. When they reach the fire, its doors will be opened in front of their faces and they will witness that abominable sight, whereupon their hearts will be become severed out of regret and sorrow&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consequently, if this observation is accomplished in the heart of the servant, he will be stripped of sins, disobedience and of following desires and will instead don the guise of fear and caution&#8230; How distant he will actually be from disobedience and violations is dependent on the strength of this observation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This observation will melt away, roast through and expel the destructive remnants and elements within his heart and thereupon, the heart will find the sweetness of well being and its pleasure.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereafter, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>an observation of Paradise is established in the heart</strong></span> and of what Allaah has prepared in it for its inhabitants: things that no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard and no imagination of has ever been made within the heart of a person. This is besides the detailed types of bliss Allaah has portrayed to His servants upon the tongue of His Messenger, guaranteeing the loftiest types of pleasure concerning foods, drink, clothes, palaces, delight and happiness. So, enacted in his heart is an observation of an abode, within which Allaah has placed everlasting bliss in its entirety.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Its ground is musk and its pebbles are pearls. Its structure is made up of bricks of gold and silver and of pearly embroidery. Its drink is sweeter than honey, possesses a fragrance more pleasant than musk, is cooler than camphor and tastier than ginger. In relation to its women, if the face of one of them were to be revealed to this world, it would overpower the radiance of the sun. The clothes of the inhabitants are made of the silk of sarsenet and brocades. Their servants are youths looking like scattered pearls. Their fruit will be everlasting, whose season is not limited and supply not cut off Therein are thrones raised high. Their food is the flesh of the fowls they desire. They will have drink of wine, there being no harmful effect within it and they will not suffer intoxication. Their vegetation is the fruit that they desire. Their view will be of fair females possessing wide lovely eyes like preserved pearls. They will be reclining upon thrones and in that Garden being made happy. In it are what the souls covet, what gratifies the eyes and they will abide in it forever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one adds to this observation, <strong><span style="color:#000000;">the observation of the day of Mazeed</span></strong> &#8220;&#8230; looking at the face of the Lord and listening to His speech without an intermediary&#8230; If this observation is attached to the ones before it, there and then, will the heart race towards its Lord faster than the procession of the wind moving in its direction and the heart will not on its way bother to glance, neither left nor right&#8230;&#8221; [Madaarij as-Saalikeen, 3/250-252]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, if such observations are manifested in the heart of the servant and he contemplates over them, it will be of great help towards the purification of his heart and its eradication of denounced characteristics and ignoble desires and towards the evacuation of any attachment to other than Allaah. Furthermore, it will be a great motive for worship, love, fear, repentance and of feeling in need of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The intent here is to highlight that one of the greatest incentives for eemaan, one of its most beneficial consolidators and most important reasons for its increase and development is the rectification of the heart through eemaan, love of Allaah, His Messenger, of that which Allaah and His Messenger love and to purify it from anything that opposes or nullifies this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is the one who grants tawfeeq.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> &#8230; لِّلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُوا الْحُسْنَىٰ وَزِيَادَةٌ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* i.e., the day of increase. Allaah says in the Qur&#8217;aan: <b>&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;">For those who do righteousness is al-Husnaa and more &#8230;</span>&#8220;</b> [Soorah Yoonus (10):26]</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">لَهُم مَّا يَشَاءُونَ فِيهَا وَلَدَيْنَا مَزِيدٌ</span> </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also says, <b>&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;">There </span></b><span style="color:#000000;">(i.e., Jannah)</span><b><span style="color:#000000;">, they will have all that they desire, and We have more</span>&#8220;</b> [Soorah Qaaf (50):35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Husnaa</em> has been explained to mean <em>Jannah</em> and &#8216;more&#8217; to mean seeing Allaah. This is attested to by the hadeeth recorded in Saheeh Muslim and Sunan at-Tirmidhee and related by Suhayb ar-Roomee, may Allaah be pleased with him, in which the Prophet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;</i><strong><span style="color:#000000;">When the people of <em>Jannah</em> enter <em>Jannah</em>, Allaah will say ‘Would you like something I con increase you with?’ They will reply, ‘Have you not whitened our faces? Have you not admitted us into <em>jannah</em> and saved us from the Fire?’</span></strong><i>&#8220;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet then said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Then the veil will be lifted and they will not have been given anything more beloved to them than seeing their Lord.&#8221;</strong></span> In a similar narration, the end reads: &#8220;The Prophet then recited this aayah: <span style="color:#000000;"><b>&#8220;For those who do righteousness is al-Husnaa and more&#8230;&#8221;</b></span> [t]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>ii. Actions of the Tongue</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for actions of the tongue like the remembrance of Allaah, praising and commending Him, reading His Book, sending <em>salaah</em> and salaam upon His Messenger, ordering the good, forbidding the evil, <em>tasbeeh</em>, seeking forgiveness, supplication and other actions that are performed by use of the tongue, without doubt, performing such actions, on a regular basis and often is one of the greatest causes for the increase of eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ibn as-Sa&#8217;dee, may Allaah have mercy upon him, says: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>One of the causes that procures eemaan is to greater the remembrance of Allaah at all times and to also supplicate much, which is the core of worship</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Remembrance of Allaah implants the tree of eemaan in the heart. It nourishes and develops it. The more the servant increases in his remembrance of Allaah, the stronger his eemaan will become.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as eemaan calls to much remembrance, whoever loves Allaah will mention Him much. [As the saying goes: &#8220;Whoever loves something, increases in his mention of it&#8221; [t]] Indeed, love of Allaah is eemaan, or rather, it is its spirit.&#8221; [Al-Tawdeeh wa al-Bayaan, pg. 32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim mentions in his book al-Waabil as-Sayyib that remembrance has a hundred benefits. He listed seventy-three of these benefits [See al-Waabil as-Sayyib, pg. 84 and onwards], such as that remembrance repels Shaytaan. It pleases the Most Beneficent, causes depression and anxiety to disappear and brings joy and happiness. It strengthens the heart and body, illuminates the face and heart, brings about sustenance and many other tremendous benefits that he mentioned, may Allaah have mercy upon him, which are attained because of the remembrance of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Undoubtedly, the greatest and most beneficial benefit in the remembrance of Allaah is the fact that it increases eemaan, strengthens it and stabilizes it. Accordingly, a number of texts are related &#8216;in the Book and Sunnah, which command and encourage the remembrance of Allaah. They beckon for its increase and show its excellence and importance. Allaah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَاذْكُرُوا اللَّهَ كَثِيرًا لَّعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ ..</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; and remember Allaah much so that you may succeed</span>.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Jumu&#8217;ah (62):10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَالذَّاكِرِينَ اللَّهَ كَثِيرًا وَالذَّاكِرَاتِ أَعَدَّ اللَّهُ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةً وَأَجْرًا عَظِيمًا ..</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; and (for) men and women who remember Allaah much, Allaah has prepared for them forgiveness and a great reward.</span>&#8220;</b> [Soorah al-Ahzaab (33):35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8230; إِنَّمَا الْمُؤْمِنُونَ الَّذِينَ إِذَا ذُكِرَ اللَّهُ وَجِلَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;">Indeed, the believers are none other than those whom when Allaah is mentioned, their hearts tremble with fear…</span>&#8220;</b> [Soorah al-Anfaal (8):2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>أَلَا بِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ تَطْمَئِنُّ الْقُلُوبُ&#8230;</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; Verily, it is in the remembrance of Allaah that the hearts (truly) attain tranquility</span>&#8220;</b> [Soorah ar-Ra&#8217;d (13):28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As recorded in Saheeh Muslim, Aboo Hurayrah, may Allaah be pleased with him, reports: &#8220;The Messenger of Allaah was on his way to Makkah when he passed by a mountain known as jumdaan. He said, <i>&#8216;Travel through, this is Jumdaan: the mufarridoon have excelled.’ </i>Someone asked, &#8216;Who are the mufarridoon O Messenger of Allaah?&#8217; He replied, <i>&#8216;Men and women who remember Allaah much.&#8217;</i>&#8221; [Muslim, 4/2062]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Dardaa&#8217;, may Allaah be pleased with him, relates the Prophet saying: <i>&#8220;Should I not inform you of the best of your deeds, the most sanctifying of them before your Lord and which does more to raise your status with Him. (A deed,) that is better for you than the disbursement of gold and money, or battle with the enemy whereby you strike at their necks and they strike at yours?&#8221;</i> They said: &#8220;What is it O Messenger of Allaah?&#8221; He replied: <i>&#8220;Remembrance of Allaah.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Related by Ahmad, 5/195; Ibn Maajah, 2/1245; at-Tirmidhee, 5/459; at-Tabaraanee in ad-Du&#8217;aa&#8217;, 3/1636; al-Haakim, 1/496; Aboo Nu&#8217;aym in al-Hilya, 2/12; al-Baghawee in Sharh as-Sunnah, 5/10 and al-Mundhiree mentioned it in at-Targheeb wa at-Tarheeb, 2/395 via many chains from Ziyaad Ibn Abee Ziyaad from Abee Bahriyyah from Aboo Dardaa&#8217; from the Prophet. Al-Haakim declared: &#8220;This hadeeth has a chain of narration that is saheeh and it has not been related by al-Bukhaaree or Muslim.&#8221; Adh-Dhahabee agreed. Ibn &#8216;Abdil-Barr states: &#8220;This is related with a connection to the Prophet via chains that are good,&#8221; Al-Baghawee and al-Mundharee declared its chain of narration to be hasan.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah Ibn Busr mentioned that a man said to the Prophet : &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah, the rites of eemaan are much for me, so tell me of something that I might hold fast to.&#8221; He answered: <i>&#8220;</i><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Let not your tongue cease from the remembrance of Allaah</strong></span><i>.&#8221;</i>[Related by Ibn Abee Shaybah, 10/301 &amp; 13/458; at-Tirmidhee, 5/458; Ibn Maajah, 2/1246 and al-Haakim, 1/495. At-Tirmidhee declared: &#8220;The hadeeth is hasan ghareeb.&#8221; Al-Haakim said: &#8220;This hadeeth has a chain of narration that is saheeh and it has not been related by al-Bukhaaree or Muslim.&#8221; Adh-Dhahabee agreed. Al-Albaanee mentioned in his checking of al-Kalim at-Tayyib, page 25: &#8220;Its chain of narration is Saheeh&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Recorded in the Saheehayn is the hadeeth of Aboo Hurayrah, may Allaah be pleased with him, in which he reports the Messenger of Allaah as saying: <i>&#8220;</i><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allaah says, ‘Indeed I am as My servant presumes Me to be and I am with him when he remembers Me. So if he remembers Me to himself I remember him to Myself and if he remembers Me amongst a company, I remember him amongst a company that is better than them &#8230;</strong></span><i>&#8220;</i> [Al-Bukhaaree, (13/384 with Fath) and Muslim, 4/2061] Many other texts are likewise indicative of the excellence and importance of remembrance and of the virtue of engaging in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consequently, if a person turns away from all of this and does not engage his tongue with remembrance of Allaah, his tongue will be engrossed with matters besides it such as backbiting, slander, mockery, lies and obscene language. This is because the slave cannot but speak. Thus, if he does not speak with the remembrance of Allaah and of His commands, he will speak of these things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim says: &#8220;For the tongue does not keep quiet at all. It is either a tongue that remembers or a tongue that is frivolous and it has to be one of these two.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the (nature of the) soul; if you do not preoccupy it with truth, it will occupy you with falsehood. It is the (nature of the) heart; if you do not accommodate it with love of Allaah, it will dwell with love of creation and this is a certain reality. It is the (nature of the) tongue, if you do not preoccupy it with remembrance, it will most definitely occupy you with frivolity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, choose for your own self one of the two courses and confer upon it one of the two standings.&#8221; [Al-Waabil as-Sayyib, pages 166- 167 and also see page 87]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>iii. Actions of the Limbs</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the actions of the heart like prayer, fasting, hajj, sadaqah, jihaad and other acts of obedience, they are also reasons for the increase of eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To exert efforts therefore, towards enacting acts of obedience, which Allaah has made incumbent upon His slaves and performing acts that achieve nearness (to Allaah), which Allaah has recommended His servants to undertake and to accomplish these acts in a proficient and complete manner, is one of the most tremendous causes behind the strengthening and increase of eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>قَدْ أَفْلَحَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>الَّذِينَ هُمْ فِي صَلَاتِهِمْ خَاشِعُونَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ عَنِ اللَّغْوِ مُعْرِضُونَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ لِلزَّكَاةِ فَاعِلُونَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ لِفُرُوجِهِمْ حَافِظُونَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِلَّا عَلَىٰ أَزْوَاجِهِمْ أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ غَيْرُ مَلُومِينَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>فَمَنِ ابْتَغَىٰ وَرَاءَ ذَٰلِكَ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْعَادُونَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ لِأَمَانَاتِهِمْ وَعَهْدِهِمْ رَاعُونَ  </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ عَلَىٰ صَلَوَاتِهِمْ يُحَافِظُونَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>أُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْوَارِثُونَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>الَّذِينَ يَرِثُونَ الْفِرْدَوْسَ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><b>&#8220;Successful indeed are the believers: those who offer their prayers with all solemnity and full submissiveness; who turn away from al-Laghw; who pay the zakaah; who guard their chastity, except from their wives or those that their right hands possess, for them, they are free from blame. However, whoever seeks beyond that, then they are the transgressors; those who are faithfully true to their amaanaat and covenants and those who strictly guard their prayers. These are indeed the inheritors, who shall inherit Firdaws. They shall abide therein forever.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah al-Mu&#8217;minoon (23):1-11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These precious qualities, each one of them profits and develops eemaan. They are also characteristics of eemaan and fall under its explanation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the attendance of the heart in prayer and the event of the praying person striving with his self to call to mind and heart what he is saying and doing, such as recitation, remembrance, supplication, standing, sitting, bowing and prostration, are reasons for the increase and development of eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah named prayer &#8216;eemaan&#8217; when He said:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8230; وَمَا كَانَ اللَّهُ لِيُضِيعَ إِيمَانَكُمْ &#8230;</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; and Allaah would never cause your eemaan</span></b><span style="color:#000000;"> [<span style="color:#999999;">i.e., the prayers that were performed towards the direction of Jerusalem, before the commandment of changing the qiblah to the Ka&#8217;bah in Makkah. [t]</span>]</span><b><span style="color:#000000;"> to be lost &#8230;</span>&#8220;</b>[Soorah al-Baqarah (2):143]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, concerning the statement of Allaah:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> &#8230; إِنَّ الصَّلَاةَ تَنْهَىٰ عَنِ الْفَحْشَاءِ وَالْمُنكَرِ ۗ وَلَذِكْرُ اللَّهِ أَكْبَرُ &#8230;</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; and establish the prayer. Verily, the prayer prevents from all obscenities and evil deeds. And the remembrance of Allaah is greater &#8230;</span>&#8220;</b> [Soorah al-Ankaboot (29):45]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Prayer is the greatest obstructer of every obscene and evil deed that negates eemaan. In addition, prayer also embodies the remembrance of Allaah, which nourishes and develops eemaan because of His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; And the remembrance of Allaah is greater &#8230;</span>&#8220;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, <em>zakaah</em> also nurtures and increases eemaan, (both) the obligatory type of <em>zakaah</em> and its recommended type, as the Prophet has said, <i>&#8220;… and sadaqah is proof.&#8221;</i> i.e., a proof for the eemaan of its giver. Hence, it is evidence of eemaan and it nourishes and develops it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further, to avert from <em>al-Laghw</em>, which is any speech or action that is void of good. Instead they (i.e., the believers) speak and do well, and abandon evil in both speech and action. This is without doubt, from eemaan and eemaan increases and profits from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why whenever the Companions, may Allaah be pleased with them, and those after them sensed heedlessness or their eemaan was in disarray, they would say to each other, ‘Sit with us so that we may have eemaan for an hour’. So they would remember Allaah and remember his religious and worldly favors causing their eemaan to renew itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Again, abstaining from forbidden and indecent acts, especially, the obscenity of fornication, this is definitely a great sign for eemaan. The believer, because of the fear he has concerning his standing in front of his Lord, he:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">نَهَى النَّفْسَ عَنِ الْهَوَىٰ &#8230;</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; restrained himself from impure evil desires and lusts.</span>&#8220;</b> [Soorah an-Naazi&#8217;aat (79):40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">… in response to the necessity of eemaan and to nourish what he already possesses of eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, observing trusts and contracts and preserving them is from the signs of eemaan and related in a hadeeth: <i>&#8220;… and there is no eemaan for the one who is not trustworthy.&#8221;</i> [Related by Ahmad, 3/135; Ibn Abee Shaybah in both his Musannaf, 11/11 and al-Eemaan, pg.5; Ibn Hibbaan in his Saheeh, (1/208 al-Ihsaan) and al-Baghawee in Sharh as-Sunnah, 1 /75. Al-Baghawee declared, &#8220;This is a hasan hadeeth&#8221; It was declared saheeh by al-Albaanee in his tahqeeq of al-Eemaan by Ibn Abee Shaybah]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you would like to know of the eemaan and religion of a slave, then inspect his condition: does he fulfill all of his trusts and contracts, the verbal and financial or trusts concerning rights? Does he observe the rights, covenants and oaths, the ones between himself and Allaah or those between himself and his fellow servants? If the answer is in the positive then he is a person of religion and eemaan. If however that is not the case, his religion and eemaan will be deficient in accordance to the level of his infringement of these obligations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah ended these <em>aayaat</em> with the issue of safeguarding the prayers with respect to their limits, rights and times. This is because preservation of this, is of similar standing to the water that flows around the garden of eemaan. So it irrigates it, nurtures it and produces its crop upon every occasion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tree of eemaan is in need of constant irrigation at all times; this irrigation is the maintenance of acts of obedience and worship of the day and night. It also demands the obliteration of anything that harms it, such as alien and harmful rocks and growths; this is in reference to the abstention from unlawful matters in both speech and action. Whenever these undertakings are accomplished, this garden will witness its geese and it will produce its assorted crop.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In light of this clarification, the strong effect of righteous actions on the increase of eemaan has become clear to us. It is also clear that the performance and increase of these acts are a tremendous cause for the increase of eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Islaam says: &#8220;The perfection of eemaan is in enacting the commands of Allaah and His Messenger and refraining from the prohibitions of Allaah and His Messenger. Consequently, if one does not perform certain commandments and replaces them by embarking on certain prohibitions; this will result in a proportional decrease of eemaan.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, prayer is eemaan, hajj is eemaan, sadaqah is eemaan, jihaad is eemaan and all the actions that Allaah has ordered His slaves with are eemaan. If the servant does these acts his eemaan will increase and the performance of these actions will be a cause for the increase of his eemaan, on the condition of sincerity and adherence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad al-&#8216;Uthaymeen, may Allaah preserve him, states: &#8220;The increase of eemaan has causes, some of these are: performing acts of obedience because eemaan increases in proportion to the fineness, type and abundance of the action. Thus the finer the action the greater will be the increase of eemaan; the fine aspect of the action is determined by the degree of sincerity and adherence. As for the type of action, the obligatory type is better than the recommended and some forms of worship are more emphasized and virtuous than others; the more virtuous the act of obedience is the greater will be the resultant increase in eemaan. As for the abundance of the action, then eemaan increases as a result of it because action is from eemaan, so it is not surprising that eemaan increases because of an increase of the action.&#8221; [Fath Rabb al-Bariyyah, pg. 65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, other great righteous actions that increase eemaan, which have not yet been mentioned are da&#8217;wah to Allaah and keeping company with virtuous people. Because of the importance and great benefit of these two matters in the increase of eemaan, its discussion is imperative.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for da&#8217;wah to Allaah and to His religion, consulting each other with the truth and patience, calling to the fundamentals of the religion, to the adherence of its laws by way of ordering the good and forbidding the evil and sincerely advising the Muslims, this is all from the incentives and causes for eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With this, the servant perfects himself and others, as Allaah has sworn by time, [Refer to Soorah al-&#8216;Asr (103). [t]] that the whole genus of humans are in a state of loss except for the one who is categorized with four qualities: eemaan and righteous actions, which both constitute the perfection of the self (thirdly) mutual consultation with the truth, which is beneficial knowledge, righteous action and the true religion and (fourthly) mutual consultation with patience in all of this, and with these (last) two, others are perfected.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because da&#8217;wah to Allaah itself and advising His servants are amongst the greatest fortifiers of eemaan. The person involved in da&#8217;wah has to work to aid this da&#8217;wah and establish the proofs and evidences for its realization. He has to undertake matters from their proper channels and approach issues from their rightful paths. These issues are from the ways and channels of eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Islaam states: &#8220;The reason for the presence of eemaan and its constituents sometimes traces back to the servant (himself) and at other times back to others, for example, one is destined to interact with someone who invites him to eemaan, orders him with good and forbids him from evil. He explains to him the signs of the religion, its proofs and evidences. He shows him what to consider, what befalls him, what to take heed from. In addition (to this), there are many other reasons.&#8221; [Al-Fataawa, 7/650]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the reward is always from the same class as the action. So, just as the person strives to perfect his fellow servants, advises them, consults them with truth and to be patience in all this, Allaah will most definitely compensate him with rewards similar to his actions. Allaah will assist him with a light and spirit from Him and with strength of eemaan and tawakkul.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Eemaan and strong tawakkul on Allaah bring about victory over the enemies of the devils of men and jinn as Allaah has said:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّهُ لَيْسَ لَهُ سُلْطَانٌ عَلَى الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><b>&#8220;Verily, he </b>(i.e., Shaytaan)<b> has no power over those who have eemaan and put their trust solely on their Lord.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah an-Nahl (16):99]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, this person is also occupied with aiding the truth and whoever turns to undertake something, then he will most definitely be granted certain triumphs in knowledge and eemaan according to his truthfulness and sincerity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One who commands the good and forbids the evil must therefore remain adherent to truthfulness and sincerity when commanding and forbidding in order for it to bear fruit and produce pure eemaan in him as well as those whom he is propagating to. He must also observe wisdom and leniency when inviting, be patient with those whom he is calling and to have knowledge of that which he is calling them to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If these features are realized within him, his da’wah will bear fruit and benefit by the will of Allaah and it will be a cause for the strengthening of his eemaan and of those whom he is calling.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for keeping company with virtuous people, clinging to them, accompanying them and coveting to benefit from them, this is a great cause for the increase of eemaan. The reason being that these type of gatherings embody reminder of Allaah, fear of Him and His punishment, targheeb, tarheeb and other matters, which are of the greatest of causes towards the increase of eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Allaah says:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">وَذَكِّرْ فَإِنَّ الذِّكْرَىٰ تَنفَعُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><b>&#8220;And remind, for indeed, reminding benefits the believers&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah adh-Dhaariyaat (51):55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>فَذَكِّرْ إِن نَّفَعَتِ الذِّكْرَىٰ سَيَذَّكَّرُ مَن يَخْشَىٰ وَيَتَجَنَّبُهَا الْأَشْقَى</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><b>&#8220;Therefore, remind, in case the reminder benefits; those who fear will remember and the wretched will avoid it.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah al-A&#8217;laa (87):9-11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This shows that possessors of believing hearts benefit greatly from reminders and from being in congregations of remembrance. It provokes activity and resolution within them and obligates profit and elevation. This is in stark contrast to gatherings of frivolity and foolishness, for these are immense reasons for the decrease and fading away of eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To this effect, our righteous predecessors were the most concerned with gatherings of remembrance and the most distant from meetings of frivolity and foolishness. Many of their statements that indicate this have preceded, like the accounts of &#8216;Umayr Ibn Habeeb al-Khatmee and Mu&#8217;aadh Ibn Jabal, may Allaah be pleased with them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is another cause, with which I will end the discussion on these causes, which one must pay attention to and not neglect. The Muslim has to train and adapt himself to fight everything that causes a decrease, weakness or disappearance of eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Since, in relation to eemaan, just as one must enact all the causes that strengthen and develop eemaan, then likewise, in addition to this, one must repel the preventive matters and obstacles (towards the attainment and increase of eemaan). Repelling these are accomplished by the abandonment of disobedience; being repentant of the disobedience one does commit; safeguarding the limbs from the unlawful issues and opposing the trials and afflictions of misconceptions that weaken the desires of eemaan, which are in essence, the desire and love for good. Endeavoring after this can only be accomplished by abandoning desires that (would otherwise) negate those desires (of eemaan), such as desire of the soul for evil and by opposing the soul that constantly commands evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the servant preserves himself from falling into the trials and tribulations of misconceptions and desires, his eemaan will become complete and his certainty will become strong.&#8221; [At-Tawdeeh wa al-Bayaan of Ibn as-Sa&#8217;dee, page 37]</p>

<p>Al-Haafidh ibn Hajr al-Asqalaanee, may Allah have mercy upon him and provide us with his knowledge, said:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The heart has been singled out for this because it is the leader of the body, and through the purification of the leader the subjects become purified, and with his corruption they become corrupted. So if you, O servant of Allah, with to cure your heart then it is upon you to be truthful with regards to seeking refuge with Allah and putting your trust in Him, to pray a great deal of superogatory prayers, to perform the actions of obedience to Allah frequently, to pray the night prayer while the people are sleeping, and to treat your heart by making it continuously stick to the remembrances and by befriending only the righteous … and to frequently recite the Qur’an. And Allah will indeed allow all of this to be preserved by him.”</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Ar-Rajaa’</em></strong><strong> (hope and longing) and its Proof</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof for <em>ar-Rajaa’</em> (hope and longing) is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَمَن كَانَ يَرْجُو لِقَاءَ رَبِّهِ فَلْيَعْمَلْ عَمَلًا صَالِحًا وَلَا يُشْرِكْ بِعِبَادَةِ رَبِّهِ أَحَدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So whoever has hope in the meeting with his Lord and in His reward then let him perform righteous actions and not associate anyone in worship with his Lord </strong></span>[18:110]<strong> <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>16</sup></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>16</strong></span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High, “<strong><em>man kaana yarjoo</em></strong>”: meaning he has hope for the reward of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and in seeing Him openly on the Day of Resurrection, whoever has hope in seeing Allaah openly with his eyes on the day of resurrection, then let him perform righteous deeds, he should carry out the means which will enable him to attain this goal, which is the reward of entry into Paradise and of being saved from the Fire and of looking upon the Face of Allaah – this necessarily follows on, because whoever enters Paradise, then he will see Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَمَن كَانَ يَرْجُو لِقَاءَ رَبِّهِ فَلْيَعْمَلْ عَمَلًا صَالِحًا وَلَا يُشْرِكْ بِعِبَادَةِ رَبِّهِ أَحَدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So whoever has hope in the meeting with his Lord and in His reward then let him perform righteous actions</span> </strong>[18:110]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This shows that hope alone is not sufficient, rather there must be action, as for your just having hope in Allaah, but you do not act, then this is to abandon the use of the means. So praiseworthy hope is that which occurs along with righteous action. As for hoping which is not praiseworthy, then it hope which does not have righteous action along with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And righteous action is that which fulfills <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>two conditions</strong></span>:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first</strong>: is that it is done purely and sincerely for Him, the Mighty and Majestic.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second</strong>: is that it is done following the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So an action will not be righteous unless it fulfills these two conditions: that it is done purely and sincerely seeking the Face of Allaah, it does not contain any <em>shirk</em>, and that it should be a correct action, done upon the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>, not containing innovation. So if the two conditions are met then it will be a righteous action, and if any condition is missing, then it will be a corrupt action, it will not benefit the person who does it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So action which contains shirk will be rejected for the person, and likewise action which contains innovation, it will be rejected for the person. He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<span style="color:#808000;">Whoever does an action which is not in accordance with our affair, then it will be rejected</span>” </strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this aayah contains <em>ar-Rajaa’</em> (hope and longing), and that it is an act of worship to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. And it shows that hope will not be correct except along with righteous action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree in disconnected form straight after <u>h</u>adeeth 7350, and reported by Muslim as <u>h</u>adeeth 1718/17 from a <u>h</u>adeeth of ‘Aa’ishah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhaa. </em>And also reported by al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree in connected form as <u>h</u>adeeth 2697 and Muslim as <u>h</u>adeeth 1718/17 from ‘Aa’ishah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhaa, </em>that she said, Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu’ alaihi wa sallam </em>said, “Whoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it will have it rejected”.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">This is a treatise that is found in ‘Fataawaa’ of Shaykh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah. The book discusses: the diseases of the hearts and their cures; the diseases of envy, and the diseases of desire and envy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Know O beloved reader that it is most important to spend one&#8217;s time and energy in treating the heart, and hastening to correct and purify it from sickness and all sins. This is due to the heart occupying a great and lofty position in Islaam, for it is the place to which the Lord looks and the storehouse for tawheed, faith, and sincerity. Actions are distinguished, one from the other, with respect to their excellence in the Sight of Allah in accordance with the condition of the heart, not by their number or form, but rather due to the strength of the caller, his or her truthfulness, his or her sincerity and the extent to which he or she prefers Allah over himself or herself &#8230;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh ibn Hajr al-Asqalaanee, may Allah have mercy upon him and provide us with his knowledge, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;The heart has been singled out for this because it is the leader of the body, and through the purification of the leader the subjects become purified, and with his corruption they become corrupted. So if you, O servant of Allah, with to cure your heart then it is upon you to be truthful with regards to seeking refuge with Allah and putting your trust in Him, to pray a great deal of superogatory prayers, to perform the actions of obedience to Allah frequently, to pray the night prayer while the people are sleeping, and to treat your heart by making it continuously stick to the remembrances and by befriending only the righteous &#8230; and to frequently recite the Qur&#8217;an. And Allah will indeed allow all of this to be preserved by him.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[7] Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Allaah says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَجَعَلْنَا عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ أَكِنَّةً أَن يَفْقَهُوهُ وَفِي آذَانِهِمْ وَقْرًا<br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> <strong>“And We placed veils upon their hearts – so that they understand it not – and deafness in their ears.”</strong> [Surah Al-An’aam: 25]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Some people perceive this ayah to contain a sense of coercion in it (on the part of Allaah). So what is your opinion with regards to this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[7] Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“placing”</strong> </span>is an existential (<em>kawnee</em>) type of placing. In order to understand this, we must explain the meaning of Allaah’s Divine Desire (<em>Iraadah</em>). Divine Desire is divided into two categories.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Shar’ee</em> (Legislative) Desire and the <em>Kawnee</em> (Existential) Desire</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Legislative Desire is everything that Allaah has legislated for His servants and incited them to do, such as acts of worship and obedience, regardless of their rulings, whether obligatory or recommended. Allaah desires and loves these acts of worship and obedience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Existential Desire, it may at times be something that Allaah did not legislate but yet preordained. This type of Desire is only called “Existential Desire” since its term was derived from Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">إِنَّمَا أَمْرُهُ إِذَا أَرَادَ شَيْئًا أَن يَقُولَ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Verily, His Command – when He desires something – is only that He says to it ‘Be’ and it is.”</strong> </span>[Surah YaaSeen: 82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word <strong>“something”</strong> here is an indefinite noun which consists of everything, whether acts of obedience or acts of disobedience. Such things come into existence by Allaah’s saying to it: “Be.” Meaning: It occurs through His Will, Ordainment, and Pre- Decree. So if we come to realize this Existential Desire, which includes everything regardless if it is an act of obedience or an act of disobedience, it will definitely lead us back to the subject of Al-Qadaa wal-Qadar (Allaah’s Divine Ordainment and Pre- Decree, since Allaah’s statement: <strong>“Verily, His Command – when He desires something – is only that He says to it ‘Be’ and it is”</strong> means that the thing to which He said “Be” is something He decreed, which will definitely come into existence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everything, according to Allaah, is decreed – it either consists of good or it consists of evil. However, that which applies from it to us – the two species of mankind and jinn who have been ordered by Allaah and are accountable for our actions – is that we look at what we do. The things we do either occur purely from our desire and free choice or they occur in spite of what we desire. Acts of obedience or disobedience do not apply to this second category and the end result of it is not Paradise or Hellfire. It is only the first category that the religious laws revolve around. And it is based on this that a person will be rewarded with either Paradise or the Hellfire. This means that whatever a person does based on his own desire and whatever he chases after through His actions and free choice, this is what he will be held accountable for. If it is good, then he will have good and if it is bad, then he will have bad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fact that a person has a free choice in a large portion of his actions is a fact that cannot be argued with whether religiously or intellectually.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for religiously, there are numerous texts from the Qur’aan and Sunnah that confirm that a person may choose to do what he is ordered to do and abandon what he is forbidden from doing. These texts are too numerous to mention.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for intellectually, it is clear to every person that is void of whims and desires that whenever he speaks or walks or eats or drinks or does anything that involves his free will, he is choosing on his own to do that action and not being forced to do that at all. For example, if I wish to speak right now, there is naturally no one that can force me to do that. However, this speech (of mine) is pre-decreed. What is meant by my speaking these words in spite of it being pre-decreed is that it is pre-ordained along with my free choice of what I will say and talk about. However, I have the ability to remain silent to make clear – to those doubtful about what I’m saying – that I have a free choice in the matter of speaking.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, the fact that a person has a free choice and a free will is something that cannot be disputed or argued against. And as for one who does argue against such a fact, then this person is only arguing philosophically and casting doubts on self-evident intuitions. And when a person reaches this stage, he can no longer be talked to (logically).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the actions of a human being are divided into two categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Those that are done out of his choice and free will<br />
2. Those that are done as a result of him being forced and coerced to</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have nothing to say about the actions that are done due to coercion – not from a religious perspective or from a real-life perspective. The religion is only concerned with the matters of free choice and free will. This is the truth of the matter. If we implant this into our minds, we will be able to understand the afore-mentioned ayah: <strong>“And We placed veils upon their hearts.”</strong> This refers to the Existential Placing. We must remember that the afore-mentioned ayah: <strong>“Verily, His Command – when He desires something”</strong> refers to the Existential Desire. However, it is not done against the will and choice of this person whom Allaah has placed veils over his heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here is an example of this from an actual perspective: When a human being is created, he is formed while his flesh is still soft and tender. Then as he gets older and older, his flesh becomes harder and his bones become stronger. However, not all people are the same in this regard. So lets say for example this person is devoted to (learning) some type of study or science. What part of the body will grow strong in this person? His mind will strengthen. His brain will become stronger in the field that he preoccupies it with and applies all of its abilities on. However, from a physical standpoint, his body will not strengthen nor will his muscles develop.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The opposite of this is exactly true as well, for there may be a person that completely applies himself physically. So everyday he engages in sports and physical training – as we say today. Such a person’s muscles and body will progress and become strong. And he will acquire an image just like those that we see sometimes in real-life and sometimes in pictures in which for example the bodies of these athletes have become all muscle. Was this person created this way? Or did he earn and acquire for himself this strong physique loaded with muscles? This is something that he has attained based on his own actions and free choice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">This is the same example as someone who lingers in his misguidance, rejection, disbelief and denial and as a result attains this condition of these veils being placed by Allaah over his heart, not because Allaah compelled and forced this upon him but rather due to his actions and free choice.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So this is the existential placing which these disbelieving people have acquired (for themselves). They have gotten themselves to this point, which the ignorant think they were forced into, when in reality, such a fate was not obliged upon them, but rather came about due to what their own hands earned. And Allaah does not oppress His servants.</strong></span></p>

<p><strong>Transcription of the Audio:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillaah hir Rahman nir Raheem. Alhumdulillahi Rabbil Aalameen<br />
Wa sallallahu ala Muhammadin wa ala aalihi wa sahbihi wa sallam</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The pillars of Kufr are four, they are,</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Haughtiness and disdainfullnes : This prevents the person from submission i.e. yielding.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Envy (Al Hasad) : This prevents him from accepting the naseehah i.e. the advice and from exerting it.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Anger (Al Ghadab) : This prevents him from being just.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Lusts : This prevents him from giving himself to worship.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If the pillar of false pride and haughtiness is demolished, then submission will become easy for him. If the pillar of envy is demolished, then it becomes easier for him to accept advice and to offer it. If the pillar of anger is demolished, it becomes easy for him to be just and humble. If the pillar of lust is demolished, it becomes easy for him to be patient and ready for worship.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The demolishing of mountains is much more easier than demolishing these four pillars for the one who is  afflicted with it, specially if they are entrenched in him and became as a firmed attribute, because no action can be upright with the presence of these pillars and no soul can be sanctified and purified having these established in it and whenever the person wants to exert himself to do or to act, these four pillars come and corrupt his work. And all other defects originate from these four and if these four are established in the heart it will make him see falsehood in the form of the truth and truth in the form of falsehood and good in the form of wrong and wrong in the form of good and it will make this life grow nearer to him and make the hereafter far removed from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you contemplate the Kufr of the nations before, you will see that the Kufr of the nations originated from these four pillars and upon these four pillars the punishment will befall. The intensity of the punishment and it&#8217;s severity will depend upon how these four and entrenched. So whoever opens for himself these four pillars is indeed has opened all the doors of evil, sooner or later and whoever has closed the doors of these then he indeed has closed all the doors of evil because these four prevents submissiveness, sincerity, repentance and longing and turning to Allah, acceptance of the truth, the advice to the Muslims, humbleness to Allah and to his creation. This is what these four pillars can do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The origin of these four pillars is from man&#8217;s ignorance concerning his Lord and ignorance concerning himself.  Had he known of his Lord qualified with the most perfect and magnificent attributes and had he known himself qualified with all forms of defects, he wouldn&#8217;t be haughty, angry, envious of others because envy in fact is one form of opposition to Allah because he dislikes the favour and blessing of Allah which he bestowed upon his slave while Allah loves that. Not only that, he likes that it to be rifted from his brother and Allah does not like that. So he is opposing Allah in his pre-decree and what Allah loves and his honour and that is why Iblees (Satan) is enemy  because his sin was due to haughtiness, arrogance and envy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can these be removed?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These two qualities, knowing Allah and Tawheed, and content with him and pleased with him and turning to him, takes away these two qualities of haughtiness and envy and taking anger away by knowing oneself that the self does not deserve all that so that to be angry for it and to avenge for its all sake. In this case this will prompt it to be contempt once this is taken out. Otherwise then this will be preference for the self over its creator and originator. The greatest thing to repel this defect is to train the self to get angry for Allah&#8217;s sake and whatever at any time enters the self this type of anger for Allah&#8217;s sake, there will exit the anger for its self and the opposite is true. As to the lust, its cure, its healing is in the correct knowledge. Yielding to the self&#8217;s lust deprives it from the correct knowledge and putting it on a diet in that respect puts it on the linkage with the correct knowledge. The more you are open the door for lusts, the more you are trying to deprive the self  from the correct knowledge and the more you close it, the more you will be linked to the correct knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anger is like the wild animal. If its owner releases it, it starts by eating him up first. Lust is like the fire when the person ignites it it begins by burning him there in first. Al-Kibr, haughtiness, false pride, arrogance is like confronting the king regarding the king&#8217;s possession and kingdom, if he does not destroy you he will expel you. Envy is like opposing someone who is more powerful and more stronger than you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>This is based on Imam Ibn Al Qayim&#8217;s (rahimahAllah) specification of these four pillars of Kufr.</em></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Advising the one who says &#8220;Taqwa is here&#8221; and he continues to Sin</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>A Doubt and its Rebuttle</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 15:</strong> <span style="color:#993300;">What lead to this question is that nowadays there is a group of people when they are called to worship Allaah they say: “Allaah is the Rabb of the hearts.” We would like also that you comment on this response?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong> We say that Allaah is indeed the Rabb of the hearts as well as the tongues. He is not the Rabb of the hearts only; and if the hearts become good then the limbs become good, because the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, there is a piece of flesh in the body, if it becomes good [reformed], the whole of the body becomes good but if it gets spoilt the whole body gets spoilt and that is the heart.</span> [29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Hadeeth renders the futile and false the claim by some, who when you advise him in regard to certain things with which he disobeys Allaah, he says: “at-Taqwaa [30] is right here,” and he points towards his chest.[31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His is a word of truth intended to imply something futile. In fact a word may be true in its general sense, but the speaker intends to imply by it a futile meaning. Indeed think of the Saying of Allaah, The Most High, concerning the Mushriks:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Mushriks will say: “If Allaah had willed, we would have not committed Shirk, nor would our fathers, and we would not have forbidden anything [against His Will]!</span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-An’aam (6): 148].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, they said: “If Allaah had willed, we would have not committed Shirk,” and they were truthful in that which they said. Because if Allaah had willed, they would have not committed Shirk. They, however, did not intend the truth by using this word. Rather, they wanted to justify their staying on their Shirk and the lifting of punishment from upon them. This is why Allaah, The Most High, Said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Likewise belied those who were before them, [they argued falsely with Allaah’s Messengers], till they tasted of Our Wrath.</span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-An’aam (6): 148].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, of no avail to them was the use of al-Qadar [32] [Allaah’s Pre-decree] as a plea when they intended it to be a justification for continuing on their Shirk, and an excuse for lifting the blame and punishment from upon themselves. [33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The actual fact, however, is exactly as they have put it: “If Allaah had not willed, they would not have committed Shirk,” as Allaah, The Most High, said to His Messenger:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Follow what has been inspired to you [O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم] from your Rabb, Laa Ilaaha Illaa Huwa [none has the right to be worshipped but He] and turn aside from the Mushriks. Had Allaah willed, they would have not committed Shirk.</span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-An’aam (6): 106-107].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is, however, a difference between the two cases. In the latter case, Allaah Said to His Prophet (what means): “Had Allaah willed, they would have not committed Shirk,” in order to clarify that their Shirk occurs by His Will, and that He, The One free of all imperfections, The Most High, has a Wisdom as to the committing of Shirk by them; and in order to comfort His Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) that this action of theirs (Shirk) takes place by His, The Exalted and Most High’s, Will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the important thing is that the person who says when you give him advice: “at-Taqwaa is here [i.e. in his heart],” has said a true word indeed. However, he intended by it something futile and false, because the one who said: “at- Taqwaa is here&#8230;” is the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم, the same one who also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Verily, there is a piece of flesh in the body, if it becomes good [reformed], the whole of the body becomes good&#8230;”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If there is Taqwaa in the heart, then it is imperative that there is Taqwaa in the limbs, and the outward actions are a sign of the inward actions of the heart.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[29] An agreed upon hadeeth. See Saheeh al-Bukhaaree, vol.1, no. 49.<br />
[30] The true meaning of at-Taqwaa is fearing Allaah and hoping for His Mercy by executing His Commands and staying away from all that He has forbidden.<br />
[31] The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) in the authentic hadeeth reported by Muslim said: <span style="color:#008000;">“A Muslim is the brother of a Muslim. He neither oppresses him nor humiliates him nor looks down upon him. The Taqwaa is here [and while saying so] he pointed towards his chest thrice.”</span> See Saheeh Muslim, vol. 4, no.6219.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Know that having bad thoughts about someone is forbidden just like having bad speech about him</strong>. So just as it is forbidden for you to speak to others about the defects of a person, it is likewise forbidden for you to speak to yourself about that and to hold bad thoughts for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe, avoid much (types) of suspicion. Verily some (forms) of suspicion is a sin.</span>” [Surah Al-Hujuraat: 12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Abu Hurairah (radhi Allaahu anhu) reported that Allaah’s Messenger (sall Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Beware of suspicion, for indeed suspicion is the most untruthful form of speech.&#8221;</span> [39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ahaadeeth with this same understanding I have mentioned here are many. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>What the backbiting of the heart means, is: When the heart has firm conviction and holds bad thoughts about someone. But as for the notions that occasionally display in one&#8217;s mind or when one talks to himself, then as long as these thoughts do not remain established and continuous in him, it is excused according to the consensus of the scholars</strong></span>. This is since he has no choice in the matter as to stop it from occurring nor can he find any way to liberate himself from it when it does occur. This is the understanding of what has been authentically established (in the texts).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (sall Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: <span style="color:#008000;">“Indeed, Allaah has permitted for my ummah that which their souls whisper to them, so long as they do not speak it out (audibly) or act upon it.”</span> [40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars say: “<strong>This refers to the notions that form in one&#8217;s mind, but do not become settled or established there</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they said: “This is regardless if the notion consists of backbiting, disbelief or so on (i.e. it is pardoned, so long as it does not settle). So (for example) whoever&#8217;s mind becomes flooded with thoughts of disbelief, but they are only thoughts, without him intending to have them carried out, and he then rids himself of these thoughts right after they occur, he is not a disbeliever nor is there any sin on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have already stated previously, in the chapter on the (internal) whisperings, the authentic hadeeth, in which the Companions said:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah! Some of us find things in our thoughts that are too tremendous to speak of.&#8221; So he (sall Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8220;That is the confirmation of Faith.&#8221;</span> [41]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this goes for the other reports we have mentioned in that chapter that bear the same understanding.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason for these thoughts being excused is due to what we have stated previously that these thoughts are impossible to prevent. Rather, one is only able to prevent those thoughts from becoming settled and established in one’s mind. This is why the heart’s being resolute and determined on these thoughts is forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whenever these thoughts, which consist of backbiting or any other sin, present themselves in your mind, it is an obligation on you to repel them, turn away from them and mention some excuse or explanation that will change what seems apparent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We stated previously that if someone is presented with a notion of bad thoughts for another person, he should cut off those bad thoughts. But this is unless there is some (religiously) legislated benefit that leads to thinking (about that person) in this manner. So if such a reason exists, holding these thoughts about his deficiencies is permissible, as well as warning against them, as can be seen in the jarh (criticism) of certain witnesses, narrators and others we have mentioned in the Chapter on “What Type of Backbiting is Permissible.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[39] Saheeh – Reported by Al-Bukhaaree (10/484 of al-Fath) and Muslim (2563)<br />
[40] Saheeh – Reported by Al-Bukhaaree (5/160 of al-Fath) and Muslim (127 and 202)<br />
[41] Saheeh – Reported by Muslim (132); Translator’s Note: This hadeeth shows the Companions’ zeal and enthusiasm in commanding themselves with good and forbidding themselves from evil, such that they would even fight against the evil notions that passed through their minds. But as it is impossible to prevent such thoughts from occurring every now and then, they asked the Prophet (sall Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) about this. His response to them meant that their trying to repel these thoughts showed their strong Eemaan (Faith) and love for good.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth: An Upright Heart</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The heart is the container where knowledge is stored. If the container is firm, it will store and protect what is placed in it, and if the container is damaged, it will lose what is placed in it.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه و سلم)&nbsp;made the heart the foundation of everything, as he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily, there is a morsel of flesh in the body that if it is correct, the entire body will be correct, and if it is corrupt, the entire body will be corrupt. Indeed, it is the heart.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An upright heart comes about through <strong>awareness of Allaah and knowledge of His Names, Attributes and Actions</strong>. It also comes about by way of <strong>reflecting on His signs and creations</strong>, and by <strong>pondering on the Qur&#8217;aan</strong>. An upright heart also comes about due to one constantly <strong>prostrating (in prayer)</strong> and frequently observing the <strong>night prayer</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should also avoid the things that corrupt and sicken the heart, since if these things are present in the heart, it will not be able to carry the knowledge. And even if the heart does carry it, it will not be understood, as Allaah says about the hypocrites &#8211; those with diseased hearts:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">They have heart with which they do not comprehend.</span>&#8221; [Surah Al-Araaf: 179]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The diseases of the heart are of two types: <strong>Desires</strong> and <strong>Doubts</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Desires are such as love for this worldly life and its pleasures and being preoccupied with that; love for unlawful images; listening to unlawful things such as musical voices and instruments; and looking at the forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Doubts are such as corrupt beliefs; innovated actions; and ascribing to innovated ideological movements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some other diseases of the heart that also serve as obstacles before knowledge are: jealousy, spite and pride.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some other things that corrupt the heart are: excessive sleep, excessive speech and excessive eating.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, one should avoid these diseases and corruptors in order to rectify the heart and make it upright.</p>

They said: We do not like to have it even for less than that as it is of no use to us. He said: Do you wish to have it (free of any cost)? They said: By Allah, even if it were alive (we would not have liked to possess that), for there is detect in it as its ear is very short; now it is dead also. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: By Allah, this world is more insignificant in the eye of Allah as it (this dead lamb) is in your eye.</p>

Allah decided to test them. So He sent an angel who came to one who was suffering from leprosy and said: Which thing do you like most? He said: Beautiful colour and fine skin and removal of that which makes me detestable in the eye of people. He wiped him and his illness was no more and he was conferred upon beautiful colour and beautiful skin. He (the angel) again said: Which property do you like most? He said: Camels, or he said: The cow the narrator is, however, doubtful about it, but (out of the persons) suffering from leprosy or baldness one of them definitely said: The came]. And the other one said: Cow. And he (one who demanded came]) was bestowed upon a she-camel, in an advanced stage of pregnancy, and while giving he said: May Allah bless you in this I Then he came to the bald-headed person and said: Which thing do you like most? He said: Beautiful hair and that (this baldness) may be removed from me because of which people hate me He wiped his body and his illness was removed and he was bestowed upon beautiful hair, and the angel said: Which wealth do you like most? He said: The cow. And he was given a pregnant cow and while handing it over to him he (the angel) said: May Allah bless you in this I Then he came to the blind man and he said: Which thing do you like most? He said: Allah should restore my eyesight so that I should be able to see people with the help of that. He wiped his body and Allah restored to him his eyesight, and he (the angel) also said: Which wealth do you like most? He said. The flock of sheep. And he was given a pregnant goat and that gave birth to young ones and it so happened that one valley abounded in camels and the other one in goats and the third one in sheep. He then came to one suffering from leprosy in his (old) form and shape and he said: I am a poor person and my provision has run short in my journey and there is none to take me to my destination except with the help of Allah and your favour. I beg of you in His name Who gave you fine colour and fine skin, and the camel in the shape of wealth (to confer upon me) a camel which should carry me in my journey. He said: I have many responsibilities to discharge. Thereupon he said: I perceive as if I recognise you. Were you not suffering from leprosy whom people hated and you were a destitude and Allah conferred upon you (wealth) He said: I have inherited this property from my forefathers. Thereupon he said: If you are a liar may Allah change you to that very position in which you had been. He then came to the one who was bald-headed in his (old) form and said to him the same what he had said to him (one suffering from leprosy) and he gave him the same reply as he had given him and he said: If you &#8216;are a liar, may Allah turn you to your previous position in which you had been. And then he came to the blind man in his (old) form and shape and he said: I am a destitute person and a wayfarer. My provision have ran short and today there is no way to reach the destination but with the help of Allah and then with your help and I beg of you in the (name) of One Who restored your eyesight and gave you the flock of sheep to give me a sheep by which I should be able to make my provisions for the journey. He said: I was blind and Allah restored to me my eyesight; you take whatever you like and leave whatever you like. By Allah. I shall not stand in your way today for what you take in the name of God. Thereupon, he said: You keep with you what you have (in your possession). The fact is that you three were put to test and Allah is well pleased with you and He is annoyed with your companions.</p>

Nothing would be left out of it but only water left in the utensil which its owner leaves, and you are going to shift to an abode which knows no end, and you should shift with the good before you, for we have been told that a stone would be thrown at one side of the Hell and it would go down even for seventy years but would not be able to reach its bottom. By Allah, it would be fully packed. Do you find it something strange, and it has been mentioned that there yawns a distance which one would be able to cover in forty years from one end to another of Paradise, and a day would come when it would be fully packed and you must be knowing that I was the seventh amongst seven who had been with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and we had nothing to eat but the leaves of the tree until the corners of the mouth were injured. We found a sheet which we tore in two and divided between myself and Sa&#8217;d b. Malik. I made the lower garment with halt of it and so did Sa&#8217;d make the lower garment with half of it and today there is none amongst us who has not become the governor of a city from amongst the cities (of the Islamic Commonwealth) and I seek refuge with Allah that I should consider myself great whereas I am insignificant in the eye of Allah. Prophethood does not remain for ever and its impact fades with the result that it changes eventually into kingship, and you would soon come to know and experience those rulers who would come after us and see (how far they are from religion).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Suhaib reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) thus said: There lived a king before you and he had a (court) magician. As he (the magician) grew old, he said to the king: I have grown old, send some young boy to me so that I should teach him magic. He (the king) sent to him a young man so that he should train him (in magic). And on his way (to the magician) he (the young man) found a monk sitting there. He (the young man) listened to his (the monk&#8217;s) talk and was impressed by it. It became his habit that on his way to the magician he met the monk and set there and he came to the magician (late). He (the magician) beat him because of delay. He made a complaint of that to the monk and he said to him: When you feel afraid of the magician, say: Members of my family had detained me. And when you feel afraid of your family you should say: The magician had detained me. It so happened that there came a huge beast (of prey) and it blocked the way of the people, and he (the young boy) said: I will come to know today whether the magician is superior or the monk is superior. He picked up a stone and said: O Allah, if the affair of the monk is dearer to Thee than the affair of the magician, cause death to this animal so that the people should be able to move about freely. He threw that stone towards it and killed it and the people began to move about (on the path freely). He (the young man) then came to that monk and Informed him and the monk said: Sonny, today you are superior to me. Your affair has come to a stage where I find that you would be soon put to a trial, and in case you are put to a trial don&#8217;t give my clue. That young man began to treat the blind and those suffering from leprosy and he in fact began to cure people from (all kinds) of illness. When a companion of the king who had gone blind heard about him, he came to him with numerous gifts and said: If you cure me all these things collected together here would be yours. Be said: I myself do not cure anyone. It is Allah Who cures and if you affirm faith in Allah, I shall also supplicate Allah to cure you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He affirmed his faith in Allah and Allah cured him and he came to the king and sat by his side as he used to sit before. The king said to him: Who restored your eyesight? He said: My Lord. Thereupon he said: It means that your Lord is One besides me. He said: My Lord and your Lord is Allah, so he (the king) took hold of him and tormented him till he gave a clue of that boy. The young man was thus summoned and the king said to him: O boy, it has been conveyed to me that you have become so much proficient in your magic that you cure the blind and those suffering from leprosy and you do such and such things. Thereupon he said: I do not cure anyone; it is Allah Who cures, and he (the king) took hold of him and began to torment him. So he gave a clue of the monk. The monk was thus summoned and it was said to him: You should turn back from your religion. He, however, refused to do so. He (ordered) for a saw to be brought (and when it was done) he (the king) placed it in the middle of his head and tore it into parts till a part fell down. Then the courtier of the king was brought and it was said to him: Turn back from your religion. Arid he refused to do so, and the saw was placed in the midst of his head and it was torn till a part fell down. Then that young boy was brought and it was said to him: Turn back from your religion. He refused to do so and he was handed over to a group of his courtiers. And he &#8216;said to them: Take him to such and such mountain; make him climb up that mountain and when you reach its top (ask him to renounce his faith) but if he refuses to do so, then throw him (down the mountain). So they took him and made him climb up the mountain and he said: O Allah, save me from them (in any way) Thou likest and the mountain began to quake and they all fell down and that person came walking to the king. The king said to him: What has happened to your companions? He said: Allah has saved me from them. He again handed him to some of his courtiers and said: Take him and carry him in a small boat and when you reach the middle of the ocean (ask him to renounce) his religion, but if he does not renounce his religion throw him (into the water).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they took him and he said: O Allah, save me from them and what they want to do. It was quite soon that the boat turned over and they were drowned and he came walking to the king, and the king said to him: What has happened to your companions? He said: Allah has saved me from them, and he said to the king: You cannot kill me until you do what I ask you to do. And he said: What is that? He said: You should gather people in a plain and hang me by the trunk (of a tree). Then take hold of an arrow from the quiver and say: In the name of Allah, the Lord of the worlds; then shoot an arrow and if you do that then you would be able to kill me. So he (the king) called the people in an open plain and tied him (the boy) to the trunk of a tree, then he took hold of an arrow from his quiver and then placed the arrow in the bow and then said: In the name of Allah, the Lord of the young boy; he then shot an arrow and it bit his temple. He (the boy) placed his hands upon the temple where the arrow had bit him and he died and the people said: We affirm our faith in the Lord of this young man, we affirm our faith in the Lord of this young man, we affirm our faith in the Lord of this young man. The courtiers came to the king and it was said to him: Do you see that Allah has actually done what you aimed at averting. They (the people) have affirmed their faith in the Lord. He (the king) commanded ditches to be dug at important points in the path. When these ditches were dug, and the fire was lit in them it was said (to the people): He who would not turn back from his (boy&#8217;s) religion would be thrown in the fire or it would be said to them to jump in that. (The people courted death but did not renounce religion) till a woman came with her child and she felt hesitant in jumping into the fire and the child said to her: 0 mother, endure (this ordeal) for it is the Truth.</p>

<p><em><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="042.7149"></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Ubadab. Walid b. Samit reported: I and my father set out in search of knowledge to a tribe of the Ansar before their death (i. e. before the Companions of the Holy Prophet left the world) and I was the first to meet Abu Yasar, a Companion of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and there was a young man with him who carried the record of letters with him and there was a mantle prepared by the tribe of Ma&#8217;afiri upon him. And his servant too had a Ma&#8217;afiri mantle over him. My father said to him: My uncle, I see the signs of anger or that of agony on your face. He said: Yes, such and such person, the son of so and so, of the tribe of Harami owed me a debt. I went to his family, extended salutations and said: Where is he? They said: He is not here. Then came out to me his son who was at the threshold of his youth. I said to him: Where is your father? He said: No sooner did he hear your sound than he hid himself behind my mother&#8217;s bedstead. I said to him: Walk out to me, for I know where you are. He came out. I said to him: What prompted you to hide yourself from me? He said: By God, whatever I would say to you would not be a lie. By Allah, I fear that I should tell a lie to you and in case of making promise with you I should break it, as you are the Companion of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). The fact is that I was hard up in regard to money. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. Then he brought his promissory note and he wrote off (the debt) with his hand and said: Make payment when you find yourself solvent enough to pay me back; if you are not, then there is no liability upon you. These two eyes of mine saw, and he (Abu&#8217;I-Yasar) placed his fingers upon his eyes and these two ears of mine heard and my heart retained, and he pointed towards his heart that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He who gives time to one who is financially hard up (in the payment of debt) or writes off his debt, Allah will provide him His shadow. I said to him: My uncle, if you get the cloak of your servant and you give him your two clothes, or take his two clothes of Ma&#8217;afir and give him your cloak, then there would be one dress for you and one for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He wiped my head and said: O Allah, bless the son of my brother. O, son of my brother, these two very eyes of mine saw and these two ears of mine listened to and this heart of mine retained this, and he pointed towards the heart that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Feed them (the servants) and clothe them (the servants) what you wear, and if I give him the goods of the world, it is easy for me than this that he should take my virtues on the Day of Resurrection. We went on till we came to Jabir b. Abdullah in the mosque and he was busy in observing prayer in one cloth which he had joined at its opposite ends. I made my way through the people till I sat between him and the Qibla and I said: May Allah have mercy upon you. Do you observe prayer with one cloth on your body whereas your mantle is lying at your side? He pointed me with his hand towards my breast just like this and he separated his fingers and bent them in the shape of a bow. And (he said): I thought that a fool like you should come to me so that he should see me as I do and he should then also do like it. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to us in this very mosque and he had in his hand the twig of the palm-tree and he saw mucus towards the Qibla of the mosque and he erased it with the help of the twig. He then came to us and said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He then again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, none of us likes it. And he said: If one amongst you stands for prayer, Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, is before him he should not spit in front of him, or on his right side, but should spit on his left side beneath his left foot and if he is impelled to do so all of a sudden (in spite of himself) he should then spit in his cloth and fold it in some part of it. (and he further said: ) Bring some sweet-smelling thing. A young man who belonged to our tribe stood up, went and brought scent in his palm. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) took that and applied it to the end of that twig and then touched the place where there had been mucus. Jabir said: This is why you should apply scent to your mosques.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported on the same authority: We set out along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) on an expedition of Batn Buwat. He (the Holy Prophet) was in search of al-Majdi b. &#8216;Amr al-Juhani. (We had so meagre equipment) that five. six or seven of us had one camel to ride and so we mounted it turn by turn. Once there wan. the turn of an Ansari to ride upon the camel. He made it kneel down to ride over it (and after having. mounted it), he tried to raise it up but it hesitated. So he said. May there be curse of Allah upon you! Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is there to curse his camel? He said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, it&#8217; is I. Thereupon he said: Get down from the camel and let us not have in our company the cursed one. Don&#8217;t curse your own selves, nor your children. nor your belongings. There is the possibility that your curse may synchronies with the time when Allah is about to confer upon you what you demand and thus your prayer may be readily responded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported on the same authority: We set out on an expedition along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) until it was evening, and we had been near a. water reservoir of Arabia. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who would be the person who would go ahead and set right the reservoir and drink water himself and serve us with it? Jabir said: I stood up and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, it is I who am ready to do that. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is the person to accompany Jabir? And then Jabbar b. Sakhr stood up. So we went to that well and poured in that tank a bucket or two of water and plastered it with clay and then began to fill it (with water) until it was filled to the brim. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was the first who appeared before us, and he said: Do you (both) permit me to drink water out of it? We said: Yea, Allah&#8217;s Messenger. He led his camel to drink water and it drank. He then pulled its rein and it stretched its legs and began to urinate. He then took it aside and made it kneel down at another place and then came to the tank and performed ablution. I then got up and performed ablution like the ablution of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), and Jabbar b. Sakhr went in order to relieve himself and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) got up to observe prayer and there was a mantle over me. I tried to invert its ends but it was too short (to cover my body easily). It had its borders. I then inverted it (the mantle) and drew its opposite ends and then tied them at my neck. I then came and stood upon the left side of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). He caught hold of me and made me go round behind him, until he made me stand on his right side. Then Jabbar b. Sakhr came. He performed ablution and then came and stood on the left side of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) caught hold of our hands together, pushed us back and made us stand behind him. Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) began to look upon me with darting looks, but I did not perceive that. After that I became aware of it and he pointed with the gesture of his hand that I should wrap my loin-cloth. When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had finished the prayer, he said: Jabir! I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, at thy beck and call. He said: When the cloth around you is inadequate, then tie the opposite ends but when it is small, tie it over the lower body.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and the only means of sustenance for every person amongst us was only one date for a day and we used to chew it. And we struck the leaves with the help of our bow and ate them until the sides of our mouths were injured. It so happened one day that a person was overlooked and not given a date. We carried that person and bore witness to the fact that he had not been given that date so he was offered that and he got up and received that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) until we got down at a spacious valley and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) went to relieve himself. I followed him with a bucket full of water and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) looked about and he found no privacy but two trees at the end of the valley and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may. peace be upon him) went to one of them and took hold of one of its twigs and said: Be thou under my control by the permission of Allah, and so it came under his control like the camel who has its nosestring in the hand of its rider, and then he came to the second tree and took hold of a twig and said: Be thou under my control with the permission of Allah, and it came under his control, and when he came in the middle of the two trees he joined together the two twigs and said: join with the permission of Allah. Jabir said: I was afraid lest Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) should be aware of my nearness and go still farther. And Muhammad b. Abbad has used the word&#8221; faitab&#8217;d&#8221; and I began to talk to myself. And as I saw, I suddenly found Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) before me and the two trees were separated and each one of them was standing at its place. I saw Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) standing for a short time, nodding his head towards right and left. Isma&#8217;il pointed towards the right and left with the help of his head (in order to demonstrate how the Holy Prophet had pointed). Then he (the Holy Prophet) came to me and said: Jabir did you see my place where I was standing? I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, yes. He then said: Then you should go to those two trees and cut a twig from each of them and go to that place with them where I was standing and stand there where I was standing and place a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Jabir said: I set out and took hold of a stone and broke it and sharpened it and then I came to those trees and cut a twig from each one of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I then came dragging them until I stood at the place where Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had been standing and placed a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Then I met him and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, I have done that, but (kindly) explain to me the reason for it. Thereupon he said: I passed by two graves the occupants of which had been undergoing torment. I liked to make intercession for them so that the might be relieved of this torment y as long as these twigs remain fresh. Jabir said: We came back to the (camp of the) army and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, call people for per- forming wudu. I cried: Come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, there is not even a drop of water in the army camp, and there. was a person who used to cool the water for Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) in the old water-skin which kept hanging by the twig. He asked me to go to such and such Ansari and ask him to see if there was any water in that skin. I went to him and cast a glance in it but did not find anything but a drop in the mouth of that water-skin and if I were to draw that, the water-skin&#8217;s,. dried part would suck it up. I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, I have not found anything in it but a drop of water in the mouth of the water-skin and now if I were to draw that, it would be absorbed. He said: Go and bring that to me. I brought that to him. He took hold of it -and began to utter something which I could not understand and then pressed it with his hand and gave that to me and said: Jabir, announce for the tub to be brought. So I announced that the tub of the army (be brought). It was brought accordingly and I placed it before him (the Holy Prophet). Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) placed his hands in the tub like this: with his fingers stretched out, and then he placed his fingers at the bottom of the tub and said: Jabir, take it (that waters-skin) and pour water over me, by reciting Bismillah, and I poured water and I said: Bismillah, and found water sprouting out between the fingers of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then that tub gushed forth until it was filled up and the Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, make an announcement to the effect: He who needs water should take that. Jabir said: The people came and got water until they were all satiated. I said: Is there anyone left who wants to get it? And Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) then lifted up his hand from that tub and it was still full. Then the people made a complaint to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) about hunger and he said: May Allah provide you food! We came to the bank of the ocean and the ocean was tossing and it threw out a big animal and we lit fire and cooked it and took it until we had eaten to our heart&#8217;s content. Jabir said: I and such and such five persons entered Its socket and nobody could see us until we had come out, and we took hold of one of its ribs and twisted it into a sort of arch, then we called the tallest of the persons of the army and the hugest of the camels of the army and it had the big saddle over it, and it could easily pass through it without the rider having need to bend down.</p>

So I carried it and there went along with him (with Abu Bakr) my father in order to fetch its price and he (&#8216;Azib) said to Abu Bakr: Abu Bakr, narrate to me what you both did on the night when you set out on a journey along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). He said: We set out during the night and went on walking until it was noon, and the path was vacant and so none passed by that (until) there appeared prominently before us a large rock. It had its shade and the rays of the sun did not reach that place. So we got down at that place. I then went to the rock and levelled the ground with my hands at the place where the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) would take rest under its shade. I then set the bedding and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, go to sleep and I shall keep a watch around you. I went out and watched around him. There we saw a shepherd moving towards that rock with his flock and he intended what we intended (i. e. taking rest). I met him and said to him: Young boy, to which place do you belong? He said: I am a person from Medina. I said, is there any milk in the udders of your sheep and goats? He said: Yes. He took hold of a goat, and I said to him: Clean the udder well so that it should be free from hair, dust and impurity. I saw al-Bara&#8217; striking his hand upon the other (to give an indication) how he did that. He milked the goat for me in a wooden cup which he had with him and I had with me a bucket in which I kept water for drinking and for performing ablution. I came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and did not like to awaken him from sleep but he was accidentally startled from the sleep.

He then took It and I was delighted and he (the Holy Prophet) said: Is now not the time to march on? I said: Of course. So he marched on after the sun had passed the meridian and Suraqa b. Malik pursued us and we had been walking on soft, level ground. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, we are about to be overtaken by them. Thereupon he said: Be not grieved. Verily, Allah is with us. Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) cursed him and his horse sank into the earth. I think he also said: I know you have hurled curse upon me. So supplicate Allah for me and I take an oath that I shall turn everyone away who would come in search of you. So he (Allah&#8217;s Messenger) supplicated Allah and he was rescued and he came back and to everyone he met, he said: I have combed all this side. In short, he diverted everyone whom he met and he in fact fulfilled his promise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bara&#8217; reported: Abu Bakr purchased a saddle from me for thirteen dirhams; the rest of the hadith is the same, and in the narration of Uthman b. &#8216;Umar, the words are: He (Suraqa b. Malik) drew near Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), and he (the Holy Prophet) cursed him and his camel sank in the earth up to the belly and he jumped from that and said: Muhammad, I am fully aware of It that it is your doing. Supplicate Allah that He should rescue me from it in which I am (pitchforked) and I give you a solemn pledge that I shall keep this as a secret from all those who are coming after me. Take hold of an arrow out of it (quiver) for you will find my camels and my slaves at such and such place and you can get whatever you need (on showing this arrow). He (the Holy Prophet) said: I don&#8217;t need your camels. And we (the Holy Prophet and Abu Bakr) came to Medina during the night and the people began to contend as to where Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) should reside and he encamped in the tribe of Najjar who were related to &#8216;Abd ul-Muttalib from the side of mother. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) honoured them, then people climbed upon house-top and women also and boys scattered in the way, and they were all crying: Muhammad, Messenger of Allah, Muhammad, Messenger of Allah.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Umar reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may    peace be upon him) said: Three persons set out on a journey. They were overtaken by rain    and they had to find protection in a mountain cave where at its mouth there fell a rock of    that mountain and thus blocked them altogether. One of them said to the others: Look to    your good deeds that you performed for the sake of Allah and then supplicate Allah, the    Exalted, that He might rescue you (from this trouble). One of them said: 0 Allah, I had my    parents who were old and my wife and my small children also. I tended the flock and when I    came back to them in the evening, I milked them (the sheep, goats, cows, etc.) and first    served that milk to my parents. One day I was obliged to go out to a distant place in    search of fodder and I could not come back before evening and found them (the parents)    asleep. I milked the animals as I used to milk and brought milk to them and stood by their    heads avoiding to disturb them from sleep and I did not deem it advisable to serve milk to    my children before serving them. My children wept near my feet. I remained there in that    very state and my parents too until it was morning. And (0 Allah) if Thou art aware that I    did this in order to seek Thine pleasure, grant us riddance from this trouble. (The rock    slipped a bit) that they could see the sky. The second one said: 0 Allah, I had a female    cousin whom I loved more than the men love the women. I wanted to have sexual intercourse    with her; she refused but on the condition of getting one hundred dinirs. It was with very    great difficulty that I could collect one hundred dinirs and then paid them to her and    when I was going to have a sexual intercourse with her, that she said: Servant of Allah,    fear Allah and do not break the seal (of chastity) but by lawful means. I got up. 0 Allah,    if Thou art aware that I did this in order to seek Thine pleasure, rid us from this    trouble. The situation was somewhat eased for them. The third one said: Allah, I employed    a workman for a measure of rice. After he had finished his work I gave him his dues (in    the form of) a measure of rice, but he did not accept them. I used these rice as seeds,    and that gave a bumper crop and I became rich enough to have cows and flocks (in my    possession). He came to me and said: Fear Allah, and commit no crueltv upon me in regard    to my dues. I said to him: Takeaway this flock of cows and sheep. He said: Fear Allah and    do not make a fun of me. I said: I am not making a fun of you. You take the cows and the    flocks. So he took them. 0 Allah, if Thou art aware that I did it for Thine pleasure, case    the situation for us. And Allah relieved them from the rest of the trouble.</font></p>

The rest of the hadith is the same and    the additional words are:&#8221; A person amongst them said: 0 Allah, I had my aged parents    and I served them milk before I (served that) to my wife, children and my servants.&#8221;    And in case of the second one, the words are:&#8221; She avoided me until she was hard    pressed because of famine and she came to me and I gave her one hundred and twenty    diiiirs&#8221; And in cease of the third one (the words are):&#8221; I invested his wages,    and it brought profit and, as a result thereof, the merchandise increased and there was    abundance of goods.&#8221; And he (the narrator said) that they got out of the cave and    began to walk.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(an ally of the tribe of Bani &#8216;Amir bin Lu&#8217;ai and one of  those who had witnessed the battle of Badr with Allah&#8217;s Apostle) Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent Abu  &#8216;Ubaida bin AlJarrah to Bahrain to collect the Jizya tax. Allah&#8217;s Apostle had concluded a  peace treaty with the people of Bahrain and appointed Al &#8216;Ala bin Al-Hadrami as their  chief; Abu Ubaida arrived from Bahrain with the money. The Ansar heard of Abu &#8216;Ubaida&#8217;s  arrival which coincided with the Fajr (morning) prayer led by Allah&#8217;s Apostle. When the  Prophet finished the prayer, they came to him. Allah&#8217;s Apostle smiled when he saw them and  said, &#8220;I think you have heard of the arrival of Abu &#8216;Ubaida and that he has brought  something.&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! &#8221; He said, &#8220;Have  the good news, and hope for what will please you. By Allah, I am not afraid that you will  become poor, but I am afraid that worldly wealth will be given to you in abundance as it  was given to those (nations) before you, and you will start competing each other for it as  the previous nations competed for it, and then it will divert you (from good) as it  diverted them.&#8221; &#8216; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The thing I am afraid of most  for your sake, is the worldly blessings which Allah will bring forth to you.&#8221; It was  said, &#8220;What are the blessings of this world?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;The  pleasures of the world.&#8221; A man said, &#8220;Can the good bring forth evil?&#8221; The  Prophet kept quiet for a while till we thought that he was being inspired divinely. Then  he started removing the sweat from his forehead and said,&#8221; Where is the  questioner?&#8221; That man said, &#8220;I (am present).&#8221; Abu Sa&#8217;id added: We thanked  the man when the result (of his question) was such. The Prophet said, &#8220;Good never  brings forth but good. This wealth (of the world) is (like) green and sweet (fruit), and  all the vegetation which grows on the bank of a stream either kills or nearly kills the  animal that eats too much of it, except the animal that eats the Khadira (a kind of  vegetation). Such an animal eats till its stomach is full and then it faces the sun and  starts ruminating and then it passes out dung and urine and goes to eat again. This  worldly wealth is (like) sweet (fruit), and if a person earns it (the wealth) in a legal  way and spends it properly, then it is an excellent helper, and whoever earns it in an  illegal way, he will be like the one who eats but is never satisfied.&#8221; </font></p>

I  would have spent all of it (distributed it) amongst Allah&#8217;s Slaves like this, and like  this, and like this.&#8221; The Prophet pointed out with his hand towards his right, his  left and his back (while illustrating it). He proceeded with his walk and said, &#8220;The  rich are in fact the poor (little rewarded) on the Day of Resurrection except those who  spend their wealth like this, and like this, and like this, to their right, left and back,  but such people are few in number.&#8221; Then he said to me, &#8220;Stay at your place and  do not leave it till I come back.&#8221; Then he proceeded in the darkness of the night  till he went out of sight, and then I heard a loud voice, and was afraid that something  might have happened to the Prophet .1 intended to go to him, but I remembered what he had  said to me, i.e. &#8216;Don&#8217;t leave your place till I come back to you,&#8217; so I remained at my  place till he came back to me. I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I heard a voice and I was  afraid.&#8221; So I mentioned the whole story to him. He said, &#8220;Did you hear it?&#8221;  I replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;It was Gabriel who came to me and said,  &#8216;Whoever died without joining others in worship with Allah, will enter Paradise.&#8217; I asked  (Gabriel), &#8216;Even if he had committed theft or committed illegal sexual intercourse?

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 76, Number 459: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>By Allah except Whom none has the right to- be worshipped,  (sometimes) I used to lay (sleep) on the ground on my liver (abdomen) because of hunger,  and (sometimes) I used to bind a stone over my belly because of hunger. One day I sat by  the way from where they (the Prophet and h is companions) used to come out. When Abu Bakr  passed by, I asked him about a Verse from Allah&#8217;s Book and I asked him only that he might  satisfy my hunger, but he passed by and did not do so. Then Umar passed by me and I asked  him about a Verse from Allah&#8217;s Book, and I asked him only that he might satisfy my hunger,  but he passed by without doing so. Finally Abu-l-Qasim (the Prophet ) passed by me and he  smiled when he saw me, for he knew what was in my heart and on my face. He said, &#8220;O  Aba Hirr (Abu Huraira)!&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Labbaik, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; He said  to me, &#8220;Follow me.&#8221; He left and I followed him. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then he entered the house and I asked permission to enter  and was admitted. He found milk in a bowl and said, &#8220;From where is this milk?&#8221;  They said, &#8220;It has been presented to you by such-and-such man (or by such and such  woman).&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Aba Hirr!&#8221; I said, &#8220;Labbaik, O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle!&#8221; He said, &#8220;Go and call the people of Suffa to me.&#8221; These people of  Suffa were the guests of Islam who had no families, nor money, nor anybody to depend upon,  and whenever an object of charity was brought to the Prophet , he would send it to them  and would not take anything from it, and whenever any present was given to him, he used to  send some for them and take some of it for himself. The order off the Prophet upset me,  and I said to myself, &#8220;How will this little milk be enough for the people of  As-Suffa?&#8221; thought I was more entitled to drink from that milk in order to strengthen  myself, but behold! The Prophet came to order me to give that milk to them. I wondered  what will remain of that milk for me, but anyway, I could not but obey Allah and His  Apostle so I went to the people of As-Suffa and called them, and they came and asked the  Prophet&#8217;s permission to enter. They were admitted and took their seats in the house. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;O Aba-Hirr!&#8221; I said,  &#8220;Labbaik, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; He said, &#8220;Take it and give it to them.&#8221;  So I took the bowl (of Milk) and started giving it to one man who would drink his fill and  return it to me, whereupon I would give it to another man who, in his turn, would drink  his fill and return it to me, and I would then offer it to another man who would drink his  fill and return it to me. Finally, after the whole group had drunk their fill, I reached  the Prophet who took the bowl and put it on his hand, looked at me and smiled and said.  &#8220;O Aba Hirr!&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Labbaik, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; He said,  &#8220;There remain you and I.&#8221; I said, &#8220;You have said the truth, O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle!&#8221; He said, &#8220;Sit down and drink.&#8221; I sat down and drank. He said,  &#8220;Drink,&#8221; and I drank. He kept on telling me repeatedly to drink, till I said,  &#8220;No. by Allah Who sent you with the Truth, I have no space for it (in my  stomach).&#8221; He said, &#8220;Hand it over to me.&#8221; When I gave him the bowl, he  praised Allah and pronounced Allah&#8217;s Name on it and drank the remaining milk. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I was the first man among the Arabs to throw an arrow for  Allah&#8217;s Cause. We used to fight in Allah&#8217;s Cause while we had nothing to eat except the  leaves of the Hubla and the Sumur trees (desert trees) so that we discharged excrement  like that of sheep (i.e. unmixed droppings). Today the (people of the) tribe of Bani Asad  teach me the laws of Islam. If so, then I am lost, and all my efforts of that hard time  had gone in vain. </font></p>

So listen, (O my children), when I die,  burn my body till I become mere coal and then grind it into powder, and when there is a  stormy wind, throw me (my ashes) in it.&#8217; So he took a firm promise from his children (to  follow his instructions).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;My example and the  example of the people is that of a man who made a fire, and when it lighted what was  around it, Moths and other insects started falling into the fire. The man tried (his best)  to prevent them, (from falling in the fire) but they overpowered him and rushed into the  fire. The Prophet added: Now, similarly, I take hold of the knots at your waist (belts) to  prevent you from falling into the Fire, but you insist on falling into it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Hudhaifa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle narrated to us two narrations, one of which  I have seen (happening) and I am waiting for the other. He narrated that honesty was  preserved in the roots of the hearts of men (in the beginning) and then they learnt it  (honesty) from the Qur&#8217;an, and then they learnt it from the (Prophet&#8217;s) Sunna (tradition).  He also told us about its disappearance, saying, &#8220;A man will go to sleep whereupon  honesty will be taken away from his heart, and only its trace will remain, resembling the  traces of fire. He then will sleep whereupon the remainder of the honesty will also be  taken away (from his heart) and its trace will resemble a blister which is raised over the  surface of skin, when an ember touches one&#8217;s foot; and in fact, this blister does not  contain anything. So there will come a day when people will deal in business with each  other but there will hardly be any trustworthy persons among them. Then it will be said  that in such-and-such a tribe there is such-and-such person who is honest, and a man will  be admired for his intelligence, good manners and strength, though indeed he will not have  belief equal to a mustard seed in his heart.&#8221; The narrator added: There came upon me  a time when I did not mind dealing with anyone of you, for if he was a Muslim, his  religion would prevent him from cheating; and if he was a Christian, his Muslim ruler  would prevent him from cheating; but today I cannot deal except with so-and-so and  so-and-so.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Two men, a Muslim and a Jew, abused each other. The Muslim  said, &#8220;By Him Who gave superiority to Muhammad over all the people.&#8221; On that,  the Jew said, &#8220;By Him Who gave superiority to Moses over all the people.&#8221; The  Muslim became furious at that and slapped the Jew in the face. The Jew went to Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and informed him of what had happened between him and the Muslim. Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t give me superiority over Moses, for the people will fall unconscious on  the Day of Resurrection and I will be the first to gain consciousness, and behold ! Moses  will be there holding the side of Allah&#8217;s Throne. I will not know whether Moses has been  among those people who have become unconscious and then has regained consciousness before  me, or has been among those exempted by Allah from falling unconscious.&#8221; </font></p>

Shall I tell you of the entertainment of the people of Paradise on the  Day of Resurrection?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The Jew said, &#8220;The  earth will be a bread,&#8221; as the Prophet had said. Thereupon the Prophet looked at us  and smiled till his premolar tooth became visible. Then the Jew further said, &#8220;Shall  I tell you of the udm (additional food taken with bread) they will have with the  bread?&#8221; He added, &#8220;That will be Balam and Nun.&#8221; The people asked,  &#8220;What is that?&#8221; He said, &#8220;It is an ox and a fish, and seventy thousand  people will eat of the caudate lobe (i.e. extra lobe) of their livers.&#8221; </font></p>

O people of the  Fire, no more death ! &#8216; So the people of Paradise will have happiness added to their  previous happiness, and the people of the Fire will have sorrow added to their previous  sorrow.&#8221; </font></p>

Ask, and your request will be granted, and say, and your saying will be  listened to; intercede, and your intercession will be accepted.&#8217; Then I will raise my  head, and I will glorify and praise my Lord with a saying(i.e. invocation) He will teach  me, and then I will intercede, Allah will fix a limit for me (i.e., certain type of people  for whom I may intercede), and I will take them out of the (Hell) Fire and let them enter  Paradise. Then I will come back (to Allah) and fall in prostration, and will do the same  for the third and fourth times till no-one remains in the (Hell) Fire except those whom  the Qur&#8217;an has imprisoned therein.&#8221; (The sub-narrator, Qatada used to say at that  point, &#8220;&#8230;those upon whom eternity (in Hell) has been imposed.&#8221;) (See Hadith  No. 3, Vol 6). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Some people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall we see our  Lord on the Day of Resurrection?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Do you crowd and squeeze each other  on looking at the sun when it is not hidden by clouds?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;No,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Do you crowd and squeeze each other on looking at  the moon when it is full and not hidden by clouds?&#8221; They replied, No, O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle!&#8221; He said, &#8220;So you will see Him (your Lord) on the Day of Resurrection  similarly Allah will gather all the people and say, &#8216;Whoever used to worship anything  should follow that thing. &#8216;So, he who used to worship the sun, will follow it, and he who  used to worship the moon will follow it, and he who used to worship false deities will  follow them; and then only this nation (i.e., Muslims) will remain, including their  hypocrites. Allah will come to them in a shape other than they know and will say, &#8216;I am  your Lord.&#8217; They will say, &#8216;We seek refuge with Allah from you. This is our place; (we  will not follow you) till our Lord comes to us, and when our Lord comes to us, we will  recognize Him. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then Allah will come to then in a shape they know and will  say, &#8220;I am your Lord.&#8217; They will say, &#8216;(No doubt) You are our Lord,&#8217; and they will  follow Him. Then a bridge will be laid over the (Hell) Fire.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle added,  &#8220;I will be the first to cross it. And the invocation of the Apostles on that Day,  will be &#8216;Allahukka Sallim, Sallim (O Allah, save us, save us!),&#8217; and over that bridge  there will be hooks Similar to the thorns of As Sa&#8217;dan (a thorny tree). Didn&#8217;t you see the  thorns of As-Sa&#8217;dan?&#8221; The companions said, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; He  added, &#8220;So the hooks over that bridge will be like the thorns of As-Sa-dan except  that their greatness in size is only known to Allah. These hooks will snatch the people  according to their deeds. Some people will be ruined because of their evil deeds, and some  will be cut into pieces and fall down in Hell, but will be saved afterwards, when Allah  has finished the judgments among His slaves, and intends to take out of the Fire whoever  He wishes to take out from among those who used to testify that none had the right to be  worshipped but Allah. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We will order the angels to take them out and the angels  will know them by the mark of the traces of prostration (on their foreheads) for Allah  banned the f ire to consume the traces of prostration on the body of Adam&#8217;s son. So they  will take them out, and by then they would have burnt (as coal), and then water, called  Maul Hayat (water of life) will be poured on them, and they will spring out like a seed  springs out on the bank of a rainwater stream, and there will remain one man who will be  facing the (Hell) Fire and will say, &#8216;O Lord! It&#8217;s (Hell&#8217;s) vapor has Poisoned and smoked  me and its flame has burnt me; please turn my face away from the Fire.&#8217; He will keep on  invoking Allah till Allah says, &#8216;Perhaps, if I give you what you want), you will ask for  another thing?&#8217; The man will say, &#8216;No, by Your Power, I will not ask You for anything  else.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then Allah will turn his face away from the Fire. The man  will say after that, &#8216;O Lord, bring me near the gate of Paradise.&#8217; Allah will say (to  him), &#8216;Didn&#8217;t you promise not to ask for anything else? Woe to you, O son of Adam ! How  treacherous you are!&#8217; The man will keep on invoking Allah till Allah will say, &#8216;But if I  give you that, you may ask me for something else.&#8217; The man will say, &#8216;No, by Your Power. I  will not ask for anything else.&#8217; He will give Allah his covenant and promise not to ask  for anything else after that. So Allah will bring him near to the gate of Paradise, and  when he sees what is in it, he will remain silent as long as Allah will, and then he will  say, &#8216;O Lord! Let me enter Paradise.&#8217; Allah will say, &#8216;Didn&#8217;t you promise that you would  not ask Me for anything other than that? Woe to you, O son of Adam ! How treacherous you  are!&#8217; On that, the man will say, &#8216;O Lord! Do not make me the most wretched of Your  creation,&#8217; and will keep on invoking Allah till Allah will smile and when Allah will smile  because of him, then He will allow him to enter Paradise, and when he will enter Paradise,  he will be addressed, &#8216;Wish from so-and-so.&#8217; He will wish till all his wishes will be  fulfilled, then Allah will say, All this (i.e. what you have wished for) and as much again  therewith are for you.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Huraira added: That man will be the last of the people  of Paradise to enter (Paradise). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ata (while Abu Huraira was narrating): Abu Said  was sitting in the company of Abu Huraira and he did not deny anything of his narration  till he reached his saying: &#8220;All this and as much again therewith are for you.&#8221;  Then Abu Sa&#8217;id said, &#8220;I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;This is for you and ten times  as much.&#8217; &#8221; Abu Huraira said, &#8220;In my memory it is &#8216;as much again therewith.&#8217;  &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;I am your predecessor at the  Lake-Fount.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah added: The Prophet said, &#8220;I am your predecessor at the  Lake-Fount, and some of you will be brought in front of me till I will see them and then  they will be taken away from me and I will say, &#8216;O Lord, my companions!&#8217; It will be said,  &#8216;You do not know what they did after you had left.&#8217; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The word &#8216;Al-Kauthar&#8217; means the abundant good which Allah  gave to him (the Prophet Muhammad). Abu Bishr said: I said to Said, &#8220;Some people  claim that it (Al-Kauthar) is a river in Paradise.&#8221; Said replied, &#8220;The river  which is in Paradise is one item of that good which Allah has bestowed upon him  (Muhammad).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;My Lake-Fount is (so large that it  takes) a month&#8217;s journey to cross it. Its water is whiter than milk, and its smell is  nicer than musk (a kind of Perfume), and its drinking cups are (as numerous) as the  (number of) stars of the sky; and whoever drinks from it, will never be thirsty.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;I am your predecessor (forerunner)  at the Lake-Fount, and whoever will pass by there, he will drink from it and whoever will  drink from it, he will never be thirsty. There will come to me some people whom I will  recognize, and they will recognize me, but a barrier will be placed between me and  them.&#8221; Abu Hazim added: An-Nu&#8217;man bin Abi &#8216;Aiyash, on hearing me, said. &#8220;Did you  hear this from Sahl?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8221; I bear witness that I  heard Abu Said Al-Khudri saying the same, adding that the Prophet said: &#8216;I will say: They  are of me (i.e. my followers). It will be said, &#8216;You do not know what they innovated (new  things) in the religion after you left&#8217;. I will say, &#8216;Far removed, far removed (from  mercy), those who changed (their religion) after me.&#8221; Abu Huraira narrated that the  Prophet said, &#8220;On the Day of Resurrection a group of companions will come to me, but  will be driven away from the Lake-Fount, and I will say, &#8216;O Lord (those are) my  companions!&#8217; It will be said, &#8216;You have no knowledge as to what they innovated after you  left; they turned apostate as renegades (reverted from Islam).&#8221; </font></p>

(Another) group (of my  followers) were brought close to me, and when I recognized them, a man (an angel) came out  from (me and them) he said (to them); Come along.&#8217; I asked, &#8220;Where?&#8217; He said, &#8216;To the  (Hell) Fire, by Allah.&#8217; I asked, What is wrong with them?&#8217; He said, &#8216;They turned apostate  as renegades after you left.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Through what avenues does the Shaytaan find a way to make suggestions to man?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">There are many avenues;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">He might try to incite someone to <strong>fornicate</strong>, for example. He first incites his victim to be alone with women, then to look at them, then to talk to them, then perhaps to listen to them sing, and so on until he achieves his end: when his victim fornicates.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Shaytaan may attack a person through his </span>stomach<span style="color:#000000;">, by tempting him into eating what is unlawful, into drinking <strong>alcohol</strong>, or even into taking <strong>drugs</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Shaytaan may find that a person has an inordinate love for owning things, so he biguiles him into gaining wealth through unlawful means:<strong> stealing, swindling, practicing usury, usurping, cheating.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">He may find that a person has a great deal of <strong>pride</strong>, so he will encourage him to belittle others, to be haughty with those inferior to him in society,</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">and the list of Shaytaan&#8217;s tricks is endless.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">May Allaah send peace and blessings on Muhammad, his family, and his Companions.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah (d.751 H), rahimahullaah 1<br />
From al-Istiqaamah magazine Shawwal 1418H/ February 1998</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O you who believe! Remember Allaah and remember Him a lot.&#8221; [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:4I]. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Those men and women who remember Allaah a lot.&#8221; [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:35]. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;So when you have finished the rights of your Pilgrimage, then remember Allaah as you remember your fore-father, or with more intense remembrance.&#8221; [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:200]. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These verses contain a command to remember Allaah intensely and abundantly, since the worshipper is in dire need of [remembering Allaah] and cannot do without it even for a twinkling of an eye. This is because every moment that a person does not spend in the dhikr (remembrance) of Allaah will not be of any benefit to him. Rather, the harm entailed in being neglectful of the dhikr of Allaah is far greater than any benefits that can be gained. One of the &#8216;aarifeen (those who are knowledgeable about Allaah) said:&#8221;If a person were to spend such and such number of years engaged [in the dhikr of Allaah], then he turns away from it for just a moment, what he will lose is far greater than whatever he has already gained.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bayhaqee relates from &#8216;Aaishah radiallaahu &#8216;anhaa that the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said: &#8220;There is no time in which the son of Aadam does not remember AIIaah in it, except that it will be a source of regret for him on the Day of Judgement&#8221; 2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mu&#8217;aadh ibn jabal radiallaahu &#8216;anhu relates that the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said: &#8220;The people of Paradise will not have any regrets except for those moments in which they were not engaged in the dhikr (remembrance) of Allaah.&#8221; 3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mu&#8217;aadh ibn Jabal also relates that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam was asked: What action is the most beloved to Allaah? So he replied: &#8220;That you continue to keep your tongue moist with the dhikr of Allaah, until you die.&#8221; 4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>POLISHING THE HEART</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Dardaa radiallaahu &#8216;anhu said:&#8221;For everything there is a polish and the polish for the heart is the dhikr of Allaah&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bayhaqee relates from Ibn &#8216;Umar radiallaahu &#8216;anhu that AlIaah&#8217;s Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said: &#8220;For everything there is a polish, and the polish for the hearts is the dhikr (remembrance) of Allaah. There is nothing more potent in saving a person from the punishment of Allaah than the dhikr of Allaah.&#8221; It was said: Not even Jihaad in the path of Allaah. So he replied: &#8220;Not even if you were to continue striking with your sword until it breaks.&#8221;5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that hearts becomes rusty just as copper and silver coins become rusty. The polish for [this rust] is the dhikr of AIlaah. This is because [dhikr] is like a polish [which polishes the heart] like a shiny mirror. When dhikr is left, the rust returns. But when dhikr resumes, then the heart is [again] polished. And hearts become rusty due to two things:-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) neglecting remembering Allaah, and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) committing sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The polish for these two things is:-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) seeking Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) dhikr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>CONFUSING TRUTH WITH FALSEHOOD</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever neglects [remembering Allaah] most of the time, then his heart will become rusty in accordance with how neglectful the person is. And when this [filthy] rust accumulates on the heart, then it no longer recognises things as they really are. Thus, it views falsehood as if it is the truth, and truth as if it is falsehood. This is because this rust darkens and confuses the heart&#8217;s perception, and so it is unable to truly recognise things for what they really are. So as the rust accumulates, the heart gets blackened, and as this happens the heart becomes stained with this filthy rust, and when this occurs it corrupts the heart&#8217;s perception and recognition of things. The heart [then] does not accept the truth nor does it reject falsehood, and this is the greatest calamity that can strike the heart. Being neglectful [of dhikr] and following of whims and desires is a direct consequence of such a heart, which [further] extinguish the heart&#8217;s light and blinds its vision. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:<br />
<strong>&#8220;And do not obey him whose heart We have made to be neglectful of Our remembrance, one who follows his own whims and desires and whose affairs are furat [have gone beyond bounds and whose deeds have been lost].&#8221; [Soorah al-Kahf 18:28]. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>QUALITIES OF A GUIDE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when a worshipper desires to follow another person, then let him see: Is this person from the people of dhikr, or from the people who are negligent [about remembering Allaah]? Does this person judge in accordance with his whims and desires, or by the Revelation? So, if he judges by whims and desires then he is actually from those people who are negligent; those whose affairs have gone beyond bounds and whose deeds are lost.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The term furat [which occurs in the above verse] has been explained in many ways. It has been explained to mean:- (i) losing the rewards of that type of action which is essential to do, and in which lies success and happiness; (ii) exceeding the limits of something; (iii) being destroyed; and (iv) opposing the truth. Each of these sayings are very close in meaning to each other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point is that Allaah &#8211; the One free from all imperfections, the Most High &#8211; has prohibited following all those who possess such attributes. So it is absolutely essential that a person considers whether such attributes are found in his shaykh, or the person who&#8217;s example he follows, or the person that he obeys. If they are, then he should distance himself from such a person. However, if it is found that the person is, in most cases, pre-occupied with the dhikr of Allaah and with following the Sunnah, and his affairs do not exceed the limits, but rather he is judicious and resolute in his affairs, then he should cling to him very firmly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, there is no difference between the living and the dead, except with the dhikr of Allaah; since [the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam] said: &#8220;The example of one who remembers Allaah and someone who does not, is like the example between the living and the dead.&#8221;6</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah, Issue No.3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the One free from all imperfections &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;So have <i>taqwaa</i> (fear and obedience) of Allaah and reconcile the differences between yourselves.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Anfaal 8:1].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed the Believers are but brothers. Therefore reconcile the differences between your brothers, and fear Allaah so that you may receive mercy.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Hujuraat 49:10].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;So this is a knot which Allaah has bound the Believers together with, such that whenever a person is found possessing <i>eemaan</i> (faith) in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers and the Last Bay &#8211; whether in the eastern or western part of the world &#8211; then such a person becomes the brother of the Believers. This brotherhood obligates that the Believers should love for that person that which they love for themselves, and hate for that person that which they hate for themselves. Therefore, the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said &#8211; whilst ordering the brotherhood of <i>eemaan</i> (faith): <i>&#8220;Do not envy one another. Do not inflate prices upon one another. Do not hate one another. Do not forsake one another. Do not under-cut one another. But be worshippers of Allaah and brothers. The Muslim is the brother of another Muslim; he neither oppresses him, nor humiliates him, nor lies to him, nor holds him in contempt. And piety is right here &#8211; and he pointed to his chest three times. It is enough evil for a person to hold his brother Muslim in contempt. The whole of a Muslim for another Muslim is sacred; his blood, his property and his honour.&#8221;</i>1 And he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;The Believer to the Believer is like a solid structure, one part supporting the other.&#8221; And he interlaced his fingers to demonstrate this.</i>2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus Allaah and His Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> ordered that the rights of the Believers be fulfilled by each other, and that those matters which will bring about harmony, love and togetherness be carried out. All of this is to be done in order to further the rights that they have over one another. So from such tights is that when fighting occurs between them &#8211; thereby causing their hearts to separate and to have hatred and to cut-off from each other &#8211; then the Believers should bring about reconciliation between their brothers and do that which will remove the enmity. Then Allaah ordered <i>taqwaa</i> in general and made the bestowal of His Mercy the consequence of their having <i>taqwaa</i> and their fulfilling the rights of the Believers. So He said: <b>&#8220;And have taqwaa of Allaah in order that you may receive mercy.&#8221;</b> Thus, if Allaah&#8217;s Mercy is attained, then the good of this world and the Hereafter will also be attained.&#8221;3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Aaishah <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhaa</i> used to say, that when people abandoned acting upon this Aayah (verse): <b>&#8220;When two parties of the Believers fight each other, then make reconciliation between them.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Hujuraat 49:9]. So when the Muslims began fighting each other, it was obligatory to reconcile them, as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; ordered. However, when they did not do this, then fitnah (trials and tribulations) spread, as did ignorance, and this is what caused the differences to continue.4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Shall I not inform you of something that is greeter in degree than (optional) fasting, charity and Prayer?&#8221;</i> They said: Indeed inform us. So he said: <i>&#8220;It is reconciling the people. For indeed causing corruption between them is the shaver!&#8221;</i>5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> explained this shaving in another saying: <i>&#8220;The disease of the people before you has overcome you, namely envy and hatred and it is the shaver. I do not say that it shaves-off the heir. Rather, it shaves-off the religion!&#8221;</i>6</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Source: Tazkiyatun-Nufoos</i> (pp.103-107) of Shaykh Ahmad Fareed</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>RAJAA (HOPE) IN ALLAAH</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hope: it is the peaceful state of the heart which awaits what is dear to it. If the means &#8211; by which what the heart hopes for may come &#8211; are not present, then stupidity and foolishness would be a more accurate name for such a state. Similarly, if there is no doubt that what is being hoped for will definitely occur, then likewise, this state cannot be referred to as hope. For example, it would not be correct to say: I hope that the sun rises today. However, it would be correct to say: I hope that it rains today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Scholars who have studied matters pertaining to the heart have said: that this world is like land that is cultivated for its fruits in the Hereafter; and that the heart is like the earth; and that <i>eemaan</i>(faith) is like the seeds; and that acts of obedience are like ploughing and preparing the soil for planting, and digging channels in order to irrigate and bring water to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The heart which is in love with this world is like barren land, from which seeds cannot sprout. The Day of Judgement is like the day of harvest &#8211; and each person reaps what he sows. And no seed can sprout, except the seeds of <i>eemaan</i>, and <i>eemaan</i> very seldom benefits if the heart is corrupt and has bad qualities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>BETWEEN HOPE AND DELUSION</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The example of a servants hope in Allaah&#8217;s mercy and forgiveness can be likened to the hope of a farmer: If the farmer searches for fertile soil, then sows it with good and healthy seeds, giving to the seeds what they need at the appropriate time, removing from around them the weeds and anything else that may hinder or ruin their growth, then he sits and waits for the Favour of Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; with regards to Him keeping away violent storms and other harmful elements, until the seeds have fully ripened and grown &#8211; then this type of waiting and expectation can truly be described as hope. However, if the farmer sows the seeds in hard and barren soil, too high up for water to reach it, and he does nothing to care and protect the seed from harm, and then he sits and waits for a good harvest &#8211; then this waiting and expectation is not called hope, rather, such waiting is called foolishness and delusion!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the term hope only applies to waiting for what is dear or desired, after all the means &#8211; that will assist in realising this desire and are within the ability of the person &#8211; have been utilised. As for that which is not within the servants ability, then it is left to the favour of Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; and He is the One who can prevent harmful matters, if He so wishes. So if the servant sows the seeds of <i>eemaan</i>, and waters them with acts of obedience to Allaah, and cleanses his heart from harmful qualities and traits, then waits for the favour of Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; with regards being granted firmness upon this until death and an excellent end leading to His forgiveness &#8211; then such a wait can truly be called hope. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>&#8220;Indeed those who believe and those who migrate and who make <i>jihaad</i> in the path of Allaah, they are the ones who have the hope of Allaah&#8217;s mercy. And indeed Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most-Merciful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:218].</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of this being that such people are truly worthy of hoping in Allaah&#8217;s mercy. And He did not intend only to particularise them with this, since others also can hope in Allaah&#8217;s mercy. However, He particularised them as being those who truly deserve to hope. So the one whose hope in Allaah&#8217;s mercy guides him to obedience and deters him from disobedience, his hope is true. And the one whose hope invites him to being immersed in sin and disobedience, is in delusion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also necessary to know that truly hoping in something necessitates three things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Firstly</i>: Yearning for what one hopes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Secondly</i>: Fearing to miss gaining it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Thirdly</i>: Striving to achieve it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If hope is not connected with any one of these matters, then it is mere wishful thinking, since hope is one thing, and wishful thinking something else. And every person who is hopeful, is also fearful, and whosoever traverses a path, makes haste when he fears that he may miss what he hopes for.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> relates that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever fears being plunderered by the enemy, sets out in the early part of the night, and whosoever sets out early reaches the destination. Indeed the treasures of Allaah are precious. Indeed the treasures of Allaah is Paradise.&#8221;</i> 2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects, the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>&#8220;Say: O My servants who have wronged their souls due to sin. Do not despair in Allaah&#8217;s mercy, for indeed Allaah forgives all sins. Indeed He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah az-Zumar 39:53].</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>&#8220;Indeed your Lord is full of forgiveness for mankind, inspite of their wrong-doing.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ar-Ra&#8217;d 13:6].</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umar ibn al-Khattaab <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> relates that some prisoners were brought before Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and amongst them was a woman who was frantically searching for someone in the crowd. When she found a baby amongst the prisoners, she took it in her arms, cradled it next to her chest and suckled it. So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Do you think that this woman would ever throw her child into the Fire?&#8221;</i> We said: By Allaah ! Never! So he said: <i>&#8220;Allaah is more merciful to His believing servants than that mother could ever be to her child.&#8221;</i>3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> relates that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Indeed before Allaah created the creation, He decreed for Himself &#8216;Indeed My mercy prevails over My anger.'&#8221;</i>4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas <i>radiallanhu &#8216;anhu</i> relates that he heard Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> say: <i>&#8220;Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said O son of Aadam! As long as you call upon Me and hope in Me, I shall forgive you for what you have done and I shall not mind. O son of Aadam! If your sins were to reach the clouds of the sky and you were then to ask forgiveness of Me, I would forgive you. O son of Aadam! Were you to come to Me with sins nearly as great as the earth, and were you then to meet Me without committing any shirk (i.e. calling upon someone else, or worshipping someone else) along with Me, I would bring you forgiveness as great as it.&#8221;</i>5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahyaa ibn Mu&#8217;aadh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;In my view, the worst kind of self-delusion is to greatly sin, yet hope for forgiveness without feeling any regret; and to hope to draw close to Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; without obedience to Him; and to await the fruits of Paradise, by planting the seeds for Hell-Fire; and to seek the abode of the obedient ones, by doing acts of disobedience; and to expect a reward, without doing any worthy action; and to hope in Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; after overstepping the bounds.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><i>&#8220;You hope for salvation but do not tread its path.<br />
A ship never sails upon dry land.&#8221;</i>6</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Author:Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah<br />
Source:Majmoo‘-ul Fataawaa (vol. 7, pg. 677-679)<br />
Produced by:al-manhaj.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the Prophet’s statement: <b>“Anyone who possesses a speck of pride (kibr) in his heart will not enter Paradise”</b> – Is this hadeeth specific only to the believers or (is it specific only to the) unbelievers? If we were to say that it is specific for the Believers then (is not) our statement trivial considering (the fact that) the believers shall enter Paradise due to their Eemaan. If, on the other hand, we were to say that the hadeeth is specific for the unbelievers then what is the relevance of the statement (since it is already known that the unbelievers shall not gain admission to Paradise?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Another) authentically reported wording of (this particular version of the) hadeeth is, <b>“Anyone who possesses half a mustard seed of Pride (kibr) in his heart will not be granted admission to Paradise. And anyone who possesses half a mustard seed of Eemaan will not enter the (Eternal) Fire.”</b> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kibr that openly opposes and negates Eemaan results in the banishment of the one who holds it from entering al-Jannah as is found in Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“And your Lord said: &#8220;Invoke Me, I will respond to your (invocation). Verily! Those who scorn (yastakbiroon – Have kibr) My worship, they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!&#8221;</b> [Surah Ghaafir: 60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Kibr of Iblees (the Devil), Pharaoh and all the others who possessed the Kibr, which invalidated Eemaan. This is also the Kibr that the Jews possess and those whom Allaah has described to us by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“Is it that whenever there came to you a Messenger with what you yourselves desired not, you grew arrogant? Some, you disbelieved and some, you killed.”</b> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 87]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Kibr, in its entirety, openly opposes the essentials of al-Eemaan. As such he who has an atom’s weight of Kibr in his heart will not act upon that which Allaah has prescribed, nor will he abstain from that which Allaah has prohibited. Instead his Kibr shall result in his disavowal and rejection of the truth and instill in him contempt of others. This, precisely, is the explanatory definition of al-Kibr provide by the Prophet as is found in the complete version of the initial Hadeeth [<b>“The one who possesses an atom’s weight of Kibr in his heart shall not be granted admission to Paradise.”</b>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) was asked: “[But] O Messenger of Allaah! A man likes to have fine clothing and footwear. Is this included in Kibr?” He responded, “No. Allaah is Beauty and loves Beauty. Kibr is the rejection of truth (<i>Batrul-Haqq</i>) and condescension of others (<i>waa ghaamtun-naas</i>).” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The statement “<i>Batarul-Haqq</i>” denotes distain and rejection of the Truth, while “<i>ghaamtun-naas</i>” implies contempt and condescension of others from amongst mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore the one who possesses half a mustard seed of it (Kibr) rejects the Truth that he was ordered to accept and act upon. At the same time, the Kibr instills in him a sense of condescension that inculcates in the individual an oppressive demeanor producing transgression over the rights of others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who neglects his obligations (due to his rejection of them) and is oppressive to others from amongst the creation is not to be amongst the people of Jannah (while in this state), or deserving of it. On the contrary, such an individual is to be counted amongst the people who are threatened with punishment!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) statement: <b> “Anyone who possesses a speck of Kibr in his heart will not be granted admission to Paradise”</b> implies that the individual is not from the people of Jannah and is not deserving of it. But if he repents, or he possesses <i>Hasaanaat</i> (righteous deeds) that expiate his sins, or Allaah has given him <i>Ibtillaah</i> (trials and tests) in the form of calamities that have expunged his sins, or similar things; then for that individual the recompense of Kibr – which originally was a barrier for him to enter Jannah – is eliminated and he gains admission (to it). Similarly Allaah, due to Divine Grace, may forgive the individual (the sin of) Kibr. [3] None shall gain admission (to Paradise) while possessing an atom’s weight of Kibr. As a result, those (scholars) discussing this Hadeeth, and other Hadeeth that have a similar theme, have stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Unconditional admission (to Paradise) – that is not in conjunction with punishment (for the sin of Kibr) – is what is being negated in this Hadeeth; not the admission to Jannah that is granted to those who have entered the Fire (to be purified and cleansed) and then are allowed admission to Paradise thereafter. (On the other hand) if a hadeeth explicitly declares that a particular person is in Jannah or that a particular person is from the People of Jannah, it would then be understood that he would enter the Jannah and not enter the fire (beforehand).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After this clarification we come to understand the true meaning of these narrations as being that the one who possesses an atom’s weight of Kibr in his heart is not from the people of Paradise (up to that point) and shall not gain admission into it without punishment (for his sin). Surely he deserves punishment – due to the enormity of the sin – similar to those who perform the Major (<i>Kabaa’ir</i>) sins. Allaah may punish him in the Fire as long as He wishes, but none from amongst the people of Tawheed shall remain in the Fire eternally.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is to be the way we understand all the Hadeeth that have a similar meaning. This understanding is to be used when seeking the meaning of his (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) statement: <b>“The one who severs the ties of the womb shall not enter Jannah”</b>[4] or <b>“You shall not enter Jannah until you believe. And you shall not believe until you love one another. Shall I inform you of something that if you do you shall (truly) love each other? Spread the greetings of Salaam amongst yourselves.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the understanding that we are to have when pondering over the ahaadeeth that contain threats of Punishment. In this way we understand that the hadeeth is general and can be attributed to both the unbelievers and the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one was to say: “All the Muslims enter Jannah due to their Islaam.” The response is that not all Muslims enter Jannah without punishment. Surely the people who have been threatened (with punishment in the Hereafter due to their sins) shall enter into the Fire to remain in it for the period that Allaah so wills even though they are not unbelievers. The individual who has some Eemaan coinciding with major sins may enter into the Fire and exit from it as a result of the <i>Shafaa‘ah</i> (Intercession) of the Prophet or by other reported means as articulated by the Prophet when he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“My Shafaa‘ah is for the people who commit Majors Sins from amongst my Ummah.”</b> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said as is reported in the Saheeh: <b>“I shall bring out of the Fire the one who possesses half a mustard seed of Eemaan.”</b> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this way we understand what is in store for those whom Allaah has threatened with punishment – the murderer, fornicator/adulterer, the one who consumes intoxicants, and the one who misappropriates the wealth of the orphans, the one who witnesses falsehood and others who perform the deeds of the people of major sins. They – even if they are not unbelievers – are not deserving of the Jannah that they are promised (as Muslims) without first being (cleansed and purged through) punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The madh-hab (way and belief) of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa‘ah is that the <i>Foosaaq</i> (deviant sinners) from amongst the general body of Muslims are not going to be eternally punished in the Fire as held by the Khawaarij[7] and the Mu‘tazilah.[8] They are not complete in their religion (Deen), Eemaan and obedience to Allaah.[9] They have good and bad deeds that necessitate a measure of punishment and reward. This is a concise dissertation regarding the issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><br />
Footnotes:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s Note: Reported by Imaam Muslim, Abu Dawood and At-Tirmidhee on the authority of Ibn Mas‘ood. See <i>Islaah al-Masaajid</i>, checked by Shaykh Al-Albaanee <i>rahimahullaah</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Translator’s Note: Reported by Imam Muslim (54), Ibn Khuzaymah, Abu Dawood, At-Tirmidhee and Ibn Sa‘d on the authority of Ibn Mas‘ood. At-Tabaraanee reports it on the authority of ‘Abdullah bin Salaam</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Translator’s Note: Allaah the Most High says in Surah an-Nisaa’ (4:48): <b>“Verily, Allaah forgives not that partners should be set up with him in worship, but He forgives what is besides that to whom He pleases, and whoever sets up partners with Allaah in worship, he has indeed invented a tremendous sin.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Translator’s Note: Reported by Imaam Muslim (1765 – Abridged) al-Haakim, al-Bayhaqee, Abu Dawood, and at-Tirmidhee on the authority of Jubayr bin Mut‘aam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Translator’s Note: Turn to the Chapter <b> “Shafaa‘ah for the People of Major Sins”</b> (Pg. 61-108) in the highly beneficial book of the world-renowned Muhaddith, Shaykh Muqbil bin Haadee al-Waadi‘ee (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) titled: “Ash-Shafaa‘ah.” In the chapter the Shaykh reports seventy-six (76) ahaadeeth showing that those who perform Major sins are not excluded from the <i>Shafaa‘ah</i> of Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>). This particular hadeeth can be found in the book on page 85, hadeeth number 56. Shaikh Abu ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Muqbil bin Haadee reports that the Hadeeth is collected by at-Tirmidhee (v. 4, pg. 45) on the authority of Anas and Jaabir. He then states: “And this hadeeth is Hasan Saheeh Ghareeb (good and authentic yet scarce in this mode). The Hadeeth is reported by Ibn Khuzaymah (pg. 270), Ibn Hibbaan as is stated in the Mawrid (pg. 640), and al-Haakim (vol. 1, pg. 69) said: ‘This hadeeth is authentic and meets the requirements set by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim even though they did not narrate it.’” Later on Shaykh Muqbil wrote: “Al-Haafidh Ibn Katheer said in his Tafseer (vol. 1, pg. 487) that its chain of narration is Saheeh and meets the requirements set by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim.” The Shaykh then takes us step by step through the chain of narration and proves convincingly that the hadeeth does not meet the requirements of Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim due to the presence of Mu‘aamar reporting from Thaabit. For further detailed analysis turn to pg. 85-88. In Shaykh al-Albaani’s Saheeh al-Jaami‘, he declares the hadeeth Saheeh on the authority of Jaabir, Ibn ‘Abbas, Ibn ‘Umar, Ka‘b bin ‘Ajrah and Anas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] Translator’s Note: This is a segment of the famous Hadeeth of Shafaa‘ah collected by Al-Bukhaaree (vol. 13, pg. 472)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] Translator’s Note: Khawaarij is the plural of Kharijee – They are those who declared that a Muslim becomes a disbeliever due to committing a major sin alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] Translator’s Note: The Mu‘tazilah deem the one who does not agree with their understanding of Tawheed (7 false principles) is deemed a Mushrik. They believe that the sinners who are Muslim shall be in a place between Jannah and the Fire. Their beliefs are built on false logical deductions that led them to negate many of the Names and Attributes of Allaah. They were the deviant group who opposed the Imaam of Ahlus-Sunnah, Ahmad Ibn Hanbal by falsely claiming that the Qur’aan is created and not the Speech of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] Translator’s Note: The Murji’ah believe that sins, major or minor, do not affect faith and that Eemaan neither increases nor decreases. They claim that actions are not part of faith and that people do not vary in faith.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Among those who remember Allah are those who begin remembering with the tongue even if he is negligent. He continues to do so until his heart is involved too.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Others do not agree with that and do not start while in a state of negligence, but instead wait until the heart is ready. He begins with his heart and then involves his tongue in remembrance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first supplication goes from his tongue to his heart and the second from his heart to his tongue without emptying any of the contents of his heart. He just waits until he feels that the utterance is ready to be verbalized. When he feels that his heart will utter! then the heart&#8217;s utterance would pass to verbal utterance. Then he would engross himself in that until he finds that every part of his being is supplicating Allah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The best and more useful kind of supplication is what the heart and tongue are involved in, to be from among the prophetic supplications, and whoever is reciting it feels its meaning and aims.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="text-align:justify;">The evidence for hope and longing (ar-rajaa) is the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;"><em>“So whoever hopes to see His Lord and be rewarded by Him, then let him perform righteous deeds and make it purely and sincerely for Him; and let him not make any share of it to anyone other than his Lord.”</em> </span>[Al-Kahf 18:110]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The evidence for hope and longing (ar-rajaa)” &#8211;</strong></p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Hope and longing is one of the pillars that worship is built upon;</li>
<li>this means that a person is optimistic about obtaining the Mercy and Pardon of Allaah.</li>
<li>It is obligatory upon the servant that they combine both hope and fear because hope causes a person to long for the Mercy of Allaah and fear prevents them from perpetrating an act that earns the anger of Allaah.</li>
<li>Some of the people of knowledge have said that fear and hope are like the ‘two wings of the servant’.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Ar-rajaa is that a person wishes for something that may be attained and is close or it may be something far off but is treated as being close.</li>
<li>This earnest hope which comprises humility and submission may only be directed to Allaah and directing it to other than this is shirk; whether minor or major depends on state of the heart of the person in this case.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“is the saying of Allaah, the Most High: “So whoever hopes to see His Lord and be rewarded by Him, then let him perform righteous deeds and make it purely and sincerely for Him;”</span> </strong>&#8211; Meaning,</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>whoever desires and longs to meet their Lord, then sheer desire is not enough but he should also perform righteous deeds.</li>
<li>This verse is a proof that it is obligatory to perform righteous deeds.</li>
<li>A righteous deed is everything that brings the servant closer to Allaah, whether it is an obligation or a recommended act.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>A person who hopes but does not act is delusional and has false hopes; this is blameworthy.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“and let him not make any share of it to anyone other than his Lord.””</strong> </span>&#8211; Meaning,</p>
<ul>
<li>he should not commit major shirk that expels him from the religion or minor shirk that negates the completeness of tawheed.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported that Ibrâhîm b. Adham (d162H) – Allâh have mercy on him – once passed through the market of Basrah. People gathered around him and asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Abû Ishâq, Allâh the Exalted says in his Book. ‘Call on me, I will answer your prayers’, but we have been calling on Him for a long time and He does not answer our prayers. [Ibrâhîm] replied, “O people of Basrah, your hearts have died in respect to ten things:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>First, you know Allâh but you do not give Him His rights;</li>
<li>Second, you have read Allâh’s Book but you do not act by it;</li>
<li>Third, you claim to love Allâh’s Messenger – Allâh’s peace and blessings be upon him – yet you abandon his Sunnah;</li>
<li>Fourth, you claim to be enemies to Shaytân but you conform to [his ways];</li>
<li>Fifth, you say you love Paradise yet you do not work for it;</li>
<li>Sixth, you say you fear The Fire yet you put yourselves closer to it [by sinning];</li>
<li>Seventh, you say death is true but you do not prepare for it;</li>
<li>Eighth, you busy yourselves with the faults of others and disregard your own;</li>
<li>Ninth, you consume the favors of your Lord but are not grateful for them; and</li>
<li>Tenth, you bury your dead but take no lesson from them.”</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;">(2.284. To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth, and whether you disclose what is in yourselves or conceal it, Allah will call you to account for it. Then He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills. And Allah is able to do all things.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah states that His is the kingship of the heavens and earth and of what and whoever is on or between them, that He has perfect watch over them. No apparent matter or secret that the heart conceals is ever a secret to Him, however minor it is. Allah also states that He will hold His servants accountable for what they do and what they conceal in their hearts. In similar statements, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say (O Muhammad ): &#8220;Whether you hide what is in your breasts or reveal it, Allah knows it, and He knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth. And Allah is able to do all things) ﴿3:29﴾, and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He knows the secret and that which is yet more hidden.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many other Ayat on this subject. In this Ayah (2:284), Allah states that He has knowledge of what the hearts conceal, and consequently, He will hold the creation accountable for whatever is in their hearts. This is why when this Ayah was revealed, it was hard on the Companions, since out of their strong faith and conviction, they were afraid that such reckoning would diminish their good deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, &#8220;When</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth, and whether you disclose what is in yourselves or conceal it, Allah will call you to account for it. Then He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills. And Allah is able to do all things)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">was revealed to the Messenger of Allah , it was very hard for the Companions of the Messenger . The Companions came to the Messenger and fell to their knees saying, `O Messenger of Allah! We were asked to perform what we can bear of deeds: the prayer, the fast, Jihad and charity. However, this Ayah was revealed to you, and we cannot bear it.&#8217; The Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Do you want to repeat what the People of the Two Scriptures before you said, that is, `We hear and we disobey&#8217; Rather, say, `We hear and we obey, and we seek Your forgiveness, O our Lord, and the Return is to You.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the people accepted this statement and their tongues recited it, Allah sent down afterwards,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Messenger believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do)the believers. Each one believes in Allah, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. (They say,) &#8220;We make no distinction between one another of His Messengers and they say, &#8220;We hear, and we obey. (We seek) Your forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the return (of all).&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When they did that, Allah abrogated the Ayah (2:284) and sent down the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope. He gets reward for that (good) which he has earned, and he is punished for that (evil) which he has earned. &#8220;Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error.&#8221;) until the end.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim recorded it with the wording; &#8220;When they did that, Allah abrogated it (2:284) and sent down,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope. He gets reward for that (good) which he has earned, and he is punished for that (evil) which he has earned. &#8220;Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error&#8221;.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said, `I shall (accept your supplication),&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;Our Lord! Lay not on us a burden like that which You did lay on those before us (Jews and Christians)&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said, `I shall (accept your supplication),&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;Our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear. &#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said, `I shall (accept your supplication),&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;Pardon us and grant us forgiveness. Have mercy on us. You are our Mawla (Supporter and Protector) and give us victory over the disbelieving people.&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said, `I shall.&#8221;&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that Mujahid said, &#8220;I saw Ibn `Abbas and said to him, `O Abu Abbas! I was with Ibn `Umar, and he read this Ayah and cried.&#8217; He asked, `Which Ayah&#8217; I said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`(And whether you disclose what is in yourselves or conceal it.)&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn `Abbas said, `When this Ayah was revealed, it was very hard on the Companions of the Messenger of Allah and worried them tremendously. They said: O Messenger of Allah! We know that we would be punished according to our statements and our actions, but as for what occurs in our hearts, we do not control what is in them.&#8217; The Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say, `We hear and we obey.&#8217;) They said, `We hear and we obey.&#8217; Thereafter, this Ayah abrogated the previous Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Messenger believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allah), until,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope. He gets reward for that (good) which he has earned, and he is punished for that (evil) which he has earned.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, they were pardoned what happens in their hearts, and were held accountable only for their actions.&#8221;&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Group recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Allah has pardoned my Ummah for what they say to themselves, as long as they do not utter it or act on it.)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Two Sahihs recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah said (to His angels), &#8220;If My servant intends to commit an evil deed, do not record it as such for him, and if he commits it, write it for him as one evil deed. If he intends to perform a good deed, but did not perform it, then write it for him as one good deed, and if he performs it, write it for him as ten good deeds.&#8221;)</p>
