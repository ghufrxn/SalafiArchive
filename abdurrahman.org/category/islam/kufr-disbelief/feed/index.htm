<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Difference between Kufr and Shirk</strong></span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: A Muslim sister N. S. `A from Riyadh says: What is the difference between Kufr (disbelief) and Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship)? Please, advise. May Allah reward you!</span></strong></p>



<p><strong><span style="color:#808080;">Answer by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah):</span></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Kufr</strong> </span>is the denial and concealment of the Truth such as those who deny the obligation of Salah, Zakah, Sawm, Hajj in case of being financially and physically able, and dutifulness to one&#8217;s parents, and so on.&nbsp;It is also like those who deny the prohibition of Zina (premarital sexual intercourse and/or adultery), consuming Khamr (intoxicants), and disobeying one’s parents.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Shirk</span> </strong>is to devote the acts of worship to anything beside Allah (Exalted be He) such as those who seek the help of the dead, the absent, the Jinn, idols, the stars, and so on or those who offer sacrifices or make vows to them.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">A Kafir (disbeliever) may be called a Mushrik (one who associates others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and vice versa. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says,</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever invokes (or worships), besides Allâh, any other ilâh (god), of whom he has no proof; then his reckoning is only with his Lord. Surely! Al­Kâfirûn (the disbelievers in Allâh and in the Oneness of Allâh, polytheists, pagans, idolaters) will not be successful.</span></strong>&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Allah (may He be Praised) also says, <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily, whosoever sets up partners (in worship) with Allâh, then Allâh has forbidden Paradise to him, and the Fire will be his abode.&#8221;</span></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In Surah Fatir, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says, <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Such is Allâh, your Lord; His is the kingdom. And those, whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmîr (the thin membrane over the date­stone). If you invoke (or call upon) them, they hear not your call; and if (in case) they were to hear, they could not grant it (your request) to you. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will disown your worshipping them. And none can inform you (O Muhammad ملسو هيلع اللها ىلص) like Him Who is the All­Knower (of everything).&#8221;</span> </strong>Here, Allah (Exalted be He) names their call upon things other than Him as Shirk and in Surah Al­Mu&#8217;minun, Allah (Exalted be He) names it Kufr.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In Surah Al­Tawbah, Allah (Glorified be He) says, <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;They (the disbelievers, the Jews and the Christians) want to extinguish Allâh’s Light (with which Muhammad ملسو هيلع اللها ىلص has been sent ­ Islâmic Monotheism) with their mouths, but Allâh will not allow except that His Light should be perfected even though the Kâfirûn (disbelievers) hate (it). It is He Who has sent His Messenger (Muhammad ملسو هيلع اللها ىلص) with guidance and the religion of truth (Islâm), to make it superior over all religions even though the Mushrikûn (polytheists, pagans, idolaters, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh) hate (it).&#8221;</strong></span> Here, Allah (Exalted be He) calls the disbelievers as Kuffar and Mushriks. This indicates that a Kafir may be called a Mushrik and vise versa. There are many Ayahs and Hadith that stress the same meaning.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Verily, between a man and Shirk and Kufr is the negligence of prayer.</strong></span>&#8221; (Related by Muslim in his Sahih (authentic) book of Hadith on the authority of Jabir Ibn `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with them).He (peace be upon him) also said, &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The covenant that distinguishes between us and them (the hypocrites) is Salah. Anyone who abandons it is a Kafir.</strong></span>&#8221; (Related by Imam Ahmad, Abu Dawud, Al­Tirmidhy, Al­Nasa&#8217;y, and Ibn Majah with a Sahih chain of transmission on the authority of Buraydah ibn Al­Hasib, may Allah be pleased with him).May Allah grant us success!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>From the ideologies of disbelief that contradict the authentic Creed and oppose what the messengers came with is:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What the <strong>atheists</strong> of this era believe in, such as the followers of <strong>Marx</strong>, <strong>Lenin</strong> and others who call to atheism and disbelief, regardless of whether they call that <strong>socialism</strong>, <strong>communism</strong>, <strong>ba’athism</strong> or any other name, for indeed from the base principles of these atheists is the belief that there is no god and that life is only (based on) matter. And from their principles is to reject the Day of Final Return, Paradise, Hellfire, and to disbelieve in all of the religions. Whoever examines their books and studies what beliefs they were upon will come to know that with full certainty. No doubt this belief is in contradiction to all of the heavenly revealed religions and leads its followers to the worst of fates in this world and the Hereafter.</p>

<p><strong>Transcription of the Audio:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillaah hir Rahman nir Raheem. Alhumdulillahi Rabbil Aalameen<br />
Wa sallallahu ala Muhammadin wa ala aalihi wa sahbihi wa sallam</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The pillars of Kufr are four, they are,</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Haughtiness and disdainfullnes : This prevents the person from submission i.e. yielding.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Envy (Al Hasad) : This prevents him from accepting the naseehah i.e. the advice and from exerting it.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Anger (Al Ghadab) : This prevents him from being just.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Lusts : This prevents him from giving himself to worship.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If the pillar of false pride and haughtiness is demolished, then submission will become easy for him. If the pillar of envy is demolished, then it becomes easier for him to accept advice and to offer it. If the pillar of anger is demolished, it becomes easy for him to be just and humble. If the pillar of lust is demolished, it becomes easy for him to be patient and ready for worship.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The demolishing of mountains is much more easier than demolishing these four pillars for the one who is  afflicted with it, specially if they are entrenched in him and became as a firmed attribute, because no action can be upright with the presence of these pillars and no soul can be sanctified and purified having these established in it and whenever the person wants to exert himself to do or to act, these four pillars come and corrupt his work. And all other defects originate from these four and if these four are established in the heart it will make him see falsehood in the form of the truth and truth in the form of falsehood and good in the form of wrong and wrong in the form of good and it will make this life grow nearer to him and make the hereafter far removed from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you contemplate the Kufr of the nations before, you will see that the Kufr of the nations originated from these four pillars and upon these four pillars the punishment will befall. The intensity of the punishment and it&#8217;s severity will depend upon how these four and entrenched. So whoever opens for himself these four pillars is indeed has opened all the doors of evil, sooner or later and whoever has closed the doors of these then he indeed has closed all the doors of evil because these four prevents submissiveness, sincerity, repentance and longing and turning to Allah, acceptance of the truth, the advice to the Muslims, humbleness to Allah and to his creation. This is what these four pillars can do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The origin of these four pillars is from man&#8217;s ignorance concerning his Lord and ignorance concerning himself.  Had he known of his Lord qualified with the most perfect and magnificent attributes and had he known himself qualified with all forms of defects, he wouldn&#8217;t be haughty, angry, envious of others because envy in fact is one form of opposition to Allah because he dislikes the favour and blessing of Allah which he bestowed upon his slave while Allah loves that. Not only that, he likes that it to be rifted from his brother and Allah does not like that. So he is opposing Allah in his pre-decree and what Allah loves and his honour and that is why Iblees (Satan) is enemy  because his sin was due to haughtiness, arrogance and envy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can these be removed?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These two qualities, knowing Allah and Tawheed, and content with him and pleased with him and turning to him, takes away these two qualities of haughtiness and envy and taking anger away by knowing oneself that the self does not deserve all that so that to be angry for it and to avenge for its all sake. In this case this will prompt it to be contempt once this is taken out. Otherwise then this will be preference for the self over its creator and originator. The greatest thing to repel this defect is to train the self to get angry for Allah&#8217;s sake and whatever at any time enters the self this type of anger for Allah&#8217;s sake, there will exit the anger for its self and the opposite is true. As to the lust, its cure, its healing is in the correct knowledge. Yielding to the self&#8217;s lust deprives it from the correct knowledge and putting it on a diet in that respect puts it on the linkage with the correct knowledge. The more you are open the door for lusts, the more you are trying to deprive the self  from the correct knowledge and the more you close it, the more you will be linked to the correct knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anger is like the wild animal. If its owner releases it, it starts by eating him up first. Lust is like the fire when the person ignites it it begins by burning him there in first. Al-Kibr, haughtiness, false pride, arrogance is like confronting the king regarding the king&#8217;s possession and kingdom, if he does not destroy you he will expel you. Envy is like opposing someone who is more powerful and more stronger than you.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: There are those who say that the Kuffâr (disbelievers) are our brothers in humanity and not in the religion. Is this true?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân</strong>: It is not sufficient with the humanity. One does not speak like that in order to please them or to gain their sympathies. One does not speak like that. One says that they are our enemies and not that they are our brothers in humanity. One says that they are our enemies. What is the benefit of a human fraternity if they are our enemies in the religion? What does it benefit? Pharaoh was also a human. Right? Was he also our brother? We do not say that.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, and the noble companions and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">If someone makes a statement of kufr or opposition to the Sunnah and he is a practicing Muslim, can we say he is a kafir?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a person commits an action of kufr or says a statement of kufr, then this person in particular can only be called a kafir only after certain criteria are met. These criteria include:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The conditions must be fulfilled that the action and/or statement is kufr and entails kufr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. It is necessary to check if there exist certain impediments that prevent the imputing of kufr on this particular person.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Actions and/or statements of kufr can be declared in general as such, however making them applicable on a specific person requires fulfilling the conditions and removing the impediments pertaining to takfeer. This is such because there may be causes which would prevent from imputing kufr on a particular person.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, it is not left for anyone to indulge in takfeer as this is the right of Allaah, (subhannahu wa ta’ala), and is a very grave matter to the extent that if you impute kufr on a person incorrectly, then the kufr may return on you; this applies to imputing kufr on the common Muslim as well as the rulers. The Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) commanded the Muslim in the authentic hadith: “Say that which is good or stay silent.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this is for general matters, then what about takfeer? Then, by all means, it is necessary to refrain from indulging in this matter and leave it to the grand and reliable scholars of Islaam. They are the ones who can deduce the correct rulings vis-à-vis the kufr of a specific person. Similarly, this is not a matter for even the senior students of knowledge to take part in openly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It seems nowadays that most people have nothing else to do but speak about the hukaam (the leaders) [1] and takfeer, day and night, in dreams and in awakness. If we claim to be on the path of the salaf (the righteous predecessors), then Muslims should not engage themselves in this matter. Regrettably, most common Muslims make analysis of the whole world political affairs and make judgments with ease and little fear of Allaah (subhannahu wa ta’ala). However, none of this is the business of the common Muslim. Their involvement in these matters can only aggravate situations and cause disunity. Some argue that, “Politics is from Islaam; Islaam and politics are the same.” They come through these doors. When you ask them about politics, you will find they read twelve newspapers, watch all the satellite news channels, and sit in countless circles, day and night, analyzing politics and so-called current affairs. This is what they consider as &#8220;politics&#8221;! At the very least, this is counterproductive and not beneficial for the person who will be responsible for every minute of his life, which he is required to fill with what is good and beneficial. The legislative policies in Islaam are the true &#8220;politics.&#8221; And this is not for the common Muslims to deal with, not to mention the &#8220;media&#8221; politics, filled with lies, counter-lies, endless analysis, deceptive statements, emotional speeches, etc. I ask Allaah (subhannahu wa ta’ala) to teach us all that which is beneficial and to save us from all that is evil. Aameen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may Allaah’s salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, and the noble companions and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 1</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">source: silsilat ul-hudā wa nnūr ~ the series of guidance and light ~ tape no. 8</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Question #5: “What is the ruling on the one who abandons the prayer? And what is the difference between al-kufr ul-ʽamalī [1] (the disbelief related to actions) and al-kufr ul-ʽitiqādī [2] (the disbelief related to faith)?”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albānī answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The one who abandons the prayer has two states: either he believes in its legislation, or he denies its legislation. So regarding this second state, he is a disbeliever by the consensus of the Muslims. And likewise, whoever denies a matter from the religion that a Muslim cannot be ignorant about – for example, whoever denies (the legislation of) fasting, Hajj and whatever else there is of matters known by all the Muslims to be necessities of the religion – then he is a disbeliever. So there is no difference of opinion about this: whoever denies the legislation of the prayer is a disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
But if there is a man who does not deny (the legislation) of the prayer and who acknowledges its legislation, but with respect to action, he does not perform it, he does not pray – maybe he does not pray at all and maybe he prays sometimes – so in this case, if we said that this man has disbelieved, this statement would not apply to him at all, because kufr (disbelief) is denial, and he is not denying the legislation of the prayer, as (Allāh), the Most High, said with regard</p>
<p>to the disbelievers: {And they denied them (those Āyāt)…, though their ownselves were convinced thereof}. [3]<br />
So if we take as an example so-and-so from the people who does not pray, but when he is asked ‘Why don’t you pray O my brother?’, he says to you, ‘Allāh will forgive me, by Allāh the worldly life has kept me busy, these children have kept me busy,’ and this type of talk. Of course, this talk is not an excuse for him at all, but he presents us a benefit which we didn’t know because we can’t know what is in his heart. He presents us a benefit that the man believes in the legislation of the prayer, as opposed to if the answer was, may Allāh forbid: ‘O my brother, the time for this prayer is gone; this was during a time when the people were not educated, they were unclean, they were in need of a specific nature of cleanliness, purity and exercise, and now the time for this has gone; now there are new means that free us of prayer’ – this (man) has disbelieved and thus (goes) to {Hell, and worst indeed is that destination}. [4]  As for if the answer is the first (example): ‘Why don’t you pray?’ (and he says,) ‘Allāh will forgive us, may Allāh curse the shaytān,’ and this type of talk that informs us that the man is not denying the legislation of the prayer, then if we said that this man is a disbeliever, we would be contradicting the reality, because this man is a believer, a believer in the legislation of the prayer and a believer in all of Islām, so how can we declare him a disbeliever?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, we say that there is no difference between the one who abandons the prayer and the one who abandons fasting and the one who abandons Hajj and the one who abandons anything from the acts of worship related to actions – (there is no difference) with regard to (judging whether) he is to be declared a disbeliever or not. When is he declared a disbeliever? If he denies. When is he not declared a disbeliever? If he believes. So it is not allowed – by consensus – to declare the believer to be a disbeliever. And many narrations have come in accordance with this…: ‘(Allāh will say:) Make whoever (sincerely) said lā ilāha illAllāh (none has the right to be worshiped but Allāh) enter Paradise,’ while he does not have a (good) deed equal to the weight of an atom, but he has the weight of an atom of īmān (faith), so this īmān is what prevents him from dwelling in the Fire forever, and he enters Paradise even if it is after he becomes a black coal. [5] However, this is the one who bears witness that none has the right to be worshiped but Allāh and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allāh, and he believes in all that has come from Allāh and His Messenger ; but he does not pray, or does not fast or does not perform Hajj or the like, or he steals or fornicates – there is no difference with regard to all these affairs when placed on the scales of disbelief related to actions and disbelief related to faith [because since he has faith, these impermissible actions do not fall under disbelief related to faith / major kufr].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For instance, a man commits fornication; do we declare him a disbeliever? You will say, no. I say, no. Don’t be hasty. We have to see, does he say that zinā (fornication) is prohibited? Does he say as some of the ignorant ones say: ‘there is no harām and there is no halāl’? If he says to me (such a) statement, he has disbelieved. Likewise, the one who steals and any (other) sin – for example, the man who backbites people, and we say to him: ‘Fear Allāh, the Messenger (of Allāh) said: ‘Backbiting is you mentioning about</p>
<p>your brother that which he dislikes,’6 and he says: ‘There is no ‘the Messenger said’ and such-and-such,’ (then) he has disbelieved. In this manner, (the same applies to) all the Islamically legislated rulings, whether it is a positive ruling, i.e., one of the obligatory duties, or a negative ruling, i.e., the prohibitions that he must keep away from. So, if he regards any of these prohibitions to be permissible in his heart, he has disbelieved. But if he falls into it by way of action while believing that he is disobeying (Allāh), he has not disbelieved.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there is no difference with regard to this between all the Islamically legislated rulings, whether they are from the obligatory duties or prohibitions. The obligatory duties must be carried out and it is not permissible to leave them off, but whoever leaves them out of laziness, it is not allowed to declare him a disbeliever. Whoever leaves them out of denial has disbelieved; whoever regards any of the forbidden things to be permissible has likewise disbelieved. There is no difference with regard to this at all between the obligations and prohibitions.”</p>

<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 2</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">source: <em>silsilat ul-ahaadeeth is-saheeha – </em>the series of authentic narrations <em>– hadeeth</em> no. 87</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hudhaifa bin al-Yamaan (<em>radiAllaahu ‘anhu</em>) said that the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “Islaam will be erased just as the decoration of a garment is (worn out and) erased, until it will not be known what is fasting, nor prayer, nor the rituals of Hajj, nor charity; and the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, (i.e., the Qur’aan) will be taken away (from the <em>mus-hafs</em>[1] and breasts of the people)[2] in one night such that not (even) an <em>aayah</em> from it will remain on earth. And groups of people will remain – the old people – saying: ‘We saw our forefathers upon this statement: ‘<em>laa ilaaha illAllaah </em>(none has the right to worshiped but Allaah),’ so we also say it.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then), Silah bin Zufar said to Hudhaifa: ‘What will ‘<em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em>’ benefit them when they don’t know what is prayer, nor fasting, nor the rituals of Hajj, nor charity?’ Hudhaifa turned away from him. Then (Silah) repeated it to (Hudhaifa) three times, and every time Hudhaifa would turn away from him. Then he turned toward him on the third time and said three times: ‘O Silah! It will save them from the Fire.’”[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~*~*~*~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) comments:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There is an important benefit of <em>fiqh </em>in the <em>hadeeth</em>, which is that bearing witness that <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah </em>(none has the right to be worshiped but Allaah) saves the one who says it (sincerely) from dwelling forever in the Fire on the Day of Resurrection, even if he didn’t use to perform any of the other pillars of Islaam at all, such as prayer and so on. And it is known that the scholars have differed about the ruling on the one who abandons the prayer especially while believing in its legislation. So<strong> the majority was of the opinion that he has not disbelieved</strong>by that, but rather disobeyed Allaah; and Ahmad – in a report – was of the opinion that he has disbelieved, and that he is to be killed due to apostasy, not as a prescribed punishment. And it is has been authentically narrated from the Companions that they did not consider leaving any of the actions to be disbelief except the prayer; at-Tirmithee and al-Haakim reported it.[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I believe that that which is correct is the view of the majority, and that<strong> what was mentioned from the Companions does not clearly state that they meant by ‘disbelief’ here to be the disbelief which will make its possessor dwell forever in the Fire and for which it is not possible that Allaah will forgive him</strong>. How can that be when this is Hudhaifa bin al-Yamaan – who is one of the foremost of those Companions – responding to Silah bin Zufar, who was about to understand the affair as Ahmad’s understanding of it. So (Silah) said: ‘What will ‘<em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em>’ benefit them when they don’t know what is prayer. . .,’ then Hudhaifa replied to him after his turning away from him, saying three times: ‘O Silah! It will save them from the Fire.’ Therefore, this is a clear statement from Hudhaifa (<em>radiAllaahu ‘anhu</em>) that the one who abandons the prayer is not a disbeliever [if he believes in its legislation], but rather a Muslim who will be saved from dwelling forever in the Fire on the Day of Resurrection. So be mindful of this, for indeed you may not find it in other than this place.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Question #10: “What about the <em>hadeeth</em>: ‘whoever abandons the prayer has disbelieved’?”[1]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>This is not the first <em>hadeeth</em> in which it is said that whoever does such-and-such has disbelieved</strong>. You have the famous <em>hadeeth</em> ‘whoever swears by other than Allaah has disbelieved,’[2] but we don’t say that whoever says ‘by the life of my father’ has apostatized from his religion.[3] And you know, for example, the<em>hadeeth</em> of ‘Umar bin al-Khattaab in Saheeh al-Bukhaari when the Messenger (of Allaah) (<em>‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) heard him swearing by his father, so he (<em>‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) said: ‘Don’t swear by your fathers; whoever of you swears, then let him swear by Allaah or keep silent.’[4] And in the <em>hadeeth</em> of (‘Umar’s) son ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Umar, he said that the Messenger (of Allaah) (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: ‘Whoever swears by other than Allaah has associated partners with Him,’[5] and in another narration, ‘he has disbelieved.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not necessary for the occurrence of the expression ‘whoever does such-and-such has disbelieved’ to mean that he has disbelieved with the disbelief of apostasy. Rather, it can have many meanings, such as for example: ‘he has disbelieved’ can mean that he is close to disbelieving, that he has disbelieved with the disbelief related to (only) actions (i.e., minor <em>kufr</em>), and such meanings that the people of knowledge were obliged to (apply) in order to reconcile between the texts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever abandons the prayer has disbelieved.’ (But also) we say, ‘whoever says<em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em>[6] (sincerely) will enter Paradise;’[7] ‘whoever says <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> (sincerely), it will benefit him some day,’[8] [9] as mentioned in the<em>hadeeth</em> of al-Bazzaar and others. (Another <em>hadeeth</em> mentions that) ‘whichever slave runs away from his master has disbelieved.’[10] These expressions are very numerous: ‘he has disbelieved, he has disbelieved.’ And there isn’t any <em>hadeeth</em>that is interpreted like this upon its apparent meaning if it comes with the expression: ‘he has disbelieved.’ This <em>hadeeth</em> – ‘whoever abandons the prayer has disbelieved’ – is treated the same way as the other narrations which share the saying ‘he has disbelieved’ with the <em>hadeeth</em> about prayer. So here, many interpretations can occur for this text as for many (other) narrations. For example, ‘the tale-carrier[11] will not enter Paradise,’[12] (but) does that mean that he has disbelieved because of his tale-carrying? The answer is: if he considers that to be permissible by his heart, then Paradise has been forbidden for him. And if he acknowledges the forbiddance of that, and admits that he is wrong, a sinner and an evildoer, then his affair is with Allaah, as He, the Mighty and Majestic, said: ‘Verily, Allaah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills.’[13] So abandoning the prayer is an action that leads its doer to die upon other than<em>eemaan</em> (faith) – and Allaah’s protection is sought. And abandoning the prayer is from the characteristics of the disbelievers who don’t pray and don’t give the<em>zakaah</em> (obligatory charity). Hence, if the Muslim does not pray, he has resembled the disbelievers. So his disbelief here is the disbelief related to actions [as long as he believes in the legislation of the prayer]. And the narrations which must be explained (with regard to their true meanings) are very numerous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For instance, during the farewell pilgrimage, (the Prophet) (<em>‘alayhi ssalaat was salaam</em>) ordered Jareer bin ‘Abdillaah al-Bajalee to quiet the people down and make them listen, and he (<em>‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) said while addressing them: ‘Do not return to being disbelievers after me by striking the necks of one another.’[14]And he (<em>‘alayhi ssalaat was salaam</em>) said: ‘Insulting a Muslim is disobedience (to Allaah), and fighting him is disbelief.’[15] But if a Muslim kills or fights another Muslim, has this (person) apostatized from his religion? The answer is: no, because Allaah said: {And if two parties or groups among the believers fall to fighting, then make peace between them both. But if one of them outrages against the other, then fight you (all) against the one that which outrages till it complies with the Command of Allah}.[16] <strong>He considered each of the two groups – the one outraging and the one being outraged – to be from the believers, although the Messenger (of Allaah) said in the previous <em>hadeeth</em> that ‘insulting a Muslim is disobedience (to Allaah) and fighting him is disbelief.</strong>’ So how is disbelief interpreted here? It is minor disbelief; it is disbelief related to actions. And the narrations about prayer – which declare that the one who abandons the prayer has disbelieved – are also (interpreted) likewise: either it is said that he is close to the disbelief related to faith (i.e., major <em>kufr</em>), that he is close to dying upon other than the religion of Islaam, or (it is said) that he has disbelieved with the disbelief related to actions. This interpretation is necessary so that we don’t contradict the narrations of the Messenger (of Allaah) (<em>‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) with one another.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Question #23: “Our Shaykh, I am asking you about the issue of proofs with regard to the ruling on the one who abandons the prayer. In the treatise ‘The ruling on the one who abandons prayer’ by Shaykh Muhammad Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, he is of the opinion that the one who abandons the prayer is a disbeliever, and he has many proofs, such as Allaah’s statement about the <em>mushrikoon</em>:[1] {But if they repent, perform <em>salaah</em> (the prayer), and give <em>zakaah</em> (obligatory charity), then they are your brethren in religion}.[2] So he says that what is understood from the <em>aayah</em> is that if they don’t do that, they are not our brethren; and the religious brotherhood isn’t negated by sins even if they are great, but it is negated when one leaves Islaam”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Yet he is not saying that if the person prays but doesn’t give the <em>zakaah</em> that he is (likewise) not a Muslim and that he has disbelieved by that. May Allaah guide you, you are bringing his proof but I would like to turn your attention to (the fact) that<strong>there is no proof in it because he is not saying about the one who abandons the<em>zakaah</em> the same as he is saying about the one who abandons the prayer.</strong> You didn’t just narrate his opinion, rather you narrated (both) his opinion and his proof, but I would like to turn your attention to (the fact) that this is not a proof for him, because the <em>aayah</em> includes <em>zakaah</em> along with the prayer, [yet he is differentiating between the one who abandons the former and the one who abandons the latter].”</p>
<div>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Question #23 (continued): “What is the ruling on this man who has abandoned the prayer, not out of denying (its legislation) but out of laziness? And what is the<em>daleel </em>(evidence)?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This (man) is one who is rebellious and disobedient (to Allaah), and not a disbeliever. The<em> daleel</em> is that ‘Whoever says <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em>[3] (sincerely) will enter Paradise,’[4] and the <em>daleel</em> is that ‘Allaah has prescribed five prayers upon (His) slaves, so whoever performs them and does them well, and completes their<em>rukoo</em>’ (bowing), <em>sujood </em>(prostration) and <em>khushoo</em>’ (submissive humility and attentiveness), then he has a covenant with Allaah that He will enter him into Paradise, and whoever does not perform them and does not complete their <em>rukoo</em>’,<em>sujood</em> and <em>khushoo</em>’, then he does not have a covenant with Allaah;<strong> If He wills, He will punish him and if He wills, He will forgive him</strong>,’[5] <strong>and if he was a disbeliever, He would not forgive him</strong> because Allaah says: ‘Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills.’”[6]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Imaam Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi&#8217;ee<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of the small treatise titled <b><i>“Hiwaar ma’a Jamaa’at at-Takfeer”</i></b> (A Debate with the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer) by Imaam Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi’ee, may Allaah have mercy on him. The source used for this e-book was the treatise that is found within Imaam Muqbil’s book Fadaa’ih wa Nasaa’ih (pg. 168-186) [Dar-ul-Haramain: 1st Edition; 1999]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this treatise, Imaam Muqbil refutes the false concepts of the Takfeeri Jamaa’at, a group that was founded in Egypt by a man named Shukree Mustafaa, and which later spread to other Muslim countries. Their beliefs revolve around declaring Muslims to be disbelievers, hence the name Jamaa’at at-Takfeer, declaring the leaders infidels and actively calling the people to revolt against the Muslim governments and anyone that supports them. Even though Mustafaa was executed in 1978, the false concepts of his group have still managed to creep into the hearts of many Muslims today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This treatise is especially important, since it deals with the beliefs of those who in recent times call to rebellion, revolution, terrorism and those who seek to spread instability in the Muslim lands as well as throughout the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The best remedy for them is to seek knowledge. As for one of them remaining ignorant and not knowing anything about the Arabic language, and then he says: ‘We are men and the Companions are (also) men’, then yes, you are men and the Companions, too, are men. However, the difference between you and the Companions is like the difference between the heavens and the earth.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Who is it that the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer preys on? They prey on those individuals who have enthusiasm and zeal for their Religion based on ignorance. The founder of the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer, which has appeared during these recent times, was Shukree Mustafaa Al-Misree, who used to be part of the Bankrupt Brotherhood (Ikhwaan-ul-Muslimeen). Then he experienced great trials in prison and was hardened along with a group of individuals. The governments (at that time) strove hard to disunite the Muslims. So this group would call themselves the Jamaa’at-ul-Hijrah (The Party of Withdrawal). This Shukree Mustafaa used to have some knowledge and he would challenge the faculty of the Azhar University to debate with him, but the Azharees would be afraid due to two reasons: <b>First:</b> All that many of them had to offer was a scanty portion of knowledge of Hadeeth and knowledge of the Book and the Sunnah. So they were either only strong in their knowledge of Grammar or their knowledge of Fiqh. <b>Second:</b> They feared that if they beat him, he and his group (Jamaa’at) would come to them at night and kill them. As a result of this, the group grew and spread. So it originated in the Jamaal ‘Abdun-Naasir Prison and then spread to Sudan and to the lands of the Sacred Precincts (Makkah and Madeenah), inconspicuously, and to Yemen, openly. Jamaa’at Ansaar-us-Sunnah rose against them in Sudan after we said that there were some individuals from the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer amongst them. So they feared that people would hear this speech and therefore not support them anymore.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So the one who these Takfeeris prey on is the individual who has lots of zeal for the Religion based on ignorance. I challenge all of them – the Egyptians, Sudanese, Yemenis, Kuwaitis and Algerians among them to bring forth one scholar from amongst them. And they claim that they strive hard to have a scholar amongst their ranks! We seek refuge in Allaah from any scholar agreeing with your Da’wah, for he would then be one of the dogs of the Hellfire on the Day of Judgement, and he would shoot out from the Religion just as an arrow shoots out from the hunted game.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is how Ahlus-Sunnah is, may Allaah preserve them – they are the ones who confront the people of falsehood, such as the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer. Don’t think that I am condoning the other groups, for I consider them to be the product of ignorance and calamities caused by the enemies of Islaam in order to split up the ranks of the Muslims. So I say to the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer: You must repent to Allaah and ask the people of knowledge (when you are unaware of matters), as Allaah says in His Noble Book: <b>‘So ask the People of the Reminder if you don’t know.’</b> [Surah An-Nahl: 43] This is since if you were to ask one of them what’s your proof on raising the hands in prayer, you would find him saying: ‘I don’t know.’ Or if you were to ask him what’s your proof for prostrating on the seven limbs, he would reply: ‘I don’t know.’ But yet after all that, he puts himself in charge of declaring Muslims to be disbelievers! So take things easy, you small ignoramus! How can you put yourself in charge of declaring Muslims to be disbelievers?? By doing this, you would be assisting the Communists, the Ba’athees, the Naasirees and the governments, rather, the enemies of Islaam, in splitting up the ranks of the Muslims. Then you would just dwindle away (and be forgotten) like Shabeeb, Naafi’ bin al-Araq, ‘Imraan bin Hattaan and other heads of the Khawaarij. So the ignorant ones melt way, but the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger remains and continues.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Imaam Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab<br />
SOURCE: His short treatise “Ma’anaa at-Taaghoot wa Ru’oos Anwaa’ihi&#8221;<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know, may Allaah have mercy on you, that the first thing Allaah obligated on the Son of Adam is to reject the Taaghoot and believe in Allaah. The proof for this is Allaah’s saying: <b>“And We have indeed sent to every nation a messenger (saying to his people): ‘Worship Allaah alone and avoid the Taaghoot (false deities).”</b> [Surah An-Nahl: 36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the description of <b>Rejecting the Taaghoot</b>, then it is that you believe in the futility of worshipping other than Allaah, and that you abandon doing so and hate it, and that you reject and make enmity with does who do it. And as for the meaning of <b>Believing in Allaah</b>, then it is that you believe that Allaah is the only true God who deserves to be worshipped alone, apart from everything else besides Him. And it is that you make all types of worship – every act &#8211; sincerely for Allaah alone, while negating and rejecting that from everything else that is worshipped besides Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also entails that you love and show friendship to the people of Ikhlaas (i.e. Islaam), while hating and showing enmity to the people of Shirk. This is the Religion of Ibraaheem, of which those who turn away from it only fool themselves. And this is the good example that Allaah informs us of in His saying: <b>“There has indeed been an excellent example for you in Ibraaheem and those with him, when they said to their people: ‘Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allaah. We have rejected you and there has commenced between us and you, enmity and hatred forever, until you believe in Allaah alone.’” </b>[Surah Al-Mumtahanah: 4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word Taaghoot is general. So everything that is worshipped besides Allaah, while being pleased with this worship – whether it is something worshipped, someone followed, or someone obeyed in the absence of obedience to Allaah and His Messenger, then that is considered Taaghoot. The Tawaagheet (pl. of Taaghoot) are many, but their heads are five:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The First: </b>The Devil who calls the people to worship other than Allaah. The proof for this is Allaah’s saying: <b>“Did I not command you O children of Aadam, that you should not worship the Devil. Verily, he is a plain enemy to you.” </b>[Surah YaaSeen: 60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Second: </b>The tyrannical and oppressive ruler who changes Allaah’s rulings. The proof for this is Allaah’s saying: <b>“Have you not seen those (hypocrites) who claim to believe in that which has been revealed to you, and that which was revealed before you, and they wish to go for judgement (in their disputes) to the Taaghoot, when they have been ordered to reject them? But the Devil wishes to lead them far astray.” </b>[Surah An-Nisaa: 60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Third: </b>The one who judges by other than what Allaah has revealed, and the proof for this is Allaah’s saying: <b>“And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed, then they are the disbelievers.” </b>[Surah Al-Maa’idah: 44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Fourth: </b>The one who claims to have knowledge of the Unseen, apart from Allaah. The proof for this is Allaah’s saying: <b>“He alone is the All-Knower of the Unseen, and He does not disclose His Unseen matters to anyone.” </b>[Surah Al-Jinn: 26-27] And He says: <b>“And with Him lie the keys to the Unseen, no one knows them but He. And He knows whatever there is in the land and in the sea; not a leaf falls except that He knows about it. There is not a grain in the darkness of the earth, nor anything fresh or dry, but that it is written in a Clear Record.” </b>[Surah Al-Ana’aam: 59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Fifth: </b>The one who is worshipped apart from Allaah, while being pleased with being worshipped. The proof for this is Allaah’s saying: <b>“And whoever amongst them says: ‘Verily, I am a God besides Him (Allaah)’, then this person’s recompense will be the Hellfire. That is the way we recompense the wrongdoers.” </b>[Surah Al-Anbiyaa: 29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And know that man will never become a believer in Allaah unless he rejects and disbelieves in the Taaghoot. The proof for this is Allaah’s saying: <b>“There is no compulsion in the Religion. Verily, the right path has become distinct from the wrong path. So whoever disbelieves in the Taaghoot and believes in Allaah, then he has taken hold of the firmest handhold, that will never break. And Allaah is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.” </b>[Surah Al-Baqarah: 256]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <b>“right path”</b> here refers to the Religion of Muhammad (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>), while the <b>“wrong path” </b>refers to the Religion of Abu Jahl. The <b>“firmest handhold” </b>refers to the testimony that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah {<b><i>Laa Ilaaha Illallaah</i></b><i></i>). This testimony consists of a negation and an affirmation. It negates all types of worship from those worshipped besides Allaah, while affirming all types of worship done for Allaah alone, free from any partner.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"><strong>Question</strong>: One of the preachers in one of the mosques in Europe claimed that it is not allowed to consider Jews and Christians disbelievers. You know &#8211; may Allaah preserve you &#8211; that most of the people who attend the mosques in Europe have very little knowledge. We fear that statements like this one will become widespread. Therefore, we request from you a complete and clear answer to this question.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: I say: The statement that came from that man is misguidance. In fact, it can be blasphemy. This is because Allaah has declared that Jews and Christians are disbelievers (kuffaar) in His Book. Allaah has said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And the Jews say, ‘Ezra is the son of Allaah,’ and the Christians say, ‘The Messiah is the son of Allaah.’ This is a saying from their mouths. They imitate the saying of the disbelievers of old. Allaah’s curse be on them, how they are deluded away from the truth. They took their rabbis and their monks as lords besides Allaah and [they also took as Lord] the Messiah, son of Mary. But they were commanded only to worship none but One God. Praise and Glory be to Him, [far above is He] from having the partners they associate with Him.&#8221;</span> [at-Taubah 9:30-31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That shows that they are polytheists who associate partners with Allaah. In other verses, Allaah has made it clear that they are disbelievers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Surely in disbelief are they who say that Allaah is the Messiah, son of Mary.&#8221;</span> [al-Maidah 5:17 and 72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Surely, disbelievers are those who said, ‘Allaah is the third of the three [in a Trinity].&#8221;</span> [al-Maidah 5:73]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Those among the Children of Israel who disbelieved were cursed by the tongue of David and Jesus, son of Mary.&#8221;</span> [al-Maidah 5:87]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Those who disbelieve among the People of the Book and the idolaters will abide in the Fire of Hell.&#8221;</span> [al-Bayyinah 98:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many verses and hadith express the same meaning. The one who rejects the idea that the Jews and the Christians who do not believe in Muhammad [peace be upon him] and deny him are disbelievers is, in fact, denying what Allaah has said. Denying what Allaah has said is blasphemy. <strong>If anyone has any doubt concerning them being disbelievers, then he himself is also a disbeliever.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Glory be to Allaah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How could that man be pleased to say that it is not allowed to say that they are disbelievers when they themselves say that Allaah is one of a Trinity? Their Creator Himself has declared that they are disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How could this man not be pleased to call them disbelievers when they actually say, &#8220;Jesus is the son of God&#8221; or &#8220;the hand of Allaah is tied,&#8221; and &#8220;Allaah is poor and we are rich&#8221;?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How could this man not be pleased to call them disbelievers and apply the word of disbelief (kufr) to them in general when they describe their Lord in such ways that are nothing but cursing and abusing Allaah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I call upon that man to repent to Allaah and to read Allaah’s words, <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;They wish that you should compromise (in religion out of courtesy) with them, so that they (too) would compromise with you.&#8221;</span> [al-Qalam (68):9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He should make it clear to everyone that they are disbelievers and that they are the inhabitants of the Hell-fire. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">&#8220;By the One in whose hand my soul is, no Jew or Christian of this community hears about me &#8211; that is from the community of people from the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him) until the Day of Judgment &#8211; and then does not follow me &#8211; or he said does not believe in what I brought &#8211; except that he is from the inhabitants of the Hell-fire.&#8221;</span> [Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who made such a statement must repent to his Lord because of this great falsehood he has stated. He must make a clear announcement that they are disbelievers and that they are inhabitants of the Hell-fire. He must also announce that it is obligatory upon them to follow the unlettered Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). he is the one that the Jews and the Christians know and they know him like they know their own sons. Allaah has stated,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Those who follow the Messenger, the illiterate Prophet whom they find written about with them in the Torah and the Gospel, he commands what is right and forbids what is evil. He allows them the good things and forbids for them disdainful things. He releases them from their heavy burdens and from the fetters that were upon them. So those who believe in him, honor him, help him, and follow the light which has been sent down with him, it is they who will be successful.&#8221;</span> [al-Araf 7:157]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is the one of whom Jesus, son of Mary (peace be upon him) gave glad tidings. Jesus said, as His Lord states in the Quran,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O Israel, I am the Messenger of Allaah for you confirming the Torah (which came) before me, and giving glad tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name is Ahmad [one of the names of the Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him]. But when he came to them with clear proofs, they said, ‘This is clear magic.’&#8221;</span> [as-Saff 61:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the one, Ahmad, who was promised came to them with clear signs, they said that it was nothing but magic. By this, we can refute those Christians who say that the one Jesus promised was named Ahmad and not Muhammad. We say to that that Allaah said, &#8220;When he came with clear proofs,&#8221; and none has come to you after Jesus except Muhammad (peace be upon him). Muhammad is Ahmad and Allaah inspired Jesus to call Muhammad Ahmad. This is because Ahmad is a name from the root meaning, &#8220;to praise,&#8221; and the name itself means, &#8220;One who praises Allaah more than others.&#8221; Therefore, [Muhammad (peace be upon him)] is the most praiseworthy of Allaah among all peoples&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I further say: If anyone claims that there is a religion on earth other than Islam that is acceptable to Allaah, then the person who made that claim is a disbeliever and there is no doubt about his disbelief. This is because Allaah has said in His Book, <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted from him and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.&#8221;</span> [ali-Imran 3:85]. Allaah has also said, <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Truly, the religion in the sight of Allaah is Islam&#8221;</span> [ali-Imran 3:19]. Another verse states, <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion&#8221;</span> [al-Maida 5:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Based on that &#8211; and I repeat it for a third time &#8211; the person who made that statement [mentioned in the question] must repent to Allaah, Most High. And he must also make it clear to all the people that those Jews and Christians are disbelievers. This is so because the proof has been established against them, they have received the message but they have refused to believe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jews have been described as those who have earned Allaah’s wrath. That is because they knew the truth and chose to go against it. The Christians have been described as those who have gone astray. This is because they sought the truth but were misled from it. Now, all of them have knowledge of the truth and recognize it. However, they go against it. Therefore, they all deserve to have the wrath of Allaah upon them. I call all those Jews and Christians to believe in Allaah and all of His Messengers. I call upon them to follow the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). This is what they have been ordered to do in their own books. Allaah states in the Quran,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;My Mercy embraces all things. That (Mercy) I shall ordain for those who are God-fearing and give zakat, and those who believe in Our revelations. Those who follow the Messenger, the illiterate Prophet whom they find written about with them in the Torah and the Gospel, he commands what is right and forbids what is evil. He allows them the good things and forbids for them disdainful things. He releases them from their heavy burdens and from the fetters that were upon them. So those who believe in him, honor him, help him, and follow the light which has been sent down with him, it is they who will be successful. Say (O Muhammad): O Mankind! Verily, I am sent to all of you as the Messenger of Allaah, to whom belongs the heavens and the earth. There is no true God but He. It is He who gives life and causes death. So believe in Allaah and His Messenger, the unlettered, who believes in Allaah and His Words. And follow him so that you may be guided.&#8221;</span> [al-Araf 7:156-158].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[By having such faith, those converts from Judaism and Christianity] shall receive their reward twice. The Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;There are three people who will receive their rewards twice: A person from the People of the Book [Jews and Christians] who believed in his prophet and believed in Muhammad&#8230;&#8221;</span> [al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have also found in the law book al-Iqna`, in the section on apostasy, where the author has stated,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;One who does not consider as a disbeliever one who follows a religion other than Islam, such as the Christians, or who has doubt about their disbelief or who approves of their way himself is a disbeliever.&#8221; </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he quotes Ibn Taimiya as saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;[The following is] a disbeliever: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Whoever believes that churches are the houses of Allaah in which he He is worshipped or who thinks that what the Jews and Christians do are valid acts of worship of Allaah and obedience to Him and His Messenger, or loves or approves of what they do, or aids them in having such places and establishing their religion, and he does so thinking that is a way of getting closer to Allaah or worshipping Allaah.&#8221; </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>He also stated, </strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;If someone believes that visiting the Jews and the Christians in their places of worship is an act that brings him closer to Allaah, then he is an apostate.&#8221;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These statements support what was stated in the text of the answer. This is a matter concerning which there is no room for doubt. And help is sought only with Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>This question was responded by Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen, Fatawa Islamiya, vol. 1, p. 87, Darussalam publishers</em></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">Shaikhul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said: &#8216;A certain saying may be kufr (disbelief) and so it is declared, unrestrictedly, that the doer is a kafir (disbeliever) and it is said: &#8216;He who says this, then he is a kafir.&#8217; But a particular person who says that is not judged to be a kafir until the proof &#8211; whose denier is a kafir &#8211; is established against him; and this is like the textual threat since Allah says: #&#8221;Verily, those who unjustly eat up the property of orphans, they eat up only fire into their bellies, and they will be burnt in the blazing Fire!&#8221;# [Sura An-Nisa&#8217; 4 :10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this and its like from the textual threats are true, but we do not bear witness that a specific individual will receive that which has been threatened. Therefore, we do not bear witness that any person in particular from the people of the Qiblah will enter the Fire, because that threat may not be carried out on him due to the absence of one of its conditions or the presence of something to prevent it. Perhaps its forbiddance never reached him, and perhaps he will repent from it, or perhaps he has great good deeds sufficient to wipe it out, or perhaps trials befall him which expiate it, or perhaps an acceptable intercessor will intercede on his behalf (on the Day of Resurrection).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, for that who makes the utterances of kufr, it could be possible that the texts which convey the truth did not reach him, or maybe they did, but he did not regard them as authentic or did not understand them. It is also a possibility that he had a doubt for which Allah will excuse him. So if a believer strives to arrive at the truth but makes a mistake, then Allah forgives his mistake whether in matters of belief or action. This is the position of the Companions of the Messenger (sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam) and the great majority of scholars of Islam. [Majmoo` ul-Fatawa (3/345)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Qasimi says, quoting Shaikhul-Islam: &#8216;What is meant is that the position of the scholars is built upon the distinction between the position of action (i.e. it being an action of kufr) and the person in particular (who does the action). Indeed there is no difference reported about this issue from Imam Ahmad or the rest of the scholars of Islam such as: Malik, Abu Hanifah and ash-Shafi`e, that they do not declare the Murji`ah as disbelievers &#8211; those who say that eman (faith) is saying without action, and their texts are replete with the fact that the Khawarij and Qadariyyah and others are not declared to be kafirun (disbelievers).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;When Imam ash-Shafi`e spoke with Hafs al-Fard, one of the heads of the Mu`attilah (deniers of Allah&#8217;s attributes), with regard to the question of the creation or otherwise of the Qur&#8217;an, he (ash-Shafi`e) said to him: &#8216;You have disbelieved in Allah, the Most Great.&#8217; &#8211; declaring him to have done kufr, but he did not judge him to be an apostate because of that. Had he regarded him as an apostate and kafir, he would have hastened to ask for his execution.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;However, a fatwa (religious verdict) was given that the callers to innovation such as Ghulatul-Qadariyya (deniers of pre-destination), al-Ja`d ibn Dirham and Jahm ibn Safwan, the leader of the Jahmiyyah (deniers of Allah&#8217;s names and attributes), and others were to be executed, but people prayed over them and they were buried with Muslims. So their execution was like that of the brigand. This was done in order to put an end to the harm they caused, not due to apostasy, and if they were disbelievers, the Muslims would have treated them as such.&#8217; [Mahasinut-Ta&#8217;wel 5/1313-1314]</p>

<div style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;aala, said about the disbelievers &#8211; those who do not believe in Allaah and the Last Day &#8211; that they are like cattle:</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<blockquote><p>وَلَقَدْ ذَرَأْنَا لِجَهَنَّمَ كَثِيرا ً مِنَ الْجِنِّ وَالإِنسِ لَهُمْ قُلُوب ٌ لاَ يَفْقَهُونَ بِهَا وَلَهُمْ أَعْيُن ٌ لاَ يُبْصِرُونَ بِهَا وَلَهُمْ آذَان ٌ لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ بِهَا أُوْلَائِكَ كَالأَنعَامِ بَلْ هُمْ أَضَلُّ أُوْلَائِكَ هُمُ الْغَافِلُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And surely, We have created many of the jinns and mankind for Hell. They have hearts wherewith they understand not, they have eyes wherewith they see not, and they have ears wherewith they hear not (the truth). They are like cattle, nay even more astray! They are the heedless ones</span>. (Al-A&#8217;raf, ayah 179)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They are like cattle &#8212;-&gt; because they don&#8217;t learn the commands and prohibitions, and they don&#8217;t act upon them.</p>
<p>Rather they are more astray &#8212;&#8211;&gt; Why are they more astray?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- The first question is: Why did Allaah make the disbelievers as the cattle?<br />
2- The second question is: Why did Allaah say: بَلْ هُمْ أَضَلُّ (Rather they are more misguided and astray)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said the disbelievers are like the animals because they don&#8217;t learn Allaah&#8217;s Deen, nor do they implement it. Because the animals don&#8217;t learn. They don&#8217;t read or write or teach (Allaah&#8217;s Religion). They only eat and seek their pleasure.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why are the disbelievers more astray than the animals? &#8212;&#8212;&gt; Because the animals praise Allaah, whereas the disbelievers do not praise Allaah. The animal doesn&#8217;t commit polytheism. As for the disbeliever, he associates partners unto Allaah. For this reason, the disbeliever is more astray than the animal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the individual who is intelligent and has an intelligent mind will know why he is created and will work to fulfill that purpose. So whoever is intelligent, he will be successful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who is the intelligent?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why is the intellect named in the Arabic language as &#8216;<strong>Aql</strong>?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The &#8216;<strong>Aql</strong> is derived from the root word of a rope that is tied.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when one wants to captivate an animal, you tie it so it doesn&#8217;t run away. Because if the animal runs away, it doesn&#8217;t know where to find its own benefit, because it could do good or bad. But when you tie the animal, you make the animal only do good. You only use the animal for what is beneficial. So the human being has a brain, and the animal has a brain. But your brain knows what will benefit you and what will harm you. Hence, you do what will benefit you, and abstain from what will harm you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the one who ties himself down to do good and imprisons himself away from the prohibitions, he is the one who is &#8216;aaqil (has intellect). In the Arabic language, the intellect is also called a Hijr. It is a barrier that stands between an individual and evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, we see that the person of true intellect is the one who deprives himself from what Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic, prohibited. So the true intellectual who does good and leaves evil, he is the one who is Sa&#8217;eed (successful, happy).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the definition of having a true, insightful intellect, the intellect which orders you with good and prohibits you from evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not intended by intellect that a person knows the details of mathematics or he has knowledge of wordly matters that the believers and disbelievers share in. The intent of &#8216;aql (intellect) is the benfecial intellect which would help you stay away from entering the Hellfire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What benefit would it serve a person if had knowledge of business or manufacturing or physics or chemistry, but he worships a cow or a stone or the dead &#8211; instead of worshipping Allaah, The Ever-Living Who does not die?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For this reason, Allaah said in the Qur`an regarding the disbelievers and hypocrites that they don&#8217;t have knowledge nor do they have the ability to analyze something intellectually.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even the disobedient Muslim &#8211; a Muslim who commits disobedience &#8211; needs to rush to repent from his disobedience. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إِنَّمَا التَّوبَةُ عَلَى اللَّهِ لِلَّذِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ السُّوءَ بِجَهَالَة ٍ ثُمَّ يَتُوبُونَ مِنْ قَرِيب ٍ فَأُوْلَائِكَ يَتُوبُ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ عَلِيماً حَكِيما</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah accepts only the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance and foolishness and repent soon afterwards; it is they to whom Allaah will forgive and Allaah is Ever Al­l-Knower, All-Wise</span></em>. (An-Nisa`, ayah 17) Even the Muslim &#8211; when he disobeys Allaah &#8211; he is in a state of ignorance when he is disobeying Allaah. And when he does so, his intellect weakens. So when they commit these acts of disobedience, they do not think of these repercussions of these sins&#8230;</p>
