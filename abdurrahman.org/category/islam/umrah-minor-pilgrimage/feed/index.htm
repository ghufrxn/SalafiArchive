<p><strong>Explanation Based on Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s Tafseer</strong></p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَإِذْ جَعَلْنَا الْبَيْتَ مَثَابَةً لِّلنَّاسِ وَأَمْنًا وَاتَّخِذُوا مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ مُصَلًّى ۖ وَعَهِدْنَا إِلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ أَن طَهِّرَا بَيْتِيَ لِلطَّائِفِينَ وَالْعَاكِفِينَ وَالرُّكَّعِ السُّجُودِ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And (remember) when We made the House </strong>(the Ka&#8217;bah at Makkah)<strong> a place of resort for mankind and a place of safety. And take you (people) the Maqam </strong>(place)<strong> of Ibrahim </strong>(Abraham) [or the stone on which Ibrahim (Abraham) stood while he was building the Ka&#8217;bah]<strong> as a place of prayer</strong> (for some of your prayers, e.g. two Rak&#8217;at after the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;bah at Makkah)<strong>, and We commanded Ibrahim </strong>(Abraham)<strong> and Isma&#8217;il </strong>(Ishmael)<strong> that they should purify My House </strong>(the Ka&#8217;bah at Makkah)<strong> for those who are circumambulating it, or staying </strong>(I&#8217;tikaf)<strong>, or bowing or prostrating themselves </strong>(there, in prayer)<strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">[Qur’aan – Surah al-Baqarah 2:125]</p>
<p><strong>Posted from</strong>: <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/11/17/tafseer-explanation-surah-al-baqarah-dr-saleh-as-saleh/"><strong>Tafseer – Explanation Surah Al-Baqarah</strong></a> – Dr Saleh as Saleh [Audio Series|En]. Explanation Based on Shaykh Uthaymeen’s Tafseer</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>The following has been posted from <em>Tafseer Ibn Katheer</em> (Darussalam English Publications):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Virtue of Allah&#8217;s House</strong></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَإِذْ جَعَلْنَا الْبَيْتَ مَثَابَةً لِّلنَّاسِ وَأَمْناً وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">125. And (remember) when We made the House (the Kabah at Makkah) a place of resort for mankind and a place of safety. And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim (or the stone on which Ibrahim as a place)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Awfi reported that Ibn Abbas commented on Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَإِذْ جَعَلْنَا الْبَيْتَ مَثَابَةً لِّلنَّاسِ</strong><br />
(And (remember) when We made the House (the Kabah at Makkah) a place of resort for mankind)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;They do not remain in the House, they only visit it and return to their homes, and then visit it again.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Abu Jafar Ar-Razi narrated from Ar-Rabi bin Anas from Abu Al-Aliyah who said that,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَإِذْ جَعَلْنَا الْبَيْتَ مَثَابَةً لِّلنَّاسِ وَأَمْناً</strong><br />
(And (remember) when We made the House (the Kabah at Makkah) a place of resort for mankind and a place of safety) means,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Safe from enemies and armed conflict. During the time of Jahiliyyah, the people were often victims of raids and kidnapping, while the people in the area surrounding it (Al-Masjid Al-Haram) were safe and not subject to kidnapping.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Mujahid, Ata&#8217;, As-Suddi, Qatadah and Ar-Rabi bin Anas were reported to have said that the Ayah (2:125) means,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Whoever enters it shall be safe.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah indicates that Allah honored the Sacred House, which Allah made as a safe refuge and safe haven. Therefore, the souls are eager, but never bored, to conduct short visits to the House, even every year. This is because Allah accepted the supplication of His Khalil, Ibrahim, when he asked Allah to make the hearts of people eager to visit the House. Ibrahim said (14:40),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>رَبَّنَا وَتَقَبَّلْ دُعَآءِ</strong><br />
(Our Lord! And accept my invocation).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah described the House as a safe resort and refuge, for those who visit it are safe, even if they had committed acts of evil. This honor comes from the honor of the person who built it first, Khalil Ar-Rahman, just as Allah said,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَإِذْ بَوَّأْنَا لإِبْرَهِيمَ مَكَانَ الْبَيْتِ أَن لاَّ تُشْرِكْ بِى شَيْئاً</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And (remember) when We showed Ibrahim the site of the (Sacred) House (the Kabah at Makkah) (saying): &#8220;Associate not anything (in worship) with Me&#8230;&#8221;) (22:26) and,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِنَّ أَوَّلَ بَيْتٍ وُضِعَ لِلنَّاسِ لَلَّذِى بِبَكَّةَ مُبَارَكاً وَهُدًى لِّلْعَـلَمِينَ فِيهِ ءَايَـتٌ بَيِّـنَـتٌ مَّقَامُ إِبْرَهِيمَ وَمَن دَخَلَهُ كَانَ ءَامِناً</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, the first House (of worship) appointed for mankind was that at Bakkah (Makkah), full of blessing, and a guidance for Al-Alamin (mankind and Jinn). In it are manifest signs (for example), the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim; whosoever enters it, he attains security) (3:96-97).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The last honorable Ayah emphasized the honor of Ibrahim&#8217;s Maqam, and the instruction to pray next to it,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim as a place of prayer). The Maqam of Ibrahim Sufyan Ath-Thawri reported that Said bin Jubayr commented on the Ayah,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim as a place of prayer) &#8220;The stone (Maqam) is the standing place of Ibrahim, Allah&#8217;s Prophet, and a mercy from Allah. Ibrahim stood on the stone, while Ismail was handing him the stones (constructing the Kabah).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Suddi said, &#8220;The Maqam of Ibrahim is a stone which Ismail&#8217;s wife put under Ibrahim&#8217;s feet when washing his head.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Qurtubi mentioned this, but he considered it unauthentic, although others gave it prefrence, Ar-Razi reported it in his Tafsir from Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Qatadah, and Ar-Rabi bin Anas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abi Hatim reported that Jabir, describing the Hajj (pilgrimage) of the Prophet said, &#8220;When the Prophet performed Tawaf, Umar asked him, Is this the Maqam of our father&#8217; He said, Yes.&#8217; Umar said, Should we take it a place of prayer&#8217; So Allah revealed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim (Abraham) as a place of prayer.&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari said, &#8220;Chapter: Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim (Abraham) as a place of prayer) meaning, they return to it repeatedly.&#8221; He then narrated that Anas bin Malik said that Umar bin Al-Khattab said, &#8220;I agreed with my Lord, or my Lord agreed with me, regarding three matters. I said, O Messenger of Allah! I wish you take the Maqam of Ibrahim a place for prayer.&#8217; The Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim (Abraham)) was revealed. I also said, O Messenger of Allah! The righteous and the wicked enter your house. I wish you would command the Mothers of the believers (the Prophet&#8217;s wives) to wear Hijab. Allah sent down the Ayah that required the Hijab. And when I knew that the Prophet was angry with some of his wives, I came to them and said, Either you stop what you are doing, or Allah will endow His Messenger with better women than you are.&#8217; I advised one of his wives and she said to me, O Umar! Does the Messenger of Allah not know how to advise his wives, so that you have to do the job instead of him&#8217; Allah then revealed,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>عَسَى رَبُّهُ إِن طَلَّقَكُنَّ أَن يُبْدِلَهُ أَزْوَجاً خَيْراً مِّنكُنَّ مُسْلِمَـتٍ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#008000;">It may be if he divorced you (all) that his Lord will give him instead of you, wives better than you, ـ Muslims (who submit to Allah)</span>).&#8221; (66:5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Ibn Jarir narrated that Jabir said, &#8220;After the Messenger of Allah kissed the Black Stone, he went around the house three times in a fast pace and four times in a slow pace. He then went to Maqam of Ibrahim, with it between him and the House, and prayed two Rakahs.&#8221; This is part of the long Hadith that Muslim recorded in Sahih. Al-Bukhari recorded that Amr bin Dinar said that he heard Ibn Umar say, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah performed Tawaf around the House seven times and then prayed two Rakahs behind the Maqam.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All these texts indicate that the Maqam is the stone that Ibrahim was standing on while building the House. As the House&#8217;s walls became higher, Ismail brought his father a stone, so that he could stand on it, while Ismail handed him the stones. Ibrahim would place the stones on the wall, and whenever he finished one side, he would move to the next side, to complete the building all around. Ibrahim kept repeating this until he finished building the House, as we will describe when we explain the story of Ibrahim and Ismail and how they built the House, as narrated from Ibn Abbas and collected by Al-Bukhari. Ibrahim&#8217;s footprints were still visible in the stone, and the Arabs knew this fact during the time of Jahiliyyah. This is why Abu Talib said in his poem known as Al-Lamiyyah&#8217;, &#8220;And Ibrahim&#8217;s footprint with his bare feet on the stone is still visible.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslims also saw Ibrahim&#8217;s footprints on the stone, as Anas bin Malik said, &#8220;I saw the Maqam with the print of Ibrahim&#8217;s toes and feet still visible in it, but the footprints dissipated because of the people rubbing the stone with their hands.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Earlier, the Maqam was placed close to the Kabah&#8217;s wall. In the present time, the Maqam is placed next to Al-Hijr on the right side of those entering through the door.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Ibrahim finished building the House, he placed the stone next to the wall of Al-Kabah. Or, when the House was finished being built, Ibrahim just left the stone where it was last standing, and he was commanded to pray next to the stone when he finished the Tawaf (circumambulating). It is understandable that the Maqam of Ibrahim would stand where the building of the House ended. The Leader of the faithful Umar bin Al-Khattab, one of the Four Rightly Guided Caliphs whom we were commanded to emulate, moved the stone away from the Kabah&#8217;s wall during his reign. Umar is one of the two men, whom the Messenger of Allah described when he said,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>«اقْتَدُوا بِاللَّذَيْنِ مِنْ بَعْدِي أَبِي بَكْرٍ وَعُمَر»</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Imitate the two men who will come after me: Abu Bakr and Umar.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar was also the person whom the Qur&#8217;an agreed with regarding praying next to Maqam of Ibrahim. This is why none among the Companions rejected it when he moved it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdur-Razzaq reported from Ibn Jurayj from Ata&#8217;, &#8220;Umar bin Al-Khattab moved the Maqam back.&#8221; Also, Abdur-Razzaq narrated that Mujahid said that Umar was the first person who moved the Maqam back to where it is now standing.&#8221; Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr, Ahmad bin Ali bin Al-Husayn Al-Bayhaqi recorded A&#8217;ishah saying, &#8220;<strong>During the time of the Messenger of Allah and Abu Bakr, the Maqam was right next to the House. Umar moved the Maqam during his reign</strong>.&#8221; This Hadith has an authentic chain of narration.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Part 7 : The Condemnation of the People of Knowledge for this Dome</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that the people of knowledge &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on them &#8211; condemn what has been prohibited by the Sharia&#8217;. Some of them have clearly mentioned their condemnation and some of them -perhaps- have remained silent, since what is known is that there is no advantage to this speech.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps they took into account the permissibility of remaining silent because of the saying of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; to &#8216;Aeysha -radiAllaah anhu:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;If it were not that your people had recently left kufr (disbelief) I would have rebuilt the house (Ka&#8217;ba) on the foundations upon which Ibraheem built it.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Agreed upon by Bukharee and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is understood is that those who openly mentioned their condemnation fulfilled what Allaah had made obligatory upon them, which is advising for the sake of Islaam and the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following are some of those who condemned the building of this dome.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him &#8211; said in his book &#8216;Iqtidaa Siraat ul-Mustaqeem&#8217; :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;…….And this is why, when his apartment was built in the time of the Tabieen (the followers of the Companions) &#8211; I would sacrifice my mother and father for him &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- that<span style="color:#993300;"> they left the top of it as a skylight towards the sky</span>. And it was like that until recent times, with wax placed upon it and rocks on its edges which held it together.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The roof was projecting upwards towards the sky and it was like that at the time the masjid and the mimbar (pulpit) were burnt down in the year six hundred and fifty odd. The fire was so severe in the land of the Hijjaz that it lit up the necks of the camels in Basra. After that came the fitnah (trial) of the Tartars in Baghdad and other Fitn (trials) also came.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Then the Masjid was re-built as it had originally been, as was the roof, and a wooden wall was introduced around the apartment. Then, after a number of years, the dome was erected on the roof whilst there were those who condemned it.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Sanaani &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him &#8211; said in &#8216;Tatheer al-I&#8217;tiqaad&#8217; :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;If you say: This is the grave of the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, a great dome has been built upon it and a lot of money has been spent on it. Then, I say that this is major ignorance of the reality of the situation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Without doubt this dome was not built by the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, nor by his Companions, nor by their successors (Tabieen), nor the followers of the successors, nor the scholars of the Ummah &#8211; the Imaams of his people.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Rather, this dome was imposed on his grave &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; and was built by one of the latter kings of Misr (Eygpt), Qaloon as-Salihee, more well known as king al-Mansoor in the year 678.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He mentioned it in: &#8216;Tahqeeq an-Nasraah bi Talkheehs mu&#8217;aalim Dar al-Hijrah&#8217; and these matters are issued by the governments and not based upon evidences from the text.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">Shaykh Hussain bin Mahdi an-Nuaymi mentions, in his book &#8216;Ma&#8217;arij alAlbaab&#8217;, the statements of some of those who were tried as a result of taking the dome of the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; as sanction for the permissibility of building all domes. A Mufti states, &#8216;From what is well known is that the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; had a dome, just like the &#8216;Aawliya of Madeenah and the &#8216;Aawliya of the rest of the different cities. Building domes is the fashion in every era; it is believed that having a dome is the cause of receiving blessings.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nuaymi &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him &#8211; commented by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;I say: if this is the case, then what about the fact that the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, warned against this, he cautioned and cleared his blessed and pure self &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam from what you did. You did exactly what he specifically prohibited. Was it not sufficient for you that you opposed his command? This (alone) is evidence against yourselves. You were forward in the presence of the Messenger (ie his statement). Did he &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – allude to any of what you hold permissible? Was he pleased with that or did he not prohibit this? As for your belief of blessings descending, then this is from yourselves and not from Allaah, and Allaah has refuted you.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Ikhwaan &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on them &#8211; entered Madeenah at the time of AbdulAzeez &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him -, it was of great importance to them to remove the dome. If only they had done so, but they &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on them &#8211; feared that the fitnah from the <strong>Qubooreeyeen</strong> (the sect of grave-worshippers) would be greater than removing the dome i.e. that removing an evil might lead to something more evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look how many false arguments the Qubooreeyeen have when they are called to remove these domes, some of which are similar to al-Laat, Uzza and Habil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance. &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</p>

<p><strong>Transcription of the Audio:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillah hir Rahman nir Raheem. Alhamdulillahi Rabbil Aalameen wa sallalaahu ala nabeeyena Muhammad wa alaa alihi wa sahbhi wa sallama tasleeman kaseera</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Second Question is why was the Ka&#8217;abah called Baytullah Al Haraam, The inviolable house of Allah ?.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Ka&#8217;bah was called Baytullah i.e The House of Allah. That is because it is the place of magnification of Allah(عز و جل) Most Mighty and Most Majestic.People come to it from all places in order to offer an obligation which Allah had ordained upon them and also because people direct themselves in its direction while in their prayers, wherever they may be fulfilling one of the conditions of the Salah i.e. directing one self towards the Qibla.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) stated in Surah Al- Baqarah (2:144) :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">قَدۡ نَرَىٰ تَقَلُّبَ وَجۡهِكَ فِى ٱلسَّمَآءِ‌ۖ فَلَنُوَلِّيَنَّكَ قِبۡلَةً۬ تَرۡضَٮٰهَا‌ۚ فَوَلِّ وَجۡهَكَ شَطۡرَ ٱلۡمَسۡجِدِ ٱلۡحَرَامِ‌ۚ وَحَيۡثُ مَا كُنتُمۡ فَوَلُّواْ وُجُوهَكُمۡ شَطۡرَهُ ۥ‌ۗ وَإِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلۡكِتَـٰبَ لَيَعۡلَمُونَ أَنَّهُ ٱلۡحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّهِمۡ‌ۗ وَمَا ٱللَّهُ بِغَـٰفِلٍ عَمَّا يَعۡمَلُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Verily! We have seen the turning of your (Muhammad&#8217;s صلى الله عليه وسلم) face towards the heaven. Surely, We shall turn you to a Qiblah (prayer direction) that shall please you, so turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid- Al-Harâm (at Makkah). And wheresoever you people are, turn your faces (in prayer) in that direction. Certainly, the people who were given the Scriptures (i.e. Jews and the Christians) know well that, that (your turning towards the direction of the Ka&#8217;bah at Makkah in prayers) is the truth from their Lord. And Allâh is not unaware of what they do.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) narrated it to Himself added it when he mentioned the Ka&#8217;abah as an honour and magnification of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is because that which is related to Allah in the construct of the statements by Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) is divided into two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) The Attribute of Himself (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى)<br />
2) The creature of  his creation</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it is an attribute, then it is related because it is established with Him and Allah(عز و جل) is qualified by it, it is His attribute like Allah&#8217;s hearing, Allah&#8217;s sight, Allah&#8217;s knowledge, Allah&#8217;s ability, Allah&#8217;s speech and other than that from His most mighty and magnificent attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it s a creature from his creation, then it is added to Allah (عز و جل) in the construct as away of honouring and magnification and in this way Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى)  related the Ka&#8217;abah to Himself when He said in Surah Al Hajj (22:26):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَطَهِّرۡ بَيۡتِىَ لِلطَّآٮِٕفِينَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">And (remember) when We showed Ibrahim (Abraham) the site of the (Sacred) House (the Ka&#8217;bah at Makkah) (saying): &#8220;Associate not anything (in worship) with Me, [La ilaha ill-Allah (none has the right to be worshipped but Allah Islamic Monotheism], and sanctify <span style="color:#ff0000;">My House</span> for those who circumambulate it, and those who stand up for prayer, and those who bow (submit themselves with humility and obedience to Allah), and make prostration (in prayer, etc.);&#8221; )</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He said &#8216;My House&#8217; (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى). He narrated it it to Himself in the construct of the verse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also He added to Himself the masaajid (the Mosques) as He said in Surah Al Baqarah (2:114):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ومن اظلم ممن منع مساجد الله ان يذكر فيها اسمه وسعى في خرابها اولئك ما كان لهم ان يدخلوها الا خائفين لهم في الدنيا خزي ولهم في الاخرة عذاب عظيم</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And who is more unjust than those who forbid Allah&#8217;s Name be glorified and mentioned much (i.e. prayers and invocations, etc.) in <span style="color:#ff0000;">Allah&#8217;s Mosques</span> and strive for their ruin? It was not fitting that such should themselves enter them (Allah&#8217;s Mosques) except in fear. For them there is disgrace in this world, and they will have a great torment in the Hereafter.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You see that now, Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) added the mosques in the  construct to Himself in the relation &#8216; &#8216;Allah&#8217;s Mosques&#8221; and also  (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) He may do the same regarding some of his creatures in order to make clear His comprehensive possession as in His statement  (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) in Surah Al Jasiya (45:13):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;وسخر لكم ما في السماوات وما في الارض جميعا منه ان في ذلك لايات لقوم يتفكرون&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And has subjected to you all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth; it is all as a favour and kindness from Him. Verily, in it are signs for a people who think deeply.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore  in summary  Allah  (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) referred the Ka&#8217;abah to Himself as an honour and magnification and no one should think that Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) reffered the ka&#8217;abah to Himself because it is &#8220;a place in which He resides&#8221;. This is impossible because (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) encompasses everything and nothing from his creatures encompass Him, rather His Kursee(سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) encompasses the Heavens and the Earth, as Allah Stated in Surah Al Baqarah (2:255) that his Kursee extends over the Heavens and the Earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in Surah Zumar (39:67):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وما قدروا الله حق قدره والارض جميعا قبضته يوم القيامة والسماوات مطويات بيمينه سبحان</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And on the Day of Resurrection the whole of the earth will be grasped by His Hand and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He is above His heavens ascended the throne in the most majestic way that befits Him and it&#8217;s not possible that He ( سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) dwells in any of his creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allah knows the best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Maajah -rahimahullaah- reported in his &#8220;Sunan&#8221; [The Book of the Rites of Hajj: chapter (5): The Virtue of the Supplication of the person performing Hajj: (no.2893)]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Muhammad ibn Tareef narrated to us, saying: `Imraan ibn `Uyainah narrated to us: from `Ataa· ibn as-Saa·ib: from Mujaahid: from Ibn `Umar: from the Prophet sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam, that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The fighter in Allaah’s cause, and the person performing Hajj, and the person performing `Umrah are Allaah’s deputation: He called them, and they responded to Him; and they ask of Him, and He gives to them</strong></span>&gt;&gt;.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaanee -rahimahullaah- said: &#8220;Hasan&#8221;; and he said in &#8220;as-Saheehah&#8221; (no.1820), having quoted a supporting narration reported by al-Bazzaar (no.1153) as a hadeeth of Jaabir: &#8220;The hadeeth, when the two chains of narration are gathered is &#8220;Hasan&#8221;.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Imaam Ibn Maajah -rahimahullaah- reported (no.2895): &#8220;Aboo Bakr ibn Abee Shaybah narrated to us, saying: Yazeed ibn Haaroon narrated to us: from `Abdul-Malik ibn Abee Sulaymaan: from Abuz-Zubayr: from Safwaan ibn `Abdillaah ibn Safwaan, who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I was married to a daughter of Abud-Dardaa·, so he came to her and he found Ummud-Dardaa·, but he did not find Abud-Dardaa·. So she said to him: &#8220;Do you intend to perform Hajj this year?&#8221; He said: &#8220;Yes.&#8221; She said: &#8220;Then supplicate to Allaah for good for us, since the Prophet sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The supplication which a person makes for his brother in his absence is responded to.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise and thanks are to Allah, the Lord of the worlds, and I send prayers and blessings on our Prophet, Muhammad and upon all his family and Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>How Should a Person Pray in an Airplane?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 . He should offer the voluntary prayers in an airplane while he is sitting in his seat in whatever direction the airplane was facing, indicating the bowing and prostrating (by inclining his head), making the prostration lower than the bowing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. He should not offer the obligatory prayers in an airplane, unless he is able to face towards the Qiblah throughout the whole of the prayer and he is also able to bow, prostrate, stand and sit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. If he is unable to do that, he should delay the prayer until he lands at the airport and then pray on the ground. If he fears that the time for the prayer will expire before the airplane lands, he should delay it until the time of the next prayer. This is the case if it is one of those prayers that may be combined with another, such as Zuhr with &#8216;Asr or Maghrib with &#8216;Isha&#8217;. If he fears that the time for the next prayer will expire, he should pray them both in the airplane before the time ends and perform whatever conditions, pillars and obligations of the prayer he is able to. For example: If the airplane took off just before sunset and the sun set while he was in the air, then he should not offer the Maghrib prayer until the airplane lands at the airport, he disembarks, and then prays on the ground. But if he fears that the time for offering the Maghrib prayer will expire, he should delay it until the time of &#8216;Isha&#8217; and offer them both together, combining them and delaying the Maghrib prayer until the time of the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer after he descends. But if he fears that the time for the isha prayer will expire &#8211; and it expires at midnight &#8211; he should offer them before the time expires in the airplane.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The manner of performing the obligatory prayer in the airplane is to stand facing the Qiblah and make the Takbir. Then he recites Sural Al-Fatihah and the words which it is prescribed to recite before it, such as the opening supplication (Du&#8217;a Al- Istiftah) and some Qur&#8217;anic Verses after it. Then he should bow, then straighten up from bowing, and relax in a standing position, then prostrate, then straighten up from prostration, and relax in a sitting position, then prostrate again, then do likewise in the remainder of the prayer. If he is unable to prostrate, he should sit and indicate the prostration while sitting, and if he does not know the Qiblah, and no one reliable can inform him of it, he should use his judgement and try to ascertain it, then pray according to his judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. The prayer of the traveller in an airplane is shortened, so he performs the four Rak&#8217;ah prayer as two Rak&#8217;ahs like other travellers.</p>

<p>1 . He should perform Ghusl in his house and remain in his normal clothing, or if he wishes, he may don the garments of Ihram.</p>
<p>2. Once the airplane is close to passing over the starting point, he should don the garments of Ihram, if he has not done so already.</p>
<p>3. When the airplane passes over the starting point, he should make the intention for commencing the rites and say the Talbiyyah according to his intention either Hajj or &#8216;Umrah.</p>
<p>4. If he assumes Ihram before passing over the starting point as a precaution, being fearful of remissness or forgetfulness, then there is no objection.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Advice for those about to perform Hajj</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Fourthly.</b> And be very careful not <strong>to walk directly in front of anyone praying in the Haraam </strong>mosque, not to speak of other mosques and prying places as the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“If the one walking between the hands of one praying knew what were upon him then it would be better for him to stand still for forty (…) than that he should walk between his hands.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Maalik, al-Bukhaaree, Muslim, the 4 Sunan of Abu Juhaim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is a general text covering everyone walking in front, and everyone praying – and there is no authentic Hadith to make any exception for the one doing so in the Haraam Masjid – and you should pray therein like any other place towards a sutrah – according to the general nature of the Hadith regarding that – and there are also some narrations from the Companions particularly about the Masjid-ul-Haraam – which I have mentioned in ‘The Original’.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Chapter 11: <strong>Shaving the Head<br />
<a title="Lessons of Creed Acquired From The Hajj – By ‘AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-Badr" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2012/10/06/lessons-of-creed-acquired-from-the-hajj-by-abdurrazzaq-bin-abdul-muhsin-al-badr/">Lessons of Creed Acquired From The Hajj<br />
</a>By  Shaykh AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The actions of the day of an-Nahr, the tenth day of the month of Dhul-Hijjah, are indeed four well-known actions which are the stoning, the slaughter, shaving the head and then the Tawaaf. The discussion here will be about shaving the head or shortening the hair as worship for Allaah in obedience to Him and seeking closeness to Him on this great day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaving is completely removing the hair of the head while shortening is lessening the hair of the head all over. Shaving or shortening the hair is one of the obligations of Hajj and Umrah, it is not permissible to leave it, and the evidence is the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Certainly, you shall enter masjid al-Haram; if Allaah wills, secure, (some) having your heads shaved, and (some) having your head hair cut short, having no fear</strong></span>&gt;&gt; [Fath : 27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qadaamah –Rahimullaah- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘If it was not from the rites of Hajj, Allaah would not have described them this way.’</strong> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Bukhari and Muslim from the hadeeth of Ibn Abbas –RadhiAllaahu anhu- who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘When the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- came to Makkah he ordered his Companions to make Tawaaf of the House and of Safa and Marwa, then to come out of Ihraam and shave or shorten their hair.’</strong> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, it is one of the obligations of Hajj and Umrah. So whoever does not shave or shorten their hair, then it is necessary to atone for this by slaughtering a sacrificial animal. It (i.e. shaving/shortening) is a sign that the time period for Ihraam has ended and it imitates the actions of the Messenger &#8211; alayhi as-sallat wa sallam- where he shaved his head and ordered his Companions to shave their heads, casting aside their impurities and removing dishevelled hair. Shaving the head is the act of humbly placing the forehead in front of its Lord, due to His greatness, and in submission due to His Honour and it is from the most intense forms of Uboodiyah (worship) for Allaah Azza Wa Jal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when the Muslims performs this great act of obedience and important worship in reverence of Allaah and in imitation of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- it is obligatory upon him to <strong>know that shaving the head or shortening the hair is done to worship and seek closeness to Allaah and that it is not permissible to perform it for anyone other than Allaah –subhanahu wa Ta’ala</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great Imaam, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaykh-ul-Islaam ibn Taymeeyah -Rahimullaah–</strong></span> was asked about a people who shave their heads at the command of their shaykhs at such graves as they glorify while regarding it as a means seeking closeness to Allaah and worship: is all of this a Sunnah or a Bida? Is shaving the head, generally, a Sunnah or Bida?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He –Rahimullaah- replied: <strong>‘Shaving the head is of four types</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>One of them is shaving the head in Hajj and Umrah</strong></span> and this is from what Allaah and His Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- have ordered. It is legislated and ordered in the Book, the Sunnah and the consensus of the Ummah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#008000;">Certainly, you shall enter masjid al-Haram; if Allaah wills, secure, (some) having your heads shaved, and (some) having your head hair cut short, having no fear</span></strong>&gt;&gt; [Fath : 27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are multiple narrations on the authority of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallamthat he shaved his head in his Hajj and Umrah as did his Companions. From them were those who shaved their heads and some who shortened their hair. Shaving is better than shortening because <strong style="line-height:1.5;">the Prophet said: ‘O Allaah forgive those who shave their heads.’ The people said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and those who shorten their hair?’ He said ‘O Allaah forgive those who shave their heads.’ The people said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and those who shorten their hair?’ He said ‘O Allaah forgive those who shave their heads.’ The people said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and those who shorten their hair?’ He said: ‘And those who shorten their hair.’</strong><span style="line-height:1.5;"> [3]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the farewell Hajj he -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- commanded the Companions who had brought a sacrificial animal with them to shorten their hair if they had performed Tawaaf of the House and had walked between Safa and Marwa for Umrah and then to shave their heads once they had completed the Hajj. So (in this way) he combined for them, firstly, shortening their hair and, secondly, shaving their heads.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The second type of shaving the head</strong> </span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">is for a need</span>, such as shaving the head for treatment</strong>. This is also permissible according to the Book, the Sunnah and the consensus of the scholars. Indeed Allaah has permitted the Muhrim (pilgrim), for whom it is not usually allowed to have his head shaved until completion of the Hajj rites, to shave his head if he is suffering as Allaah Ta’ala mentions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>and do not shave your heads until the Hady (sacrificial animal) reaches the place of sacrifice. And whosoever of you is ill or has an ailment in his scalp (necessitating shaving), he must pay a Fidyah (ransom) of either observing Saum (fasts) (three days) or giving Sadaqah (charity &#8211; feeding six poor persons) or offering sacrifice (one sheep)</strong> </span>&gt;&gt; [Baqarah :196]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What has been established by agreement of the Muslims is the hadeeth of Ka’b bin Ujraah that when the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- passed by him in the Umrah of Al-Hudaybiyah lice were falling from his head, so the Prophet said to him: ‘Are your lice harming you?’ K’ab replied: ‘Yes.’ So the Prophet said: ‘Shave your head and sacrifice a sheep, or fast three days or feed a group of six needy people.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The authenticity of this Hadeeth is agreed upon and has been received with acceptance by all the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The third type of shaving the head is that which is done for worship, religion and Zuhd (abstention from loving worldly things) in other than Hajj or Umrah</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, some of the people command the one who repents, once he has repented to shave his head. Similar is the one who shaves the head as a sign of being from the people of rituals and religion or as a sign of the perfection of Zuhd and worship or as a sign that the one who shaves is better, more religious or has more Zuhd than the one who does not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there are those who adhere to certain shaykhs such that if they repent, they shave their heads or they cut some of his hair. So the shaykh specifies who should have the scissors and prayer rug so he can pray on that rug (and not with the Muslims). His cutting hair from the heads of the people is from the complete authority befitting him and someone who is imitated in order to make the people repent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So all of this is Bida’ which has neither been commanded by Allaah, nor by His Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</strong>. It is not obligatory nor has it been recommended by any one scholar of the Deen. Not one of the Companions did this, nor did any of those who followed the companions in goodness, neither the scholars of the Muslims who were well known for Zuhd and worship nor the Companions, the successors or those who came after them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There were those who accepted Islam at the time of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- but he never used to order them to shave their heads if they entered Islaam nor did he cut anyone’s hair. He didn’t pray on a rug but, rather, he used to pray as an Imaam with all the Muslims. He used to pray on what they used to pray, sit where they used to sit and he never used to make himself distinct from them by sitting on something special, whether a prayer rug or anything else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever takes this Bida’ -which is not obligatory or even recommended- as a means of seeking closeness and obedience or as a path to Allaah making it a completion of the Deen or orders the repentant to do it, both the Zahid (the one who abstains from loving worldly things) and the worshipper, then he is a misguided person outside the path of ar-Rahmaan (Allaah the Most Merciful), following the footsteps of the Shayateen.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Shaykh ul-Islaam –Rahimullaah- mentioned <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>the fourth type of shaving the head</strong></span> which is shaving the head as other than a ritual or for other than a need, neither seeking closeness to Allaah nor seeking to be religious. He mentions that the people of knowledge have two opinions regarding this, which are two narrations attributed to Imaam Ahmad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first is that it is disliked and this is the Madhab of Maalik and others. The second is that it is permissible and this is well known amongst the companions of Abu Haneefa and ash-Shafi&#8217;ee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Imaam Ahmad mentions the evidence that the scholars use for each of these sayings. [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim</strong> mentions a similar division to what has preceded in his book &#8216;Zaad al-Ma&#8217;ad&#8217;. He mentions that from the different types of shaving the head there is one that is Shirk and one that is Bida’. <strong>Shirk being the one shaving his head for other than Allaah –Subhaanhu- such as those who follow shaykhs and who shave their heads for their shaykhs</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of them will say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;I have shaved my head for so-and-so and you have shaved your head for soand-so.’ This is the same as saying: ‘I have done Sadjah (prostration) for so- and-so,’ because shaving the head is done with humility, in worship and with submissiveness and it is done for the completion of Hajj.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he mentions that the misguided shaykhs deceive their followers by causing them to shave their heads for them, just as they mislead them into prostrating to them. [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this is clear Shirk and a great lie, we ask Allaah for security.</p>

<p><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Question</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Does &#8216;Umrah in the month of Ramadan satisfy for the obligation of Hajj due to the Messenger&#8217;s (صلى الله عليه وسلم) statement, &#8220;<strong>Whoever performs ‘Umrah in Ramadan is like the one who makes Hajj with me</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Shaykh Abdul- Azeez Bin Baaz:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umrah in Ramadan does not compensate for Hajj. However, it has the merit/virtue of Hajj due to his (صلى الله عليه وسلم) statement, &#8216;<strong>Umrah in Ramadan equals a Hajj&#8217;</strong> or he said &#8216;<strong>a Hajj with me</strong>&#8216;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means in regards to merit and reward and it does not mean it is equivalent to it and replaces it such that he does not have to perform Hajj. No, rather he still must perform the Hajj, the Hajj of Islam (the obligatory Hajj) even if he makes &#8216;Umrah in Ramadan according to all of the scholars. Thus, with &#8216;Umrah in Ramadan, the merit of Hajj is attained from the aspect of reward and excellence, but it does not compensate for the Hajj of Islam.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Q: <span style="color:#993300;">Does performing ‘Umrah (lesser pilgrimage) during the months of Hajj have any particular virtue different from performing it in other months?  </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The best month to perform ‘Umrah is during Ramadan, for the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> ‘Umrah (performed) in Ramadan is equal to Hajj (in reward). <span style="color:#808080;">[1]</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Agreed upon its authenticity by Imams Al-Bukhari and Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to another narration by Al-Bukhari:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is equivalent to performing Hajj with me.<span style="color:#808080;"> [2]</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to the narration by Muslim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is equivalent to Hajj or Hajj performed with me (in reward). <span style="color:#808080;">[3]</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that it is equivalent to Hajj or (indicative of uncertainty on the part of the Hadith narrator) equivalent to Hajj performed with the Prophet (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, comes the <strong>‘Umrah in Dhul-Qa‘dah</strong>, for all the ‘Umrahs which the Prophet (peace be upon him) performed took place in Dhul-Qa‘dah. Allah (Glorified be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Indeed in the Messenger of Allâh (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) you have a good example to follow <span style="color:#808080;"> [4]</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>May Allah grant us success!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Q. 405. If a traveller arrives in Makkah and he is fasting, should he break his fast in order to gain strength to perform &#8216;Umrah?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. We say that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) entered Makkah on the twentieth of Ramadan in the year of the conquest of Makkah and he was not fasting, and he led the people of Makkah in a two Rak&#8217;ah prayer and he said to them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Oh, people of Makkah! Complete the prayer (i.e. pray four Rak&#8217;ahs), for we are travellers</strong></span>.&#8221; [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been confirmed in Sahih Al-Bukhari that the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) did not fast for the remainder of the month, because he was a traveller, so the journey of a person performing &#8216;Umrah does not end with his arrival in Makkah, and he is not obliged to fast if he arrives while not fasting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Some people might continue to fast even while they are travelling, thinking that to fast while travelling in the present day is not difficult for people. So, they will continue fasting even while travelling, then they arrive in Makkah and feel tired, and so they say to themselves: Should I continue my fast and delay the &#8216;Umrah until after I have broken my fast, or should I break my fast in order to perform the &#8216;Umrah immediately upon arrival in Makkah. We would say to them in these circumstances: It is better for you to break your fast in order to perform &#8216;Umrah immediately upon arrival in Makkah, in order to perform this rite. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Because when the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) entered Makkah and he was performing his religious rites, he would go straight to the Masjid, even making his camel kneel outside the Masjid, entering it in order to perform the rites, for he was so preoccupied with it. Therefore, for those who perform &#8216;Umrah, breaking your fast in order to perform &#8216;Umrah briskly is better than remaining in a state of fasting, then performing your &#8216;Umrah after you have broken your fast at night.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is confirmed from the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) that he was fasting on his journey to the battle for the conquest of Makkah, and the people came to him and said: &#8220;Oh, Messenger of Allah! Fasting has become difficult for the people and they are waiting to see what you will do.&#8221; And this was after &#8216;Asr, but the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) called for water and drank it while the people were watching. [2] So, the Prophet broke his fast during his journey, indeed, he broke his fast at the end of the day, and all of this was in order to make it clear to his people that this was permissible. Fasting while travelling, as some do, in spite of difficulty, contradicts the Sunnah; of this there is no doubt. To this applies the statement of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>It is not righteousness to fast while on a journey.</strong></span> &#8221; [3]</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Translated and transcribed by: Aboo Bilal Nahim ibn Abd al Majid حفظه الله<br />
Video Courtesy: Brother Bilal Nahim<br />
<strong>Audio Source</strong>: <a href="http://urdu-islamic-audio.com/2015/05/28/my-umrah-selfie/" target="_blank">http://urdu-islamic-audio.com/2015/05/28/my-umrah-selfie/</a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Below is the Transcription of the above Video</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The question of the brother is that in these days a new <em>Fitnah</em> (trial) has begun.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> <strong>THE TAKING OF SELFIE PHOTOS</strong> &#8211; <strong>Allah’s aid is sought</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The strange thing is that you see this in the Haram, people standing in front of the Ka’bah taking selfies, behind them is the Ka’bah and they are taking photographs.  My brother, taking photographs is Haraam (forbidden).</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>This Haraam (forbidden act), outside of this House (of Allah) is also Haraam.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Its prohibition inside (of this Masjid) is increased even more!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>In front of the House of Allah its prohibition is increased even more!</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For what reason have these people come here? To show the world that I have come here to perform Umrah and here is my evidence for it! Then were has their intention gone!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you came for the pleasure of Allah, then why is there a need to announce to the world where you are?  Then they post it upon Facebook:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>“Look, I also went to Makkah.  Here is the proof, look the Ka’bah is behind me.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>إنا لله وإنا إليه راجعون</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>To Allah we belong and to Him we shall return.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So fear Allah and save yourself from this Fitnah… and a mobile phone is a mobile phone.  Some people have turned it in to, I don’t know what.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For some people within it, they have songs, music, movies a camera.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>HARAAM UPON HARAAM!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How many Muharamaat (forbidden things) are you carrying in your pocket!!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> <strong>So, FEAR ALLAH!!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Keep it within the limits of being a mobile phone.  Use it in a good manner for good (permissible) things.  But, since when has that taking of photographs been regard as making good use of it?</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Using it for something that is Haraam!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah has given you the ability, by Allah millions wish for the opportunity to visit the House of Allah.  In the world, millions of individuals, I swear by Allah. But, do they have the ability?  No they don’t have the ability. They don’t get the opportunity to come to the House of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>They die with this desire!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>And you come here having the pleasure of performing Umrah and you are taking <u>SELFIES</u>!!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Behind you walk’s a sister or someone’s mother and they too become a part of this selfie.  Do you have no shame!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nor do you have any shame with regards to the House of Allah and no shame with regards to the sister or daughter and neither any shame of yourself.  So for this reason this is a fitnah and it is not permissible, may Allah reward you with barakah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Dr Murtaza (حفظه الله تعالى) then explains the prohibition to our Moroccan brother (حفظه الله تعالى) who was present (in the Urdu lecture) to take opportunity to sit in a gathering where the remembrance of Allah was taking place).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from <a href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2014/09/02/sahih-bukhari-book-030/">Virtues of Madinah of Sahih Bukhari</a></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Medina is a sanctuary from that place to that.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Its trees should not be cut.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">No heresy should be innovated nor any sin should be committed in it.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Whoever innovates in it an heresy or commits a sin, or gives shelter to such an innovator in it will incur the curse of Allah,the angels, and all the people, none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet peace be upon him said, “I have made Medina a sanctuary between its two (Harrat) mountains.”</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Allah’s Apostle , peace be upon him, “Verily, Belief returns and goes back to Medina as a snake returns and goes back to its hole (when in danger).”</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">“None plots against the people of Medina but that he will be dissolved (destroyed) like the salt is dissolved in water.”</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">“The terror caused by Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal will not enter Medina and at that time Medina will have seven gates and there will be two angels at each gate guarding them.”</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">“There are angels guarding the entrances (or roads) of Medina, neither plague nor Ad-Dajjal will be able to enter it.”</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">“There will be no town which Ad-Dajjal will not enter except Mecca and Medina, and there will be no entrance (road) (of both Mecca and Medina) but the angels will be standing in rows guarding it against him, and then Medina will shake with its inhabitants thrice (i.e. three earth-quakes will take place) and Allah will expel all the nonbelievers and the hypocrites from it.”</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">“Medina is like a furnace, it expels out the impurities (bad persons) and selects the good ones and makes them perfect.”</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">“Medina expels the bad persons from it, as fire expels the impurities of iron.”</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet , peace be upon him, said, “O Allah! Bestow on Medina twice the blessings You bestowed on Mecca.”</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet , peace be upon him, said, “There is a garden from the gardens of Paradise between my house and my pulpit, and my pulpit is on my Lake Fount (Al-Kauthar).”</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Umar ,radhi Allaahu anhu,said, “O Allah! Grant me martyrdom in Your cause, and let my death be in the city of Your Apostle.”</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>Lessons of Creed Acquired From the Hajj<br />
</strong>By ‘AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-Badr<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Chapter Seven</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Kissing the Black Stone and Touching the<em>Yemeni</em> Corner [1]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What preceded was a discussion of the excellence of <em>Tawaaf</em> of the House of Allaah <em>al-Haraam</em>, the great act of worship and important act of obedience which is a pillar from the pillars of <em>Hajj</em> and <em>Umrah</em> and that it is prescribed for this one place only, as Allaah<em>Ta’ala</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَلۡيَطَّوَّفُواْ بِٱلۡبَيۡتِ ٱلۡعَتِيقِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; and circumambulate the Ancient House (the <em>Ka’ba</em> at Makkah). &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">[Hajj: 29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So it is not permissible to make <em>Tawaaf</em> of domes, graves, tombs or other things; since these matters clash with the principles of the <em>Sharia’</em> and they oppose the reality of<em>Tawheed</em>, because it involves associating and equating the created with The Creator <em>-Subhanahu</em>.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The discussion of a part of this issue, with a brief explanation, has already preceded.  As for what we will discuss here, by Allaah’s permission, regarding another lesson and benefit for the Muslim is what happens when he reaches the House of Allaah <em>al-Haraam</em>to perform <em>Tawaaf</em> of it.  It is legislated at this place to kiss the black stone and touch the <em>Yemeni</em> corner in obedience to Allaah and in imitation of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>. There are very many proofs which explain the legality of it and show that the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> did this when he came to the House of Allaah <em>al-Haraam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been narrated by Bukhari and Muslim on the authority of Abdullaah bin Umar bin al-Khattab <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> who said : <strong>‘I saw the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> when he came to Makkah.  He touched the black corner (the black stone) at the beginning of his <em>Tawaaf</em> and he would jog the first three of the seven circuits</strong>.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Muslim in the hadeeth of Jaabir bin AbdAllaah, who said that: <strong>‘When the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> came to Makkah he entered the <em>Masjid</em> and touched the stone, he then began from the right hand side.  He jogged for three circuits and walked for four………..’</strong>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, the Muslims also kiss the stone imitating the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, following his guidance and adhering to his Sunnah; rejecting any belief that the Black Stone could bring benefit or harm or give or withhold.  This is why the <em>Ameer ul-Mumineen</em>, Umar bin al-Khattaab <em>-RadiAllaahu anhu- </em>said, as he kissed the Black stone:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Indeed I  know that you are a stone and you cannot cause benefit or harm.  If it were not that I saw the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>kiss you, I would not have kissed you.’</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhari and  Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jareer at-Tabaree <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Verily, Umar said this because the people had newly entered Islaam after having left the worship of idols.  So Umar feared that some of the ignorant people would take the act of touching of the stone to signify glorification of stones or rocks as had been the practice of previous Arabs in times of ignorance.  Umar intended to teach the people that he only touched this stone imitating the action of the Messenger of Allaah, not because the stone itself caused harm or benefit, which they had previously believed about their idols.’</strong>[4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for what has been narrated in the hadeeth of Abu Saeed that Alee, when Umar said this, responded by saying. ‘Indeed it does harm and benefit’ and went on to mention how Allaah took covenants from the sons of Aadam and they were written upon parchement which were devoured by the stone.  He continued, ‘I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘The black Stone will be brought on the Day of Judgment, it will have a tongue and it will testify for those upon <em>Tawheed</em> who touched it.’</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, this narration is not established from the Ameer ul-Mumineen, Alee bin Abu Taalib.  Hafidh Ibn Hajr said in Fath ul-Bari: ‘In its chain is Abu Haroon al-Abdee and he is very weak.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Haroon, the narrator of this narration is <em>Matrook</em> Hadeeth (his narrations are not accepted) according to the people of knowledge, some even call him a liar! an-Nisaee mentions that he is ‘<em>Matrook al-Hadeeth’</em>.  Hamaad Ibn Zayd said ‘Abu Haroon al-Abdee is a liar, in the morning he says one thing and  in the evening another!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al Jawzajani said of him ‘a slandering liar’ and Ibn Hibban said of him ‘I used to narrate from Abu Saeed that which was not narrated by him. It is not permissible to write his hadeeth except from the standpoint of amazement!!’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how can anyone support this narration if this, according to the people of knowledge, is the state of the narrator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus what is prescribed is kissing of the Black stone only and if you cannot do so then touching it.  If it is not possible to kiss or touch it then pointing to it is sufficient.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also legislated to touch the <em>Yemeni</em> corner, as found in the two authentic books.  On the authority of Abdullaah bin Umar bin al-Khattaab <em>–RadiAllaahu anhu-</em>  ‘I did not see the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> touch any part of the House except the two <em>Yemeni</em> corners.’[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This clarifies that it is not legislated to touch any part of the House other than the two<em>Yemeni</em> corners, namely the Black stone and the <em>Yemeni</em> corner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah said: ‘No corners other than the two <em>Yemeni</em> corners are to be touched and not the <em>Shami</em> corners.  The Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> specifically touched them because they are from the foundations laid by Ibraheem whilst the other corners are from inside the House.  Thus the Black stone is touched and kissed and the <em>Yemeni</em> corner is touched but not kissed.  The remaining two corners are not touched or kissed. <em>Al-Istislaam</em> is to touch with the hand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the remaining parts of the House and the Station of Ibraheem, the entire<em>masjid</em> and its walls, graves of Prophets and righteous people, such as the house of our Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, the cave of Ibraheem, the place in which our Prophet used to pray in and other places such as the graves of the Prophets and the righteous people and the stone in Bait al-Maqdis, then none of these are to be touched or kissed and the Imaams are all in agreement on this.’[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are great lessons and benefits which the Muslim derives from the fact that touching and kissing is only legislated at the above-mentioned specific place.  The evidence does not allow these acts to be performed at other than these two places.  Thus the Muslim does this in obedience to Allaah and imitating His Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.  The Muslim does not believe that in doing this (i.e. touching/kissing) he will receive any benefit or ward off any harm, as in the preceding explanation of the <em>Ameer ul-Mumineen</em>, Umar bin Khattab, where he kissed the Black stone and said as much in front of the people in order to teach and guide them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As previous texts have illustrated, touching or kissing the walls of the <em>Ka’ba</em> at other than the <em>Yemeni</em> corners or the Black stone is not from the Sunnah.  The texts show that touching or kissing the station of Ibraheem is, likewise, not from the Sunnah as nothing regarding this has been narrated from the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it (i.e. touching/kissing) is not permissible with the <em>Ka’bah</em> itself -whose sacredness over all other <em>Masajid</em> and places is well-known- then it is not permissible at the Station of Ibraeem, about which Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَٱتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبۡرَٰهِ&#x200d;ۧمَ مُصَلّٗىۖ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; And take the <em>Maqaam </em>(place) of Ibraheem [or the stone on which Ibraheem stood while he was building the Ka&#8217;bah] as a place of prayer&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">[al-Baqarah : 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though it is known that there is the Station of Ibraheem in Shaam, and other places, along with the other places of the Prophets lesser than this one, Allaah has only ordered us to take this particular, one station as a place of prayer.  Yet even so, we are not allowed to touch it or kiss it, as there is no evidence to sanction such an action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Know! That the rest of places cannot be made places of prayer nor can you touch or kiss any of them.  In fact there is no one thing on the face of this earth other than the Black stone that it has been made allowed to kiss.[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those ignorant people -who encourage one another to gather around shrines and tombs etc- they kiss, rub and touch them.  They seek blessings from them and request their help and aid.  All of this has nothing at all to do with the <em>Deen</em>.  On the contrary, it is clear misguidance and a great lie.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah said: ‘As for touching/rubbing a grave, regardless of whose it is, kissing it or placing one’s cheek upon it then this is prohibited by the consensus of the Muslims, even if they were the graves of the Prophets.  Neither anyone from the Salaf of this <em>Ummah</em> nor from the Imaams did it, rather this is from<em>Shirk</em>.’[10]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>Lessons of Creed Acquired From the Hajj<br />
</strong>By ‘AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-Badr<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Chapter Six</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tawwaf of the House of Allaah al-Haraam</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed from the great lessons that benefits the pilgrim is when he reaches the Ancient House and carries out that great act of worship which is: <em>Tawwaf</em> of the House of Allaah<em>al-Haraam</em>.  He sees all those pilgrims performing <em>Tawwaf</em> in obedience to Allaah and fulfilling His command.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What benefits him in this situation is that which is well-known; the important state and noble value of this worship and the great intensity with which it enters the hearts of the believers.  This is especially so when the large masses of believers are all dressed in one type of clothing and are of uniform appearance, circling the House of Allaah, saying: ‘SubhanAllaah, La illaah ill Allaah and Allaahu Akbar’ (Far is Allaah from imperfection, There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah and Allaah is the Greatest), supplicating to their Noble Lord, beseeching Him for success, asking of Him and turning to Him in prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every single one of them is making a <em>Tawwaf</em> of seven circuits, all of them beginning at the black stone and ending at it and this is what the <em>Tawwaf</em> is: going around the <em>Ka’ba</em>seven times with the intention of <em>Tawwaf</em>, in worship of Allaah, starting with the black stone and ending at it, with the <em>Ka’ba</em> on their left hand side.  The Muslims do this in obedience to Allaah and in imitation of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, and, for each person, the level of perfection for this act of worship is the equivalent to how much he followed the Noble Messenger<em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Tawwaf</em> is the first action a Muslim does when he reaches Makkah.  It is narrated by Bukhari and Muslim on the authority of ‘Ayesha <em>-radiAllaah anha &#8211;</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed the first action the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> performed when he reached Makkah was that he made <em>Wudhoo</em>, then he made the <em>Tawwaf</em>.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been narrated by Muslim in his authentic book on the authority of Jaabir ibn Abdullaah <em>&#8211; radiAllaah anhu – </em>who described the <em>Hajj</em> of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘…until we came to the House with the Prophet, where he touched the corner (black stone), then briskly walked the first three circuits and calmly walked four circuits.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has also been narrated by Bukhari and Muslim from the Hadeeth of Ibn Umar <em>&#8211; radiAllaah anhu-</em> ‘that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> if he made<em>Tawwaf</em> in the <em>Hajj</em> or <em>Umrah</em>, the first thing he would begin with was walking briskly for three circuits and walking the remaining four normally.  Then, he prostrated twice (i.e. he prayed two <em>rakahs</em>) and, next, walked between as-Safa and al-Marwah.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The evidences in the Book and the Sunnah showing the legislation of <em>Tawwaf </em>of the House of Allaah <em>al-Haraam</em> are numerous and there are multiple narrations from the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>. </em> This is proof that this action brings one closer to Allaah and it is obedience from Allaah’s slaves that He loves.  He has legislated it for them and commanded them with it, urged them to carry it out and made it a rite from the rites whereby His House <em>al-Haraam</em> is intended as He said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَأَذِّن فِي ٱلنَّاسِ بِٱلۡحَجِّ يَأۡتُوكَ رِجَالٗا وَعَلَىٰ كُلِّ ضَامِرٖ يَأۡتِينَ مِن كُلِّ فَجٍّ عَمِيقٖ ٢٧ لِّيَشۡهَدُواْ<br />
مَنَٰفِعَ لَهُمۡ وَيَذۡكُرُواْ ٱسۡمَ ٱللَّهِ فِيٓ أَيَّامٖ مَّعۡلُومَٰتٍ عَلَىٰ مَا رَزَقَهُم مِّنۢ بَهِيمَةِ ٱلۡأَنۡعَٰمِۖ فَكُلُواْ مِنۡهَا<br />
وَأَطۡعِمُواْ ٱلۡبَآئِسَ ٱلۡفَقِيرَ ٢٨ ثُمَّ لۡيَقۡضُواْ تَفَثَهُمۡ وَلۡيُوفُواْ نُذُورَهُمۡ وَلۡيَطَّوَّفُواْ بِٱلۡبَيۡتِ ٱلۡعَتِيقِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And proclaim to mankind the <em>Hajj</em>.  They will come to you on foot and on every lean camel, they will come from every deep and distant mountain highway (to perform<em>Hajj</em>).  That they may witness things that are of benefit to them and mention the Name of Allaah on the appointed days, over the livestock animals that He has provided for them.  Then eat thereof and feed therewith the poor having a hard time.  Then let them complete their prescribed duties and perform their vows, and circumambulate the Ancient House.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Hajj: 27-29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Allaah appointed His Prophet and friend, Ibraheem, along with his son Ismaeel, the Prophet of Allaah –<em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam</em>, to sanctify the House, build its foundations and prepare it for those who would perform <em>Tawwaf</em>, stand up for prayer, make <em>Rukoo</em> and make <em>Sujood</em>, Allaah says :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَعَهِدۡنَآ إِلَىٰٓ إِبۡرَٰهِ&#x200d;ۧمَ وَإِسۡمَٰعِيلَ أَن طَهِّرَا بَيۡتِيَ لِلطَّآئِفِينَ وَٱلۡعَٰكِفِينَ وَٱلرُّكَّعِ ٱلسُّجُودِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;and We commanded Ibraheem and Isma’eel that they should purify My House (the Ka’bahat Makkah) for those who are circumbulating it, staying (in it i.e. in <em>I’tikâf</em>), bowing or prostrating themselves (there, in prayer) &gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah : 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَإِذۡ بَوَّأۡنَا لِإِبۡرَٰهِيمَ مَكَانَ ٱلۡبَيۡتِ أَن لَّا تُشۡرِكۡ بِي شَيۡ&#x200d;ٔٗا وَطَهِّرۡ بَيۡتِيَ لِلطَّآئِفِينَ وَٱلۡقَآئِمِينَ وَٱلرُّكَّعِ ٱلسُّجُودِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;And (remember) when We showed Ibraheem the site of the (Sacred) House (the Ka’bah at Makkah) (saying): “Associate not anything (in worship) with Me, and sanctify My House for those who circumambulate it, those who stand up for prayer, and those who bow and prostrate (in prayer)”&gt;&gt;[Hajj: 26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It becomes clear from what has preceded that <em>Tawwaf</em> of the Ancient House is a noble act of worship and great act of obedience that Allaah loves from His slaves.  He has legislated it and ordained it for them.  He has prepared a great reward and many gains for those performing the <em>Tawwaf</em>.  <em>Tawwaf</em> of the House is a pillar from the pillars of<em>Hajj</em>, just as it is also a pillar from the pillars of <em>Umrah</em>.  This shows the great importance and high status of the <em>Tawwaf</em> with Allaah; since neither the <em>Hajj</em> nor the<em>Umrah</em> can be complete without it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, in this great act, the Muslim learns great lessons and attains significant benefits, which is that this significant act of worship – by which I mean the <em>Tawwaf</em> – was legislated for this place alone, around the House of Allaah <em>al-Haraam</em>, as preceding texts from the Book and Sunnah have shown and there are many other texts as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this, the Muslim comes to know that making <em>Tawwaf</em> in any place of the world other than this place is not legislated and there is nothing that proves its legislation.  Rather it is misguidance and false to make the houses of the creation equal with the House of the Creator; that place that He <em>-Subhanahu-</em> commanded to be established for His remembrance, obedience and to be faced in His <em>-Subhanahu-</em> worship.  There is no difference amongst the people of knowledge regarding the futility of making <em>Tawwaf</em>in any area or location other than the House of Allaah <em>al-Haraam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it  is not permissible to make <em>Tawwaf</em> around domed shrines or graves, nor around tombs, trees, stones or anything else, and there are many, many narrations from the people of knowledge regarding this.  Perhaps, if time allows, I will mention some of their statements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam an-Nawawee <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said in his book ‘al-Majmoo Sharh al-Muhadhib’: ‘and it is not permissible to make <em>Tawwaaf</em> of his grave <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continues after mentioning some points: ‘A person should not be deceived by many of the common people performing this <em>Tawwaf</em> because following the Sunnah and performing an action is only done by following the <em>Ahaadeeth</em> and the sayings of the scholars; no attention is paid to the innovations and ignorance of the common people or other then them.  It is affirmed in the two authentic books on the authority of ‘Ayesha <em>-RadiAllaah anha</em>: that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211;<em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>said<em>:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever innovates in this matter of ours that which is not from it then it is rejected.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in the narration of Muslim :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever does an action that we have not commanded then it will be rejected.’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And on the authority of Abu Huraira <em>&#8211; radiAllaah anhu &#8211;</em> who said that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Do not frequent my grave, and send prayers upon me, as your prayers reach me from wherever you are.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Aboo Dawood with an authentic chain,[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fudayl bin ‘Ayaad <em>-Rahimullaah-</em>  said the meaning of which is : ‘Follow the paths of guidance and you will not be harmed due to being a small number of followers.  Beware of the paths of misguidance and do not be deceived by the large number of ruined ones.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whosoever thinks that wiping his hands on graves and shrines, and other things similar to this, is more effective for receipt of blessings then this is from his ignorance and negligence; because receiving blessings can only be by way of that which is in accordance with the <em>Sharia’</em>, and how can good be achieved by opposing that which is correct.’[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said :  ‘And Indeed the Muslims are agreed that it is not legislated to make the <em>Tawaaf</em> except of <em>Bait-ul-Mamoor</em>.  It is not allowed to make <em>Tawaaf</em> of the rock of Bait ul-Maqdis, nor of the Prophet’s house <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, nor of the dome which is in the mountain of ‘Arafat, nor in any other place.’[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said : ‘There is no place on earth like the <em>Ka’ba</em> where you can make <em>Tawaaf</em>.  Whoever believes that making <em>Tawaaf</em> of other than the <em>Ka’ba</em> is legislated, then that is a worse evil than the one who believes that it is permissible to pray facing other than the <em>Ka’ba</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and the Muslims prayed facing Bait ul- Maqdis for eighteen months when he first migrated from Makkah to Madina.  That was the <em>Qiblah</em> of the Muslims for that period, then Allaah changed the<em>Qiblah</em> to the <em>Ka’ba</em> and revealed this in the Qur’aan as is mentioned in Sooratul Baqaraah.  The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and the Muslims prayed towards the <em>Ka’ba</em> and so it became a <em>Qiblah</em>.  It is the <em>Qiblah</em> of Ibraheem and other than him, from the Prophets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever today takes the rock as a <em>Qiblah</em> and prays facing it then he is a disbeliever, an apostate and he is made to repent- so he either repents or he is killed.  This is even though it used to be a <em>Qiblah</em> but has since been abrogated.  So what is the condition of one who takes it as a place for <em>Tawaaf</em>, just as one would make <em>Tawaaf</em>of the <em>Ka’ba</em>?  Making <em>Tawaaf</em> of other than the <em>Ka’ba</em> has not been legislated by Allaah in any way whatsoever……….’[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, with this research mentioned by Imaam an-Nawawee, Shaykh-ul- Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah and other then them from amongst the people of knowledge, the severe evil and danger of making <em>Tawaaf</em> of any place other than the House of Allaah<em>al-Haraam</em>&#8211; which Allaah gave permission to make <em>Tawaaf</em> around- becomes clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As far as what some of the ignorant people do where they make <em>Tawaaf</em> around graves, domes, shrines or anything else like this, then none of this is from the <em>Deen</em> of Allaah; rather it is from the whisperings of the Shaytaan and the legislation of Iblees; if it is not, then where is it to be found in the Book and the Sunnah: ‘make <em>Tawaaf</em> of the grave of so-and-so’ or of the tomb of so-and-so’, or things of this nature?  Allaah is The Most High above what they describe and He is far from the imperfection of what they associate with Him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Lessons of Creed Acquired From the Hajj<br />
</strong>By ‘AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-Badr </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Chapter Five</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>An Explanation of a Number of Benefits Gained From The <em>Talbiyaah</em></strong><strong><em><strong>[1]</strong></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the words in the proclamation relate to a very important matter and have a profound explanation.  We previously discussed the proof for the words of the<em>Talbiyaah</em> containing the implementation of <em>Tawheed</em> and the rejection of <em>Shirk</em>.  There is no doubt that these are great words which comprise important meanings with distinguished aims and many benefits.  The people of knowledge have pointed out the great significance of these words and the magnitude of what they comprise, of benefits and gains.  The Imaam and great scholar Ibn al-Qayyim mentioned a complete section, giving an extended explanation and discussion of this, in his book ‘Tahdeeb as-Sunnan’.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘And indeed the words in the <em>Talbiyaah</em> consist of great principles and magnificent benefits…’  and he mentioned twenty one benefits.  Here I will summarise a number of these magnificent benefits extracted from the <em>Talbiyaah</em> and from what Ibn al-Qayyim mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from these benefits is:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Your saying: ‘Labbayk’ (here I am).  This includes the response to your supplication by The One supplicated to and the response to your call by The One called upon.  It is not correct linguistically or intellectually that you call someone who does not speak or that you supplicate to someone who cannot answer you, so in this is the affirmation of the attribute of Allaah’s Speech.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>That the <em>Talbiyaah</em> includes love.  ‘Labbayk’ (here I am) is not said except to The One who is loved and glorified.  This is why it is said of its meaning: ‘I am directing myself towards You with what You love’, and it is said: a woman is beloved. i.e. beloved to her son.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>That the <em>Talbiyaah</em> comprises an adherence to a continuous (<em>al-Uboodiyah</em>) worship, so this is why it is said: the <em>Talbiyaah</em> is taken from the word <em>al-Iqamah</em> (establishment), i.e.: I am established on Your obedience.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>It includes humility and submissiveness, i.e. humility and more humility, in what they say: I am responding here in front of You, i.e. with humbleness and submissiveness.</li>
<li>It comprises <em>al-Ikhlaas</em> (sincerity), that is, it is said: the <em>Talbiyaah</em> is taken from the word <em>al-Lubb</em> (the core) and it is something pure.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the benefits of the <em>Talbiyaah</em> are that:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>It comprises an affirmation that Allaah, The Lord, hears; since it is impossible that a man will say ‘Labbayk’ (here I am) to someone who will not hear his supplication.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>It includes coming closer to Allaah, since it is said: that the <em>Talbiyaah</em> is taken from the word <em>al-ilbaab</em> (establishing) and that is seeking nearness.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>The <em>Talbiyaah</em> is used as a distinction between moving from one state to another and from one rite to another in <em>Ihraam</em>, just as the <em>Takbeer</em> (saying<em>Allaahu Ak</em><em>bar</em>) in the prayer is a cause for moving from one pillar of the prayer to another.  This is why it is the Sunnah to say the <em>Talbiyaah</em> up until the start of the <em>Tawaaf</em> at which point you break off from the <em>Talbiyaah</em>.  Then (after that), the pilgrim again begins to say the <em>Talbiyaah</em> until he stands at ‘Arafat, then he breaks off the <em>Talbiyaah</em>.  The pilgrim then resumes the <em>Talbiyaah</em> until he stands at Muzdalifah then he breaks off from it.  Then he makes the<em>Talbiyaah</em> until he stones the <em>Jamaraatul-‘Aqabah</em> (the Large Pillar) then he stops making <em>Talbiyaah</em>.  Therefore, the <em>Talbiyaah</em> is a sign of <em>Hajj</em> and a (sign of) change in the actions of its rites.  So, when the pilgrim moves from one action to another action he says: ‘Labbayk Allaahumma Labbayk’, just as the one praying says ‘<em>Allaahu Ak</em><em>bar</em>’ when he moves from one act to another.  So, when he completes his rites, he breaks off from the <em>Talbiyaah</em>, just as the one praying says the <em>Tasleem</em> (saying salaams at the end of the prayer) which cuts him off from his <em>Takbeer</em>.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>The <em>Talbiyaah</em> is a sign of <em>Tawheed</em> and the creed of Ibraheem – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam</em>, which is the spirit of <em>Hajj</em> and its purpose.  On the contrary, it is the spirit of all acts of worship and its purpose.  This is why the <em>Talbiyaah</em> is the key to this act of worship, wherewith a person enters into the <em>Hajj</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From its benefits is that it contains the key to Paradise and the door of Islaam whereby Paradise and Islaam are entered. It is also the statement of <em>al-Ikhlaas</em> and the testification for Allaah that He has no partners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the benefits of the <em>Talbiyaah</em> is that it includes the fact that all praise (<em>al-Hamd</em>) is for Allaah, which is the most beloved thing whereby a slave comes closer to Allaah.  It is the first thing that the people of Paradise will call with and ‘<em>al-Hamd</em>’ is the opening and completion of the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From its benefits is that it comprises the acknowledgement that all blessings belong to Allaah and this is why the word <em>an-Ni’ma</em> (الـنعـم) (the blessing) is in the definite form, meaning that it includes everything i.e. that all blessings are for You [O Allaah ] and You are The Lord of blessings and the One who gives blessings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From its (benefits); the <em>Talbiyaah</em> includes the acknowledgement that all the dominion belongs to Allaah Alone, thus there is, in actuality, no dominion for anyone other than Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from its benefits: The <em>Talbiyaah</em> includes a notification of the combination of <em>al-Mulk </em>(the dominion), <em>an-Ni’mah </em>(the blessings) and al-Hamd (the praise) and that all of these are for Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em>.  This is another type of praise for Allaah which is different to the praise which results from (only) one of any of these three, High attributes.  So combining the dominion, which constitutes capability, with the blessing- which constitutes the height of benefiting, doing good and mercy-, and the praise – which constitutes a general sublimity and honour which leads to loving Allaah- then this is a different type of praise and in it is a greatness and perfection and a glory which is better suited to Allaah and befitting for Him <em>–Subhanahu</em>.  So, when a slave  remembers Him and knows about his Lord then his heart is attracted to Allaah and turns towards Him, facing Him, professing all love for Him with that which is the reason for <em>al-Uboodiyaah</em> (worship) and its core.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From its benefits: the Prophet said, ‘The best thing which I and the Prophets before me have said is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَه،ُ لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْد،ُ وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaahu wahdahu la shareeka lahu, lahul mulku wa lahul hamdu wa huwa ala kulli shayin qadeer’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">(There is none worthy of worship except Allaah Alone, He has no partner, He has the Dominion and for Him is the praise and He has the capability over everything.)’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>Talbiyaah</em> consists of these words exactly and they include the same meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from the benefits: That the words in the <em>Talbiyaah</em> contain a refutation of everyone who negates Allaah’s Attributes and His <em>Tawheed</em>.  So the <em>Talbiyaah</em> nullifies the statements of the <em>Mushrikeen</em> however diverse their sects and statements. The<em>Talbiyaah</em> nullifies the statements of the philosophers and whoever is affected by them, from amongst those who nullify Allaah’s Attributes connected to <em>al-Hamd</em> (all praise).  The <em>Talbiyaah</em> ends the sayings of the <em>Qadireeyah</em>,  who are called the <em>Majoos</em> (fire-worshippers) of this <em>Ummah</em>, those who separate the actions of His slaves- from amongst the Angels, <em>Jinn</em> and mankind- from the dominion of The Lord and His capability.  They do not affirm that Allaah has power over them, nor do they make Him the Creator of this power over them.</p>
<blockquote><p>So, whoever comes to know the meaning of  the <em>Talbiyaah</em>, testifies to them and truly believes in them, then he will be unlike all the sects of the Muattilah (those who nullify the attributes of Allaah.)</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, from the benefits of the <em>Talbiyaah</em> is that repetition of the testification (<em>Shahaada</em>) in Allaah, ‘that He has no partner’, has a benefit which is that Allaah has informed him of the fact that He has no partner after the response to: ‘labbayk’ (Here I am), then he repeats it again after saying: ‘innal hamda wan-ni’mata laka wal mulka-la shareeka lak’ (Verily all praise is for You, and every bounty is from You, and all dominion is Yours – You have no partner.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This section of the <em>Talbiyaah</em> consists of the fact that Allaah has no partner in praise, blessing or dominion whereas the first part consists of the fact that Allaah has no partner in His response to this call (i.e. the <em>Talbiyaah</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is similar to the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">شَهِدَ ٱللَّهُ أَنَّهُۥ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ وَٱلۡمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ وَأُوْلُواْ ٱلۡعِلۡمِ قَآئِمَۢا بِٱلۡقِسۡطِۚ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ ٱلۡعَزِيزُ ٱلۡحَكِيمُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Allah bears witness that <em>Lâ ilâha illa Huwa</em> (none has the right to be worshipped but He), and the Angels, and those having knowledge (also give this witness); (He is always) maintaining His creation in Justice. <em>Lâ ilâh illa Huwa</em> (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the All-Mighty, the All-Wise. &gt;&gt; [al-Imraan: 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At the beginning of this Ayaah Allaah tells us that there is none worthy of worship in truth except Him, which is incorporated into His testimony (<em>la ilaha ill Allaah</em>) along with the testimony of the Angels and the people of knowledge, this is what has been attested to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah informs us that He maintains with justice and that He is just, then repeats the testification that there is none worthy of worship in truth except Him along with His maintainingeverything with justice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are just a number of great benefits and the precious harvest acquired from this distinguished statement, the <em>Talbiyaah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These benefits, without doubt, indicate the importance of concern for understanding the meaning of this statement and that if the slave of Allaah has correct concern for it then this will help him to perform this worship in the best and most correct way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>Lessons of Creed Acquired From the Hajj<br />
</strong>By ‘AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-Badr<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Chapter Four</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>From the Guidance of the </strong><strong>Proclamation</strong><strong> is Warning Against <em>Shirk</em></strong><strong><em><strong>[1]</strong></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What has preceded is the explanation of the excellence of the proclamation (<em>Talbiyaah</em>) and that it comprises the proclamation of Allaah’s Tawheed and the rejection of <em>Shirk</em>.  This is why the great Companion Jabir bin Abdullaah <em>-radiAllaah anhu-</em> mentioned the<em>Hajj</em> of the Prophet as is described in Saheeh Muslim by saying: ‘Then he made the proclamation with <em>Tawheed</em>, Here I am O Allaah, here I am, You have no partner, here I am, Verily all praise is for You, and every bounty is from You, and all dominion is Yours – You have no partner.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he <em>-radiAllaah anhu-</em> described this statement as a proclamation with <em>Tawheed</em>; because in it is sincerity for Allaah and the rejection of <em>Shirk</em>.  This also shows us that these words, by which I mean the words of the <em>Talbiyaah</em>, are not mere words which do not suggest any meaning, but rather they have a great meaning and a deep significance and it is none other than the spirit of this <em>Deen</em>, its foundation and the origin upon which the Tawheed of Allaah Ta’ala is built.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is indeed an obligation on everyone who proclaims these great words that he brings to mind what these words suggest, from their meanings.  Also, that one knows what they contain of evidence; so that one can be truthful in  one’s proclamation and so that, due to this, one’s speech can be in conformity with the reality of one’s situation, whereby one can hold on to <em>Tawheed</em>, preserving it, observing its rights, keeping away completely from that which cancels out <em>Tawheed</em> and that which opposes it from <em>Shirk</em> and setting up equals unto Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So do not ask, except from Allaah, and aid is not sought except from Allaah and do not rely, except upon Allaah, do not request aid, help or victory except from Allaah and do not direct any aspect of worship except to Allaah Alone, He in Whose Hand is bestowing and withholding, taking and (giving openly), benefit and harm.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">أَمَّن يُجِيبُ ٱلۡمُضۡطَرَّ إِذَا دَعَاهُ وَيَكۡشِفُ ٱلسُّوٓءَ وَيَجۡعَلُكُمۡ خُلَفَآءَ ٱلۡأَرۡضِۗ أَءِلَٰهٞ مَّعَ ٱللَّهِۚ قَلِيلٗا مَّا تَذَكَّرُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; Is not He (better than your gods) Who responds to the distressed one, when he calls Him and Who removes the evil and makes you inheritors of the earth, generation after generation.  Is there any god with Allaah? Little is it that you remember! &gt;&gt;[al-Naml : 62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Muslim says in his proclamation : ‘You have no partner’ then it is obligatory upon him to have knowledge about the reality of <em>Shirk</em>, recognising its danger, and being completely wary of falling into it or any of its causes, means and ways; since it is the greatest of sins by which Allaah is disobeyed.  Due to this, the punishments that are levelled for <em>Shirk</em> in this world and the Hereafter are not the same as those levelled for any other sin, by which the blood and wealth of the people become lawful and their women and children become prisoners, such that there is no forgiveness for a person for his sins except by repenting from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala says :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَغۡفِرُ أَن يُشۡرَكَ بِهِۦ وَيَغۡفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَآءُۚ وَمَن يُشۡرِكۡ بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدِ ٱفۡتَرَىٰٓ إِثۡمًا عَظِيمًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; Verily, Allaah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him in worship, but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He pleases, and whoever sets up partners with Allaah in worship, he has indeed invented a tremendous sin.&gt;&gt; [Nisa:48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He says :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَغۡفِرُ أَن يُشۡرَكَ بِهِۦ وَيَغۡفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَآءُۚ وَمَن يُشۡرِكۡ بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدۡ ضَلَّ ضَلَٰلَۢا بَعِيدًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; Verily! Allaah forgives not (the sin of) setting up partners in worship with Him, but He forgives whom He pleases sins other than that, and whoever sets up partners in worship with Allaah, has indeed strayed far away. &gt;&gt;[Nisa:116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also says :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">إِنَّهُۥ مَن يُشۡرِكۡ بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدۡ حَرَّمَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيۡهِ ٱلۡجَنَّةَ وَمَأۡوَىٰهُ ٱلنَّارُۖ وَمَا لِلظَّٰلِمِينَ مِنۡ أَنصَارٖ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;  Verily, whosoever sets up partners in worship with Allaah, then Allaah has forbidden Paradise for him and the Fire will be his abode.  And for the <em>Zalimoon</em>(polytheists and wrong­doers) there are no helpers.&gt;&gt; [Maida:72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَلَقَدۡ أُوحِيَ إِلَيۡكَ وَإِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبۡلِكَ لَئِنۡ أَشۡرَكۡتَ لَيَحۡبَطَنَّ عَمَلُكَ وَلَتَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلۡخَٰسِرِينَ ٦٥ بَلِ<br />
ٱللَّهَ فَٱعۡبُدۡ وَكُن مِّنَ ٱلشَّٰكِرِينَ ٦٦</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;And indeed it has been revealed to you as it was to those (Allaah’s Messengers) before you: ‘If you join others in worship with Allaah, (then) surely (all) your deeds will be in vain, and you will certainly be among the losers.’ Nay! But worship Allaah (Alone and none else), and be among the grateful. &gt;&gt; [az-Zumar: 65-66]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are very many <em>Ayaat</em> with these meanings in the Noble Qur’aan.  Allaah warns His slaves against committing <em>Shirk</em> with Him and He explains to them the extreme danger of Shirk, the magnitude of its foolishness and the evil consequence, in this world and the Hereafter, for the one who does it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the consequence of <em>Shirk</em> is evil, its result is grievous, its danger is immense and the one who commits it does not benefit anything after it except failure, deprivation, degradation and loss.  It is the greatest of sins by which Allaah is disobeyed, because it is the most oppressive of oppressions; since its meanings contain a belittling of the Lord of the worlds, diverting His absolute Right to someone else and equating someone else with Him.  This is because the one committing <em>Shirk</em> is contradicting the purpose of creation and Allaah’s command, negating it from every angle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shirk</em> is the height of opposition to the Lord of  the worlds and it is to be too arrogant to have obedience and humility for Him, because <em>Shirk</em> is to liken the creation to the Creator, the Most High and the Holy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can a person put someone else in the position of worship – one who does not possess the ability to harm or to bring about benefit, nor possesses death, nor life, nor can he resurrect the dead, let alone other than himself, – and liken (him) to The One Who owns all of the creation and the dominion, in Whose Hands is all good and all matters and to Whom all matters return?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whatever He wills exists and whatever He does not will does not exist.  There is none to prevent what He gives and there is none to give what He prevents. He Who, if He opens up mercy for the people there is none to hold it back and whatever He withholds, then there is none that can send it after Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, the obligation on every Muslim is that he warns most sternly against <em>Shirk</em> and that he is extremely wary of falling into it. We have the Prophet of Allaah and His friend Ibraheem <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> saying in his supplication:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَٱجۡنُبۡنِي وَبَنِيَّ أَن نَّعۡبُدَ ٱلۡأَصۡنَامَ ٣٥ رَبِّ إِنَّهُنَّ أَضۡلَلۡنَ كَثِيرٗا مِّنَ ٱلنَّاسِۖ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; And keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols. O my Lord! They have indeed led astray many among mankind. &gt;&gt; [Ibraheem: 35-36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Ibraheem <em>–alayhis Salaam- </em>feared this and supplicated to his Lord that He protect him and his offspring from worshipping idols.  So, if Ibraheem <em>al-Khaleel</em> <em>–alayhis Salaam-</em> used to ask Allaah to keep him and his offspring away from worshipping idols, then what do you think about anyone other than him?  As Ibraheem at-Taymee <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said : ‘Who can feel safe from trial after Ibraheem ?’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that the heart which is alive and fearful of <em>Shirk</em> is extremely wary of it and is continuously and ceaselessly asking Allaah to be excepted from falling into it.  This then requires that the believing slave must be knowledgeable about the reality of<em>Shirk</em> and its causes, its principles and its various types; so as not to fall into it.  This is why Hudayfah bin al-Yaman <em>-radiAllaah anhu-</em> said : ‘The people used to ask the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> about  good, but I used to ask him about evil fearing that I would fall into it.’  Narrated by Bukhari and Muslim in their authentic collections.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is because for the one who knows nothing but good, then perhaps evil may come to him but he doesn’t know that it is evil.  So, either he will fall into it or he will not be able to reject it, unlike the one who knows about it, who will be able to reject it; so this is why Umar bin al-Khattab <em>-radhiAllaah anhu &#8211;</em> said : ‘Indeed the yoke of Islaam will be taken apart peice by piece if the one raised in Islaam does not know about the times of ignorance.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed being far removed from all types of <em>Shirk</em> whilst having sincerity of <em>Tawheed</em> for Allaah is the foundation upon which it is obligatory to build all acts of obedience, those which bring the slave closer to Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> and this includes the <em>Hajj</em> and other acts of obedience. Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> said in <em>Sooratul Hajj</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">٢٦ وَأَذِّن فِي ٱلنَّاسِ بِٱلۡحَجِّ يَأۡتُوكَ رِجَالٗا وَعَلَىٰ كُلِّ ضَامِرٖ يَأۡتِينَ مِن كُلِّ فَجٍّ عَمِيقٖ ٢٧ لِّيَشۡهَدُواْ<br />
مَنَٰفِعَ لَهُمۡ وَيَذۡكُرُواْ ٱسۡمَ ٱللَّهِ فِيٓ أَيَّامٖ مَّعۡلُومَٰتٍ عَلَىٰ مَا رَزَقَهُم مِّنۢ بَهِيمَةِ ٱلۡأَنۡعَٰمِۖ فَكُلُواْ مِنۡهَا<br />
وَأَطۡعِمُواْ ٱلۡبَآئِسَ ٱلۡفَقِيرَ ٢٨ ثُمَّ لۡيَقۡضُواْ تَفَثَهُمۡ وَلۡيُوفُواْ نُذُورَهُمۡ وَلۡيَطَّوَّفُواْ بِٱلۡبَيۡتِ ٱلۡعَتِيقِ ٢٩<br />
ذَٰلِكَۖ وَمَن يُعَظِّمۡ حُرُمَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ فَهُوَ خَيۡرٞ لَّهُۥ عِندَ رَبِّهِۦۗ وَأُحِلَّتۡ لَكُمُ ٱلۡأَنۡعَٰمُ إِلَّا مَا يُتۡلَىٰ عَلَيۡكُمۡۖ<br />
فَٱجۡتَنِبُواْ ٱلرِّجۡسَ مِنَ ٱلۡأَوۡثَٰنِ وَٱجۡتَنِبُواْ قَوۡلَ ٱلزُّورِ  حُنَفَآءَ لِلَّهِ غَيۡرَ مُشۡرِكِينَ بِهِۦۚ وَمَن يُشۡرِكۡ بِٱللَّهِ فَكَأَنَّمَا خَرَّ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَتَخۡطَفُهُ ٱلطَّيۡرُ أَوۡ تَهۡوِي بِهِ ٱلرِّيحُ فِي مَكَانٖ سَحِيقٖ٣٠</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; And proclaim to mankind the <em>Hajj </em>(pilgrimage). They will come to you on foot and on every lean camel; they will come from every deep and distant (wide) mountain highway (to perform <em>Hajj</em>). That they may witness things that are of benefit to them and mention the Name of Allah on appointed days over the beast of cattle that He has provided for them (for sacrifice).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">Then eat thereof and feed therewith the poor who have a very hard time. Then let them complete the prescribed duties for them, and perform their vows, and circumambulate the Ancient House (the Ka’bah at Makkah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">That (duties of Hajj is the obligation that mankind owes to Allaah), and whoever honours the sacred things of Allah, then that is better for him with his Lord. The cattle are lawful to you, except those (that will be) mentioned to you (as exceptions). So shun the abomination (worshipping) of idols and shun lying speech (false statements)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">To worship none but Allaah, not associating partners unto Him and whoever assigns partners to Allah, it is as if he had fallen from the sky, and the birds had snatched him, or the wind had thrown him to a far-off place. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">[Hajj : 27-31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah warns against <em>Shirk</em> in these Noble <em>Ayaat</em>, in context of the <em>Hajj</em>, and commands keeping away from <em>Shirk</em> and He explains the ugliness of <em>Shirk</em> and its evil consequences.  The one who does <em>Shirk</em>, it is as if he has fallen from the sky and the birds have snatched him or the wind has thrown him to a far-off place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as was mentioned before these <em>Ayaat</em>, Allaah <em>–Subhanahu-</em> ordered His Prophet Ibraheem <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em>to sanctify the House after Allaah had shown him a place for it, and Allaah prohibited him from making <em>Shirk</em> with Allaah, as He <em>–Subhanahu-</em> says :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَإِذۡ بَوَّأۡنَا لِإِبۡرَٰهِيمَ مَكَانَ ٱلۡبَيۡتِ أَن لَّا تُشۡرِكۡ بِي شَيۡ&#x200d;ٔٗا وَطَهِّرۡ بَيۡتِيَ لِلطَّآئِفِينَ وَٱلۡقَآئِمِينَ وَٱلرُّكَّعِ ٱلسُّجُودِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; And (remember) when We showed Ibraheem the site of the (Sacred) House (the<em>Ka’bah</em> at Makkah) (saying): ‘Do not Associate anything (in worship) with Me and sanctify My House for those who circumambulate it, those who stand up for prayer and those who bow and make prostration (in prayer);’ &gt;&gt; [Hajj: 26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These <em>Ayaat</em>, which are regarding <em>Hajj</em>, are surrounded by a warning against <em>Shirk</em>, a prohibition of it and an explanation of its evil consequences.  These <em>Ayaat</em> also demonstrate a great proof illustrating the ugliness of <em>Shirk</em> and its great danger.  May Allaah protect myself and yourselves from it and may He provide us with sincerity in our speech and actions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>Lessons of Creed Acquired From the Hajj<br />
</strong>By ‘AbdurRazzaq bin ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-Badr<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Chapter 3</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Proclamation of Tawheed is an Evidence of ‘Aqeedah</strong><strong>[1]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the most significant of the great lessons which benefits the Muslim in his <em>Hajj</em> to the House of Allaah the <em>al-Haram</em> is the obligation to have sincerity in all worship for Allaah Alone Who has no partners. So when the Muslim begins his <em>Hajj</em>, the first thing that he begins with is the proclamation of <em>Tawheed</em> and rejection of <em>Shirk</em> (associating partners with Allaah), when he says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">لَبَّيْكَ اللَّهُمَّ لَبَّيْكَ , لَبَّيْكَ لا شَرِيكَ لَكَ لَبَّيْكَ , إنَّ الْحَمْدَ وَالنِّعْمَةَ لَكَ وَالْمُلْكَ ، لا شَرِيكَ لَكَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">labbaykallaahumma labbaika, labbaika laa shareeka laka labbaika-innal hamda wan ni’mata laka wal mulka-la shareeka lak</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Here I am O Allaah, here I am, You have no partner, here I am, Verily all praise is for You, and every bounty is from You, and all dominion is Yours – You have no partner.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He repeats it and raises his voice with it whilst, at the same time, he is conscious of and feels what this proclamation indicates: the obligation to single out Allaah Alone with worship and keeping far away from <em>Shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since Allaah is Alone in His favours and His giving, having no partners, then likewise He is Alone in His <em>Tawheed</em> not having any equal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No one is supplicated to except Allaah, none is relied upon except Allaah, none is sought for aid except Allaah nor is any type of the different aspects of worship directed to anyone except Allaah. Just as the slave is required to make his intention for the <em>Hajj</em>completely for Allaah Alone, then in the same way he is required to make his intention in all the worship he performs and in all the acts of obedience by which he becomes closer to Allaah, for Allaah Alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whosoever directs anything from worship to other than Allaah then he has committed<em>Shirk</em> with Allaah, The Great, and he has suffered a clear loss, nullified his actions and Allaah will not accept his actions from him, neither his optional actions nor his obligatory actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Islaam came with this great proclamation, the proclamation of the <em>Tawheed</em> of Allaah, making the <em>Deen</em> sincerely for Allaah and distancing oneself from all types of<em>Shirk</em> large or small, minor or major.  Whereas the <em>Mushrikoon</em> (polytheists), the worshippers of idols and statues, used to make the declaration to enter into their<em>Ihraam</em> for <em>Hajj</em> with <em>Shirk</em> and abuse, they would say in their <em>Talbeeyaah</em>(proclamation):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Here I am O Allaah, here I am, You have no partner except for the partner who is Yours, whom you possess and what he possesses.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, in the proclamation, they included their false gods along with Allaah and they place – what they claim for their false gods – in the Hands of Allaah and this is the meaning of the saying of Allaah about them in the Qur’aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَمَا يُؤۡمِنُ أَكۡثَرُهُم بِٱللَّهِ إِلَّا وَهُم مُّشۡرِكُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; And most of them believe not in Allaah except that they attribute partners unto Him&gt;&gt; [Yusuf: 106]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: that most of them do not believe in Allaah, that He is The Creator, The Provider and The Disposer except that they associate partners with Him in worship – with idols who do not possess anything and statues that do not benefit or bring harm, nor do they give anything or prevent harm, rather they do not possess anything at all for themselves, let alone possess anything for anyone else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Ibn Jareer at-Tabaree on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas <em>-RadiAllaah anhu   – </em>who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It is from their <em>Eemaan</em>, that if it is said to them: ‘Who created the sky?’ ‘Who created the earth?’ and ‘Who created the mountains?’ They would say ‘Allaah’ yet they are still<em>Mushrikoon</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Ikrimaa that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Ask them who created the heavens and the earth, they will say: Allaah. That is their<em>Eemaan</em> in Allaah and yet they worship other than Him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, on the authority of Mujaahid who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Their <em>Eemaan</em> is their saying: Allaah is our Creator, He gives us provision and He takes our lives. So this is <em>Eemaan</em>, along with <em>Shirk</em> in their worship of other than Him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Ibn Zayd who said: ‘There is no-one that worships someone along with Allaah except that he believes in Allaah, knows that Allaah is His lord and that Allaah is his Creator and his Provider, but along with this he commits <em>Shirk</em> with Him. Do you not see how Ibraheem said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">قَالَ أَفَرَءَيۡتُم مَّا كُنتُمۡ تَعۡبُدُونَ ٧٥ أَنتُمۡ وَءَابَآؤُكُمُ ٱلۡأَقۡدَمُونَ ٧٦ فَإِنَّهُمۡ عَدُوّٞ لِّيٓ إِلَّا رَبَّ ٱلۡعَٰلَمِينَ ٧٧</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; He said: ‘Do you observe that which you have been worshipping – you and your ancient fathers? Verily they are enemies to me, except the Lord of the worlds. &gt;&gt; [ash-Shoora:75-77]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibraheem <em>– alayhi as-Sallam &#8211;</em> knew that they worshipped the Lord of the worlds along with those whom they used to worship.’ Then he said: there is none that commits <em>Shirk</em>except that he believes in Allaah, do you not see how the Arabs used to proclaim and say: ‘Here I am O Allaah, here I am, You have no partner except for the partner who is Yours, whom you possess and what he possesses.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what the <em>Mushrikoon</em> used to say.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the <em>Mushrikoon</em> at the time of the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> used to affirm that their Creator, Provider and The Disposer of their affairs was Allaah, but even with this affirmation they did not make the <em>Deen</em> sincerely for Allaah. Rather, they worshipped others along with Him in their worshipping of trees, stones and idols, besides other things. Allaah made this matter clear and explained it in many places in the Noble Qur’aan, such as His <em>-Subhanahu-</em> saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَلَئِن سَأَلۡتَهُم مَّنۡ خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضَ وَسَخَّرَ ٱلشَّمۡسَ وَٱلۡقَمَرَ لَيَقُولُنَّ ٱللَّهُۖ فَأَنَّىٰ يُؤۡفَكُونَ ٦١</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;And if you were to ask them: ‘Who has created the heavens and the earth and subjected the sun and the moon?’ They will surely reply ‘Allaah’. How then are they deviating (as disbelievers)? &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">[Ankabut: 61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Aayaat</em> with this meaning are many.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafidh Ibn Katheer <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said in his book of <em>Tafseer</em>: ‘Allaah Ta’ala speaks, affirming that there is none worthy of worship in truth except Him- because the<em>Mushrikeen</em> who worship Him, worship others along with Him- they acknowledge that He is Independent in His creation of the heavens and the earth, the sun and the moon and the change of the night and day and that He is The Creator and The Provider for His slaves, The One Who determines their different times of death, their different types of provision and the contrast between them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, from amongst them, are the rich and the poor and He knows best that which is befitting for everyone amongst them, he who deserves to be rich and he who deserves to be poor. It is mentioned that He is Independent in creating things and He is Alone in organising the creation.  So, if this is the case, then why is someone other than Him relied upon? Since He is Alone in possessing everything then He should be the only One worshipped. Many times Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> establishes His status as being worthy of being worshipped due to the recognition of the <em>Tawheed</em> of His Lordship. The<em>Mushrikoon</em> used to acknowledge this as they used to say in their proclamation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Here I am O Allaah, here I am, You have no partner, except for the partner who is Yours, whom You possess and what he possesses.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So why is someone else relied upon?[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many places in the noble Qur’aan which mention this meaning of establishing proof against the <em>Kuffar</em> of their obligation to have <em>Tawheed</em> of Him in His worship and making the <em>Deen</em> sincerely for Him due to their acknowledgement of the Lordship of Allaah <em>–Jala wa Oola</em>. Due to this, Allaah addresses them regarding the <em>Tawheed</em> of His Lordship with a rhetorical question. So, if they affirm His Lordship, He uses this as an evidence against them, that He is The One Who deserves to be worshipped Alone and He rebukes them, rejecting their association of others with Him, even though they acknowledge that He Alone is The Lord; because whoever acknowledges that He Alone is The Lord then it necessitates that all worship is performed sincerely for Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With this, it becomes clear that acknowledging that Allaah is The Creator, The Provider, The Benefactor, The One who controls and The Disposer of the affairs of the creation, (then this) is not sufficient for the (establishment of the) <em>Tawheed</em> of Allaah and it does not save anyone from the punishment of Allaah on the Day of Judgement, unless all worship is sincerely for Allaah Alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah does not accept the <em>Tawheed</em> of Lordship from His slaves unless they single Him out Alone in the <em>Tawheed</em> of <em>Ibaadah</em> (worship), such that they do not take an equal with Him, nor do they supplicate to anyone along with Him, nor do they rely upon anyone except Him, nor do they direct any form of worship to other than Him <em>-Subhanahu</em>, so just as He <em>-Subhanahu-</em> is The Only One to create then He is worshipped Alone with all types of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why Allaah Ta’ala said to those who turned their worship to other than Him, even though they knew that He is their Creator and Provider:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">فَلَا تَجۡعَلُواْ لِلَّهِ أَندَادٗا وَأَنتُمۡ تَعۡلَمُونَ ٢٢</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; Then do not set up rivals unto Allaah (in worship) while you know (that He Alone has the right to be worshipped)&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">[al-Baqarah: 22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Abbas <em>&#8211; RadiAllaah anhu –</em> said: ‘i.e. Do not associate others with Allaah assigning equals to Him, who do not bring any benefit, nor do they harm while you know that you have no Lord who provides for you other than Him. Indeed you have come to know that what the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>called you to, of Allaah’s <em>Tawheed</em>, then that is the truth wherein there is no doubt.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qatadah said: ‘You know that Allaah created you and He created the Heavens and the earth, then you ascribe equals unto Him.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the blessing upon the <em>Ummah</em> of Islaam is great; their being guided to the<em>Tawheed</em> of Allaah in His Lordship, worship and His Names and Attributes. The blessing of Allaah upon the Muslims is great in their being capable of proclaiming Allaah’s<em>Tawheed</em>, since others besides them proclaim <em>Shirk</em> and set up equals with Him.  So, for Allaah belongs the praise, <em>-Subhanahu-</em> for giving the ability, His blessings and guidance and to Him belong many good and blessed praises, such as our Noble Lord loves and is pleased with.</p>

<p>Jabir <em>-Radi Allaahu anhu-</em> said:</p>
<p>The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> raised his voice with Tawheed: :</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>لَبَّيْكَ</strong><strong>اللَّهُمَّ</strong><strong>  </strong><strong>لَبَّيْكَ</strong><strong>،</strong><strong>لَبَّيْكَ</strong><strong>لا</strong><strong>شَرِيكَ</strong><strong>  </strong><strong>لَكَ</strong><strong>  </strong><strong>لَبَّيْكَ</strong><strong>،</strong><strong>إِنَّ</strong><strong>الْحَمْدَ</strong><strong>وَالنّعْمَةَ</strong><strong>  </strong><strong>لَكَ</strong><strong>  </strong><strong>وَالْمُلْكَ</strong><strong>لا</strong><strong>شَرِيكَ</strong><strong>  </strong><strong>لَكَ</strong></h2>
<p align="center"><strong> </strong>Labbaykallaahumma labbaik, labbaika laa shareeka laka labbaik innal hamda wan ni’mata laka wal mulk-laa shareeka lak</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here I am O Allaah, here I am, You have no partner, here I am, Verily all praise is for You, and every bounty is from You, and all dominion is Yours – You have no partner. [1]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3 – Making Dua’ When Seeing the Ka’abah</strong></p>
<p>Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘if one of you sees the Ka’abah he can raise his hands – due to this being established from Ibn ‘Abbas <em>-Radi Allaahu anhu</em>, but it is not established from the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>that he made a specific Dua’ here – and he can make Dua’ with whatever is easy for him, and if he makes Dua’ with what Umar <em>-Radi Allaahu anhu-</em> did then that is good due to it being established from Umar <em>-Radi Allaahu anhu</em>:</p>
<h2 align="center">اللَّهُمَّ أَنْتَ السَّلَامُ وَمِنْك السَّلَامُ فَحَيِّنَا رَبَّنَا بِالسَّلَامِ</h2>
<p align="center">‘Allaahumma Anta as-Salaam, wa Min kas-Salam fa hayyina Rabbana bis-Salaam’</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">‘O Allaah You are as-Sallam, and from You is peace and security, so grant us life O our Lord with peace and security.’ [2]</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>4 – When beginning the Tawaf at the Hajr al-Aswad [The Black Stone]</strong></p>
<p>Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It is the Sunnah to say Takbeer [Say: Allaahu Akbar (Allaah is the greatest)] at the Hajr al-Aswad on every circuit due to the hadeeth of Ibn Abbas <em>-Radi Allaahu anhu-</em> who said: the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>made Tawaf of the House upon his camel, and every time he came to the Hajr al-Aswad corner, he would indicate to it with what he had with him in his hand and say Takbeer.</p>
<p>As for saying ‘Bismillaah’ (In the Name of Allaah), then it is authentic from Ibn Umar that he would point to the stone and say;</p>
<p align="center">بسم الله والله أكبر</p>
<p align="center">‘Bismillaah wa Allaahu Akbar’. [3]</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>5 – The Dua’ between the Yemeni Corner &amp; the Black Stone</strong></p>
<p>From Abdullaah bin as-Saib <em>-Radi Allaahu anhu-</em> who said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>say: between the two corners [the Yemeni corner &amp; the black stone]:</p>
<p align="center"><strong> </strong>رَبَّنَا آتِنَا فِي الدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةً وَفِي الْآخِرَةِ حَسَنَةً وَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&lt;&lt;Our Lord! Give us in this world that which is good and in the Hereafter that which is good, and save us from the torment of the Fire!&gt;&gt; [4]</p>
<p><strong>6 – The Dua’ Upon Mount Safa &amp; Marwa</strong></p>
<p>From Jabir <em>-Radi Allaahu anhu-</em> who said: Then the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> went out to Safa and when he came close to Safa he recited:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center"><strong>إِنَّ الصَّفَا وَالْمَرْوَةَ مِنْ شَعَائِرِ </strong><strong>الله</strong><strong> فَمَنْ حَجَّ الْبَيْتَ أَوِ اعْتَمَرَ فَلا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِ أَنْ يَطَّوَّفَ بِهِمَا وَمَنْ تَطَوَّعَ خَيْرًا فَإِنَّ </strong><strong>الله</strong><strong> شَاكِرٌ عَلِيمٌ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> &lt;&lt;Verily! As-Safa and Al-Marwah  are of the Symbols of Allaah. So it is not a sin on him who perform Hajj or ‘Umrah of the House (the Ka’bah at Makkah) to perform the going between them (As-Safa and Al-Marwah). And whoever does good voluntarily, then verily, Allaah is All-Recogniser, All-Knower.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p align="center">نَبْدَأُ بِمَا بَدَأَ اللَّهُ بِهِ</p>
<p align="center">Nabda Bima Bada Allaahu Bihi, so he <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> began at Safa and climbed it until he could see the Ka’abah, and he faced the Qiblah [the Ka’abah], and he singled out Allaah and said the Takbeer three times <strong>الله أكبر الله أكبر الله أكبر</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> [Allaahu Akbar, Allaahu Akbar, Allaahu Akbar]</p>
<p align="center">Then he <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>would say</p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center">لَا إلَهَ إلَّا <strong>الله</strong> وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ لَهُ الْمُلْكُ ، وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ ، لَا إلَهَ إلَّا <strong>الله</strong> أَنْجَزَ وَعْدَهُ وَنَصَرَ عَبْدَهُ وَهَزَمَ الْأَحْزَابَ وَحْدَهُ</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> ‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah Alone, He has no partners, to Him belongs the Dominion and for Him is all praise, and He is capable of all things. He kept His promise, and aided His slave, and He Alone defeated all the clans of (non-believers).’</p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center">La ilaha ‘illa Allaahu wahdahu la shareeka lahu, lahul mulku wa lahul hamdu wa huwa ala kulli shayin qadeer, Anjaza Waaddahu, wa nasra ‘abdahu wa Hazama al-Ahzaab Wahaddahu’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>would say this three times and would make Dua’ between saying this. Then he <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>would do the same thing on Marwa as he did on Safa.’ 5<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>7 – The Dua’ during the Sa’ee between Safa &amp; Marwa</strong></p>
<p>Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p>‘And if he makes Dua’ in the Sa’ee by saying:</p>
<p align="center">رَبِّ اغْفِرْ وَارْحَمْ ، إِنَّكَ أَنْتَ الأَعَزُّ الأَكْرَمُ</p>
<p align="center">‘Rabb Ighfir warrham, innaka Anta al-‘Aa’azz al-Akram.’</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">‘O Lord forgive me and have mercy on me, Indeed You are the Most Honourable and the Most Generous.’</p>
<p>Then this is permissible to say due to it being established from a number of the Salaf.’ 6</p>

<h3 align="center">Minor Pilgrammage (Umra)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.027.001"></a>Volume 3, Book 27, Number 1:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;(The performance of) &#8216;Umra is an expiation for the sins committed (between it and the previous one). And the reward of Hajj Mabrur (the one accepted by Allah) is nothing except Paradise.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 2:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Juraij:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ikrima bin Khalid asked Ibn &#8216;Umar about performing &#8216;Umra before Hajj. Ibn &#8216;Umar replied, &#8220;There is no harm in it.&#8221; &#8216;Ikrima said, &#8220;Ibn &#8216;Umar also said, &#8216;The Prophet had performed &#8216;Umra before performing Hajj.'&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 3:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ikrima bin Khalid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I asked Ibn &#8216;Umar the same (as above).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 4:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Mujahid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ursa bin AzZubair and I entered the Mosque (of the Prophet) and saw &#8216;Abdullah bin Umar sitting near the dwelling place of Aisha and some people were offering the Duha prayer. We asked him about their prayer and he replied that it was a heresy. He (Ursa) then asked him how many times the Prophet had performed &#8216;Umra. He replied, &#8216;Four times; one of them was in the month of Rajab.&#8221; We disliked to contradict him. Then we heard &#8216;Aisha, the Mother of faithful believers cleaning her teeth with Siwak in the dwelling place. &#8216;Ursa said, &#8220;O Mother! O Mother of the believers! Don&#8217;t you hear what Abu &#8216;Abdur Rahman is saying?&#8221; She said, &#8220;What does he say?&#8221; &#8216;Ursa said, &#8220;He says that Allah&#8217;s Apostle performed four &#8216;Umra and one of them was in the month of Rajab.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;May Allah be merciful to Abu &#8216;Abdur Rahman! The Prophet did not perform any &#8216;Umra except that he was with him, and he never performed any &#8216;Umra in Rajab.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 5:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ursa bin Az-Zubair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked &#8216;Aisha (whether the Prophet had performed &#8216;Umra in Rajab). She replied, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle never performed any &#8216;Umra in Rajab.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 6:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Qatada:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Anas how many times the Prophet had performed &#8216;Umra. He replied, &#8220;Four times. 1. &#8216;Umra of Hudaibiya in Dhi-l-Qa&#8217;da when the pagans hindered him; 2. &#8216;Umra in the following year in Dhi-l-Qa&#8217;da after the peace treaty with them (the pagans); 3. &#8216;Umra from Al-Jr&#8217;rana where he distributed the war booty.&#8221; I think he meant the booty (of the battle) of Hunain. I asked, &#8220;How many times did he perform Hajj?&#8221; He (Anas) replied, &#8220;Once. &#8220;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 7:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Qatada:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Anas (about the Prophet&#8217;s &#8216;Umra) and he replied, &#8220;The Prophet performed &#8216;Umra when the pagans made him return, and Umra of al-Hudaibiya (the next year), and another &#8216;Umra in Dhi-l-Qa&#8217;da, and another &#8216;Umra in combination with his Hajj.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 8:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hammam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet performed four &#8216;Umra (three) in Dhi-l-Qa&#8217;da except the (one) &#8216;Umra which he performed with his Hajj: His &#8216;Umra from Al-hudaibiya, and the one of the following year, and the one from Al-Jr&#8217;rana where he distributed the booty (of the battle) of Hunain, and another &#8216;Umra with his Hajj.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 9:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Ishaq:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Masruq, &#8216;Ata&#8217; and Mujahid (about the &#8216;Umra of Allah&#8217;s Apostle). They said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle had performed &#8216;Umra in Dhi-l-Qa&#8217;da before he performed Hajj.&#8221; I heard Al-Bara&#8217; bin &#8216;Azib saying, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle had performed &#8216;Umra in Dhi-l-Qa&#8217;da twice before he performed Hajj.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 10:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ata:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Ibn &#8216;Abbas saying, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked an Ansari woman (Ibn &#8216;Abbas named her but &#8216;Ata&#8217; forgot her name), &#8216;What prevented you from performing Hajj with us?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;We have a camel and the father of so-and-so and his son (i.e. her husband and her son) rode it and left one camel for us to use for irrigation.&#8217; He said (to her), &#8216;Perform &#8216;Umra when Ramadan comes, for &#8216;Umra in Ramadan is equal to Hajj (in reward),&#8217; or said something similar.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 11:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We set out along with Allah&#8217;s Apostle shortly before the appearance of the new moon (crescent) of the month of Dhi-l-Hijja and he said to us, &#8220;Whoever wants to assume Ihram for Hajj may do so; and whoever wants to assume Ihram for &#8216;Umra may do so. Hadn&#8217;t I brought the Hadi (animal for sacrificing) (with me), I would have assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra.&#8221; (&#8216;Aisha added,): So some of us assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra while the others for Hajj. I was amongst those who assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra. The day of &#8216;Arafat approached and I was still menstruating. I complained to the Prophet (about that) and he said, &#8220;Abandon your &#8216;Umra, undo and comb your hair, and assume Ihram for Hajj;.&#8221; When it was the night of Hasba, he sent &#8216;Abdur Rahman with me to At-Tan&#8217;im and I assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra (and performed it) in lieu of my missed &#8216;Umra.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 12:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amr bin Aus:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdul Rahman bin Abu Bakr told me that the Prophet had ordered him to let &#8216;Aisha ride behind him and to make he perform &#8216;Umra from At-Tan&#8217;im.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 13:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet and his companions assumed Ihram for Hajj and none except the Prophet and Talha had the Hadi with them. &#8216;Ali had come from Yemen and he had the Hadi with him. He (&#8216;Ali) said, &#8220;I have assumed Ihram with an intention like that of Allah&#8217;s Apostle has assumed it.&#8221; The Prophet ordered his companions to intend the Ihram with which they had come for &#8216;Umra, to perform the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba (and between Safa and Marwa), to get their hair cut short and then to finish their Ihram with the exception of those who had the Hadi with them. They asked, &#8220;Shall we go to Mina and the private organs of some of us are dribbling (if we finish Ihram and have sexual relations with our wives)?&#8221; The Prophet heard that and said, &#8220;Had I known what I know now, I would not have brought the Hadi. If I did not have the Hadi with me I would have finished my Ihram.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha got her menses and performed all the ceremonies (of Hajj) except the Tawaf . So when she became clean from her menses, and she had performed the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, she said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! You (people) are returning with both Hajj and &#8216;Umra and I am returning only with Hajj!&#8221; So, he ordered &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin Abu Bakr to go with her to At-Tan&#8217;im. Thus she performed &#8216;Umra after the Hajj in the month of Dhi-l-Hijja. Suraqa bin Malik bin Ju&#8217;sham met the Prophet at Al-&#8216;Aqaba (Jamrat-ul &#8216;Aqaba) while the latter was stoning it and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Is this permissible only for you?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;No, it is for ever (i.e. it is permissible for all Muslims to perform &#8216;Umra before Hajj.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 14:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We set out with Allah&#8217;s Apostle shortly before the appearance of the new moon of Dhi-l-Hiija and he said, &#8220;Whoever wants to assume Ihram for &#8216;Umra may do so, and whoever wants to assume Ihram for Hajj may do so. Had not I brought the Hadi with me, I would have assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra.&#8221; Some of the people assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra while others for Hajj. I was amongst those who had assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra. I got my menses before entering Mecca, and was menstruating till the day of &#8216;Arafat. I complained to Allah&#8217;s Apostle about it, he said, &#8220;Abandon your &#8216;Umra, undo and comb your hair, and assume Ihram for Hajj.&#8221; So, I did that accordingly. When it was the night of Hasba (day of departure from Mina), the Prophet sent &#8216;Abdur Rahman with me to At-Tanim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sub-narrator adds: He (&#8216;AbdurRahman) let her ride behind him. And she assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra in lieu of the abandoned one. Aisha completed her Hajj and &#8216;Umra, and no Hadi, Sadaqa (charity), or fasting was obligatory for her.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 15:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Aswad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The people are returning after performing the two Nusuks (i.e. Hajj and &#8216;Umra) but I am returning with one only?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Wait till you become clean from your menses and then go to At-Tan&#8217;im, assume Ihram (and after performing &#8216;Umra) join us at such-and-such a place. But it (i.e. the reward if &#8216;Umra) is according to your expenses or the hardship (which you will undergo while performing it).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 16:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We set out assuming the Ihram for Hajj in the months of Hajj towards the sacred precincts of Hajj. We dismounted at Sarif and the Prophet said to his companions, &#8220;Whoever has not got the Hadi with him and likes to make it as &#8216;Umra, he should do it, but he who has got the Hadi with him should not do it.&#8221; The Prophet and some of his wealthy companions had the Hadi with them, so they did not finish Ihram after performing the &#8216;Umra. The Prophet came to me while I was weeping. He asked me the reason for it. I replied, &#8220;I have heard of what you have said to your companions and I cannot do the &#8216;Umra.&#8221; He asked me, &#8220;What is the matter with you?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I am not praying.&#8221; He said, &#8220;There is no harm in it as you are one of the daughters of Adam and the same is written for you as for others. So, you should perform Hajj and I hope that Allah will enable you to perform the &#8216;Umra as well.&#8221; So, I carried on till we departed from Mina and halted at Al-Mahassab. The Prophet called &#8216;Abdur-Rahman and said, &#8220;Go out of the sanctuary with your sister and let her assume Ihram for &#8216;Umra, and after both of you have finished the Tawaf I will be waiting for you at this place.&#8221; We came back at mid-night and the Prophet asked us, &#8220;Have you finished?&#8221; I replied in the affirmative. He announced the departure and the people set out for the journey and some of them had performed the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba before the morning prayer, and after that the Prophet set out for Medina.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 17:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Safwan bin Ya&#8217;la bin Umaiya from his father who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;A man came to the Prophet while he was at Ji&#8217;rana. The man was wearing a cloak which had traces of Khaluq or Sufra (a kind of perfume). The man asked (the Prophet ), &#8216;What do you order me to perform in my &#8216;Umra?&#8217; So, Allah inspired the Prophet divinely and he was screened by a place of cloth. I wished to see the Prophet being divinely inspired. &#8216;Umar said to me, &#8216;Come! Will you be pleased to look at the Prophet while Allah is inspiring him?&#8217; I replied in the affirmative. &#8216;Umar lifted one corner of the cloth and I looked at the Prophet who was snoring. (The sub-narrator thought that he said: The snoring was like that of a camel). When that state was over, the Prophet asked, &#8220;Where is the questioner who asked about &#8216;Umra? Put off your cloak and wash away the traces of Khaluq from your body and clean the Sufra (yellow color) and perform in your Umra what you perform in your Hajj (i.e. the Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba and the Sa&#8217;i between Safa and Marwa). &#8220;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 18:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hisham Ibn &#8216;Urwa from his father who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While I was a youngster, I asked &#8216;Aisha the wife of the Prophet. &#8220;What about the meaning of the Statement of Allah;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al Marwa, are among the symbols of Allah. So, it is not harmful if those who perform Hajj or &#8216;Umra of the House (Ka&#8217;ba at Mecca) to perform the going (Tawaf) between them? (2.158) I understand (from that) that there is no harm if somebody does not perform the Tawaf between them.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha replied, &#8220;No, for if it were as you are saying, then the recitation would have been like this: &#8216;It is not harmful not to perform Tawaf between them.&#8217; This verse was revealed in connection with the Ansar who used to assume the Ihram for the idol Manat which was put beside a place called Qudaid and those people thought it not right to perform the Tawaf of As-Safa and Al-Marwa. When Islam came, they asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about that, and Allah revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa Are among the symbols of Allah. So, it is not harmful of those who perform Hajj or &#8216;Umra of the House (Ka&#8217;ba at Mecca) to perform the going (Tawaf) between them.&#8221; (2.158) Sufyan and Abu Muawiya added from Hisham (from &#8216;Aisha): &#8220;The Hajj or &#8216;Umra of the person who does not perform the going (Tawaf) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa is incomplete in Allah&#8217;s sight.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 19:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Isma&#8217;il:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullah bin Abu Aufa said: &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle performed &#8216;Umra and we too performed &#8216;Umra along with him. When he entered Mecca he performed the Tawaf (of Ka&#8217;ba) and we too performed it along with him, and then he came to the As-Safa and Al-Marwa (i.e. performed the Sai) and we also came to them along with him. We were shielding him from the people of Mecca lest they may hit him with an arrow.&#8221; A friend of his asked him (i.e. &#8216;Abdullah bin Aufa), &#8220;Did the Prophet enter the Ka&#8217;ba (during that &#8216;Umra)?&#8221; He replied in the negative. Then he said, &#8220;What did he (the Prophet ) say about Khadija?&#8221; He (Abdullah bin Aufa) said, &#8220;(He said) &#8216;Give Khadija the good tidings that she will have a palace made of Qasab in Paradise and there will be neither noise nor any trouble in it.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 20:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amr bin Dinar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We asked Ibn &#8216;Umar whether a man who had performed the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba but had not performed the Tawaf between As-Safa and Al-Marwa yet, was permitted to have sexual relation with his wife. He replied, &#8220;The Prophet arrived (at Mecca) and circumambulated the Ka&#8217;ba seven times and then offered a two Rak&#8217;at prayer behind Maqam-lbrahim and then performed the going (Tawaf) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa (seven times) (and verily, in Allah&#8217;s Apostle you have a good example.&#8221; And we asked Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah (the same question) and he replied, &#8220;He should not go near her till he has finished the going (Tawaf) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 21:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ashari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I came to the Prophet at Al-Batha&#8217; while his camel was kneeling down and he asked me, &#8220;Have you intended to perform the Hajj?&#8221; I replied in the affirmative. He asked me, &#8216;With what intention have you assumed Ihram?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I have assumed Ihram with the same intention as that of the Prophet. He said, &#8220;You have done well. Perform the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and (the Sai) between As-safa and Al-Marwa and then finish the Ihram.&#8221; So, I performed the Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba and the Sai) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa and then went to a woman of the tribe of Qais who cleaned my head from lice. Later I assumed the Ihram for Hajj. I used to give the verdict of doing the same till the caliphate of &#8216;Umar who said, &#8220;If you follow the Holy Book then it orders you to remain in the state of Ihram till you finish from Hajj, if you follow the Prophet then he did not finish his Ihram till the Hadi (sacrifice) had reached its place of slaughtering (Hajj-al-Qiran).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 22:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Aswad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullah the slave of Asma bint Abu Bakr, told me that he used to hear Asma&#8217;, whenever she passed by Al-Hajun, saying, &#8220;May Allah bless His Apostle Muhammad. Once we dismounted here with him, and at that time we were traveling with light luggage; we had a few riding animals and a little food ration. I, my sister, &#8216;Aisha, Az-Zubair and such and such persons performed &#8216;Umra, and when we had passed our hands over the Ka&#8217;ba (i.e. performed Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba and between As-Safa and Al-Marwa) we finished our lhram. Later on we assumed Ihram for Hajj the same evening.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 23:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle returned from a Ghazwa, Hajj or &#8216;Umra, he used to say Takbir thrice at every elevation of the ground and then would say, &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah; He is One and has no partner. All the kingdoms is for Him, and all the praises are for Him, and He is Omnipotent. We are returning with repentance, worshipping, prostrating, and praising our Lord. He has kept up His promise and made His slave victorious, and He Alone defeated all the clans of (non-believers).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 24:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet arrived at Mecca, some boys of the tribe of Bani &#8216;Abdul Muttalib went to receive him, and the Prophet made one of them ride in front of him and the other behind him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 25:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle left for Mecca, he used to pray in the mosque of Ash-Shajra, and when he returned (to Medina), he used to pray in the middle of the valley of Dhul-Hulaifa and used to pass the night there till morning.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 26:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas: The Prophet never returned to his family from a journey at night. He</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 27:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir: The Prophet forbade going to one&#8217;s family at night (on arrival from a</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 28:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Humaid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas said, &#8220;Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle returned from a journey, he, on seeing the high places of Medina, would make his she-camel proceed faster; and if it were another animal, even then he used to make it proceed faster.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Humaid that the Prophet used to make it proceed faster out of his love for Medina.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 29:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As above, but mentioned &#8220;the walls of Medina&#8221; instead of &#8220;the high places of Medina. Al-Harith bin Umar agrees with Anas.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 30:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Ishaq:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Al-Bara&#8217; saying, &#8220;The above Verse was revealed regarding us, for the Ansar on returning from Hajj never entered their houses through the proper doors but from behind. One of the Ansar came and entered through the door and he was taunted for it. Therefore, the following was revealed: &#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It is not righteousness That you enter the houses from the back, But the righteous man is He who fears Allah, Obeys His order and keeps away from What He has forbidden So, enter houses through the proper doors.&#8221; (2.189)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 31:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Traveling is a kind of torture as it prevents one from eating, drinking and sleeping properly. So, when one&#8217;s needs are fulfilled, one should return quickly to one&#8217;s family.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 32:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Aslam from his father:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was with Ibn &#8216;Umar on the way to Mecca, and he got the news that Safiya bint Abu Ubaid was seriously ill. So, he hastened his pace, and when the twilight disappeared, he dismounted and offered the Maghrib and &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayers together. Then he said, &#8220;I saw that whenever the Prophet had to hasten when traveling, he would delay the Maghrib prayer and join them together (i.e. offer the Maghrib and the Isha prayers together).&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">source:<em> Silsilat ul-ahaadeeth us-saheeha</em> – the series of authentic narrations – <em>hadeeth </em>no. 43<br />
assaheeha translations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “O <em>‘Aaisha</em>, if your people had not recently been polytheists (and new converts to <em>Islaam</em>), and if I had enough means to reconstruct it, I would have spent the treasure of the <em>Ka’bah</em> in the way of Allaah, and I would have demolished the <em>Ka’bah</em> and made it at a level with the ground. Then I would have rebuilt it on its original foundations laid by <em>Ibraaheem</em> (Abraham) and made two doors for it – a door facing the east, for the people to enter, and a door facing the west, for their exit… And I would expand (the <em>Ka’bah</em>) by six cubits (around three meters) of area from <em>al-Hijr</em> (the unroofed portion of the <em>Ka’bah</em> which is at present in the form of a semi-circular, wall-surrounded area in the north side of the <em>Ka’bah</em>); (in [another] narration: I would have included the space of <em>al-Hijr</em> in it ), for when the <em>Quraish</em> had rebuilt the<em> Ka’bah</em>, they reduced its (area). And if your people would take initiative after me in rebuilding it, then come along with me so that I could show you what they have left out of it.” He [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] showed her about seven cubits (three and a half meters) of area (from the side of <em>al-Hijr</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In [another] narration from her (<em>‘Aaisha</em>), she said: “I asked the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) about the wall (i.e., <em>al-Hijr</em>): ‘Is it regarded as part of the House (the <em>Ka’bah</em>)?’ He [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] replied, ‘Yes.’ I said: ‘Then why did they not include it in the House?’ He [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] said, ‘Your people ran short of the means/money (to do so).’ I said: ‘Why is it that the level of its door is raised high?’ He [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] said, ‘Your people did it to admit whomever they liked, and prevent whomever they disliked; (in [another] narration: (They did it) out of vanity so that (they might be in a position) to grant admittance to only whom they wished. So when a person intended to enter it, they called him to climb (the stairs), and when he was about to enter, they pushed him and he fell down). Were your people not close to the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance (i.e. they have recently embraced<em> Islaam</em>) and were I not afraid that their hearts might deny (my action), then surely I would have included the (area of the) wall inside (the building of) the House and I would have made its gate touch the ground.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, when <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> ruled, he demolished it and made two doors for it. (In [another] narration: That was what urged <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr </em>to demolish (the <em>Ka’bah</em>). <em>Yazeed bin Rumaan</em> said: ‘I saw <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> when he demolished it, rebuilt it and included <em>al-Hijr </em>in it. And I saw the original foundations of <em>Ibraaheem</em> (<em>‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) which were of stones joined together resembling the humps of camels.’)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>*</strong>the translation of the above <em>hadeeth</em>, for the most part, was taken directly from the already translated text of <em>saheeh al-bukhaari </em>and<em> saheeh muslim</em><strong>*</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>shaykh al-albaani </em>(<em>rahimahullaah</em>) summarizes a number of benefits from the above narration:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This <em>hadeeth</em> indicates two things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First: that it is obligatory to delay carrying out rectification, if an evil greater than [its good] results from it. And from it, the scholars of <em>fiqh</em> took their famous principle: ‘<strong>Repelling the evil [comes] before bringing the good</strong>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second: that the honorable <em>Ka’bah</em> is now in need of the reconstructions that the <em>hadeeth</em> includes, due to the disappearance of the reason for the sake of which the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) left that – and (the reason) is that the hearts of those who were recently polytheists in his time (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) would have a dislike [for it]. And <em>Ibn Battaal </em>has reported from some of the scholars that: ‘the dislike that he (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) feared was that they would accuse him of boasting by himself over them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is possible to list those reconstructions in what follows:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>1- Expanding the <em>Ka’bah</em> and building it upon the foundation of <em>Ibraaheem </em>(<em>‘alayhi ssalaat wa ssalaam</em>), and that is by adding approximately six cubits (three meters) of <em>al-Hijr</em></li>
<li>2- Leveling its ground with the surface of the <em>Haram</em> (<em>Al-Masjid ul-Haraam</em>)</li>
<li>3- Opening another door for it from the Western side</li>
<li>4 – Making the two doors low with the ground to organize and facilitate entering it and exiting from it for everyone who wishes</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed,<em> ‘Abdullaah bin uz-Zubayr </em>(<em>radi Allaahu ‘anhumaa</em>) had carried out the fulfillment of this reconstruction completely during his rule in <em>Makkah</em>, but the unjust political administration returned the <em>Ka’bah</em> after him to its previous state!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">the<em> shaykh </em>then mentions the following <em>hadeeth</em> as narrated by <em>Muslim</em> and <em>Abu Nu’aym</em> on the authority of <em>‘Ataa</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The House was burnt during the time of <em>Yazeed bin Mu’aawiya</em> when the people of <em>Shaam</em> had fought (in <em>Makkah</em>), and it happened with it (the<em> Ka’bah</em>) what was (in store for it). <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> left it (in the same state) until the people came in the season (of <em>Hajj</em>) – he wanted to encourage them or urge them on (to war) against the people of <em>Shaam</em>. When the people had arrived, he said to them, ‘O people, advise me about the <em>Ka’bah</em>. Should I demolish it and then build it from its very foundation, or should I repair whatever has been damaged of it?’ <em>Ibn ‘Abbaas</em> [<em>radi Allaahu &#8216;anhu</em>] said, ‘An idea has occurred to me, according to which I think that you should only repair whatever has been damaged for it, and leave the House (in the same state) in which people embraced<em> Islaam</em>, (and leave) the stones (in the same state) in which people embraced<em> Islaam</em> and upon which the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) was sent.’ So, <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr </em>said, ‘If the house of any one of you was burnt, he would not be pleased until he had reconstructed it, then how about the House of your Lord (which is far more important than your house)?! Indeed, I will seek good advice from my Lord thrice and then I will make up my mind about this affair.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After seeking good advice thrice, he made up his mind to demolish it. The people were suspicious and fearful that calamity might fall from heaven on those persons who would be first to climb over it (for the purpose of demolishing it), until a man climbed it and threw down one of its stones. When the people saw no calamity befalling him, they followed him and demolished it until they leveled it to the ground. Then, <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> erected pillars and hung curtains on them until the walls were raised. And <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr </em>said, ‘Indeed I heard<em> ‘Aaisha </em>say that the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: (he then mentioned the first portion of the <em>hadeeth</em> [mentioned in the beginning], then he said) – I today have the means to spend and I don’t fear the people (that they would protest against this change).’ So he expanded it by five cubits (around two and a half meters) of area from the side of <em>al-Hijr</em> until it appeared as the original foundation (upon which <em>Ibraaheem</em> had built the <em>Ka’bah</em>), and the people saw it; and it was upon this foundation that he raised the wall. The length of the <em>Ka’bah</em> was eighteen cubits (around nine meters), and when he had expanded it, he found it to be short (since the addition was made to its width, so naturally the length appeared to be small compared to its width). Therefore, he expanded its length by ten cubits (around five meters). He also constructed two doors, one of which (was meant) for entrance and the other one for exit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, when <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> was killed, <em>al-Hajjaaj </em>wrote to <em>‘Abd ul-Malik bin Marwaan </em>informing him about it, and telling him that <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> had built (the<em> Ka’bah</em>) on the very foundation (which was laid by <em>Ibraaheem</em>) and which reliable persons among the people of <em>Makkah</em> had seen. Then, <em>‘Abd ul-Malik</em> wrote to him: ‘Indeed, we are not concerned with disgracing <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> in anything. As for what he added in the side of its length, keep it intact; and as for what he added from the side of <em>al-Hijr</em>, return it to its (previous) foundation, and close up the door which he opened.’ Thus, he (<em>al-Hajjaaj</em>) demolished it (that portion) and rebuilt it on its (previous) foundation.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>*</strong>the translation of the above <em>hadeeth</em>, for the most part, was taken directly from the already translated text of <em>saheeh</em><em> muslim</em><strong>*</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>shaykh al-albaani</em> continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“That is what <em>al-Hajjaaj</em> the oppressor did by the command of<em> ‘Abd ul-Malik</em> the mistaken one, and I don’t think that his regret later on clears him of his mistake. <em>Muslim</em> and <em>Abu Na’eem</em> have also narrated from <em>‘Abdullaah bin ‘Ubayd</em> who said: <em>Al-Haarith bin ‘Abdillaah</em> came to <em>‘Abd ul-Malik bin Marwaan</em> as an envoy during his <em>Khilaafa</em> (Caliphate), and<em> ‘Abd ul-Malik</em> said, ‘I don’t think that<em> Abu Habeeb</em> (i.e., <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em>) heard from<em> ‘Aaisha</em> that which he claimed to hear from her.’ <em>Al-Haarith</em> said: ‘But yes, I [myself] heard it from her.’ He (<em>‘Abd ul-Malik</em>) said, ‘You heard her saying what?’ He (<em>Al-Haarith</em>) said, ‘She said: the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: (he then mentioned the <em>hadeeth</em>).’ <em>‘Abd ul-Malik </em> said to <em>Al-Haarith</em>, ‘You heard her saying this?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ Then, he (<em>‘Abd ul-Malik</em>) scratched the ground with his staff for a while and then said, ‘I wish that I had left it and not changed [the reconstructions carried out by<em> Ibn uz-Zubayr</em>].’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is in [another] narration from them both (<em>Muslim and Abu Na’eem</em>) from <em>Abu Qaz’ah </em>that: While <em>‘Abd ul-Malik</em> <em>bin Marwaan </em>was going around the House, he at that time said, ‘May Allaah fight <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> since he uttered a lie upon the mother of the believers, saying: I heard her say: (he then mentioned the <em>hadeeth</em>).’ So, <em>Al-Haarith bin ‘Abdillaah bin Rabee’ah</em> said, ‘Don’t say this O leader of the believers, for I [myself] heard the mother of the believers saying this.’ He (<em>‘Abd ul-Malik</em>) said, ‘If I had heard it before I demolished it (the <em>Ka’bah</em>), I would have left it upon what <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em> had built.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (<em>Shaykh al-Albaani</em>) say: it was (obligatory) upon him, before the demolition, to verify and to <strong>ask the people of knowledge</strong> about that, whether it was allowed for him to criticize <em>‘Abdullaah bin uz-Zubayr</em> and accuse him of uttering a lie upon the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>). And his truthfulness (<em>radi Allaahu ‘anhu</em>) became clear to<em> ‘Abd ul-Malik</em> by <em>Al-Haarith</em>‘s agreeing with it, as many a group from <em>‘Aaisha</em> (<em>radi Allaahu ‘anhaa</em>) agreed with it. And I have collected their narrations…in this <em>hadeeth</em>, and the <em>hadeeth</em> is detailed from<em> ‘Aaisha</em>. Therefore, I indeed fear that <em>‘Abd ul-Malik</em> had prior knowledge about the <em>hadeeth</em> before he demolished the House, but he pretended that he did not hear about it except through <em>Ibn uz-Zubayr</em>. So when <em>Al-Haarith bin ‘Abdillaah</em> opposed him, that he also had heard it (the <em>hadeeth</em>) from <em>‘Aaisha</em>, he (<em>‘Abd ul-Malik</em>) showed regret at what he had done, [but] it was too late for regrets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, it has reached us that there is an idea or plan to expand the area of <em>tawaaf </em>(circumambulation) around  the <em>Ka’bah</em> and transfer the <em>Maqaam Ibraaheem</em> (the Standing Place of <em>Ibraaheem</em>) (<em>‘alayhi ssalaat wa ssalaam</em>) to another place. So in relation to this, <strong>I suggest to those responsible (for the <em>Ka’bah</em>) that they hasten to expand the <em>Ka’bah</em> before everything (else) and rebuilt it upon the foundation of <em>Ibraaheem </em>(<em>‘alayhi ssalaat wa ssalaam</em>)</strong>, fulfilling the noble, honorable Prophetic wish in this<em> hadeeth</em>, and saving the people from the problems of crowding at the door of the <em>Ka’bah</em> which is witnessed every year, and from the domination of the guard over the door who prevents whoever he wishes from entering and allows whoever he wishes, for the sake of a few dirhams!”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:Are there any authentic Hadeeths that mention the virtues of Zamzam water?<strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are Hadeeths which indicate that Zamzam water is noble and blessed. In a Hadeeth confirmed in the Sahih, the Prophet (sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) said about Zamzam water:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed it is blessed, and that like food, it fills.&#8221; (Muslim no. 2473)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in Abu Dawud&#8217;s narration, there is this addition:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And a cure for illness.&#8221; (Abu Dawud At-Tiyalsi 2nd Volume no. 61)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this Hadeeth proves its virtues, that it is a <strong>filling food, a cure for illness, and that it is blessed.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sunnah is to drink it as the Prophet (sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) drank it, but it is also <em><strong>permissible to make ablution with it, to use it to purify yourself after you have relieved yourself, and if necessary, to take a shower using it when you are Junub (impure).</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is confirmed that on one occasion, water poured forth from between the Prophet&#8217;s fingers, and then people took what they needed from that water, using it to drink, to make ablution, to wash their clothes, or to purify themselves after relieving themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zamzam water may not be the same as the water that poured forth from between the Prophet&#8217;s fingers, but it is also not more blessed, for each has its place as pure water. If it is permissible to use the water that miraculously poured forth from between the Prophet&#8217;s fingers for all the purposes mentioned above, then it is also permissible in the case of Zamzam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh `Abdul-`Azeez Bin Baz<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> </b><b> Q 11:</b><b> What is the ruling on a person who performs `Umrah (lesser pilgrimage) before Hajj, although the former is only an act of Sunnah? </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> A: </b><span style="color:#008000;">The correct view of the two rulings of the scholars is that `Umrah is obligatory, because Allah states:Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 196<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" /><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span style="color:#008000;"> And perform properly (i.e. all the ceremonies according to the ways of Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him) the Hajj and â€˜Umrah (i.e. the pilgrimage to Makkah) for AllÃ¢h. </span></a><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" />There are also other Hadiths narrated in this regard. If a Muslim performs `Umrah before Hajj during the months of Hajj and performs Hajj in the same year, then he has performed Tamattu` Hajj (combining Hajj and `Umrah with a break in between) which is better than the Ifrad Hajj (performing Hajj only) and Qiran Hajj (combining Hajj and `Umrah simultaneously) for the one who has not brought a hadiy with him. It is reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) told the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) who did not bring sacrificial animals:<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" /><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span style="color:#008000;"> Make it `Umrah, for if I had formerly known what I came to know lately, I would not have driven the Hadiy with me and would have finished the state of Ihram along with the people when they finished it. </span></a><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" /></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The heart of the Prophet&#8217;s masjid houses a very special but small area named <i>ar-Rawdah an-Nabawiyah</i>, which extends from Muhammad&#8217;s tomb to his pulpit. Pilgrims attempt to visit and pray in ar-Rawdah, for there is a tradition that supplications and prayers uttered here are never rejected. Entrance into <i>ar-Rawdah</i> is not always possible (especially during the Hajj season), as the tiny area can accommodate only a few hundred people. <i>Ar-Rawdah</i> has two small gateways manned by Saudi police officers. The current marble pulpit was constructed by the Ottomans. The original pulpit was much smaller than the current one, and constructed of palm tree wood, not marble. <i>Ar-Rawdah an-Nabawiyah</i> is considered part of Jannah (Heaven or Paradise).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is prescribed for the one who visits the Prophet’s Mosque to pray two rak’ahs in the Rawdah or whatever he wants of naafil prayers, because it is proven that there is virtue in doing so. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: <b>“The area between my house and my minbar is one of the gardens ( <i>riyaad</i>, sing. <i>rawdah</i>) of Paradise, and my minbar is on my cistern (<i>hawd</i>)” </b>Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1196; Muslim, 1391.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it was narrated that Yazeed ibn Abi ‘Ubayd said: <b>“I used to come with Salamah ibn al-Akwa’ and he would pray by the pillar which was by the mus-haf, i.e. in the Rawdah. I said, ‘O Abu Muslim, I see that you are keen to pray by this pillar!’ He said, ‘I saw that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was keen to pray here.’”</b> Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 502; Muslim, 509.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Being keen to pray in al-Rawdah does not justify being aggressive towards people or pushing the weak aside, or stepping over their necks. </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Women who want to pray in Rawdah area can enter the masjid through the Gates 21 &#8211; 25. Rawdah area for women is open after Fajr, Zuhr and Isha Prayers. It is open after Fajar for long time and 15 &#8211; 20 min after Zuhr prayer</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fatwa by Shaykh Ibn Baz Fatawa Islamiyah , Darussalam, Vol 4, Page 127</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q. Is it better for the Muhrim to cover the two shoulders or to uncover one of them during the Ihram?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. The sunnah for the Muhrim is that he places the Rida&#8217; (upper garment) over both of his shoulders and put its ends on his chest. This is the Sunnah and it is what the Prophet (Sallalahu Alahi wa Sallam) did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if the person wants to perform the Tawaf of Arrival (Tawaful-Qudum) , he does Al-Idhtiba&#8217;. This is by him placing the center of his Rida&#8217; under his right armpit and its edges over his left shoulder. Thus he uncovers his right shoulder. This is specifically for the Tawaf of Arrival, meaning when the person first arrives in Makkah for Hajj or &#8216;Umrah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then when he completes the Tawaf, he adjusts the Rida&#8217; and places it over both of his shoulders, and he prays two Rak&#8217;ahs of Tawaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The person who always keeps one shoulder uncovered, this is opposed to the Sunnah, and so is uncovering both of the shoulders. The Sunnah is only to cover both of them with the Rida&#8217; while the person is in Ihram. If the person takes off the Rida&#8217; and does not cover his shoulders while he is sitting or eating or talking with his brothers, there is no harm in that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the Sunnah is that when the person wears the Rida&#8217;, it should be over his two shoulders and its ends should be on his chest.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Iltizaam Between The Corner And The Door</b> ( from Rites of Hajj and Umrah &#8211; by Shaik Nasiruddin Albanee )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">38. And he may cling to the place between the corner and the Door &#8211; placing his chest and face and forearms upon this place.(45)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is narrated by two isnaads from the Prophet by which the hadith reaches the level of hasan &#8211; and is increased in strength by the fact that a group of the Sahaabah acted on it &#8211; from them Ibn &#8216;Abbaas &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with him &#8211; who said: &#8220;<strong>This is the Multazam between the Corner and the Door</strong>. And it is authentically narrated from &#8216;Urwah ibn az-Zubair also &#8211; see &#8216;As-Sahaabah, no.2138.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Ibn Taimiyyah said in his &#8216;Mansak&#8217; (p.387): &#8220;And if he wishes to come to the Multazam &#8211; and that is what is between the Black stone and the Door &#8211; and he places upon it his chest and face and forearms and hands &#8211; and makes du&#8217;aa &#8211; and he asks Allaah for whatever he needs &#8211; then he may do so. And he may do so before the Farewell Tawaaf there being no difference in this being at that time or any other &#8211; and the Sahaabah used to do so when they entered Makkah &#8211; and if he stands near the Door making du&#8217;aa without iltizaam of the House then that is also good, and when he leaves he does not stand or turn or walk backwards.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen</strong> (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a matter concerning which the scholars differed, although it was not narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) (i.e. that was not narrated in a saheeh hadeeth, as the ahaadeeth that were narrated concerning this were deemed to be da’eef or weak). Rather it was narrated from some of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them). So is iltizaam (clinging) Sunnah? When should it be done – upon arrival or when about to leave, or at any time?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason for this difference of opinion among the scholars is that it is not narrated in the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), rather the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) used to do that when they arrived in Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fuqaha’ said: He (the pilgrim) should do that when about to leave, and should cling to the multazam, which is the area between the corner where the Black Stone is located and the door…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Based on this, there is nothing wrong with iltizaam (clinging to the Ka’bah in this area) so long as that does not involve annoying others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 7/402, 403.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">

<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Ajwa Dates Keep Away Harm, Poison And Magic</h3>
<p>Ajwa (عجوة) is a soft dry variety of date fruit from Saudi Arabia. It is cultivated at Madina . A delightfully soft and fruity date with fine texture.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) said, “Whoever has seven Ajwa dates every morning he will not be harmed on that day by poison or magic.” [Saheeh al-Bukhaaree (5445) (5768) (5769) (5779)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) said, “Ajwa dates are from paradise.” [Tirmidhee (2068) he said hasan Saheeh and it was authenticated by Shaikh al-Albaani].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Referring to eating seven Ajwa dates, the Messenger (Sallallaahu Álayhi Wasallam) said, “He will not be harmed by anything until he reaches the evening.” [Saheeh Muslim (2047)].</p>

<p>Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr <strong>Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah</strong> (d.751 A.H.) -Rahimullaah- said:</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<blockquote><p>‘The Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- would not perform an extra Umrah exiting out of Makkah, after already having performed one, as many of the people do nowadays. Rather all the Umrahs that the Messenger performed were upon entering Makkah.</p>
<p>He -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- lived in Makkah for thirteen years after the revelation had first descended, and it is not reported from the outset about him that he performed Umrah exiting from Makkah in that time period.</p>
<p>So, the Umrah that the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- performed and legislated, is the Umrah of entering into Makkah, there is no Umrah for the person who is in Makkah and he goes outside the boundary of Makkah whereby he can enter again and perform Umrah. This was not ever done by anyone at the time of the Prophet, except by ‘Aeysha alone out of all those who were with her. This was because she had made the intention and entered into Ihram but had begun her menstrual cycle. So the Prophet ordered her to connect up her Umrah with the Hajj, and informed her that her Tawaf of the House and going between Safa and Marwa, would indeed be sufficient for her Hajj and Umrah together (instead of performing a separate Umrah).</p>
<p>So she found that her female companions were returning with a Hajj and a separate Umrah, since they had intended to perform Hajj at-Tamattu (with an Umrah and a Hajj), and they had not begun their menstrual cycle and did not have to combine their Umrah in with the Hajj. However, she would have only returned with an Umrah within her Hajj, so he -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- ordered her brother to take her to perform an Umrah from at-Tan’eem, to soothe her heart, and her brother did not perform an Umrah from Tan’eem in that Hajj nor did anyone else from those who were with him.’</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>[Taken from: ‘Zad al-Ma’ad’ 1/94]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani (d.1420A.H) -Rahimullaah- was asked:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">‘Is it permissible for me to perform Umrah twice in one journey, since I am from Jordan. The first one from Abyaar Ali (the local name for the Meeqat Dhul Hulayfah just outside Madina), and the second from at-Tan’eem (outskirts of Makkah), just like ‘Aeysha -Radhi Allaahu anha. If this is not permissible, then can I perform it for my deceased father or mother? May Allah reward you with goodness.</span></p>
<p><strong>The Shaykh answered:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>‘The person who wants to repeat an Umrah then it is necessary for him to return to the Meeqat from whence he entered into Ihraam, whether that is for his own self or for his parents.<br />
As for entering into Ihraam from at-Tan’eem, from whence the Noble lady ‘Aeysha entered into Ihraam, then this ruling is specific for ‘Aeysha and those who are in a similar condition to her.</p>
<p>I term this Umrah from at-Tan’eem as the Umrah of the menstruating woman. The reason for this is because when ‘Aeysha -Radhi Allaahu anha- went out with the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- to perform the farewell Hajj, and she had entered into Ihraam to perform Umrah, but when she reached a place close to Makkah, known as ‘Sarif’ the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- entered upon her and found her crying. So he said to her:</p>
<p>مالك أنفست</p>
<p>‘Why are you crying? Have you started your menstrual cycle?’</p>
<p>She replied: ‘Yes, O Messenger of Allaah.’</p>
<p>He –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said:</p>
<p>هذا أمر قد كتبه الله على بنات آدم، فاصنعي ما يصنع الحاج غير ألَّا تطوفي ولا تصلي</p>
<p>‘This is a matter which Allaah has written for the daughters of Adam, so do that which the person performing Hajj does, except do not perform the Tawaf and do not perform the Salat.’</p>
<p>So she did not perform the Tawaf or the Salat until she had become clean in Araafat, then she continued with the rites of Hajj and accomplished Hajj completely. When the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- had decided to travel and return to Madina, he entered upon ‘Aeysha in her tent and again he found her crying.</p>
<p>He asked her: ‘What is wrong with you?’</p>
<p>She said: ‘What is wrong with me? The people are returning with Hajj and Umrah, and I am returning with Hajj without Umrah.’</p>
<p>The reason was because her menstruation had caused her Umrah to be changed to a Hajj, a Hajj Mufrad (Hajj without Umrah), so here she is saying, she is crying out of grief of what she missed out from performing an Umrah before performing the Hajj, whereas her co-wives like Umm Salamah and other than her, returned with Umrah and Hajj, and that is why was crying.</p>
<p>She said: ‘Why should I not cry? The people are returning with a Hajj and Umrah and I am returning with a Hajj.’ So the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- had compassion on her and ordered her brother AbdurRahmaan bin Abi Bakr as-Siddiq to accompany her, with him on his camel and go out with her to at-Tan’eem. So he did that and she returned, and performed an Umrah and soothed her soul.</p>
<p>This is why we say, if a woman is afflicted with that which had afflicted ‘Aeysha from amongst the women, whereby her menstrual cycle started, while she wanted to perform Umrah, and she could not complete the Umrah, so that her Umrah was changed into a Hajj. So here a woman can perform Umrah in place of what she missed out on, in the same way that Allaah legislated upon the tongue of His Messenger for ‘Aeysha, so the woman who was menstruating goes out again to at-Tan’eem and comes and performs an Umrah.</p>
<p>As for men then, Alhamdulillah they do not menstruate so they do not take the ruling of the menstruating woman. The proof is, as some of the scholars of Seerah and history of the Companions, say: a hundred thousand Companions performed Hajj with the Messenger, not one of them did an Umrah the like of the Umrah of ‘Aeysha -Radhi Allaahu anha, so if that was something good then they would have proceeded us in that action. Therefore, the person who wants to perform an Umrah returns to the Meeqat and enters into Ihraam from there, whether for himself or for his mother and father.</p>
<p>This is sufficient and praise be to Allaah Lord of all the worlds.’</p></blockquote>

<p style="text-align:justify;">It was reported in <em>Sahih Muslim</em> that the Prophet, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, said to Abu Dharr, who had stayed near the <em>Ka&#8217;bah</em> and its coverings for forty days and nights with no food or drink other than (Zamzam), &#8220;How long have you been here?&#8221; Abu Dharr said, &#8220;I have been here for thirty days and nights.&#8221; The Prophet, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, said, &#8220;Who has been feeding you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have had nothing but Zamzam water, and I have gotten so fat that I have folds of fat on my stomach. I do not feel any of the tiredness or weakness of hunger and I have not become thin.&#8221; The Prophet, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, said, &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Verily, it is blessed, it is food that nourishes</strong></span>.&#8221; [Narrated by <em>Imam</em> Muslim, 2473]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Hamad al-Ansaari</strong> (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I searched for the origin of what people say these days of al-Madina ‘al-Munawarah’ and I found that the first people to label it ‘al-Munawarah’ were the ‘Uthmaanyoon’.  As for the Companions and the Successors and those after them, then for many centuries they called it al-Madina an-Nabaweeyah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>AbdulAwal bin Hamad al-Ansaari</strong> commented:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I noticed from my father -Rahimullaah- that if he saw a person write ‘al-Munawarah’, he would say to him to wipe out the word ‘al-Munawarah’ and write ‘an-Nabaweeyah.’[28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed the people of knowledge apply the term ‘an-Nabaweeya’ to al-Madina.’[29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Applying the word ‘al-Munawarah’ after the word al-Madina was introduced by the non-Arabs.  What was well known by the Companions and the Successors was the addition ‘an-Nabaweeyah’. Likewise, adding the term ‘<strong>al-Mukkarama</strong>’ to Makkah is not known.’[30]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Making Takbir, then du&#8217;aa to Allaah after praying two rak&#8217;ah inside the Ka&#8217;bah (Hijr) is a Sunnah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question: Is salat inside the Ka&#8217;bah in any way superior to salat outside it, and is it permissible for a person to speak of what he has seen inside the ka&#8217;bah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer by The Permanent Committee: Salat inside the Ka&#8217;bah is preferred, if it is possible to do so without any inconvenience, difficulty or harm to anyone, as the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) entered it and prayed therein, according to an authentic narration in the Sahihain (Two Sahihs). And it has been reported from him (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) that he came out one day looking sad, and he said: &#8220;<strong>Verily, I fear that I may have placed a burden upon my Ummah (i.e. by entering the ka&#8217;bah).</strong>&#8221; [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when &#8216;A`ishah (radiallaahu &#8216;anha) asked him about salat in the Ka&#8217;bah, he said: &#8220;<strong>Pray in the Hijr, because it is a part of the House.</strong>&#8221; [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>This proves that salat inside the Ka&#8217;bah is preferred and is a means of drawing close (to Allaah) and an act of obedience, and in it is great merit.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, it is not fitting that there should be crowding, or harm, or doing anything which causes difficulty to him or to the people. It is enough for him to pray in the Hijr, because it is a part of the House; and there is no objection to speaking about what he has seen inside the Ka&#8217;bah, such as its inscriptions, or what is on its ceiling or the like. There is no objection to a person talking and saying: &#8220;I saw such and such and such and such.&#8221; There is no sin in that.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Sunnah, when one enters the Ka&#8217;bah, is to pray two rak&#8217;ahs and to say &#8220;Allaahu Akbar&#8221; and invoke Allaah, the Almighty, the All-Powerful with whatever supplications are easy for him at the end of it, especially those which have been reported (from the Prophet, salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) because the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) entered the Ka&#8217;bah and prayed therein, then he performed Takbir and supplicated Allaah. All of this has been authentically reported from him (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam).</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhârî reports that ‘Umar – Allâh be pleased with him – came to the Black Stone (performing tawâf, circumambulation), kissed it, and said, “I know that you are a stone, you do not cause benefit or harm; and if it were not that I had seen Allâh’s Messenger – peace and blessings of Allâh be upon him – kiss you, I would never have kissed you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhârî, <em>Al-Sahîh, </em>Chapter on what has been said about the Black Stone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Points to note</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">· The illustrious Companion and Caliph ‘Umar reminded us in this narration of the pure belief that benefit and harm are not caused by created objects and thus should not be sought from them. Only Allâh has control over these things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">· We are reminded that acts of worship are taken from Allâh’s Messenger, and a person is not supposed to make up his own way of worship, he must follow the manner of worship that the Prophet taught and practiced.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">· We also learn that once an action is confirmed in the Sunnah, the believer submits and complies and practices it because it is confirmed that Allâh’s Messenger did it, even if we don’t know the wisdom behind it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">· This narration is also an example of how a responsible person tries to clarify and do away with any misunderstandings that people may have about matters of faith. The people had recently left their unbelief and polytheism, so ‘Umar wanted to make it clear that kissing the Black Stone is by no means done as an act of devotion to it, as people used to do with their stone idols.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Sahih Bukhari</strong> Volume 4, Book 55, Number 583: </em></p>
<p>Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first lady to use a girdle was the mother of Ishmael. She used a girdle so that she might hide her tracks from Sarah. Abraham brought her and her son Ishmael while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka&#8217;ba under a tree on the spot of Zam-zam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in Mecca, nor was there any water So he made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Ishmael&#8217;s mother followed him saying, &#8220;<em><span style="color:#008000;">O Abraham! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?</span></em>&#8221; She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her Then she asked him, <em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Has Allah ordered you to do so?&#8221;</span></em> He said, <span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</em> </span>She said, <em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Then He will not neglect us,&#8221;</span></em> and returned while Abraham proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniya where they could not see him, he faced the Ka&#8217;ba, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Your Sacred House (Kaba at Mecca) in order, O our Lord, that they may offer prayer perfectly. So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks.&#8217;</span> </em>(14.37) Ishmael&#8217;s mother went on suckling Ishmael and drinking from the water (she had).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him (i.e. Ishmael) tossing in agony; She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached the Marwa mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between Safa and Marwa) seven times.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, <em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;This is the source of the tradition of the walking of people between them (i.e. Safa and Marwa).&#8221; </span></em>When she reached the Marwa (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, &#8216;O, (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?&#8221; And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zam-zam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet added, <em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;May Allah bestow Mercy on Ishmael&#8217;s mother! Had she let the Zam-zam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zam-zam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet further added, <em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, &#8216;Don&#8217;t be afraid of being neglected, for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah never neglects His people.&#8217;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The House (i.e. Kaba) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kada&#8217;. They landed in the lower part of Mecca where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said, &#8216;This bird must be flying around water, though we know that there is no water in this valley.&#8217; They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came (towards the water).&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;Ishmael&#8217;s mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, &#8216;Do you allow us to stay with you?&#8221; She replied, &#8216;Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water.&#8217; They agreed to that.&#8221; The Prophet further said, &#8220;Ishmael&#8217;s mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent residents there. The child (i.e. Ishmael) grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After Ishmael&#8217;s mother had died, Abraham came after Ishmael&#8217;s marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmael&#8217;s wife about him, she replied, &#8216;He has gone in search of our livelihood.&#8217; Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied, &#8216;We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution,&#8217; complaining to him. He said, &#8216;When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house).&#8217; When Ishmael came, he seemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, &#8216;Has anyone visited you?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;Yes, an old man of so-and-so description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were living in a hardship and poverty.&#8217; On that Ishmael said, &#8216;Did he advise you anything?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the threshold of your gate.&#8217; Ishmael said, &#8216;It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family.&#8217; So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (i.e. Jurhum).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmael&#8217;s wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, &#8216;He has gone in search of our livelihood.&#8217; Abraham asked her, &#8216;How are you getting on?&#8217; asking her about their sustenance and living. She replied, &#8216;We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance).&#8217; Then she thanked Allah&#8217; Abraham said, &#8216;What kind of food do you eat?&#8217; She said. &#8216;Meat.&#8217; He said, &#8216;What do you drink?&#8217; She said, &#8216;Water.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Allah! Bless their meat and water.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca.&#8221; The Prophet added,&#8221; Then Abraham said Ishmael&#8217;s wife, &#8220;When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate.&#8217; When Ishmael came back, he asked his wife, &#8216;Did anyone call on you?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;Yes, a good-looking old man came to me,&#8217; so she praised him and added. &#8216;He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in a good condition.&#8217; Ishmael asked her, &#8216;Did he give you any piece of advice?&#8217; She said, &#8216;Yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate.&#8217; On that Ishmael said, &#8216;It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to keep you with me.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them afterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Abraham, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father). Abraham said, &#8216;O Ishmael! Allah has given me an order.&#8217; Ishmael said, &#8216;Do what your Lord has ordered you to do.&#8217; Abraham asked, &#8216;Will you help me?&#8217; Ishmael said, &#8216;I will help you.&#8217; Abraham said, Allah has ordered me to build a house here,&#8217; pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. the Ka&#8217;ba). Ishmael brought the stones and Abraham was building, and when the walls became high, Ishmael brought this stone and put it for Abraham who stood over it and carried on building, while Ishmael was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, &#8216;O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.&#8217; The Prophet added, <em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Then both of them went on building and going round the Ka&#8217;ba saying: O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.&#8221;</span></em> (2.127)</p>
