										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Haafiz `Abdul-`Azeem <strong>al-Mundhiree</strong> -rahimahullaah- (d. 656 H) said in &#8220;<strong>at-Targheeb wat-Tarheeb</strong>&#8221; [1] (The Book of Repentance and Abstention: Chapter (6): An encouragement upon Abstention (<strong>Zuhd</strong>) with regard to this world, and sufficing with a small amount from it):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And from Ibraaheem -meaning al-Ashtar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That death approached Aboo Dharr, whilst he was at ar-Rabadhah [2], so his wife wept. He said: “What causes you to weep?” She said: “I weep because I cannot do anything for you, and I have<strong> no cloth large enough to shroud you in</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: “Do not weep, for I heard Allaah&#8221;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) say one day, [and I was with him, in a group of people]: &lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#008000;">A man from amongst you will certainly die in a desert area: a group of the Believers will be present at his funeral.</span></strong> &gt;&gt; He said: “ So everyone who was along with me in that gathering has died within a group of people or separately [3] , and none from them remain except for me; and I am in a part of the desert, dying. So go out and watch the road, for you shall soon see what I say, for, by Allaah! I have not lied, nor have I been lied to.” She said: “ How can that occur, when the people travelling for Hajj have ceased?” He said: “ Watch the road.” He said: So whilst she was doing so, a group of people could be seen moving along quickly upon their riding camels, (looking) as if they were vultures [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the people came, until they stood over her, and said: “What is wrong with you?” She said:“ There is a man of the Muslims for you to shroud, and thus be rewarded for it.” They said: “Who is he?” She said: “Aboo Dharr.” So they declared that may their fathers and mothers be a ransom for him, and they hung their whips upon the necks of their camels, and they hastened to him. So he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> “Receive glad tidings, for you are the group about whom Allaah&#8221;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said what he said. So today I have entered the morning as you see me; and if I had a garment of mine that were sufficient to shroud me in, then I would not be shrouded in anything else besides it. So I implore you, by Allaah, let not a man from amongst you shroud me who has been a chief, a governor, or an official messenger.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So all of the people had attained something from that, except for a youth from the Ansaar who was with the people. He said: “ I am your companion: there are two garments in my travelling bag that were woven by my mother, and the newest of my garments are these two that I am wearing.” He said: “ You are my companion, [so you shroud me].”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Reported by Ahmad, and the wording is his, and its narrators are the narrators of the &#8220;Saheeh&#8221;; and by al-Bazzaar -with its like, in abridged form&#8230;”. Shaikh al-Albaanee said: &#8220;Hasan&#8221;.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] &#8220;Saheehut-Targheeb wat-Tarheeb&#8221; (3/295-296/no.3314) of Shaikh al-Albaanee &#8211; rahimahullaah, and the additions in square brackets were included by the Shaikh from the original hadeeth in the &#8220;Musnad&#8221; of Imaam Ahmad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] A village at a distance of three days journey from al-Madeenah, Aboo Dharr -radiyallaahu `anhu- took up residence here until his death in 32 H (&#8220;Mu`jamul-Buldaan&#8221;:1/24).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Shaikh al-Albaanee&#8221;s checked edition has the word &#8220;furqah&#8221;(separately), as occurs in some of the editions of the &#8220;Musnad&#8221;. In other editions of Musnad Ahmad, and in the &#8220;Daar ulHadeeth, Cairo edition of &#8220;at-Targheeb&#8221; there occurs here &#8220;qaryah&#8221; (a village); and in &#8220;alFathur-Rabbaanee&#8221; (no. 11, 916) there occurs &#8220;rifqah&#8221;(amongst companions).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Shaikh al-Albaanee said: “ Perhaps the angle of their resemblance to vultures was on account of their having the dirt of travelling upon them.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Source</strong>: <strong><a title="Permanent Link to Sufism : Origin and Development  – Dr. Saleh As-Saleh" href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2015/04/12/sufism-origin-and-development-dr-saleh-as-saleh/" rel="bookmark">Sufism : Origin and Development </a>– Dr. Saleh As-Saleh</strong> (e-Book)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The call for Zuhd in Islam is to lead a pious life devoted to Allaah (Azza wa Jal) taking the least that is sufficient of the lawful things of life. It does not mean to abandon lawful means of earning, property, children, etc. nor exaggerating in performing acts of worship. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>O Children of Adam! Take your adornment [by wearing your clean clothes] while praying and going round [the Tawaaf of] the Ka’bah, and eat and drink but waste not by extravagance, certainly He [Allaah] likes not the extravagants.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Say [O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم]: “Who has forbidden the adoration with clothes given by Allaah, which He has produced for his slaves, and At-Tayyibaat [all kinds of Halaal things] of food?” Say: “They are, in the life of this world, for those who believe, [and] exclusively for them [believers] on the Day of Resurrection [the disbelievers will not share them].” Thus We explain the Aayaat [Islamic laws] in detail for people who have knowledge. </em></span>[Qur’aan, Soorat Al-’Araaf, 7:31-32].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Azza wa Jal) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>But seek with that [wealth] which Allaah has bestowed on you, the home of the Hereafter, and forget not your portion of legal enjoyment in this world, and do good as Allaah has been good to you, and seek not mischief in the land. Verily Allaah likes not the Mufsideen [those who commit great crimes and sins, oppressors, tyrants, mischiefmakers, corrupted people].</em></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Qasas 28:77].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Sa’d Bin Abee Waqqaas [33] asked the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) whether he can will all of his property in charity, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) told him to give only one third of it and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“One third is too much. It is better for you to leave your inheritors wealthy than to leave them poor, begging from others.” [34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) invoked Allaah (Azza wa Jal) to grant abundant wealth to Anas Bin Maalik :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas : My mother said, “O Allaah’s Messenger! Please invoke Allaah on behalf of your servant (i.e. Anas ).” He said: “O Allaah! Increase his wealth and children, and bestow your blessings on whatever you give him.”35 There are many other texts in the Qur’aan and (or) Sunnah which teach the medium course of this Deen in its acts of worship as well as in its codes for living this life in the way that pleases Allaah (Azza wa Jal).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In contrast, we find that the Soofee type of Zuhd opposes the essence of true Zuhd laid down in the Qur’aan, authentic Sunnah, and as understood by the Salaf, mainly that it is a renunciation of that which is of no benefit in the Hereafter. Consider, for example, some of the so-called Soofee Zuhd:(2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(2) Poverty, hunger, abandonment of lawful things and of Hadeeth, and other strange things:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Soofee master said, “I like for the beginner not to make his heart busy with the matter of earning (i.e. a living), otherwise he would change.” [36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another master said, “I have attained this state (of Soofee knowledge) by means of a hungry stomach and a naked body.”37(!)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A call to abandon marriage and the seeking of hadeeth−knowledge is attributed to the “Soofee master” AlJunayd.[38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Ghazaalee also related the same saying of AlJunayd: “I like for the starting Mureed (Soofee disciple) not to occupy his heart in three things, otherwise his condition will change (he then named them as): (1)-Seeking to gain sustenance, (2)-Seeking knowledge of Al-Hadeeth, and (3)- Marriage.”[39]!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Within Soofee sources we find the following statement: “Hunger is the food of the Zaahideen!” [40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abdul Wahaaab Ash-Sha’raanee, an authority on Soofism in the eyes of the Soofis reported that Rabaah Bin ‘Amr AlQayeesee said: “A man would not attain the levels of the Siddeeqeen [41] until he leaves his wife as if she was a widow, his kids as if they were orphans, and takes refuge in dog houses!” [42]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to Ash-Sha’raanee, Ibraaheem Bin ‘Usayeefeer was, “A man having a great deal of Kashf &#8230;He used to come to the town riding a wolf or a hyena, and to walk on water having no need for a boat; his urine was as white as milk&#8230;Most often he slept in a church, and he used to say: the Christians, unlike Muslims, do not steal shoes in the church.”[43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He invalidated the fasting of the Muslims who ate chicken and mutton meat. Only those who, like the Christians, do not eat mutton meat, their fast is correct as far as ‘Usayeefeer is concerned! [44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A story of another “Soofee”, Ibn Al-Kurainee, the teacher of Al-Junayd in which he says that he subdued himself into humiliation for twenty years until it became like that of a dog! [45]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to the Soofee sources, Abu Yazeed, an example for many Soofis, devoted himself to Allaah and he had the determination to restrain himself from drinking water and from sleeping for one year! [46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ash-Sha’raanee also reported that one of the celebrated Soofee so-called Awliyaa’ by the name of ‘Abdur Rahmaan Al-Majthoob, “Cut off his own private part in the beginning of his Jathbah (a mystic Soofee state of Jathb)”! [47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also reported that another Soofee mystic by the name of Yaaqut Al-‘Arshee (d.707 AH/1307 C.E.) married the daughter of his sheikh Abul ‘Abbaas Al-Mursee. She stayed with him for eighteen years but he never touched her being shy from her father. He left her while she was still a virgin! [48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are only few cases presented in order to expose this early deviation in Soofism.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[33] Sa’d Bin Abee Waqqaas, one of the early sahaabah who accepted Islam and one of the ten companions whom the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) brought good news that they would enter Al-Jannah. He shared in the battle of Badr and Uhud and was one of the six members of the Shoora counsel which ‘Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab chose to appoint the new Khaleefah after ‘Umar was stabbed. He was the first to shoot an arrow at the Mushrikeen in Jihaad. He lead the Muslims in taking over ‘Iraaq from the Persians after defeating them in the battle of Al-Qaadisiyyah in the 15th year of Hijrah (634 C.E.) He died in 55th year of Hijrahh (675 C.E.).

See Ihsaan Elaahee Thaheer’s At-Tasawwuf, Al-Mansha’ Wal Masdar [Lahore, Pakistan: Idaarat Turjumaan As-Sunnah, (1st edition), 1406 AH/1986 C.E.)], p. 100. Ihsaan quoted the text from Tabaqaat Ash-Sha’raanee, 1:7, printed by Daar Al-’Ilm Liljamee’ and Al-Matba’ah Al-’Aamiryyah Al-’Uthmaaniyyah, Cairo, 1305AH/1887 C.E..

[44] Ibid, p. 90, from Tabaqaat-I, 2:140.<br />
[45] Qutul Quloob, vol. 2, p. 74. This is contained in the “most influential book” of Abu Taalib Al-Makki, as some Soofis refer to it. In Qutul Quloob (V. 4, p. 71) there is the story of “special people” in Basra who if they “would ask Allaah to hold off the establishment of the Hour, He would do so!” Al-Ghazaalee commented: “In themselves these are conceivable matters!” Reported in his Ihyaa’, vol. 4, p. 356.<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">1- From Maymoon who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I entered upon Ibn Umar <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> and I added up everything that was in his house from a bed or a blanket or a rug and I found that it was only equivalent to one hundred Dirham! !’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Zuhd – by Abu Dawood / 294]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- From Abu Hamza who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I said to Ibraheem, verily Farqad as-Subkhee does not eat meat, and he does not eat such and such food.’ Ibraheem said: ‘The Companions of Muhammad <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> were better than him and they used to eat meat and clarified butter, and such and such food.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Mussanaf  &#8211; 7/236]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – From Sha’abee who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘No one leaves a thing in the Dunyaa for the sake of Allaah except that Allaah gives him that which is good for him in the Hereafter.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Hileeyah – 4/312]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- From Jafar who said: ‘I heard Malik bin Dinaar saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Concern for the Hereafter leaves your heart due to the amount you grieve over the Dunyaa and concern for the Dunyaa leaves your heart due to the amount that you grieve over the Hereafter.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Zuhd – by Ahmad /387]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 – From al-Hasan al-Basari who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed the believer in this Dunyaa is like a stranger, he does not surrender to the humiliation of the Dunyaa, nor does he compete with the people of the Dunyaa for the honour of this Dunyaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people according to him are relaxing, while his soul according to himself is busy (with the Hereafter). As a result Toobah (a tree in Paradise) is for the slave of Allaah who earns goodness and submits a virtuous action for a day when he will be poor and in need. (i.e. the Day of Judgment.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Zuhd by Ahmad 333/Muhasib an-Nafs by Ibn Abi Dunyaa 78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 – From Yahya bin Mu’adh who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘We will not achieve everything that we wish from the Dunyaa however, we just submit our good actions for the Hereafter, as for the Day of Judgment, we do not know what our condition will be.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Hileeyah – 10/56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7 – From Bilal bin Sa’ad who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O people of piety, you have not been created in order to become extinct, however you will transfer from one land to another land, just as you transferred from the loins to wombs, and from wombs to this Dunyaa, and from the Dunyaa to graves and from the graves to the area of standing (Day of Judgment) and from that area to eternity in Paradise or Fire.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Seera ‘Aalaam 5/91]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8 – From Malik bin Dinaar who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The worldly people leave this Dunyaa without having tasted the best thing in the Dunyaa.’ It was asked and what is that thing?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘Knowing Allaah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Seera ‘Aalaam 5/236]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9 – From Malik bin Dinaar, that a thief entered upon Malik bin Dinaar but did not find anything to steal, whereby Malik called out to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘You won’t find any worldly thing to take, however, do you desire something for the Hereafter?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Thief answered: ‘Yes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Malik said: ‘Make Wudu and pray two Rakah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he did likewise, then Malik sat for a while and went out to the Masjid and the thief went with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Malik was asked: ‘Who is this?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘He came to steal from us but we ended up stealing him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Seera ‘Aalaam 4/190]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10 – From Hatim al-Assam who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Sadness has two aspects: Sadness that is in your favour and Sadness that is against you, as for the sadness which is against you, then it is for everything which passed you by of the Dunyaa and you were saddened as a result of that, therefore this is against you.  As for everything that passed you by of the Hereafter and you were Saddened as a result of that, then that is in your favour.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The explanation of this is; if you had two Dirham and you lost both of them, and you were saddened as a result of that, then this is a sadness for the sake of the Dunyaa, and if an error, shortcoming or jealousy is committed or something causing sadness and regret (due to that error etc.) then that is in your favour.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Hileeyah – 8/77]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11 – From Rabee’a who said: Shafi’ee said to me:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Adhere to Zuhd, since Zuhd for a Zahid is better than jewelry on a mature woman!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Seera ‘Aalaam 10/36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12 – From Wahab bin Munabbih who said: Malik ibn Dinaar said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘A man asked a person who was higher in status in terms of knowledge than himself: ‘How big shall I build my home? The person answered: ‘That which is sufficient to shelter you from the sun and protect you from a lot of rainfall.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man asked: ‘How much food should I eat?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘Enough not to remain hungry and less than being satisfied.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man asked: ‘How much shall I laugh?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘Enough to bring colour to your face but not enough to hear your voice.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man asked: ‘How much shall I cry?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘Enough that you do not get bored from crying from the fear of Allaah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man asked: ‘How many of my good actions should I hide?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘So much so that the people think that you do not do any good actions.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man asked: ‘How many of my good actions shall I make known?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘Just enough to encourage a miser to do good actions (based on your example).’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Hileeyah – 4/45]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13 – From al-Fudayl who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘General Zuhd amongst people means that a person does not love people’s praise of him, nor does he not concern himself with their criticism.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continued:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If you are capable of not being known then do so, and do not look to the people if the people do not praise you. And it is not upon you that you are criticized if you are praised by Allaah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever loves to be mentioned then he is not mentioned, and whoever dislikes to be mentioned then he is mentioned.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Hileeyah – 8/88]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14 – From Ayoob Sakhteeyani who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘A man should fear Allaah – Subhana wa Ta’ala- if he has Zuhd then he should not make his Zuhd as a punishment upon the people, indeed it is better for a man to hide his Zuhd than to announce it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Hileeyah – 2/6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15  – From al-Hasan al-Basari who used to say, when a person who was attached to the Dunyaa was mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘ I swear by Allaah, he did not remain for the Dunyaa, nor did the Dunyaa remain for him, nor did he secure himself from its trials nor from its evil nor from its account, rather he left the Dunyaa in rags (a shroud).’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Hileeyah – 2/144]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16 – From al-Hasan who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O you youth, adhere to seeking the Hereafter, we have often seen a person seek the Hereafter and he achieves the Hereafter along with the Dunyaa, however we have not seen anyone who seeks the Dunyaa and by that he also gains the Hereafter along with the Dunyaa.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Zhud al-Kabeer /12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">17 – From al-Hasan who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed I met many people who were not overjoyed with what they received from the Dunyaa, nor would they grieve over what passed them by of the Dunyaa.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Hileeyah 6/270]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">18 –  From Abdullaah bin al-‘Aayzaar who said: Umar bin AbdulAziz gave us a Khutbah in Shaam  standing on a Mimbar made of mud, and he praised and glorified Allaah and then he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O you believers rectify your secret actions and your manifest actions will be rectified, work for the Hereafter in order to protect the affair of your religion.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Hileeyah 5/298]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19 – From Abdullaah bin Wahhab who said: I heard Sufyaan at-Thawri say in Makkah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Pleasing the people is a goal which cannot be achieved, and seeking the Dunyaa is a goal which cannot be achieved.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Hileeyah 6/386]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">20 – From Sufyaan bin Uayainah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Seeking from the Dunyaa what is necessary for yourself is not considered loving the Dunyaa.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Hileeyah 7/273]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">21 –  From Sufyan at-Thawri who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Zuhd of the Dunyaa is Zuhd of the people, and the foremost of that is Zuhd of yourself.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Seera ‘Aalaam 7/268]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">22 – From Abdullaah bin ‘Awn who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed those who were before us would give to the Dunyaa that which was left over after from their Hereafter, and you give to the Hereafter that which is left over from your Dunyaa.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Sifat as-Saffwa 3/101]</p>

Chapter 55<br />
Excellence of Leading an Ascetic Life, and Virtues of Simple Life</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Verily, the likeness of (this) worldly life is as the water (rain) which We send down from the sky; so by it arises the intermingled produce of the earth of which men and cattle eat: until when the earth is clad in its adornments and is beautified, and its people think that they have all the powers of disposal over it, Our Command reaches it by night or by day and We make it like a clean-mown harvest, as if it had not flourished yesterday! Thus, do We explain the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, laws, etc.) in detail for the people who reflect.&#8221;</b></span><b> (10:24)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And put forward to them the example of the life of this world: it is like the water (rain) which We send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth mingles with it, and becomes fresh and green. But (later) it becomes dry and broken pieces, which the winds scatter. And Allah is Able to do everything. Wealth and children are the adornment of the life of this world. But the good righteous deeds that last, are better with your Rubb for rewards and better in respect of hope.&#8221;</b></span><b> (18:45,46)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Know that the life of this world is only play and amusement, pomp and mutual boasting among you, and rivalry in respect of wealth and children. (It is) as the likeness of vegetation after rain, thereof the growth is pleasing to the tiller; afterwards it dries up and you see it turning yellow; then it becomes straw. But in the Hereafter (there is) a severe torment (for the disbelievers-evildoers), and (there is) forgiveness from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure (for the believers-gooddoers). And the life of this world is only a deceiving enjoyment&#8221;.</b></span><b> (57:20).</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Beautified for men is the love of things they covet; women, children, much of gold and silver (wealth), branded beautiful horses, cattle and well-tilled land. This is the pleasure of the present world&#8217;s life; but Allah has the excellent return (Jannah with flowing rivers) with Him.&#8221;</b></span><b> (3:14).</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;O mankind! Verily, the Promise of Allah is true. So let not this present life deceive you, and let not the chief deceiver (Satan) deceive you about Allah.&#8221;</b></span><b> (35:5).</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;The mutual rivalry (for piling up of worldly things) diverts you. Until you visit the graves (i.e., till you die). Nay! You shall come to know! Again nay! You shall come to know! Nay! If you knew with a sure knowledge (the end result of piling up, you would not have been occupied yourselves in worldly things)&#8221;.</b></span><b> (102:1-5).</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And this life of the world is only amusement and play! Verily, the home of the Hereafter is the real life if they but knew&#8221;.</b></span><b>  (29:64).</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>457.</b> `Amr bin `Auf Al-Ansari (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) sent Abu<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';"> `</span>Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah (May Allah be pleased with him) to Bahrain to collect (Jizyah). So he returned from Bahrain with wealth. The Ansar got news of it and joined with the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) in the Fajr prayer. When the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) concluded the prayer, they stood in his way. When he saw them, he smiled and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;I think you have heard about the arrival of Abu</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';"> `</span><span style="color:#0000ff;">Ubaidah with something from Bahrain&#8221;.</span> They said, &#8220;Yes! O Messenger of Allah!&#8221;. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Rejoice and hope for that which will please you. By Allah, it is not poverty that I fear for you, but I fear that this world will be opened up with its wealth for you as it was opened to those before you; and you vie with one another over it as they did and eventually it will ruin you as it ruined them&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>458.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) sat on the pulpit and we sat around him. He said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;What I am concerned most is the flourishment and the beauty of this world will be available to you&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>459.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The world is sweet and green (alluring); and verily, Allah is making you to succeed each other, generations after generations in it in order to see how you act. So beware of this world  and beware of women&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>460.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O Allah, there is no true life but the life of the Hereafter&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>461.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Three (things) follow a dead person: Members of his family, his property and his deeds. Two of them return; and one remains with him. The people and his wealth return; his deeds remain with him&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>462.</b> Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Among the inmates of Hell, a person who had led the most luxurious life in this world will be brought up on the Day of Resurrection and dipped in the Fire and will be asked: `O son of Adam! Did you ever experience any comfort? Did you happen to get any luxury?&#8217; He will reply: `By Allah, no, my Rubb.&#8217; And then one of the people of Jannah who had experienced extreme misery in the life of this world will be dipped in Jannah. Then he will be asked: `O son of Adam! Did you ever experience any misery? Did you ever encounter difficulty?&#8217; He will say: &#8220;By Allah, no my Rubb, I neither experienced misery nor passed through hardship&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>463.</b> Al-Mustaurad bin Shaddad (May allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;This world (i.e., its pleasures and duration) in comparison with the Hereafter is (similar to the amount of water) one gets when he puts his finger in the sea. Let him then see what it returns with&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>464.</b> Jabir bin `Abdullah (May allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was passing through the bazaar with his Companions on his both sides, when he saw a dead skinny lamb. He held its ear and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Who of you would like to have it for a dirham&#8221;.</span> They replied, &#8220;We do not like to get it for nothing, and what shall we do with it?&#8221;. Then he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) asked,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Would you like to have it for nothing?&#8221;.</span> They replied, &#8220;Had it been alive, it would have been defective because it is skinny; but when dead it is of no use&#8221;. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Truly, the world is more contemptible to Allah than this (the dead lamb) is to you&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>465.</b> Abu Dharr (May allah be pleased with him) reported: I was walking with the Prophet on the stony ground in Al-Madinah in the afternoon when Uhud Mount came into sight. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O Abu Dharr!&#8221;</span> I said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, here I am responding to you&#8221;. He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;If I had as much gold as the weight of Uhud, it would not please me to have a single dinar out of it with me after the passage of three days, but I would hold back something for the repayment of a debt. I would distribute it among the slaves of Allah like this and like this and like this.&#8221;</span> And he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) pointed in front of him, and on his right side and on his left side. We then walked a little further and he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The rich would be poor on the Day of  Resurrection, except he who spent like this and like this and like this,&#8221;. and he pointed as he did the first time. &#8220;But such persons are few&#8221;.</span> Then he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Stay where you are till I come back to you&#8221;.</span> He (the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) walked ahead a little further in the darkness of the night and disappeared from my sight. I heard a loud voice. I said (to myself): &#8220;The Messenger of Allah might have met (mishap or an enemy)&#8221;.<span style="color:#008000;"> I</span> wished I could go after him but I remembered his commanding me to stay till he came back<span style="color:#008000;">.</span> So I waited for him; and when he came, I made mention of what I had heard. He asked,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Did you hear it?&#8221;</span>. I said, &#8220;Yes&#8221;. Then he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;It was Jibril (Gabriel), who came to me and said: `He who dies among your Ummah without having associated anything with Allah (in worship) will enter Jannah.&#8217; I said: `Even if he committed illicit sexual intercourse or steals?&#8217; He (Jibril) said: `Even if he has committed illicit sexual intercourse or steals&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>466.</b> Abu Hurairah (May allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;If I had gold equal to Mount Uhud (in weight), it would not please me to pass three nights and I have a thing of it left with me, except what I retain for repayment of a debt&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>467.</b> Abu Hurairah (May allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Look at those who are inferior to you and do not look at those who are superior to you, for this will keep you from belittling Allah&#8217;s Favour to you.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the wording in Sahih Muslim. The narration in Al-Bukhari is: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)  said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;When one of you looks at someone who is superior to him in property and appearance, he should look at someone who is inferior to him&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>468.</b> Abu Hurairah (May allah be pleased with ihm) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;May he be miserable, the worshipper of the dinar and dirham, and the worshipper of the striped silk cloak. If he is given anything, he is satisfied; but if not, he is unsatisfied&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>469.</b> Abu Hurairah (May allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> I saw seventy of the people of the Suffah and none of them had a cloak. They had either a lower garment or a blanket which they suspended from their necks. Some (cloaks) reached halfway down to the legs and some to the ankles; and the man would manage to keep it in his hand to avoid exposing his private parts.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>470.</b> Abu Hurairah (May allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The world is the believer&#8217;s prison and the infidel&#8217;s Jannah&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>471.</b> `Abdullah bin `Umar (May allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) took hold of my shoulders and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Be in the world like a stranger or a wayfarer&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) used to say:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;When you survive till the evening, do not expect to live until the morning; and when you survive until the morning, do not expect to live until the evening; (do good deeds) when you are in good health before you fall sick, and (do good deeds) as long as you are alive before death strikes&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>472.</b> Sahl bin Sa`d As-Sa`idi (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A man came to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, guide me to such an action which, if I do Allah will love me and the people will also love me.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Have no desire for this world, Allah will love you; and have no desire for what people possess, and the people will love you.&#8221;</span><br />
[Ibn Majah]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>473.</b> An-Nu`man bin Bashir (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: `Umar bin Al-Khattab (May Allah be pleased with him) spoke at length regarding the worldly prosperity that people had achieved and said:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;I saw that the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) would pass his days in hunger and could not get even degraded dates to fill his stomach&#8221;.</span><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>474.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) died when my house was void of any edible thing except for a small quantity of barley I had on a shelf and from which I kept eating it for a long time. Then when I measured what was left of it, it soon finished.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>475.</b> `Amr bin Al-Harith (May Allah be pleased with him) the brother of Juwairiyah (May Allah be pleased with her), the Mother of believers) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> (When he died) Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) left neither a dinar nor a dirham nor a male slave nor a female slave, nor anything else except his white riding mule, his weapons and his land which he had given in charity to wayfarers.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>476.</b> Al-Khabbab bin Al-Aratt (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> We emigrated with Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) seeking the pleasure of Allah and expecting our reward from Him. Some of us died without enjoying anything of it. Among them was Mus`ab bin `Umair (May Allah be pleased with him), who was killed in the battle of Uhud, leaving only a small coloured sheet of wool (which we used as his shroud). When we covered his head with it, his feet were exposed, and when we covered his feet with it, his head was uncovered. So the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) told us to cover his head and to put some Idhkhir (i.e., fragrant grass) over his feet. Others among us enjoy prosperity.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>

The world is accursed and what it contains is accursed, except remembrance of Allah and those who associate themselves with Allah; and a learned man, and a learning person.&#8221;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>479.</b> `Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Do not crave for property lest you should be absorbed in the desire of worldly life.&#8221;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>480.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`as (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: We were repairing our thatchy hut when Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) passed by and asked us,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;What are you doing?&#8221;</span> We said, &#8220;The thatch had gone weak and we are repairing it.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;I see the sure thing (death) approaching sooner than this.&#8221;</span><br />

[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>482.</b> `Uthman bin `Affan (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;There is no right for the son of adam except in these (four) things: A house to live in, a cloth to cover therewith his private parts, bread and water.&#8221;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>483.</b>  `Abdullah bin Ash-Shikhkhir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> I came to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) while he was reciting (Surat At-Takathur 102):</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">&#8220;The mutual rivalry (for hoarding worldly things) preoccupy you. Until you visit the graves (i.e., till you die). Nay! You shall come to know! Again nay! You shall come to know! Nay! If you knew with a sure knowledge (the end result of hoarding, you would not have been occupied in worldly things). Verily, you shall see the blazing Fire (Hell)! And again, you shall see it with certainty of sight! Then (on that Day) you shall be asked about the delights (you indulged in, in this world)!&#8221;</span> (102:1-8)</p>

[At-Tirmidhi].</p>

Chapter 56<br />
Excellence of Simple Living and being Content with Little</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Then, there has succeeded them a posterity who have given up As-Salat (the prayers) [i.e., made their Salat (prayers) to be lost, either by not offering them or by not offering them perfectly or by not offering them in their proper fixed times] and have followed lusts. So they will be thrown in Hell. Except those who repent and believe (in the Oneness of Allah and His Messenger Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)), and work righteousness. Such will enter Jannah and they will not be wronged in aught.&#8221;</b></span><b> (19:59,60)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;So he went forth before his people in his pomp. Those who were desirous of the life of the world, said: `Ah, would that we had the like of what Qarun (Korah) has been given! Verily, he is the owner of a great fortune.&#8217; But those who had been given (religious) knowledge said: `Woe to you! The reward of Allah (in the Hereafter) is better for those who believe and do righteous good deeds&#8217;.&#8221;</b></span><b> (28:79,80)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Then, on that Day, you shall be asked about the delights (you indulged in, in this world)!&#8221;</b></span><b> (102:8)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Whoever desires the quick-passing (transitory enjoyment of this world), We readily grant him what We will for whom We like. Then, afterwards, We have appointed for him Hell; he will burn therein disgraced and rejected (far away from Allah&#8217;s Mercy).&#8221;</b></span><b> (17:18)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>491.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> The family of Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) never ate to the fill the bread of barley for two successive days until he died.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is: `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) said:<span style="color:#008000;"> Never did the family of Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) eat to the fill, since their arrival to Al-Madinah, the bread of wheat for three successive nights until his death.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>492.</b> `Urwah from `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported that she used to say to Urwah (May Allah be pleased with him)<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">:</span><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;O son of my sister, by Allah, I used to see the new moon, then the new moon, then the new moon, i.e., three moons in two months, and a fire was not kindled in the house of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam).</span> &#8220;I (`Urwah) said,<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;O my aunt, what were your means of sustenance?&#8221;</span> She said;<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Dates and water. But it (so happened) that Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) had some Ansar neighbours who had milch animals. They used to send Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) some milk of their (animals) and he gave that to us to drink.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>493.</b> Abu Sa`id Maqburi reported: Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him)<span style="color:#008000;"> said that he happened to pass by some people who had a roast lamb before them. They invited him, but he declined, saying: &#8220;The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) left the world without having eaten his fill with barley bread.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>494.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) neither ate on a dining cloth, nor ate soft bread throughout his life.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One narration adds:<span style="color:#008000;"> He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) never even saw a Samit lamb</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>495.</b> An-Nu`man bin Bashir (May Allah be pleased with them) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> I have seen your Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) when he did not find enough of even the inferior quality of dates to eat and fill his belly.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>496.</b> Sahl bin Sa`d (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) had never seen bread made out of fine flour throughout his life, since Allah commissioned him until his death.</span> He was asked,<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Did you not have sieves at the time of the Messenger of Allah?&#8221;</span> He replied,<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) never saw a sieve.&#8221;</span> He was asked,<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;How did you manage to eat barley bread made of unsieved flour?&#8221;</span> He said,<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8221;We used to ground it and then blew away the husk, and what remained we kneaded into dough.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>497.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) went out (of his house) one day, or one night, and there he met Abu Bakr and `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) also. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;What made you leave your houses at this hour?&#8221;</span> They said, &#8220;It is hunger, O Messenger of Allah.&#8221;    He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;By Him in Whose Hands my soul is, what made you leave, made me also leave,</span> so come along!&#8221; And he went along with them to a man from the Ansar, but they did not find him in his house. When the wife of that man saw the Prophet, she said, &#8220;You are most welcome.&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to her,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Where is so-and-so?&#8221;</span> She said, &#8220;He went to fetch some fresh water for us.&#8221; In the meantime, the Ansari came back, saw Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and his two companions and said: &#8220;Praise be to Allah, today no one has more honourable guests than I.&#8221; He then went out and brought them a bunch of date fruit, having dates, some still green, some ripe, and some fully ripe, and requested them to eat from it. He then took his knife (to slaughter a sheep). Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to him,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Do not kill a milch sheep.&#8221;</span> So he slaughtered a sheep for them. After they had eaten and drunk to their fill, Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to Abu Bakr and `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them),<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, you will certainly be questioned about this treat on the Day of Resurrection. Hunger brought you out of your homes, and you do not return to your homes till you have been blessed with this treat.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>498.</b> Khalid bin `Umar Al-`Adawi reported: `Utbah bin Ghazwan, the governor of Basrah, delivered a Khutbah. He praised Allah, glorified Him, then said:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Amma b`adu, verily, the world has been given the news of its end and is running to meet its end swiftly. Nothing is left out of it but a very little amount. Similar to the remainder in a dish whose owner is collecting it to drink; and you are going to move to an abode which knows no end, and you should proceed there with the good before you, for we have been informed (by the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) that a stone would be thrown at one side of the Hell and it would travel down for seventy years but would not reach its bottom. By Allah, it will be filled (with men and jinn). Do you find it strange? We have been informed (i.e., by the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) that the distance between two shutters of the gate of Jannah is forty years (distance). And a day would come when it would be fully packed; I was the seventh amongst the seven who had been with Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), and we had nothing to eat but the leaves of the tree until the sides of our mouth were injured. We found a sheet which we tore into two and divided between myself and Sa`d bin Malik. I made the lower garment with half of it and so did Sa`d. Today, there is none amongst us who has not become the governor of a city, and I seek refuge with Allah that I should consider myself great while I am insignificant to Allah.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>499.</b> Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) showed us a sheet and a thick lower garment</span> and said to us<span style="color:#008000;"> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was wearing them when he died.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>500.</b> Sa`d bin Abu Waqqas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> By Allah, I am the first Arab who shot an arrow in the Cause of Allah. We fought along with Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) when our food was only the leaves of Hublah and Samur trees (wild trees) until one of us would defecate like the droppings of sheep.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>501.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to supplicate:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O Allah, make the provisions of family of Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) bare subsistence.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>502.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: By Allah other than Whom there is none worthy of worship, I used to press my stomach against the earth owing to my hunger; I would tie a stone over it. One day, I was sitting on the way they usually take when the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) passed by me. When he saw me he smiled at me and knew my condition and my feelings. He called me and I replied, &#8220;At your service, O Messenger of Allah.&#8221; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Follow me.</span>&#8221; So I followed him. Having arrived at home, he sought permission and entered. He allowed me in and I, too, entered. He found milk in a bowl and asked,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Where is this from?&#8221;</span> He was told that it was a gift for him from so-and-so. He called me and I responded: &#8220;At your service, O Messenger of Allah.&#8221; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Go to the people of As-Suffah and usher them in.&#8221;</span> He Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) explained: The people of As-Suffah were guests of Islam; they had no family, no property and no relations. When Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to receive something in charity, he would send it to them without taking anything from it. When he received a present, he would send for them and share it with them. On this occasion, I disliked to give them anything. I said to myself: &#8220;This meagre quantity of milk will not be enough for all the people of As-Suffah! I am more deserving of it than anyone else. By drinking it I may attain some strength. When they come, he will order me to give it to them. I do not expect that anything will be left for me from this milk.&#8221; As there was no alternative but to obey Allah and His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). I went and called them. They came and sought permission which was granted. They took their seats. The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) called me and I responded, &#8220;At your service, O Messenger of Allah.&#8221; He then said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Take the milk and give it to them.&#8221;</span> I took the bowl and gave it to one man who drank his fill and returned it to me, and I gave it to the next and he did the same. I went on doing this till the bowl reached Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). By that time all had taken their fill. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) took the bowl, put it on his hand, looked at me, smiled and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Abu Hirr.&#8221;</span> I said, &#8220;At your service, O Messenger of Allah.&#8221; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Now you and I are left.&#8217;</span>&#8216; I said, &#8220;That is true, O Messenger of Allah.&#8221; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Sit down and drink.&#8221;</span> I drank, but he went on saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Drink some more.</span>&#8221; I said, &#8220;By Him Who has sent you with the Truth, I have no room for it.&#8221; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Then give it to me.&#8217;</span>&#8216; So I gave him the bowl. He praised Allah, uttered the Name of Allah and drank the remainder.<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>503.</b> Muhammad bin Sirin (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;I would fall in swoon between the pulpit of (the mosque of) Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and the chamber of `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) and every passer-by would put his foot on my neck thinking I was insane. I was not insane but I was awfully hungry.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>504.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> When Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) died, his armour was mortgaged with a Jew for thirty Sa` (measures) of barley.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>505.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> T</span>he Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) mortgaged his armour for a quantity of barley, and I took to him some barley bread and rancid fat. I heard him saying:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The family of Muhammad never possessed a measure of wheat from dawn to dusk although they were nine houses (to feed).&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>506.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> I saw seventy of the people of As-Suffah and none of them had a cloak. They had either a lower cloth or a blanket which they suspended from their necks. Some reached half way down to the legs and some to the ankles, and one of them would manage to keep it in his hand to avoid exposing his private parts</span>.<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>507.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> The mattress of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was a piece of tanned skin stuffed with palm fibres.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>508.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: We were once sitting in the company of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) when a man from the Ansar came and greeted. As he was leaving, Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to him,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O brother of the Ansar, how is my brother Sa`d bin `Ubadah?</span>&#8221; He replied, &#8220;He is well.&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) asked,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Which of you is desirous of visiting him?&#8221;</span> Having said this he got up and we followed him. We were ten and odd in number and we had neither shoes nor light boots nor caps nor shirts. We walked on foot through the barren plain till we came to the residence of Sa`d (May Allah be pleased with him). His people made way and Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) along with those who accompanied him went up to him.<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>509.</b> `Imran bin Husain (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The best of you, are my contemporaries, then those who follow them, then those who will come after them.</span> (`Imran said, I do not know if he said this twice or thrice).<span style="color:#0000ff;"> Then, they will be followed by those who will testify but will not be called upon to testify; they will betray the trust, and will not be trusted. They will make vows but will not fulfill them, and obesity will prevail among them.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>510.</b> Abu Umamah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O son of Adam, if you spend the surplus, it will be better for you; and if you retain it, it will be evil for you. You will not be reprimanded for storing what is enough for your need. First of all spend upon those who are your dependents.&#8221;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>511.</b> `Ubaidullah bin Mihsan Al-Ansari (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Whosoever begins the day feeling family security and good health; and possessing provision for his day is as though he possesed the whole world.&#8221;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>512.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`as (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Successful is the one who enters the fold of Islam and is provided with sustenance which is sufficient for his day&#8217;s needs, and Allah makes him content with what He has bestowed upon him.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>513.</b> Fadalah bin `Ubaid Al-Ansari (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) say:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Happiness is due to him who is guided to Islam and possesses provision that suffices him for his day and remains content.&#8221;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>514.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) went to bed hungry for several successive nights, nor did his family have a thing for supper for many consecutive nights; and their bread was mostly of barley.</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>515.</b> Fadalah bin `Ubaid (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: When Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) led Salat, some people would fall down from their standing posture out of extreme hunger. They were of the people of As-Suffah. The nomad Arabs would say that they were insane. After concluding Salat, Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) would turn to them and say,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;If you were to know what is in store for you with Allah, the Exalted, you would wish to augment your starvation and lack of provisions.&#8221;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>516.</b> Miqdad bin Ma`dikarib (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) say:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;No man fills a container worse than his stomach. A few morsels that keep his back upright are sufficient for him. If he has to, then he should keep one-third for food, one-third for drink and one-third for his breathing.&#8221;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>517.</b> Abu Umamah bin Tha`labah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Companions of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) mentioned the life of the world before him. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Do you not hear? Do you not hear? Simplicity (in life) is part of Faith, simplicity is part of Faith.&#8221;</span><br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>518.</b> Jabir bin `Abdullah (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) sent us in an expedition under the command of Abu<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';"> `</span>Ubaidah (May Allah be pleased with him) to intercept a caravan of the Quraish. He provided us with a bag of dates, apart from which he found nothing for us. Abu<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';"> `</span>Ubaidah (May Allah be pleased with him) gave each of us one date (every day). He (the narrator) was asked: &#8220;What did you do with that?&#8221; He said: We sucked that just like a baby and then drank water over that, and it was sufficient for us for the day until night. We beat off leaves with the help of our sticks, then drenched them with water and ate them. We then went to the seaside, when there appeared before us something like a big mound. We came near it and we found that it was a beast called Al-Anbar. Abu &#8216;Ubaidah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: &#8220;It is dead (so it useless for us).&#8221; He then said: &#8220;No (but it does not matter), we have been sent by Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) in the way of Allah and you are hard-pressed (on account of the scarcity of food), so you can eat that.&#8221; We, three hundred in number, stayed there for a month until we fattened up (having plenty to eat of that fish). He (Jabir) said: I saw how we extracted pitcher after pitcher full of fat from the cavity of its eye, and sliced from it compact piece of meat equal to a bull or almost like a bull. Abu &#8216;Ubaidah (May Allah be pleased with him) called thirteen men from us and he made them sit in the cavity of its eye, and he held one of its ribs and raised it erect and then saddled the biggest of the camels we had with us and it passed through it (the arched rib), and we carried large pieces of meat for use in our journey. When we came back to Al-Madinah we went to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and told him about that, whereupon he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;That was a sustenance Allah had brought forth for you. Do you have any piece of meat left with you, for us to eat.&#8221;</span> Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) said: We sent to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) some of that (meat) and he ate it.<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>519.</b> Asma&#8217; bint Yazid (May Allah be pleased with them) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> The sleeves of the shirt of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) reached his wrists.</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>520.</b> Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: On the day of the battle of Al-Khandaq (the Trench), we were digging the trench when a very hard boulder came in our way. The Companions went to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and told him about it. He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;I will go down the trench to see it.&#8221;</span> He stood up and it was noticed that he had tied a stone over his stomach due to intense hunger. We had not tasted anything for three days. He took up a spade and struck the hard rock with it and it turned into sand. I sought his permission to go home, (after reaching home I) said to my wife, &#8220;I have seen the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) in a state that I am unable to endure. Have you got anything in the house?&#8221; She said, &#8220;I have a small quantity of barley and a lamb.&#8221; I slaughtered the lamb, ground the barley and put the meat in the cooking pot. Then I went to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). In the meantime the flour had been kneaded and the meat in the pot was nearly cooked. I said to him, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, I have some food, will you come along with one or two Companions?&#8221; He asked,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;How many men should go there?&#8221;</span> I told him the number. He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;It will be better if they are more in number. Tell your wife not to remove the pot from the hearth nor the bread from the oven till I arrive.&#8221;</span> Then he said to the Muhajirun and the Ansar:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Let us go (to eat).&#8221;</span>  They all rose (and went with him). I went to my wife and said, &#8220;Bless you, the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), the Muhajirun, the Ansar and the whole company are coming.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Did he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) ask you?&#8221; I replied in the affirmative. (When they arrived) Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to his Companions,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Enter, but do not crowd in.</span>&#8221; Then he started breaking up the bread and putting meat on it. He would take from the pot and the oven then would cover them up, approach his Companions and hand it over to them. He would then go back and uncover the pot and the oven. He continued to break up the bread and put meat on it till all had eaten to their fill and still some of the food remained. Then he said to my wife,<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;</span>Eat from it, and send it as a present, for the people have been afflicted with severe hunger.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is: Jabir said: When the trench was being dug, I noticed the signs of hunger on the face of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). I returned to my wife and said to her, &#8220;Have you got anything in the house? I have seen the signs of severe hunger on the face of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam).&#8221; She brought out a bag which contained a Sa` (a measure that equals approximately 3kg.) of barley. We had a lamb which was reared in the home. I slaughtered the lamb and she ground the flour for baking bread. I then cut the meat and put it in the cooking pot. When I was returning to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), my wife said to me, &#8220;Do not embarass me before Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and his Companions.&#8221; (She said this because she thought that the food would not be enough for everyone, for how can very little food cater for a thousand people?) When I came to him, I said to him in a low tone, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), we have slaughtered a small lamb and have ground a Sa` of barley. Please accompany me with a few of your Companions<span style="color:#008000;">.</span>&#8221; Thereupon he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) announced in a loud voice,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O people of the Trench, Jabir has arranged a feast for you, so all of you are welcome.</span>&#8221; And addressing me he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Do not take the pot off the fire, nor bake the kneaded flour till I arrive.</span>&#8221; So I came home and he came ahead of the people. My wife said, &#8220;It will be a matter of disgrace for you (because there is not enough food).&#8221; I said, &#8220;I did only what you told me.&#8221; She brought out the kneaded flour and Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) spat into it, and invoked the blessing of Allah on  it, and then he spat into the cooking pot and invoked the blessing of Allah on it. Then he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Call another woman to help bake bread and let her take out from the cooking pot, but do not take it off the fire.&#8221;</span> There were about a thousand guests. All of them ate till they left the food and went off. Our pot still bubbled as before and the dough was being baked as before.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>521.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Abu Talhah (May Allah be pleased with him) said to (to his wife) Umm Sulaim(May Allah be pleased with her), &#8220;I noticed some weakness in the voice of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and I feel it was due to hunger. Have you got any food?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; So she brought out barley loaves, took off her head covering, in a part of which she wrapped these loaves and then put them beneath my mantle and covered me with a part of it. She then sent me to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). I set forth and found Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) sitting in the mosque in the company of some people. I stood near them whereupon Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) asked,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Has Abu Talhah sent you?</span>&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Thereupon he said to those who were with him to get up (and follow him). He went forth and so did I, ahead of them until I came to Abu Talhah and informed him. Abu Talhah said, &#8220;O Umm Sulaim, here comes Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) along with the people and we do not have enough (food) to feed them.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Allah and His Messenger know better<span style="color:#008000;">.</span>&#8221; Abu Talhah went out (to receive him) until he met Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), and he came forward along with him until they both (Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and Abu Talhah (May Allah be pleased with him) came in. Then Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) s<span style="color:#0000ff;">aid, &#8220;O Umm Sulaim, bring forth what you have with you.&#8221;</span> So she brought the bread. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) commanded that the bread be broken into small pieces and after Umm Sulaim (May Allah be pleased with her) had squeezed clarified butter out of a butter container and made it just like soup. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) recited over it what Allah wished him to recite. He then said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allow ten guests to come in.&#8221;</span> They ate until they had their fill. They then went out. He (Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) again said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allow ten (more to come in)&#8221;</span>, and he (the host) ushered them in. They ate to their fill. Then they went out. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) again said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allow ten (more),</span>&#8221; until all the people ate to their fill. They were seventy or eighty persons.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Another narration is: Anas said:<span style="color:#008000;"> When all had eaten, the remaining food was collected. It was as much as there was in the beginning.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet another narration is: Anas said:<span style="color:#008000;"> The groups of ten people ate by turn. After eighty persons had eaten, Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and the family of that house ate, and there was still a quantity left over.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is: Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I visited Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) one day, and found him sitting in the company of his Companions, with a belt tied over his waist. I asked,<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Why has Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) tied the belt on his waist?</span>&#8221; I was told,<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Due to hunger.&#8221;</span> I went to Abu Talhah (May Allah be pleased with him) the husband of Umm Sulaim (May Allah be pleased with her) and said,<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;O father, I have seen Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) with a belt tied over his waist</span>.<span style="color:#008000;"> I asked one of his Companions about the reason of it and he said that it was on account of severe hunger.</span>&#8221; Abu Talhah  (May Allah be pleased with him) went to my mother and asked,<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Have you got anything?</span>&#8221; She said,<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Yes.</span> I have a piece of bread and some dry dates. Were Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) to come alone, we could feed him his fill, but if he comes along with others, there would not be enough food.&#8221; Anas then narrated the Hadith in full.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>a) AbdurRahmaan bin Ali bin Muhammad Ibn Jawzi (d. 598 A.H.) said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Zuhd is not just leaving wealth or giving wealth to show that you are generous and strong, nor to get people’s hearts to incline to you, on the contrary Zuhd is leaving worldly things due to having the knowledge that it is insignificant in relation to the immeasurable value of the Hereafter.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Taken from: ‘Mukhtasir Minhaj al-Qasideen’ p.324]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>b) Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751 A.H.) -Rahimullaah- said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The intent of Zuhd is not rejection of having possessions, since in fact Sulayman and Dawood –alayhim as-Salaam- were the ones who had the most Zuhd from amongst the people at their time and they had been endowed with wealth, land and women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- had definitely the most Zuhd above all mankind, and he had nine women. ‘Ali bin Abi Taalib, AbdurRahman bin ‘Awf, Zubayr and Uthmaan -Radi Allaahu anhum- were from those who had Zuhd even though they had wealth, and there were many others like them.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Taken from ‘Madarij as-Salikeen’ by Ibn al-Qayyim (d. 751 A.H.) Volume 2/13-14)]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>c) Al-Hasan said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Having Zuhd of the Dunyaa is not prohibiting oneself from that which is Halaal, nor by wasting money, but it is knowing that what is in Allaah’s Hand is more trustworthy than one’s own-self and what he has in his hand (i.e. possesses).’</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Taken from ‘Madarij as-Salikeen’ by Ibn al-Qayyim (d. 751 A.H.) 285]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>d) Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali (d.795) -Rahimullaah- said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abu Sulayman said: <span style="color:#008000;">‘Do not testify for anyone that he has Zuhd, since indeed Zuhd is in the heart.’</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The noble <em>Shaykh Ahmad ibn Ahmad Shamlaan (hafidhahullaah)</em> explained that <em>Zuhud</em> is to renounce worldly pleasures in order to gain nearness to Allaah. It is to leave off what Allaah has made <em>haram</em> and to do that which Allaah has made obligatory. This concept is of tremendous importance in <em>Islaam</em> and the <em>Shaykh</em>presented this in the form of a comparison between the proper and upright <em>Zuhud</em> of the <em>Salaf</em> to the extreme and deviant practices of the <em>sufis</em>. The <em>Salaf</em> best understood and practiced this noble principle. They had reached the pinnacle of sincerity and devotion to Allaah and strict adherence to the <em>sunnah</em> of the Messenger <em>(sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam)</em>, performing all acts of worship in precise accordance to the legislated texts. The <em>Shaykh</em> showed the clear distinction of this to the absurd innovations of the <em>sufis</em> who went to such extremes in their <em>‘ibaadah</em>, out of their acclaimed piety, that many of their beliefs and practices fell into <em>kufr</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our <em>Shaykh Ahmad Shamlaan</em> <em>(hafidhahullaah)</em> continues in this lecture making distinct the falsehood of the<em>sufis</em> and the proper practice of our <em>salaf us saalih</em> in their implementation of <em>zuhud</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Wa Billaahi Tawfeeq</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Wa SallAllaahu wa Sallaama wa Barak &#8216;alaa Nabiyanna Muhammad wa &#8216;alaa &#8216;Alyhi wa Sahbyhi wa Sallam</em></p>
