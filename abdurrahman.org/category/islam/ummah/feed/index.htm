Translated by Abu <u>T</u>al<u>h</u>ah Dawud Burbank <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Author’s Introduction</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah, Lord of the worlds and may His praises and peace be upon the noblest of Messengers and upon his family and all his Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>To proceed:</strong> I have included in this treatise the answer to a question asked about that which has been named <em><strong>Fiqh ul- Waaqi&#8217;</strong></em> , its ruling, how great is the Muslims’ need for it and an explanation of its correct form in the <em>Sharee’ah</em>. The basis for this treatise was an unprepared answer in a sitting from the sittings of knowledge, in which there were, all praise is for Allaah, a number of Muslim youth keen to seek correct knowledge, drawn from the Book and the Sunnah, upon the <em>manhaj</em> of the <em>Salaf us- Saalih</em> (the Pious Predecessors), the best of this Ummah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of these brothers, may Allaah reward him with good, transcribed my words from cassette-tape and presented it to me. I corrected it, added to it and revised it for publication, such that its benefit would be more universal and of greater worth , if Allaah wills. I ask Allaah to make this brief treatise of benefit to it’s reader and to make it of use to those who seek it. Indeed He is the One. who hears and responds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad Naasir ud-Deen al-Albaanee<br />
Ammaan, 29th of Shawwaal 1412H.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Knowledge of Current Affairs</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah. We praise Him, seek His aid, seek His forgiveness and we seek Allaah&#8217;s refuge from the evil of ourselves and from our evil actions. Whosoever Allaah guides, then none can misguide him and whosoever Allaah misguides, then none can guide him. I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped but Allaah alone, having no partners and I bear witness that Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) is His slave and Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The nations are about to call each other and set upon you just as the diners sets upon food.” </strong></span><strong style="color:#000000;">It was said, Will it be because of our small number that day. </strong><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said, “Rather, on that day you will be many, but you will be like foam, like the foam on the river and Allaah will remove the fear of you from the hearts of your enemies and will throw weakness (<em>wahn</em>) into your hearts.” </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> Someone said, O Messenger of Allaah, what is <em>wahn</em>? </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said, “Love of the world and hatred for death.”</strong></span> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<em>Saheeh</em> &#8211; related by Abu Daawood (4297), ar-Rooyaanee in <em>al-Musnad</em> (2/ 134/25), Ibn Asaakir in <em>Taareekh Dimashq</em> (2/ 97/ 8) from Thawbaan &#8211;<em> radiallaahu ’anhu</em>. It was authenticated in <em>as-Saheehah</em> (958) of Shaikh al-Albaanee.]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The State of Affairs of the Muslims</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This noble prophetic hadeeth has manifested, with the strongest expression and clearest image, the very great trial (<em>fitnah</em>) that has come upon the Muslims, which has destroyed their unity, weakened their resolve and split their ranks. Part of this trial has struck at the root of the hearts of a great number of <em>du’aat</em> and students of knowledge so that they have become divided , regretfully, between themselves. Some of them speaking ill of others and the others criticizing the remainder and refuting them.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Recognizing the Truth through Refutation</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These rebuttals on their own, or these criticisms alone, will harm neither the one refuting, nor the one refuted. Since, with the people of Justice, the truth is recognized by its light and its proofs. This is not so with the people of blind-sectarianism and deviation. But what will harm them is speech without knowledge, talking without restraint and speaking untruthfully about the servants of Allaah!</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Matter of <em>Fiqh ul-Waaqi’</em></strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During this trial, various questions have sprung-up concerning <em>fiqh</em>, <em>manhaj</em> and <em>da’wah</em> and we were able to answer them at that time with answers backed by knowledge and all praise is for Allaah, the Most Perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Amongst the questions brought about by this trial, about which there had been much talk is that which some have decided to start calling F<em>iqh ul- Waaqi</em>. I do not argue concerning the form of this knowledge for which they have newly invented this name which is <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi’</em> , since many of the scholars have previously written that those who should take on the responsibility of guiding the Ummah and providing answers to their problems (that they) should be aware of and know their state of affairs. Therefore, from amongst those sayings well-known is: Passing judgement about a matter comes after comprehending it. This does not come about except by knowing the situation surrounding the matter under discussion. This is a basic principle of giving religious verdicts (<em>fataawaa</em>) in particular and from the principles of knowledge in general.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">S0 <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi</em>’, is to find out those things which are of importance to the Muslims from their affairs, or the plans of their enemies, in order to warn them and uplift them practically. It is not speculative talk nor preoccupying oneself with news and reports about the unbelievers nor drowning oneself in analyzing them and their thoughts!</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Importance of Knowing the State of Affairs</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So knowing the situation in order to arrive by it at the <em>Sharee’ah</em> ruling is an important obligation from the obligations which have to be carried out by a discerning section of the specialist Muslim students of knowledge. Just like any branch of <em>Sharee’ah</em> knowledge, or social, economic or military affairs or any knowledge which benefits the Ummah of lslaam and brings it closer to the roads leading to a return of its strength, splendour and supremacy; especially when these branches of knowledge develop with the change of time and place.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Some Categories of <em>Fiqh</em> which are Obligatory</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It must be mentioned here, that the category of <em>Fiqh</em> [<span style="color:#ff0000;">2</span>] required from the Muslims as a whole is not just the <em>Fiqh</em> of the schools of thought, which they know and are instructed in, nor this <em>Fiqh</em> which some of the young <em>du’aat</em> have become aware of and started to call the attention of others towards. Since the categories of Fiqh which are obligatory upon the Muslims to master, even if they are only of the level of being obligatory upon some (<em>Fard Kifaayah</em>) are greater than all of this, and more widespread.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">2</span>] <em>Fiqh</em>: Understanding. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said. as is related by al-Bukhaaree (1/25) and at-Tahaawee in <em>Mushkil ul-Aathaar</em> (2/278): “<em><strong>When Allaah intends excellence for someone, He gives them the understanding (Fiqh) of the Deen. Indeed I am the distributor and Allaah is the giver</strong>.</em> (Publisher’s Note)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from this, for example, is <em>Fiqh ul-Kitaab</em> (understanding the Book), <em>Fiqh us-Sunnah</em> (understanding the Sunnah), <em>Fiqh ul-Lughah</em> (understanding the Language), <em>Fiqh us-Sunan ul-Kawniyyah</em> (understanding the ways in which the creation Operates), <em>Fiqh ul-Khilaaf</em> (understanding the differences between the scholars) and their like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These categories of <em>Fiqh</em> , in general, are of no lesser importance than the two types of Fiqh previously indicated, whether the Fiqh that is well- known or <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi</em> ’ which we are at the moment trying to clarify here. Despite all of this, we do not find anyone who calls the attention of the people to these categories of Fiqh! Particularly <em>Fiqh ul-Kitaab was-Sunnah</em>, which is the head of these categories and is their foundation. This Fiqh, which if someone were to say that it is obligatory upon every individual (<em>Fard ’Ayn</em>), then he would not be far wrong, due to the dire need of the Muslims for it and how necessary it is for them. Yet, in spite of this, we do not hear those who speak constantly about it, laying down its methodology, nor occupying the youth with it, nor training and cultivating them upon it!</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>What We Need is the <em>Manhaj</em>, not Mere Talk</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, there are many, all praise is for Allaah, who speak about the Book and the Sunnah today and point to them. However, the obligation that we require is not in merely writing a small work here and giving a lecture there, but rather What we need is that the Book and the Sunnah are made the general framework for every small or large matter and that their <em>manhaj</em> is made the undergarment and overgarment of <em>Da’wah</em> &#8211; its beginning and its end and that the thinking of those youths and others who are giving <em>Da’wah</em> should be lead in accordance with this great <em>manhaj</em> , upon which is the only means for the well-being of the Ummah. So there has to be scholars in every branch of <em>Fiqh</em> that has preceded, particularly <em>Fiqh</em> of the Book and the Sunnah, with clear criteria and principles.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Partitioning of the People through <em>Fiqh ul-Waaqi’</em></span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have heard and noticed that many Muslim youth have become trapped in a predicament about this branch of knowledge which they have called <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi’</em> and have regretfully partitioned into two groups at variance with each other. Some have gone beyond the bounds in this matter and others have fallen short of the mark! Since you will see and hear from those who over-inflate the importance of <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi’</em> and place it in a very high position, above its correct place amongst the branches of knowledge, that they want every scholar of the <em>Sharee’ ah</em> to be a scholar of what they call <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi</em>’! Just as the reverse also occurs from them. Those who listen to them and are instructed by them are made to think that everyone who is aware of the state of affairs (<em>waaqi</em>’) of the Islaamic world is (also) a scholar of the Book and the Sunnah and is upon the <em>manhaj</em> of the <em>Salaf us-Saalih</em>. This does not automatically follow, as is clear.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Completeness is Something Very Rare</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We do not expect to find a human being who is complete in every sense of the word, i.e., that we find one (person) who is a scholar of all these branches of knowledge that we have indicated and spoken about. Therefore, it is obligatory that all those who have spent their time and effort in coming to know the state of affairs of the Islaamic Ummah and the plots against it should work and co-operate with the scholars of the Book and the Sunnah, upon the <em>manhaj</em> of the <em>Salaf</em> of this Ummah. So they should put forward their Views and ideas and the scholars should explain Allaah&#8217;s ruling, Most perfect is He, based upon the authentic proof and clear evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who speaks about <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi</em>’ ; in the minds of those who hear him, he becomes one of the scholars and <em>muftees</em>, for no other reason than that he speaks about this <em>Fiqh</em> which we have indicated. This is something not in any way supported by truth. Then his words are taken as a stepping stone to reject the religious verdicts given by the scholars and to invalidate their <em>ijtihaad</em> and rulings which they have clarified.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Mistake of a Scholar Does Not Mean that He is to be Renounced</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is important to mention here that a scholar may make a mistake in passing judgement about a particular matter from these questions relating to the state of affairs, this has happened and will happen. Does this mean that the scholar is to be renounced and that those who disagree with him should describe him with improper words which it is not permissible to use for him? For example and it has been said: He is a scholar of the <em>Sharee’ah</em> and he is not a scholar of the current affairs! This is a statement which conflicts both with the <em>Sharee’ah</em> and the true state of affairs!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to this saying of theirs, it is as if they make it obligatory for the scholars of the Book and the Sunnah to also be fully aware of economics, social-affairs, politics, military affairs, use of modern weapons-systems and other matters also! I do not think that there is a sensible human who imagines all of these branches of knowledge and disciplines combined in the heart of a single man, however great a scholar or however complete!</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Mistake of Being Ignorant of the State of Affairs</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have also heard people saying: It is not important for us to know the state of affairs. This is also an error. Rather justice demands that it be said: There must be for every branch of knowledge those who know about it and specialize in it and that they all work together as required by Islaam as sincere brothers, not due to partisanship , nor sectarianism &#8211; in order to realize that which is of benefit to the Islaamic Ummah and to establish the Islaamic society that every Muslim aspires to, such that Allaah’s <em>Sharee’ah</em> is applied upon His earth. Each of these branches of knowledge are obligatory upon some of the scholars of the Muslims and it is not obligatory at all that a single person gathers all of them, not to mention the impossibility of that actually occurring!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example: In some cases, it is not permissible for a surgeon to carry out a particular operation until he has obtained the View of a scholar of the Book of Allaah, the Most Perfect and the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم), upon the <em>manhaj</em> of the <em>Salafus-Saalih</em>. Since it is difficult, if we do say impossible, to find a proficient surgeon who also has good knowledge of the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, their <em>Fiqh</em> and the rulings derived from them.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Obligation of Co-operation</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, there has to be co-operation, acting upon the saying of the Lord of the worlds in His noble Book:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَتَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْبِرِّ وَالتَّقْوَىٰ ۖ وَلَا تَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْإِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Help you one another in righteousness and piety and do not help one another in sin and transgression.</span> [Sooratul-Maa‘idah (5):2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Through this, the good that is hoped for, for the Islaamic <em>Ummah</em> may be attained. This matter is something obvious, since a Muslim cannot think of a scholar having great knowledge of the Book and the Sunnah and then further that he is a skilled surgeon. Then on top of that, he is fully aware of what they call today <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi</em>’. Since, when he occupies himself with one branch of knowledge, that will reduce his time spent on other branches of knowledge. Thus, if he gives greater importance to a certain field then he will naturally be detracted from other fields and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Completeness will not come about except by all of them working together, each of them in his special field. By this means and this means alone, what the <em>Sharee’ah</em> wishes, for all the Muslims, can be achieved and they can be saved from clear ruin. The Lord of the worlds says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَالْعَصْرِ &#8211; </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِنَّ الْإِنسَانَ لَفِي خُسْرٍ &#8211; </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِلَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالْحَقِّ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالصَّبْرِ</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">By Time! Verily man is in loss. Except those who believe and do righteous deeds and help one another to the truth and help one another to patience.‘</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<em>Sooratul-‘Asr</em> (103) :1-3]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Going Beyond Bounds Regarding that which is Essential</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet what we have noticed and still notice, is that the wild and fervent emotions which know no bounds have a number of negative results.From them is going beyond bounds in that which is essential. Since that which is obligatory and essential is of two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: That which is obligatory upon every Muslim (<em>Fard ’Ayn</em>)<br />
<strong>Secondly</strong>: That which, if carried out by some, then it is not required from the rest (<em>Fard Kifaaee</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible to treat the <em>Fard Kifaaee</em> like the <em>Fard ’Ayn</em> and to make them equal. Even if we were to say, for the sake of argument, that it were obligatory upon the up and coming students of knowledge to know <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi</em>’. How could that be? Since we are not even able to apply this unrestricted statement to the major scholars of the Muslims, not to mention making it obligatory upon the students of knowledge to know the state of affairs, along with the necessary <em>Fiqh</em> demanded by this knowledge, so that each case can be given its fitting ruling.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Fiqh ul-Waaqi</em>’ is not to be Rejected</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, since this is the case, it is not permissible for any of the students of knowledge to reject the necessity of this <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi</em>’. Since it is not possible to obtain that which was lost and is hoped for by all the Muslims, which is freeing ourselves from the colonialization of the Muslim lands by the unbelievers , or at the very least, some of them, except by knowing their mutual plots and agreements, in order to beware and warn, so that their colonialization and enslavement of the Islaamic world ceases to continue. A large part of this goal cannot be attained except by educating and cultivating the Muslim youth correctly in <em>Aqeedah</em>, knowledge and <em>manhaj</em>, built upon the purification (<em>tasfiyah</em>) of Islaam from all the accretions that have been added to it and upon the principle of cultivation and education (<em>tarbiyah</em>) upon this pure Islaam, just as Allaah sent it down upon the heart of His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم).</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Between the Scholars and the Rulers</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From those matters which need to be mentioned here is that the ones who have the ability to bring the Ummah to carry out that which is obligatory upon it, whether upon all or some of them, are not those passionate speakers, nor the academic scholars, rather they are the rulers (<em>hukkaam</em>) who have the power of giving orders and having them implemented and to enact and to dissolve, nor are they the enthusiastic youth, nor emotional <em>du’aat</em> who carry no weight, nor authority with them!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the speakers, the scholars and the callers must educate and train the Muslims to accept the law of Islaam and to submit to it and also to call the rulers with that which is best, to that which is right. To use the scholars properly with their various levels and types of knowledge: <em>Fiqh</em> of the Book and the Sunnah, <em>Fiqh</em> of the Language, <em>Fiqh</em> of the ways in which the creation operates, <em>Fiqh</em> of the state of affairs and likewise for all important matters. Putting into effect the great Islaamic principle of <em>Shooraa</em> (carrying out the affairs through consultation), then on that day will the affairs be straightened out and the Believers rejoice at the victory from Allaah:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَإِنْ أَعْرَضُوا فَمَا أَرْسَلْنَاكَ عَلَيْهِمْ حَفِيظًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">But if they turn away, then We have not sent you as a protector over them.</span> [Sooratush-Shooraa (42):48]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Reason Behind the Degradation of the Muslims</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A very important matter must be explained here, about which many are unaware. The reason why the Muslims continue to be downtrodden and enslaved by the unbelievers, even by the Jews of some Islaamic lands, is not that many of the people of knowledge are ignorant about the state of affairs, not knowing the plots and the plans of the Unbelievers, as some think!</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">From the Mistake of Some <em>Du’aat</em></span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, I hold that giving extra and undue importance to <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi</em> , such that it becomes a total program for the <em>du’aat</em> and the youth, upon which they are educated and educate others, thinking that it is the way to salvation, is an evident error and a clear mistake! The matter about which no two scholars differ and about which no two goats would lock horns over is that the primary reason for the degradation which has settled upon the Muslims is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: The ignorance of the Muslims of the Islaam which Allaah sent down upon the heart of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: That many of the Muslims who know about the Islaamic rulings for some of their affairs do not put them into practice, but neglect them and allow them to fall into disuse.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Tasfiyah and Tarbiyah</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the key to a return of the glory of Islaam is: Implementation of beneficial knowledge (’<em>Ilm un-Naafi’</em>) and establishing righteous action (’<em>Amal us-Saalih</em>) and this is a very great affair which the Muslims cannot reach, except through the <em>manhaj</em> of <em>tasfiyah</em> and <em>tarbiyah</em>. These are two very great obligations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By the first of these the following is intended:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: Purifying the Islaamic ’<em>Aqeedah</em> from that which is alien to it, such as Shirk (associating partners along with Allaah in those things that are specific to Him), <em>ta’teel</em> (denial of Allaah’s attributes), <em>ta’weel</em> (twisting the meanings of Allaah’s attributes) and refusing authentic ahaadeeth because they are connected to ’<em>Aqeedah</em>, and their like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: Purifying the Islaamic Fiqh from the erroneous judgements made, which are contrary to the Book and the Sunnah, freeing the minds from the bonds of blind-following and the darkness of sectarianism.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly</strong>: Purifying the books of <em>tafseer</em>, <em>fiqh</em>, <em>raqaaiq</em> (matters concerning the heart) and other than that, from <em>ahaadeeth</em> that are weak (<em>da’eef</em>), fabricated (<em>maudoo</em>’) and unsupported narrations of the people of the Book (<em>Israaeeleeyaat</em>) and reprehensible matters (<em>munkaraat</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>As regards the second obligation:</strong> Then by it I mean cultivating the young generation upon this Islaam, purified from all that we have mentioned, giving them a correct Islaamic education from the beginning, without any influence of the infidel western education.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt, that bringing these two obligations about requires huge efforts and sincere co-operation between all of the Muslims organisations and individuals, from all of those who are truly concerned with establishing the desired Islaamic society, each one working in his own field and speciality.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Correct Islaam</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the scholars who know the rulings from the correct Islaam must take pains to call the Muslims to this correct Islaam and bring them to understand it, then to cultivate them upon it, just as Allaah says:</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَٰكِن كُونُوا رَبَّانِيِّينَ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تُعَلِّمُونَ الْكِتَابَ وَبِمَا كُنتُمْ تَدْرُسُونَ</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Rather, be you <em>Rabbaani’yyeen</em>,</span>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">01</span>] <span style="color:#008000;">because you teach the Book and you study it. </span><br />
[Soorah Aal-‘Imraan (3):79]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">01</span>] <em>Rabbaanee</em> (plural: <em>Rabbaaniyyeen</em>) is the scholar who acts upon his knowledge and has insight into the condition of the people, so that he raises them upon the primary matters of knowledge before that which is more detailed. </span><span style="color:#999999;">In his Jaami’ us-Saheeh (1/192 &#8211; with Fath), al-Bukhaaree &#8211; <em>rahimahullaah</em> &#8211; says: Ibn ‘Abbaas said: “<em>Be Rabbaaniyyeen. wise-ones and scholars</em>.” It is said: The <em>Rabbaanee</em> is one who teaches people simple knowledge before the more difficult one. (Publisher’s note)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the only solution, which comes in the Book and the Sunnah, as is in His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> إِن تَنصُرُوا اللَّهَ يَنصُرْكُمْ وَيُثَبِّتْ أَقْدَامَكُمْ</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">If you help Allaah then Allaah will help you and establish your feet firmly.</span><br />
[Soorah Muhammad (47) : 7]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>How Will Allaah’s Help Come?</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah. From those things about which there is total agreement between the Muslims is that:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِن تَنصُرُوا اللَّهَ يَنصُرْكُمْ </strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">If you help Allaah then Allaah will help you. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means if you carry out what He has ordered you to do, then Allaah will grant you victory over your enemies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the most important texts that support this meaning and which totally fits the state of affairs in which we are presently living, in that the disease and the cure are both mentioned together is his (صلى الله عليه وسلم) saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“When you indulge in <em>eenah</em> transactions and take hold of the tails of cows and become satisfied with cultivation and abandon <em>Jihaad</em> , then Allaah will cover you with humiliation, which He will not remove from you, until you return to your <em>Deen</em>.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[<em>Saheeh</em> &#8211; related by Abu Daawood (3426), ad-Dawlaabee. in <em>al-Kunaa</em> (2/65), aI-Baihaqee in <em>as-Sunan ul-Kubraa</em> (5 / 3l 6) and others, from Ibn ’Umar &#8211; <em>radiallaahu ’anhu</em>. It was authenticated by al-Albaanee in <em>as-Saheehah</em> (11).]</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Reason for the Sickness of the Muslims</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the sickness of the Muslims today is not because of their ignorance of any particular branch of knowledge. Although, I agree that every branch of knowledge which is of benefit to the Muslims is obligatory in proportion to this. But the reason for the degradation which has come upon the Muslims is not their ignorance of this knowledge known today as <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi&#8217;</em> ’. Rather, the reason, as occurs in the authentic <em>hadeeth</em>, is their neglecting action in accordance with the rulings of the <em>Deen</em>, from the Book and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His (صلى الله عليه وسلم) saying: “<strong>When you indulge in <em>eenah</em> transactions</strong>” is an indication of a type of usurious transaction, seeking a means around the <em>Sharee’ah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His (صلى الله عليه وسلم) saying: “<strong>and take hold of the tails of cows</strong>” is an indication of giving importance to worldly matters and pre-occupying oneself with them and not giving importance to the <em>Sharee’ah</em> and its rulings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise is his (صلى الله عليه وسلم) saying: “<strong>and become satisfied with cultivation</strong>” and his (صلى الله عليه وسلم) saying: “<strong>and abandon jihaad</strong> ” is a result of desiring this world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا مَا لَكُمْ إِذَا قِيلَ لَكُمُ انفِرُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ اثَّاقَلْتُمْ إِلَى الْأَرْضِ ۚ أَرَضِيتُم بِالْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا مِنَ الْآخِرَةِ ۚ فَمَا مَتَاعُ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا فِي الْآخِرَةِ إِلَّا قَلِيلٌ</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! What is the matter with you, that when you are asked to go forth in the path of Allaah you cling heavily to the earth? Do you prefer the life of this world to the Hereafter? But little is the comfort of this world in comparison to the Hereafter.</span> [Sooratut-Tawbah (9):38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His (صلى الله عليه وسلم) saying: “<strong>Allaah will cover you with humiliation, which He will not remove from you, until you return to your Deen</strong>” contains a clear indication that the <em>Deen</em> which it is obligatory to return to is that which Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, mentions in a number of verses, such as His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِنَّ الدِّينَ عِندَ اللَّهِ الْإِسْلَامُ</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed the Deen with Allaah is Islaam.</span><br />
[Soorah Aal-‘Imraan (3):19]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِي وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ الْإِسْلَامَ دِينًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">This day have I perfected your Deen for you, completed My favours upon you and have chosen for you Islaam as Deen. </span>[Sooratul-Maa‘idah (5):3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">lmaam Maalik’s famous comment about this aayah clearly explains what is meant, when he &#8211; <em>rahimahullaah</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>What was not on that day considered <em>Deen</em>, is not <em>Deen</em> today. So the latter part of this <em>Ummah</em> will not be set right except by that which set right its first part</strong>.”</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Going Beyond Bounds in <em>Fiqh ul-Waaqi’</em></span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards those <em>du’aat</em> today who concentrate heavily on <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi’</em> and over inflate it’s importance and give it a higher position than is due. They go into excesses in this understanding and giving others the understanding, perhaps unintentionally, that it is obligatory upon every scholar, indeed every student of knowledge to have knowledge of this Fiqh!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whereas, many of those <em>du’aat</em> know fully that this <em>Deen</em> with which our Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, is pleased for us, has been greatly misunderstood within the Muslim <em>Ummah</em> for a long time, even with regards to <em>Aqeedah</em>, to the extent that we find many people indeed who say <em>Laa ilaaha illallaah</em> and carry out the pillars and even carry out optional worship, such as standing in prayer during the night, giving charity and their like, but they deviate from the sayings of Allaah, the Most High, (such as):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَاعْلَمْ أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Know that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah</span>. [SoorahMuhammad (47):19]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The State of the <em>Du’aat</em> with regards to <em>Fiqh ul-Waaqi’</em></strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We know that many of these <em>du’aat</em> agree with us fundamentally in recognizing the reason for the evil situation in which the Muslims live. That is their being far from the correct understanding of Islaam that is obligatory upon every individual to have, not just obligatory upon some only. So what is obligatory is to correct the beliefs, correct the worship and correct the manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Where in this <em>Ummah</em> are those who are seeking to establish this obligation which is an obligation upon all (<em>Fard ’Ayn</em>) and not just upon some (<em>Fard Kifaaee</em>)? ? Since the <em>Fard Kifaaee</em> should come after the <em>Fard Ayn</em>, as has been established and not before! Therefore, being pre-occupied with and giving undue importance in calling the elite of the Muslim Ummah, to take care of a <em>Fard Kifaaee</em>, which is <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi</em> and giving less importance to the <em>Fiqh</em> which is <em>Fard ’Ayn</em> upon every Muslim, which is Fiqh of the Book and Sunnah, as I have indicated, is an excess and a neglect of that which is obligatory upon every individual of the Muslim <em>Ummah</em>. It is going beyond bounds in raising the importance of something, which in reality, is no more than <em>Fa&#8217;rd Kifaayah</em>!</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The True and Just Saying about <em>Fiqh ul-Waaqi’</em></strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the matter is as Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَكَذَٰلِكَ جَعَلْنَاكُمْ أُمَّةً وَسَطًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Thus have We made you a justly-balanced Ummah.</span><br />
[Sooratul-Baqarah (2):143]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi&#8217;</em> with its correct <em>Sharee’ah</em> meaning is obligatory without doubt, but it is obligatory upon some, not all. If some of the scholars attain it, then it is not obligatory upon the rest of the scholars, not to mention the students of knowledge or the common Muslims!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is essential to keep matters in due proportion when calling the Muslims to awareness of <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi’</em> and not to drown them with political news and analysis of western thinkers. Rather, what is obligatory always, is to concentrate on the <em>tasfiyah</em> (purification) of Islaam from corruption, then the <em>tarbi&#8217;yah</em> (cultivation) of the Muslims, groups and individuals, upon this pure Islaam; connecting them to the pure and correct <em>manhaj</em> (methodology) of <em>Da’wah</em>: The Book and the Sunnah with the understanding of the Salaf of this Ummah.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Obligation of Mutual Love and Ties of Relationship</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From that which is also obligatory upon the scholars, with their various specialities, not to mention the rest of the Ummah , is that they should comply with the saying of their Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>The example of the Believers in their mutual love and mercy is like a single body</strong>.” [<span style="color:#ff0000;">01</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">01</span>] <em>Saheeh</em> &#8211; related by Muslim (8/20), Ahmad (4/70) and at-Tiyaalasee (790). from an- Numaan ibn Basheer <em>radiallaalm ’anhu</em>. The full text of the hadeeth being: “<em>The example of the Believers in their mutual love and mercy is like a single body. When one part of it feels pain then the whole of the body suffers in sleeplessness and fever</em>.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This great prophetic simile, with its beautiful meaning, will not be realized except by the scholars working in co-operation with the individuals of the society, teaching and learning, calling and acting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, those who know the <em>Fiqh</em> of the <em>Sharee’ah</em> with its evidences and rulings, should co-operate with those who know <em>Fiqh ul-Waaqi’</em> in its correct and practical form, not merely as a discussion. S0 one supports the other with what they have of knowledge and understanding and one alerts the other to what is clear to them so that they can be aware and warn. From this sincere co-operation between the scholars and the <em>Du’aat</em>, with their different areas of expertise, it will be possible to fulfill the hope of every sincere Muslim.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Danger of Accusing the Scholars</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards accusing some of the scholars or students of knowledge and labelling them as being ignorant of <em>Fiqh ul- Waaqi’</em> and accusing them with such things as one would feel shame to mention, then this is a mistake and an error. It is not permissible for this to continue, since it is from hatred and many ahaadeeth prohibit the Muslims having hatred for each other, rather the opposite has been ordered, that is, to have mutual love, to come together and to co-operate.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">How Can We Cure the Mistakes</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Any Muslim who sees a matter about which a scholar or caller has made a mistake, then it is obligatory upon him to remind and advise them. If the mistake was in a particular place, then it should be called to their attention there and then in the best way without broadcasting or publicizing it; in order to bring about what is more befitting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the mistake was made publicly and broadcasted, then there is no harm in calling the mistake to attention and explaining it openly, but as Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color:#000000;">ادْعُ إِلَىٰ سَبِيلِ رَبِّكَ بِالْحِكْمَةِ وَالْمَوْعِظَةِ الْحَسَنَةِ ۖ وَجَادِلْهُم بِالَّتِي هِيَ أَحْسَنُ</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching and argue with them in ways that are best. </span>[Sooratun-Nahl (16):125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is important to explain that the correction of an error meant here, is not the correction founded upon the emotions and feelings of the youth without any knowledge or proof. Rather, what is meant is correction based upon clear proof and sound evidence.This correction, in this mild and wise manner, will not be achieved except between sincere scholars and well-wishing and sincere students of knowledge, who are together in their knowledge and <em>Da’wah</em> built upon the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em> and upon the <em>manhaj</em> of the <em>Salaf us-Saalih</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards the case if the one who is to be corrected is one who knowingly deviates from this methodology, then there is for him a particular treatment and method befitting the scale of his deviation and distance from the truth and correct way.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Danger of Present-Day Politics</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Finally</strong>, we must advise the Muslims of a very important matter in this regard. Our approval of <em>Fiqh ul-Waaqi’</em> with its approved form in the <em>Sharee’ah</em> or our preoccupation with it, must not lead us to opening the doors of modern politics (<em>siyaasah</em>) of the transgressors. Those fooled by the words of the rulers, willing pupils of their methods and those drowned in their ways.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, what is obligatory, is to pursue the politics of the <em>Sharee’ah</em> &#8211; which is to protect and take care of the affairs of the Ummah. This cannot be except in the light of the Book and the Sunnah upon the <em>manhaj</em> of the <em>Salaf us-Saalih</em> and in the hands of the active scholars and the just rulers. Since Allaah curbs with the rulers those whom He does not curb with the Qur‘aan.[1]</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[1] See <em>ad-Durrul-Manthoor</em> (4/99) of as-Suyootee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for the western politics, which open the doors and deceives its people; it has no <em>Deen</em> with it. It flows onwards with those caught in its tide, or drowned in its sea. Its harm comes upon him and he is afflicted by its fire, since he preoccupied himself with the subsidiary (<em>furoo</em>’) and left the fundamentals (<em>usool</em>)!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah have mercy upon the one who said: <em>Whosoever seeks to hasten something before its time is ripe, is punished by being deprived of its achievement.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our final call is that all praise is for Allaah, Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 52: Point 90A</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said, “My nation will divide into 73 sects; all of them shall be in the Fire except one, and it is the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>; the united body upon the truth.” It was said, “Who are they, O Messenger of Allaah?” He said, “That which I and my companions are upon today.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/my-ummah-will-divide-into-73-sects-all-of-them-shall-be-in-the-fire-except-one" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And you should know that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said, “My nation will divide into 73 sects, all of them in the Fire except one and it is <em>al-Jamaa`ah</em>; the united body upon the truth,” </strong></span>Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, commanded us to unite; to become <em>ijtimaa</em>` upon the truth.</p>
<p><strong>وَاعْتَصِمُوا بِحَبْلِ اللَّهِ جَمِيعًا وَلَا تَفَرَّقُوا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And cling together to the rope of Allaah and do not separate. </strong></span>(Soorah Aali-Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>103)</p>
<p><strong>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ فَرَّقُوا دِينَهُمْ وَكَانُوا شِيَعًا لَّسْتَ مِنْهُمْ فِي شَيْءٍ ۚ إِنَّمَا أَمْرُهُمْ إِلَى اللَّهِ ثُمَّ يُنَبِّئُهُم بِمَا كَانُوا يَفْعَلُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Those who split up their religion and become sects, you have nothing to do with them. Their affair is just with Allaah. Then He will inform them of what they used to do. </strong>(</span>Sooratul An`aam (6), <em>aayah </em>159)</p>
<p><strong>وَلَا تَكُونُوا كَالَّذِينَ تَفَرَّقُوا وَاخْتَلَفُوا مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَهُمُ الْبَيِّنَاتُ ۚ وَأُولَٰئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And do not be like those who split and differed after the clear signs have come to them. And they are the ones for whom will be a tremendous punishment. </strong></span>(Soorah Aali-Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>105)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He forbade us from splitting and He commanded us with uniting and with clinging on to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger. So He said:</p>
<p><strong>وَأَنَّ هَٰذَا صِرَاطِي مُسْتَقِيمًا فَاتَّبِعُوهُ ۖ وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا السُّبُلَ فَتَفَرَّقَ بِكُمْ عَن سَبِيلِهِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And this is my straight way so follow it and do not follow the divergent paths for they will split you and lead you away from His path.</span> </strong>(Sooratul An`aam (6), <em>aayah </em>153)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not permissible to split and differ on account of desires or on account of <em>taqleed</em> (blindly following) fathers and forefathers or as a result of blindly following the Jews and the Christians. Differing is not permissible in the matters of `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) and in the fundamentals of the religion. Rather, it is obligatory to agree and to be united with regard to it. As for differing in issues of <em>fiqh</em> then this occurs. However, it is obligatory to return and refer back to those sayings which the proof establishes. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>فَإِن تَنَازَعْتُمْ فِي شَيْءٍ فَرُدُّوهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَالرَّسُولِ إِن كُنتُمْ تُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ وَأَحْسَنُ تَأْوِيلًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So if you dispute about anything then refer it back to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger if you truly believe in Allaah and in the Last Day. That is better and finer in its outcome.</span> </strong>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), <em>aayah </em>59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore <em>ikhtilaaf</em> (differing) in `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) is not permissible because `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) is <em>tawqeefeeyah</em> (reliant upon text). It is not a place for <em>ijtihaad</em> (scholarly deduction). But as for the issues of <em>fiqh</em> and <em>istinbaat</em> (deduction of rulings) then in that case, each one of the People of Knowledge in that matter who are suitable to promote <em>ijtihaad</em> can strive to deduce rulings and they may differ in their outlooks. However, they should not just remain upon their differing. Rather, they should refer back to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger. So, whoever has proof then they should follow him and take his saying and leave their own opinions. This is the position of the people of the Sunnah and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em> and this is what the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> directed us to. As for our saying, leave the people and let everyone have his own opinion and the differing of the nation is a mercy as they say then we say <em>haathaa baatil </em>(this is false and futile). Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَلَا يَزَالُونَ مُخْتَلِفِينَ</strong><br />
<strong>إِلَّا مَن رَّحِمَ رَبُّكَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they will continue to disagree except for those who your Lord has mercy upon.</span> </strong>(Soorah Hood (11), <em>aayah </em>118-119)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying, <strong>“Except for those who your Lord has mercy upon,” </strong>indicates that those whom Allaah has mercy upon do not differ and that differing is a punishment (<em>a<u>th</u>aab)</em> and is not a mercy (a <em>ra<u>h</u>mah)</em>. Mercy is for those who do not differ and if they do differ then they refer back to the Book and the Sunnah and they take what is correct and they leave what is wrong. This is the way of <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for each one remaining upon his own opinion and what so and so said and so and so then this is not the way of the Muslims. This is the way of the <em>Ahlul-Ahwaa</em> (innovated sects) and the People of <em>Shahawaat</em> (followers of desires). They search for whatever saying will conform to their desires and whatever will conform to what they want and whatever differs with their desires, they abandon it even if the Imaam whom they say that they take his saying says it. Meaning, they do not accept from the sayings of the Imaams and the scholars except what is in accordance with their desires. As for what contradicts their desires then they reject it. So, this is a proof that they are just following their own desires, whatever conforms with their desires they accept it and whatever is contrary to their desires they abandon it. <em>Wa laa <u>h</u>awla wa laa quwatta illaa billaah</em> (and there is no movement and no ability except with the aid of Allaah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is what is called to nowadays in the newspapers and magazines and meetings and conferences mostly and upon the channels. They promote disagreement and they say we are just making things open and easy for the people. With what are we making things open and easy for the people? With abandonment of the Book and the Sunnah and with going along with sayings whose people are not secure from error; those who make errors sometimes and are correct sometimes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whereas they; meaning the Imaams of the past, they forbade us from taking their sayings except what accords with the proof. They forbade us from taking their sayings, which are in contrary to the proof. So, this is a matter, which it is obligatory to be aware of because the people today have been put to trial on account of those people who confuse things for the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So his saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And you should know that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said, my nation will split into 73 sects, all of them will be in the Fire except one,” </strong></span>This <u>h</u>adeeth is authentic, when its chains of narration are gathered and its many narrations and the Imaams reported in their works and speak in praise of it and actual circumstances testify to its truth. So he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed that this nation of Muhammad will split into 73 sects and these are the major fundamental sects and there are actually more than these sects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said all of them will be in the Fire, meaning the 72, all of them will be in the Fire except for one and it is the 73<sup>rd</sup> one, which is that which is upon the like of what the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his companions were upon. So it is what will be saved from the Fire. And therefore, they are called <strong><em>al-Firqatun Naajiyah</em></strong> (the saved sect) and they are called <strong><em>Ahl-us-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em></strong> (the People of the Sunnah and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>); the united body upon the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whatever is beside them then they are opposers to the truth under the threat of the Hellfire. So from them will be those who enter the Fire on account of disbelief (<em>kufr)</em> and from them will be those who enter the Fire on account of <em>fisq</em> (evil doing) and from them will be those who enter the Fire on account of <em>ma`<u>s</u>iyyah</em> (sin, disobedience). They are not all the same with regard to entering the Fire. So it is not to be taken from this <u>h</u>adeeth that these sects, all of them are disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“</span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And it is the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>; the united body,”</span> </strong><em>Al-Jamaa`ah</em> (united body) is whoever is upon the truth even if it is a single person. This is the <em>Jamaa`ah</em> (the united body). As for <em>Al-Kathrah</em> (being numerous on its own); a group being numerous then this on its own does not indicate the truth. He, the Most High said:</p>
<p><strong>وَإِن تُطِعْ أَكْثَرَ مَن فِي الْأَرْضِ يُضِلُّوكَ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And if you were to obey most of those upon the earth, they will lead you astray from the path of Allaah.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-An`aam (6), <em>aayah </em>116)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا أَكْثَرُ النَّاسِ وَلَوْ حَرَصْتَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And most of mankind even if you eagerly wish will not be believers.</span> </strong>(Soorah Yoosuf (12), <em>aayah </em>103)</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا وَجَدْنَا لِأَكْثَرِهِم مِّنْ عَهْدٍ ۖ وَإِن وَجَدْنَا أَكْثَرَهُمْ لَفَاسِقِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We have not found most of them to be true to their covenant, We have found most of them to be disobedient ones. </strong></span>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>102)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So being numerous is not what is counted. What is counted is those who are upon the truth even if they are few in number, even if it is a single person then he will be the <em>Jamaa`ah</em> (the body upon the truth).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“<strong>It was said, “Who are they O Messenger of Allaah? He said, “That which is upon that which I and my companions are upon today.” </strong></span>This is the correct path, those who are upon that which the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his companions were upon, they are the <em>Jamaa</em>`<em>ah</em> (the united body upon the truth).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>How to fight the Eastern and Western cultural invasion [1]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allah Alone, and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah, his family and Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that the gravest danger that Muslim societies are facing nowadays is the so-called cultural invasion with its different weapons, including all media means, printed and broadcast alike. Invaders have realized in the modern age that the old ways have become ineffective. Nations fight courageously to defend their religion, homelands and their heritage. Usurping by violence and terrorism is an inherently refused concept, especially in modern times after the spread of awareness among the people. The world has become like a small village and many organizations were established to defend the rights of nations, refuse political invasion, and claim the right to self-determination. Every nation has the right to have sovereignty over its own territory, invest its resources, and rule its territories according to its own standards. Nations also adopt different beliefs, creeds and ruling systems, which made invaders leave these countries after fierce, bloody wars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, before leaving those countries, the invaders thought of many ways and prepared many plots based on thorough investigation, full awareness of the aims and effectiveness of those plans, and the ways that should be followed to accomplish them. Their aims revolved around designing highly deceiving curriculums of weak ties with religion, focusing on spreading their culture and instilling in the souls of most of the people the admiration of their material achievements in different aspects of life. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>When people, especially teenagers and young students, are impressed by this superficial brilliant achievements and inventions in the world, some of them who are totally impressed choose to complete their education in European and American universities</strong></span>. There they are surrounded with doubts and sorts of lusts systematically presented by orientalists and atheists, using well-organized, perverted, cunning schemes, where they face the Western lifestyle with all its corruption, dissolution and obscenity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rarely does a person remain safe from these weapons, being accompanied with enticement and lack of religion or authority. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>After completing their study and returning to their countries, those people assume important posts and become agents for the colonialists and apply their demands and implement their plots precisely, even with harsher means than those used by the colonialists themselves</strong></span>. This has taken place, indeed, in many countries that were occupied by invaders. The way to safety from this danger lies in establishing universities and institutes in different specializations, in order to limit the missions abroad and teach all forms of knowledge in all universities and institutes. This should be accompanied with paying attention to Islamic subjects and culture, in order to keep the `Aqidah (creed) of the students intact, and protect their morals and future, so that they take part in building their society on a Shari`ah (Islamic law) basis and according to the needs of the Islamic Ummah (nation). We should restrict educational missions abroad to certain forms of knowledge that are not available at home.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah guide us to all what benefits the people and the countries, and protects the Muslims against anything that might harm them in their `Aqidah and morals. He is the Most Generous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, <strong>we need to take more care of curricula, add a perfect Islamic touch to them, and establish more scientific institutions to help the people study at home instead of traveling abroad</strong>. <strong>We should also choose teachers and managers perfectly; all of them should be of good morals, sound `Aqidah, reputation, jealousy on Islam, power and honesty.</strong> Whoever enjoys these traits is guaranteed and will most probably do their best to explain information to the students in a correct way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if it is a necessity to send some students to learn abroad due to the lack of some professional institutions, especially in the field of industry, an objective committee should be formed to choose the most suitable students in terms of religion and morals and who are well-versed in Islamic culture and have an Islamic spirit. The committee can also choose a knowledgeable, righteous supervisor, who is active in practicing Da`wah (calling to Islam), to accompany the mission, practices Da`wah there, supervises and guides the students, and refutes any doubts they may come across.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>They should be given even a short course before traveling to be aware of all the problems they might encounter abroad</strong>, and clarify the Shari`ah viewpoint and wisdom behind such issues according to the Qur&#8217;an, the Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet), and the opinions of scholars. This includes, for instance, the rulings on slavery, polygyny in general, polygyny of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in particular, Talaq (divorce pronounced by a husband), the wisdom behind both offensive and defensive Jihad (fighting in the Cause of Allah), and such doubts that are mentioned by the enemies of Allah to Muslim youths, so that they would be fully ready to refute any such issues.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for facing the invasion of print and broadcast media, which have afflicted the Muslim Ummah in the modern age and have come to occupy most of the time of Muslims in spite of the deadly poison and the misleading promotion they usually contain, it is one of the most important tasks to protect Islam and the Islamic culture from its evil plotting. We should make sure that the Du`ah (callers to Islam) dedicate themselves to writing useful researches, periodicals and articles; practicing Da`wah, replying to different forms of cultural invasion and exposing their falsehood. The enemies have dedicated all their resources and potentials, founded many organizations and applied different means to deceive Muslims. Their misconceptions should be refuted and Islamic `Aqidah, legislation, rulings and morals should be clarified and explained in a nice, attractive way using suitable modern ways; wisdom and good discourse of preaching, arguing in a gentle way via all mass media as much as possible. Islam is the perfect religion that encompasses all goodness, guarantees happiness to all people, good progress, sound development, peace, security, prosperous life and winning in this world and in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslims are afflicted by all this as they do not stick to their religion as they should have, with most of the people not understanding its reality, because of being not interested; ignorant of it; negligent of many scholars in clarifying its advantages, wisdoms and secrets; lack of honesty and patience in inviting others to it; and not bearing harm and using the modern ways. Thus, discrepancy took place. Most of the people have become ignorant of the Islamic rulings. They have become deluded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is known that the last generation of this Ummah will not succeed except with what brought success to the first generation &#8211; that is, to follow the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) to these idolaters (pagan Arabs) of your folk:] </strong><strong>Follow what has been sent down unto you from your Lord (the Qur’ân and Prophet Muhammad’s Sunnah), and follow not any Auliyâ’ (protectors and helpers who order you to associate partners in worship with Allâh), besides Him (Allâh). Little do you remember! </strong>[Surah Al-A`raf, 7: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And verily, this </strong>(i.e. Allâh’s Commandments mentioned in the above two Verses 151 and 152)<strong> is My Straight Path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His Path. This He has ordained for you that you may become Al-Muttaqûn </strong>(the pious &#8211; see V.2:2)<strong>.&#8221; </strong>[Surah Al-An`am, 6: 153]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: <strong>And this is a blessed Book (the Qur’ân) which We have sent down, so follow it and fear Allâh (i.e. do not disobey His Orders), that you may receive mercy (i.e. be saved from the torment of Hell). </strong>[Surah Al-An`am, 6: 155]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He), Who is the Most Truthful, has promised us a great victory and successful outcome in return for this in His Statement: &#8230;and<strong> (as for) the believers, it was incumbent upon Us to help (them). </strong>[Surah Al­Rum, 30: 47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>But if you remain patient and become Al-Muttaqûn [the pious &#8211; See V.2:2], not the least harm will their cunning do to you. Surely, Allâh surrounds all that they do. </strong>[Surah Al-`Imran, 3: 120]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: <strong>Allâh has promised those among you who believe and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers) in the land, as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practise their religion which He has chosen for them (i.e. Islâm). And He will surely give them in exchange a safe security after their fear (provided) they (believers) worship Me and do not associate anything (in worship) with Me. But whoever disbelieves after this, they are the Fâsiqûn (rebellious, disobedient to Allâh).</strong>[Surah Al-Nur, 24: 55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: <strong>O you who believe! If you help (in the cause of) Allâh, He will help you, and make your foothold firm</strong>.[Surah Muhammad, 47: 7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) in this regard. When the Salaf (righteous predecessors) applied these noble Ayahs, whether in words, actions, or beliefs, Allah granted them victory over their enemies, made them rulers of the world, spread justice through them, and made them leaders of the Ummah and Imams of guidance. When the latter generations faltered in this (Allah&#8217;s Orders) their conditions declined, according to Allah&#8217;s Statement: <strong>Verily, Allâh will not change the (good) condition of a people as long as they do not change their state (of goodness) themselves (by committing sins and by being ungrateful and disobedient to Allâh).</strong>[Surah Al-Ra`d, 13: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah make the Muslims, whether people or governments, return to their faith in a proper way; grant them comprehension of it, cause them to apply it, make them unanimous on Al-Haqq (the Truth), guide them to cooperation in righteousness and piety, and enjoining each other to Al-Haqq and persevering upon it. He is the All-Hearing, Ever Near. May Allah&#8217;s peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">As sallamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A few days ago (13<sup>th</sup> Ramadaan), in the masjid of the Prophet (<i>sallalahu alahi  wa sallam</i>) in Medina, in his explanation of Usool-us-Sunnah of Imaam Ahmad, Sheikh Saaleh bin Sa’d as-Suhaymee (<i>hafidhahullah</i>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“My brothers, do not forget your brothers in Palestine, Syria, Iraq and in every place in your supplications because of these well-known conspiracies which have been agreed upon by all from amongst the disbelievers from the Jews and the Christians, the hizb-ul-Iblees (the party of Iblees), the Raafidah and other than them. They are agreed upon in concocting these conspiracies to divert the Muslims away from Tawheed and to put them to trial and so that they can reach their goals of completely eradicating the Muslims of Ahlus-Sunnah. </b><b><br />
</b></span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"> <b>However, they will bring in loss (upon themselves) – by the permission of Allah – whether it is the Jews and the Christians of the west and the east, or the party of Iblees, or the Raafidah or those who conspire with them against Ahlus-Sunnah, or the Khawaarij or other than them. All of these (groups) will come to an end – by the permission of Allah. Every time a tentacle from amongst them appears, it will be cut off, and Allah will cut off their tentacles – by the permission of Allah, The Most High&#8230;”</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh then stressed the importance of the Muslims returning back to Allah and to have reliance upon Him alone. He mentioned how the day before someone in Gaza had even called upon Salaah-ud-Deen al-Ayubee (<i>rahimahullah</i>) to help them and that this is the very essence of Shirk. The Sheikh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“How do you expect to be rescued (from these trials) whilst you are calling upon other than Allah?”</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then advised the Muslims to call upon Allah alone and not upon anyone else, including the Prophet (<i>sallalahu alahi wa sallam</i>). He then supplicated for the destruction of all these groups, whether it is the ‘devils’ of the Khawaarij and The Islamic state of Iraq and the Levant, or the ‘devils’ of the Jews and the Christians in the east and the west or the ‘devils’ of the Raafidah or the hizb of Iblees. He then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“&#8230;By Allah, the Jews and the Christians and the west and the east are not the enemies of the Raafidah. They are not the enemies of the Khawaarij. They are the ones who brought them in, they are the ones who armed them and they are the ones who sold weapons to them. This is because the goal which they have in mind is to completely eradicate Ahlus-Sunnah, the Salafees, Ahlus-Sunnah Wal Jammah. However, they will bring in loss, failure and disappointment (upon themselves) by the permission of Allah, The Most Merciful&#8230;”</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The transcription of the Sheikh’s words can be found at:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://www.sahab.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=145310" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.sahab.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=145310</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah save the Muslims from the conspiracies of the Jews and Christians, the Raafidah and the Khawaarij. Aameen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-align:justify;line-height:1.5em;">All praises belong to Allaah, may prayers and salutations be upon the Messenger of Allaah, his family, companions and those who follow his guidance. As to what follows:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Certainly Allaah has distinguished the ummah of Islaam over the other nations, because<strong><span style="color:#993300;"> we enjoin what is right and we forbid what is wrong</span>.</strong> Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;">“You are the best nation brought out of the people (because) you enjoin what is right and you forbid what is wrong.”</span> (3:110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (may peace be upon him said): <span style="color:#008000;">“Whoever of you sees an evil then let him change it with his hand, if he is not able then with his tongue, if he is not able then with his heart and that is the weakest of faith.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Lord has imposed on us that we are from those people who establish justice. As Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;">“Oh you who believe, be from those who establish justice and be witnesses for Allaah even if it is against yourselves, parents or kinfolk.”</span> (4:135)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also ordered us to cooperate upon righteousness and piety and not sin and transgression. As Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;">“And cooperate upon righteousness and piety and do not cooperate upon sin and transgression, and have taqwa of Allaah; certainly Allaah is strong in punishment.”</span> (5:2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Allaah ordered us with jihad, as a means for spreading the religion and defending it</strong></span>. We were ordered to make jihad with the sword and with the tongue. We were ordered with the jihad of clarifying, (establishing) evidences, and proofs. And this is the jihad of the prophets (may peace be upon them all).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Allaah ordered (us) with truthfulness</strong></span> and what comes along with it, and forbade us from lying and what comes along with it. The Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">“Upon you is to be truthful, for truthfulness guides to goodness and goodness guides to paradise. A man will continue to be truthful and he is lead to that, until it is written with Allaah that he is truthful. And beware of lying, for lying leads to wickedness and wickedness leads to the fire. A man will continue lying and he is lead to that until it is written with Allaah that he is a liar.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (may peace be upon him)<span style="color:#993300;"><strong> warned us from false suspicion</strong></span> when he said: “Beware of suspicion, for suspicion is the worst of false tales.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">He ordered us with brotherhood</span></strong> and being diligent upon coming together as brothers. The Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">“The Muslim is a brother to another Muslim, he does not deceive him nor desert him. The Muslim’s honor, wealth and blood are sacred.”</span> (Then he said) “Piety is here,” (pointing to his chest three times) and he said, <span style="color:#008000;">“It is sufficient enough evil for a person to hold his Muslim brother in contempt.”</span> (Narrated by at-Tirmidhi who said the hadeeth is hasan)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (may peace be upon him) (also) said: “Do not envy one another, do not hate one another, do not turn away from one another, do not inflate prices on one another, but be, (oh) servants of Allaah, brothers (to one another).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>He ordered us with (giving) advice</strong></span>. He said: “The religion is advice.” So we said, “To whom, oh Messenger of Allaah?” He said: “To Allaah, to His Book, to His Messenger, to the leaders of the Muslims and to the common folk.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">He ordered us with helping the oppressed and the oppressor</span></strong>. He said: “Help your brother if he is an oppressor or oppressed.” A man then said: “Oh Messenger of Allaah, I (can see) helping him if he is being oppressed. But if I see that he is the oppressor how can I help him?!” He said: “Hold him and prevent him from oppression and this is (your) helping him.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah informed us that oppression will be darkness on the Day of Judgment. Allaah says: “Indeed, Allaah does not do injustice, [even] as much as an atom&#8217;s weight; while if there is a good deed, He multiplies it and gives from Himself a great reward.” (4:4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (may peace be upon him) said (that Allaah says) in a Hadeeth al-Qudsi [1]: “Oh my servants, surely I have made oppression forbidden upon Myself and I have made it forbidden amongst you, therefore do not oppress (one another).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Allaah has made excessiveness and extremism forbidden in the religion</strong></span>. Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;">“Oh People of the Scripture, do not commit excess in your religion or say about Allaah except the truth.”</span>(4:171)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">“Beware of excessiveness, for certainly the people before you were destroyed because of their excessiveness in the religion.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said: <span style="color:#008000;">“Do not exaggerate with me as the Christians exaggerated with (Jesus) the son of Mary.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>He (Allaah) made forbidden partisanship and tribalism</strong></span>, as the Messenger of Allaah (may peace be upon him) said:<span style="color:#008000;"> “Whoever is killed under the banner of a people whose cause is not clear and calls to fanatical partisanship or tribalism or supports it and is killed, he dies in a state of jaahiliyyah</span> [2].”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">It is not correct for those who educate to make the people into parties or groups and to make enmity and hatred between them. Rather they should be as brothers, cooperating upon righteousness and piety.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">As Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;">“And cooperate upon righteousness and piety and do not cooperate upon sin and transgression, and have taqwa of Allaah, certainly Allaah is strong in punishment.”</span> (5:2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">It is not (correct) for anyone to take a vow to be in agreement with everything that someone wants, and to support those whom he supports and to become an enemy to those he is an enemy to. Rather whoever does this, he is from the likes of Genghis Khan [3] and those similar to him. They are the ones who make those in agreement with them their supporting friends and they make those who oppose them their hated enemies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">What is binding upon them and their followers is the covenant of Allaah and His Messenger (may peace be upon him). So they must obey Allaah and His Messenger and work by what Allaah and His Messenger ordered. They must make forbidden that which Allaah and His Messenger made forbidden. They must take care of the rights of those (scholars and students) who educate people as Allaah and His Messenger have ordered. So if a teacher (scholar or student) is the one being oppressed, then he aids him and if a teacher is the oppressor, then he does not aid him in his oppression, rather he prevents him from it. As what has been authentically reported is that the Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: “Help your brother if he is an oppressor or oppressed.” A man then said: “Oh Messenger of Allaah, I (can see) helping him if he is being oppressed. But if I see that he is the oppressor how can I help him?!” He said: “Hold him and prevent him from oppression and this is (your) helping him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(End of Ibn Taymiyyah’s quote)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>It is obligatory for this ummah to establish these affairs of great benefits and upright principles. And (the ummah) must have a concern for this with a true care, whether it be an individual, group, tribe, or government, and specifically the scholars and the students of knowledge. This applies more specifically to those who ascribe themselves to the people of Sunnah and the Jamaa’ah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>So if there is (any) exceeding of the limits of these affairs or anything from them, great corruption will appear in the world and the religion, and this leads to the destruction of these great guideposts. In this is a dangerous evil and great corruption.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>And from that of which there is no doubt for the one who has intellect, there has occurred great exceeding of the limits and harmful oppression for the one who speaks the truth. He is rebutted for what is with him of the truth, belittled and insulted, and this is something extremely bad. It coming from a disbeliever (is one thing) but how much more coming from a Muslim?</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Therefore it is upon the Muslim ummah, specifically the youth who are its pillars, to honor and respect the truth and magnify it. It is upon them to despise falsehood and its people, whoever they may be. Allaah will honor them, give them might and elevate their affairs because of this. The opposite of this only brings misguidance, trials, and displeasure from Allaah. This will (lead) to punishments in the life of this world. From these punishments is that the enemies will have authority over them until they return to their true religion and adhere to it.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah give us all success in what pleases Him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#888888;"><em>The Likeness Of Those Who Seek To Unite The Muslims Even Though They Are Upon Divergent Beliefs, Is The Likeness Of One Who Attempts To Bring Together Water And Fire, And A Reptile And Fish</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sheikh Saaleh al Fawzaan </strong>(may Allaah preserve him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As long as the Aqeedah is shaky and blemished, the Muslims cannot be united.  It is not possible to unite the one upon Bidah with the one upon the Sunnah, <b>abadan.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not possible to unite the person of corrupted aqeedah with the person of sound aqeedah, even though they share the same name (i.e. they are both called Muslims).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is inevitable to unite the word of the Muslims upon Tawheed, upon the correct aqeedah, upon the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (Muhammad-sallal-laahu-alayhi-wasallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslims must be together.  They are to be united, and that they follow that which comes from that (bond and unity), as long as this does not depart from obedience to Allaah and His Messenger (sallal-laahu-alayhi-wasallam)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For that reason the Messenger (sallal-laahu alayhi wasallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8221;Allaah is pleased for you with three things:  &#8221;that you worship Him (alone) and not to associate anything with Him; and that you (all) hold unto the Rope of Allaah and not to be divided; and that you give sincere advise to the one placed in charge over your affairs (i.e. the Muslim Ruler)&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who calls to the unity of the Muslims, even though they differ in their aqeedah, this indeed cannot be possible.  The one who wants to unite the Muslims, even though they are upon divergent beliefs, even though they are upon shaky beliefs, this is but inconceivable like the one who attempts to bring together water and fire (This is not  possible);  Or bring together (as it is said) a reptile and a fish.   This is not possible ever, because the reptile lives on land and the fish lives in the sea&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;">Al-Istiqaamah Magazine &#8211; Issue No.7</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> Rabee&#8217; ul-Awwal 1418H / July 1997</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;">By Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Jameel Zaynoo</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Understand that judging by what Allaah revealed in His Book is incumbent upon the Muslim, and not doing so results an many calamities befalling the Ummah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That there would always continue to be a group from this Ummah clinging to the truth and to the pure Tawheed of Allaah until the day of Judgment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Say: Allaah has power to send punishment upon you from above you, or from under your feet; or to cover you in confusion with party strife; and make you taste the inter-fighting and violence of one another. See how We variously explain the Aayaat (proofs and signs), so that they may understand.” [Sooratul-An’aam 6:65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, when this verse was revealed: “Say: Allaah has power to send punishment upon you from above you.” So he said: “I seek refuge in Your Face.” “Or from under your feet.” He said: “I seek refuge in Your Face.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Or to cover you in confusion with party strife, and make you taste the inter-fighting and violence of one another.” So Allaah’s Messenger (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said: “This is lighter or easier.” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said: “Indeed Allaah gathered up the earth for me so that I saw its eastern and western parts, and indeed the dominion of my Ummah will reach what was gathered up for me from it. And I have been granted the two treasures of gold and silver. And indeed I asked my Lord for my Ummah that it should not be totally destroyed by a prevailing famine, nor to allow on enemy to totally conquer it, except from amongst themselves. So my Lord said: O Muhammad! When I decree a matter, then it is not reversed. I grant to you for your Ummah that it would not be totally destroyed by a prevailing famine, nor will it be totally conquered by on external enemy, even if all the notions were to rally against it However, a group from your Ummah will destroy one another and imprison one another.” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) also said: “I asked my Lord for three things, I was granted two; but prevented from one: I asked my Lord that He should not destroy my Ummah with drought and famine, so He granted it to me. I asked my Lord that He should not destroy my Ummah with drowning, so he granted it to me. And I asked Him not to cause my Ummah to fight amongst themselves, but he refused that to me.” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this inter-fighting that has befallen the Muslims has been further emphasized in his (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) saying: “And when your leaders do not judge by the Book of Allaah, not seeking the good and welfare with Allaah has revealed, then Allaah would cause them to fight one another.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, in an addition to the second narration: “Indeed, what I fear for my Ummah are misguided leaders, and that when the sword is drown out against them, it will not be lifted from them until the Day of Judgement. And the Hour will not come, until sections of my Ummah will follow the mushrikeen (those who worship others along with Allaah), and until many sections of my Ummah will worship idols. And there will be in my Ummah thirty liars; all of whom will claim that he is a Prophet. But I am the last and the seal of the Prophets; there is no Prophet after me. And there will not cease to be a group from my Ummah being helped upon the truth, not being harmed by those who oppose them; until the commend of Allaah comes.” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">SOME BENEFITS FROM THE ABOVE AAYAH AND HADEETH:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]: It shows the great power of Allaah &#8211; the Most High – in sending punishment to the previous nations, from above them, and from beneath their feet, causing them to be annihilated and destroyed. Due to this, Allaah’s Messenger (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) sought refuge and protection in the Face of his Lord against his Ummah being punished in a similar manner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]: The first hadeeth (narration) affirms that Allaah – the Most High – has a wajh (Face), but in a manner that befits His Greatness and Majesty, there being any tashbeeh (resemblance) between Allaah and between that of His creation; as Allaah said: “There is none like Him; and He is the all-Hearing, the all-Seeing.” [Sooratush-Shooraa 42:11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]: It shows the great power of Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; in that whenever the Muslims abandon judging by the Sharee’ah (Divinely Prescribed Law) of Allaah; but rather take to manmade laws that oppose the Law of Allaah &#8211; which, with deep regret, is happening now &#8211; then Allaah causes the Ummah to split-up into sects and parties, and makes them fight one another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]: It Shows the might of Allaah in that He gathered-up the earth for His Messenger (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam), so that he saw its eastern and western parts; and that the dominion of his Ummah would extend over all that which was gathered-up for him, from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]: It shows the mercy of Allaah to the Muslim Ummah, in His not sending against them a punishment that would totally destroy the entire Ummah; but it would only cause destruction to parts of the Ummah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]: An-Nawawee (d.676H) &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said: “In this hadeeth is a clear and apparent miracle, all of which has come to pass &#8211; so all praise be to Allaah.” [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]: It also shows the mercy of Allaah to the Muslim Ummah in that He has not allowed an external enemy to overpower them, such that they have complete control over them. Rather, Allaah has caused some parts of the Ummah to fight against others; and this is far easier than the former case.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]: It Shows the fear that Allaah’s Messenger (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) had for his Ummah with regards to the misguided leaders who would not take hold of the Book and the Sunnah; and how he warned against them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]: That when the sword has been drawn out against this Ummah, then it would not be lifted from it until the Day of Judgement &#8211; as is happening at this very time now.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]: It proves that shirk would be present in the Ummah. And shirk is: Directing worship, or forms of worship, to other than Allaah, such as making du’aa (supplication) to other that Allaah, or judging by other than what Allaah has legislated and revealed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]: We are informed about the existence of those who would claim that they are Prophets and that they are all liars in this claim; such as Musaylimah al-Kadhdhaab in earlier times, and in more recent times Ghulaam Ahmad Mirza, the Qaadiyaanee (whose followers are called Qaadiyaanees).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12]: That there would always continue to be a group from this Ummah clinging to the truth and to the pure Tawheed of Allaah until the day of Judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam an-Nawawee &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“As for this group, then Imaam al-Bukhaaree (d.256H) said: “They are the people of knowledge.” And Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal (d.241H) said: “If they are not Ahlul-Hadeeth (the Scholars of Hadeeth), then I do not know who they can be.” Qaadee ’Iyaad said: “What Imaam Ahmad meant by that was Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah and whosoever holds the ’aqeedah (belief) of Ahlul-Hadeeth.” I say: It is possible that this group could be scattered amongst the various categories of Believers, from them:- the brave warriors, the Scholars of Hadeeth, the zuhhaad (those who abstain from the world in a praiseworthy manner), those that enjoin the good and forbid the evil, and other categories of people who do good.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibnul-Mubaarak (d.181H) &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said: “In my view they are Ashaabul-Hadeeth (the companions of Hadeeth).” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the preferred saying is that this Aided and Victorious Group are those that act in accordance with the authentic hadeeth, not giving precedence to the saying of anyone over and above the saying of Allaah and His Messenger (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Ibaanah Magazine, Issue No.1 &#8211; Dhul-Qa’dah 1415H / April 1995</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<b>Allaah has promised to those of you who believe and do righteous actions, that He will certainly grant them succession</b><b> (<i>khilaafah</i>) upon the earth, as He granted it to those before them; and that He will grant them authority to practice their Religion, the one that He has chosen for them and He will change their state from one of fear in which they lived, to one of peace and security. They will worship Me alone, not associating any partner with Me.  But whosoever disbelieves after this, then they are the rebellious ones.</b>” [Soorah Noor 24:55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">’Ubayy Ibn Ka’b relates that the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: “Give glad-tidings to this <i>Ummah</i> of high position, establishment upon this earth, victory and a lofty status in this world and in the Hearafter.” [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Katheer (d.774H) – <i>rahimahullaah</i> – said: [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is a promise from Allaah – the Most High – to His Messenger, may the Prayers of Allaah and the peace be upon him, that he will make this <i>Ummah</i> the <i>khulafaa‘</i> (successors) upon the earth.  Meaning that they will be the leaders and rulers over mankind, by whom nations will be corrected and to whom mankind will submit.  And that He will replace their state of fear in which they lived, to one of security and dominion.  Allaah – the Blessed, the Most High – has fulfilled His promise, and to Him belongs all praise and thanks.  For the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) did not die until Allaah made him conquer Makkah, Khaybar, al-Bahrain, the remaining lands of the Arabian peninsula and the whole of Yemen.  He took <i>jizyah</i> (protection tax) from the Magians of Hajar and from the people of the surrounding areas of Syria.  The Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) received gifts from Heraclius – the king of Rome; the ruler of Egypt and Alexandria – the Mawqawqis; the kings of Oman; and Negus, the king of Ethiopia, who became king after Ashamah died – may Allaah have mercy upon him and grant him nobility.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) died, Allaah having chosen for him the reward that is with Him, Aboo Bakr as-Siddeeq was then established as his <i>Khaleefah</i> (successor), taking charge unwaveringly.  Aboo Bakr took the Arabian peninsula and put it in order.  He sent forth armies of Islaam to the lands of Persia, under the command of Khaalid Ibnul-Waleed (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhu</i>).  They conquered parts of these lands, slaying a number of it’s inhabitants.  A second army was sent to the lands of Syria, under the leadership of Aboo ’Ubaydah (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhu</i>) and those who followed him.  A third army was sent to Egypt under the leadership of ’Amr Ibnul-’Aas (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhu</i>).  It was during his time that the armies sent to Syria conquered the cities of Busra, Damascus and it’s environs from the land of Hawraan and it’s surroundings.  Allaah – the Mighty and Majestic – took the soul of Aboo Bakr – choosing for him the reward which is with Him.  Allaah blessed the people of Islaam by inspiring as-Siddeeq to chose ’Umar al-Faarooq as a successor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">’Umar then stood up, taking charge completely.  The heavens will not witness – after the Prophets – anyone like ’Umar, whether in the strength of his reign, or in the fulfillment of justice.  It was during his time that the conquest of Syria was completed; as was that of Egypt to it’s farthest reaches, as well as the province of Persia.  He destroyed Kisraa (Chosroes) and humiliated him to the utmost, forcing him to retreat back to the farthest reaches of his kingdom.  Similarly, ’Umar destroyed Qaysar (Caesar), wrestling from his hands the lands of Syria and bottling him up in Constantinople.  He spent the wealth (conquered from them) in the path of Allaah – as the Messenger of Allaah had informed and promised – may the most complete <i>salaam</i> and most purest <i>salaat</i> be bestowed upon the Messenger from his Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there was the rule of ’Uthmaan, under whom the possessions of Islaam extended to the furthest eastern and western reaches of the earth.  The lands of the west were conquered to the farthest reaches of what lies there – Andulus, Cyprus, the lands of Qayrawaan and the lands of Ceuta – which is next to the all encompassing ocean; and to the farthest lands of China.  Kisraa was killed and his kingdom totally vanquished.  The cities of al-’Iraaq, Khuraasaan and Ahwaaz were conquered and the Muslims slew a large number of Turks.  Allaah having humiliated the Turks and their great king Kha-Khaan.  The wealth of the east and the west was collected and brought to the <i>Ameerul-Mu‘mineen</i> (leader of the Believers) ’Uthmaan Ibn ’Affaan (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhu</i>).  All of this came about as a result of his recitation, study and gathering the <i>Ummah</i> upon the preservation of the <i>Qur‘aan</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is confirmed in the <i>Saheeh</i> that the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: “Indeed Allaah gathered up the earth for me, so that I saw it’s east and it’s west.  Indeed the dominion of my <i>Ummah</i> will reach what was gathered up for me, from it.” [3] We fluctuate in what Allaah has promised us with and in what His Messenger has promised.  Allaah and His Messenger have spoken the truth.  We ask Allaah to grant us <i>eemaan</i> (faith) in Him and His Messenger, and that we establish gratitude of what Allaah has given us, in the matter that He is please with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">’Umar related to us, that Sufyaan related to us from ’Abdul-Malik Ibn ’Umayr, from Jaabir Ibn Samurah who said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) say: “The affair of the people will continue to be upright whilst twelve men are in charge in of them.”  The Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) then said something which I could not make not.  So I asked my father: What did the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) say?  He replied: “They are all from <i>Quraysh</i>.”  This narration is also narrated by al-Bukhaaree. [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this narration there exists a clear evidence that all twelve of these man must be leaders from <i>Quraysh</i>.  They are not the twelve <i>imaams</i> claimed by the <i>Shaee’ah</i>, because many of them had no leadership over the Muslims.  As for these twelve, they will be from <i>Quraysh</i> and they will be just rulers.  The glad-tidings of their appearance have also occurred in the previous scriptures.  Furthermore, it is not necessary that they succeed one another.  Rather, their appearance in the <i>Ummah</i> could be successive or separate.  Four of them were in order, namely, Aboo Bakr, ’Umar, ’Uthmaan and ’Alee (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhum</i>).  After these four there was a gap.  Others amongst the twelve appeared as and when Allaah willed.  It is possible that some of them will appear during a time which only Allaah – the Most High – knows.  Amongst them will be the <i>Mahdee</i> whose name will be that of the Messenger (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>), and his <i>kunyaa</i> (nickname) that of his <i>kunyaa</i>.  He will fill the earth with justice as it is filled with tyranny and injustice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad, Aboo Daawood, at-Tirmidhee and an-Nisaa‘ee have all reported from the <i>hadeeth</i> of Sa’eed Ibn Juhmaan, from Safeenah – the <i>mawlaa</i> (master) of the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallalaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) that the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: “The <i>Khilaafah</i> (successorship) after me will last for thirty years.  Then kingship will appear.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed ar-Rabee’ Ibn Anas has said that Abul-’Aaliyah has remarked concerning this <i>aayah</i>: “The Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) and his Companions were in Makkah for ten years afraid, secretly calling to Allaah and His worship alone, He has no partner.  They remained in such a state that they were ordered to migrate to al-Madeenah.  They were ordered by Allaah to fight.  Whilst they were (in al-Madeenah) they were in constant fear (of attack).  They would go to sleep armed and awake armed.  They remained patient upon that state for as long as Allaah willed, until one day when one individual from amongst the Companions said: “O Messenger of Allaah!  Will we remain in a state of fear until the end of time?  Will there not come a time when we will be in a state of security, so that we may lay down our weapons?”  The Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) then said: “Be patient for a while, for there will come a time when any man from amongst you will sit in a crowd unharmed.”  Allaah sent down this <i>aayah</i> and made his Prophet victorious over the Arabian Peninsula.  The Companions of the Prophet were now safe and they could lay down their weapons.  Allaah – the Most High – then took the soul of His Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) and the Muslims remained in such a state during the leadership of Aboo Bakr, ’Umar and ’Uthmaan; until the Muslims fell into what they fell into from discord.  So fear entered into their hearts and they took armies and guards for protection.  For they had changed, so Allaah changed their state.  One of the <i>Salaf</i> has remarked that the <i>khilaafah</i> of both Aboo Bakr and ’Uthmaan was true.  He then recited this <i>aayah</i>, al-Baraa‘ Ibn ’Aazib has said: “This <i>aayah</i> was revealed whilst we were in a state of extreme fear.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This noble <i>aayah</i> is similar in meaning to His statement – the Most High – :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<b>And remember when you were few and were reckoned weak in the land and were afraid that men might kidnap you, but He </b> <b>(i.e. Allaah)provided a safe place for you, and strengthened you with His help and provided you good things so that you might be grateful.</b>” [Sooratul-Anfaal 8:26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the statement of Allaah – the Most High – : “<b>As he granted that to those before them.</b><b>”  This <i>aayah</i> is similar to what Allaah said about Moosaa </b> (<i>’alayhis-salaam</i>) <b> that he said to his people:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“It may be that your Lord will destroy your enemy and make you succeed </b>(the present rulers) <b>upon earth, so that He may see how you act.</b>” [Sooratul-A’raaf 7:129]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah – the Most High – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<b>And We wished to confer a favour upon those who were oppressed in the land; and to make them leaders and to make them heirs; and to establish them upon earth..</b>.” [Soorah Qasas 28:5-6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah’s statement: “<b>And that He will change their state after the fear in which they lived to one of security and peace.</b>”  This is similar to what the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said to ’Adee Ibn Haatim when ’Adee came as a delegation to the Messenger.  The Messenger (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: “Do you know Hira?”  ’Adee replied: ‘I have not seen it, but I have heard of it.”  The Messenger (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) then said: “By Him in Whose Hand is my soul!  Allaah will complete this matter (i.e. Islaam) until a woman will be able to travel from Hira, until she goes around the House not needing the protection of anyone.  And you will surely conquer the treasure of Kisraa Ibn Hurmuz.”  I (i.e. ’Adee) replied: “Kisraa Ibn Hurmuz!”  The Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) replied: “Yes!  Kisraa Ibn Hurmuz.  Money will be spent until no one will accept it.”  ’Adee Ibn Haatim said: “Now here is the woman leaving from Hira until she goes around the House.  And I was from amongst those who conquered the treasure of Kisraa.  And by Him in Whose Hand is my soul!  The third matter will come to pass because the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) has said so.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad reports upon ’Ubayy Ibn Ka’b who said that the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) has said: “Give glad tidings to this <i>Ummah</i> of ease of life, exalted stature, establishment of their Religion, and victory and leaderhsip upon the earth.  Whoever does acts of the Hereafter for this world, he will have no portion of the Hereafter.” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the statement of Allaah: “<b>They worship Me alone and do not associate anything with Me.</b>”  Ahmad reports upon Mu’aadh who said: ‘I was sitting behind the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) and I except the end of his saddle.  The Prophet said to me: “O Mu’aadh Ibn Jabal!”  I said: “Here I am O Messenger of Allaah in your service.”  The Prophet said: “Do you know what is the Right of Allaah upon His servants?”  I said: “Allaah and His Messenger know best.”  He said: “The Right of Allaah upon the servants is that they worship Him and do not associate anything with Him.”  The Prophet continued to ride on for some time and then he said to me: “O Mu’aadh Ibn Jabal!”  I said: “Here I am O Messenger of Allaah at your service.”  The Prophet said: “Do you know what is the right of the servants upon Allaah if they worship Him alone?”  I said: “Allaah and His Messenger know best.”  He said: “The right of the servants upon Allaah is that He does not punish whomsoever does not associate anything with Him.”  This narration is also narrated in the two <i>Saheehs</i>. [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the statement of Allaah: “<b>But whoever disbelieved after this, and they are the rebellious ones.</b>”  Meaning, whoever steps outside my obedience after that promise, has stepped outside the Command of His Lord, and sufficient is that as a sin.  Since the Companions of the Prophet (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhum</i>) were the most upright and obedient of the people after the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) in fulfilling the commands of Allaah – the Mighty and Majestic – their victory was accordingly.  The Companions of the Prophet made the Word of Allaah supreme, so Allaah Himself aided them in such a manner that He subdued for them the rest of mankind, as well as their lands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the people after the Prophet’s Companions fell short in adhering to some of Allaah’s Commands, their victory accordingly fell short.  It is, however, affirmed in both <i>Saheehs</i> (i.e. al-Bukhaaree and Muslim) in many ways from the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) that he said: “There shall not cease to be a group from my <i>Ummah</i>, victorious upon the truth, not being harmed by those who abandoned them or go against them, until Allaah’s favour comes, and they are like that.” [8] And in a narration: “Until the last of them fights the Anti-Christ (<i>Maseehud-Dajjaal</i>).” [9] All of these narrations are authentic and there is no contradiction between them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ’Abdur-Rahmaan Ibn Naasir as-Sa’dee (d.1376H) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is one of His true promises whose meaning and accomplishment has been witnessed.  He promised those who came with <i>eemaan</i> (faith) and <i>’amalus-saalih</i> (righteous and correct actions) from this <i>Ummah</i>, that He will cause them to be successors upon this earth, so that they are the ones in authority and in charge of the affairs.  Further, that He would establish their Religion – that which He was pleased with for them, which is the Religion of Islaam, which gained ascendancy over all other religions.  He was pleased with it for this <i>Ummah</i>, due to its excellence, nobility and favours upon it, in that He enabled them to establish it, and to establish it’s laws and prescriptions – relating both to manifest and non-manifest matters – upon themselves and upon others, so that the people of other religions and the rest of the disbelievers conquered and humbled.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that He would change their condition of fear to one of security, since it was previously the case that one of them would not be able to manifest his Religion, and they suffered harm and injury from the disbelievers.  The united body of Muslims was very small in number, in comparison to the rest of the people of the earth, who combined to attack them and hope for their downfall.  However, Allaah promised them these things when the <i>aayah</i> was sent down, at a time when they were not witnessing ascendancy and establishment upon this earth, nor the ability to fully establish the Religion of Islaam and full security – such as would enable them to worship Allaah, not associating anything with Him – in a state of not having to fear anyone besides Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the first and foremost of this <i>Ummah</i> combined <i>eemaan</i> and righteous and correct action to a degree surpassing everyone else, so He established them in the land and gave them authority over the people, and granted them the conquest of the east and the west.  They attained full security and complete authority and establishment – and this is one of the astounding signs of Allaah.  This applies until the Hour is established – that whenever the Muslims combine <i>eemaan</i> (faith) and righteous and correct action – then that which Allaah promises will certainly occur.  Indeed Allaah only grants that they be overcome by the unbelievers and the hypocrites, and that they suffer humiliation when the Muslims neglect <i>eemaan</i> and righteous and correct action.” [10]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Nâsir ud-Dîn al-Albânî [1]<br />
<strong>Al-Istiqaamah Magazine</strong>, Issue No.4 &#8211; Jumâdal-Awwal 1417H / November 1996<br />
Taken from al-Asaalah magazine (11/84-87).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: What are the foundations that will enable the Islaamic world to arise again anew?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: That which I believe, is what has been reported in the authentic hadeeth &#8211; which is a clear answer to this question, and to those questions similar to it which are asked in our present time &#8211; and that is the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s</i> saying: <i>&#8220;When you deal in &#8216;eenah (a transaction involving usury), take hold of the tails of cows, become content with agriculture and abandon jihaad in the path of Allaah, then Allaah will permit your humiliation and He will not remove it from you, until you return to your Religion.&#8221;</i>2 Thus the foundation is to return to Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This very fact has been pointed out by Imaam Maalik (d.179H), <i>rahimahullaah</i>, in a statement transmitted from him, which is worthy of being written in gold ink: and that is his saying: &#8220;Whosoever introduces into Islaam an innovation, and holds it to be something good, has indeed alleged that Muharnrnad <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> has betrayed his message. Read the saying of Allaah &#8211; the Most Blessed &#8211; the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you and I have chosen for you Islaam as your religion.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:3].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So that which was not part of the religion at that time, cannot be part of the religion today. And the last part of this Ummah cannot be rectified, except by that which rectified its first part.&#8221;3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The last sentence is the essential part with regards to the answer to this question, since he said: &#8220;And the last part of this Ummah cannot be rectified, except by that which rectified its first part.&#8221; So, just as the affair of the Arabs in <i>jaahillyyah</i> (pre-Islaamic ignorance) was not rectified, except by the advent of the Prophet Muhammad <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> via Divine Revelation &#8211; which brought them happiness in this world and will bring them salvation in the Hereafter &#8211; then likewise, re-establishing a happy and successful Islaamic life cannot be based upon anything other than returning to the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah (the Prophetic guidance).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, this matter is in need of some clarification, due to the presence of a multitude of Islaamic groups and parties in our midst today, each of them claiming to have set out the correct <i>manhaj</i> (methodology) which will bring about the Islaamic society and the rule of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We know from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> that the path to be taken in order to realise this objective (of bringing about the Islaamic society and the rule of Islaam) is a single path, and that is the one which Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; mentions in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed this is My Straight Path, so follow it, and do not follow other paths that will separate you from His Path.&#8221; </b>[Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:152].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> explained this to his Companions, since: <i>One day he drew a straight line for them on the ground and then drew many short lines on both sides of it. He then recited the previous aayah (verse) whilst he was moving his noble finger over the straight line, and he said: &#8220;This is Allaah &#8216;s Path.&#8221; He then pointed to the other lines and said: &#8220;These are other paths, and at the head of each one their is a devil calling towards it.&#8221;</i>4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Lord &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; emphasised in another <i>aayah</i> this very same point which was mentioned in the previous <i>aayah</i>; along with the explanation of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallullaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> in the hadeeth. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And whosoever opposes the Messenger, even after the guidance has been clearly conveyed to him, and follows a path other than that of the Believers, we shall leave him in the path he has chosen and land him in Hell, what an evil destination.&#8221; </b>[Soorah an-Nisaa 4:115].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <i>aayah</i> (verse) contains a great wisdom, since He &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; placed the path of the Believers in conjunction with that which the Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> brought. And the fine point of this wisdom was also indicated by the Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> in the hadeeth of al-lftiraaq (the</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">authentic narration concerning the splitting-up of this Ummah into seventy-three sects), when he was asked about the Saved-Sect, so he replied: <i>&#8220;It is that which I and my Companions are upon today.&#8221;</i>5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is the wisdom in Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; mentioning the path of the Believers in the previous <i>aayah&#8217;</i> And what is the underlying point of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> mentioning his Companions straight after mentioning himself, in the previous hadeeth?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer to this is: that these noble Companions are the very people who received the two Revelations (the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah) from Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, who explained it to them directly &#8211; without an intermediary &#8211; and this is contrary to all those who came after them. And there is no doubt that the affair is as Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam </i>said: &#8220;Indeed, the one present sees that which the absent one does not.&#8221;6 This is why the <i>eemaan</i> (faith) of the Companions was greater than those who came after them, and this is what has been clearly indicated by the Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> in the authentic hadeeth: <i>&#8220;The best of mankind is my generation, then those who follow them, then those who follow them.&#8221;</i>7 <b>Therefore, it is not possible for any Muslim to independently understand the Book and the Sunnah. Rather one must seek aid in understanding them by returning to the understanding of the noble Companions, who took their understanding from the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>; via his statements, his actions and his tacit approvals.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, along with calling to the Book and the Sunnah, it is absolutely essential to attach to this the understanding and the practice of the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> (the Pious Predecessors: the first three generations of Muslims whose excellence has been testified to in the above hadeeth); acting upon the preceding verses and hadeeth, which order clinging to the path of the Believers, which has been explained to be the path upon which the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, his Companions and those who followed them in beliefs and actions, were upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And here, a very important question arises, which many of the Islaamic groups and parties neglect; and that is: How does one obtain knowledge of the understanding and the practical application of the Sunnah that the Companions adhered to?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer to this is: that there is no way in obtaining this knowledge, except by returning to <i>&#8216;ilmul-hadeeth</i> (the knowledge of hadeeth); <i>&#8216;ilm mustalahul-hadeeth</i> (the science of hadeeth) and the science of <i>al-jarh wat-ta&#8217;deel</i> (the science of verifying the condition of the narrators) &#8211; applying its principles and its terms such that the Scholars are able to distinguish that which is authentic from the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, from that which is not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in ending the answer to the question, we say in the the dearest possible manner, to those who desire to bring back to Islaam its honour, strength, supremacy and rule, that you must actualise two matters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Firstly: to bring back to the minds of the Muslims the knowledge of the Sharee&#8217;ah (Laws) of Islaam; purified from all the innovations that have entered into it, which was not part of it on the day when Allaah &#8211; the Most Blessed, the Most High &#8211; revealed His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you and I have chosen for you Islaam as your religion.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:3].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accomplishing this matter requires a huge and tremendous effort on the part of the Muslim Scholars in all parts of the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Secondly: It is a must that this purified knowledge is coupled with constant and steadfast action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, the day the Muslims return to understanding their religion as the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> understood it; and then act upon this purified Islaam in the correct manner, in all aspects of life, then that will be the day that the Muslims will rejoice at the help of Allaah and His victory. So this is what I am able to write in this short time. I ask Allaah that He grants us and all the Muslims the correct understanding of Islaam &#8211; in light of the Book, the authentic Sunnah (guidance) of His Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and that which the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> (Pious Predecessors) were upon &#8211; and that He grants us the ability to act in accordance with it. Indeed Allaah is the One who hears and responds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah Magazine, Issue No.6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE BASIS OF RIGHT GUIDANCE</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) &#8211; <i>rahimahallaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Religion of the Muslims is built upon following the Book of Allaah, the Sunnah of His Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, and that which the Ummah has agreed upon. So these are the three infallible <i>usool</i> (fundamentals). So whatever the Ummah differs in, then it is referred back to Allaah and His Messenger. Thus, it is not for anyone to set-up a person for the Ummah, and to call to his way, and form <i>walaa</i> (love, loyalty and allegiance) and <i>&#8216;adaa</i> (enmity and hatred) based upon that, except for the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. Nor is any speech set-up for them based upon which they form <i>walaa</i> and <i>&#8216;adaa</i>, except for the speech of Allaah, and that of His Messenger, and that which the Ummah has agreed upon. Rather, this is the practice of the people of Innovation, who set-up a person, or a saying, with which they cause splits in the Ummah; forming <i>walaa</i> or<i> &#8216;adaa</i> based upon that saying or ascription.&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Taymiyyah &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; also said:<br />
&#8220;It is not for anyone to ascribe himself to a particular Shaykh and to have <i>walaa</i> with those who follow him, or to have <i>&#8216;adaa</i> based upon that. Rather, he should have <i>walaa</i> for everyone who is from the people of <i>eemaan</i> (i.e. is a Muslim) and is known to have <i>taqwaa</i> (piety and obedience to Allaah in that which He has ordered and prohibited), from the Shaykhs, or from others. No one should be particularised with an increase in <i>walaa</i> except if he sees from him greater <i>eemaan</i> and <i>taqwaa</i>. So precedence and excellence is given to whomsoever Allaah and His Messenger have given them to. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;O mankind! Indeed We created you from a man and a woman, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Indeed the most noblest of you with Allaah are those that have the most <i>taqwaa</i> (piety).&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Hujuraat 49:13].&#8221;2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>SECTARIANISM AND MISPLACED LOYALTIES</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah said:<br />
&#8220;Indeed the people of the truth and the Sunnah do not follow anyone (unconditionally) other than Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>; who does not speak from his desires, rather it is nothing less than Revelation sent down to him. So it is obligatory to affirm all that he informs, and to obey all that he commands. This status is not given to anyone else from this Ummah. Rather, every person&#8217;s saying can be taken or left, except that of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. So whoever sets up an individual other than Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, such that the one who loves and agrees with him is reckoned to be from <i>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah</i>, and the one that differs with him is reckoned to be from the people of innovations and sectarianism &#8211; as happens with those groups who follow certain Imaams of <i>kalaam</i> (theology and rhetorical speech) &#8211; then the person doing so is from the people of innovation, deviation and sectarianism.&#8221;3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; further said:<br />
&#8220;Indeed many &#8211; from the people who say such sayings &#8211; follow their desires in this, in order to elevate their egos, or to gain leadership; or whatever is connected to it. Their intention is not to make the word of Allaah uppermost, nor is it to make the Religion purely for Allaah. Indeed, they have hatred for those who oppose them &#8211; even if it is a <i>mujtahid</i> (a Scholar striving his utmost to arrive at the truth) who is excused, and whom Allaah is not angry with. Likewise, they are pleased with those who agree with them &#8211; even if it is an ignorant person with evil intentions, who neither has any knowledge, nor good intent. This leads them to praise those whom Allaah and His Messenger have not praised, and to censure those whom Allaah and His Messenger have not censured. It also causes them to have <i>walaa</i> (love and allegiance) and <i>&#8216;adaa</i> (enmity and hatred) based upon their own self-desires, not upon the Religion of Allaah and His Messenger &#8230; So whosoever does this will only bring about <i>fitan</i> (trials and discord) between the people.&#8221;4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>PRESERVING THE LOVE AND UNITY</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez bin Baaz &#8211; <i>hafidhahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Religion of Allaah orders to judge (with justice) in all matters, and not to have <i>walaa</i> (love, loyalty and allegiance) with your brother merely because he agrees with you, or to have <i>&#8216;adaa</i> (enmity and being distant) from him merely because he disagrees with you on a certain opinion or issue. This is not from justice at all! The Companions &#8211; <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhum</i> &#8211; differed in various issues, yet this did not affect the happiness and sincerity between them, nor their <i>walaa</i> and love for each other &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with them all. So the Believer acts upon the <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i> (Prescribed and Divine Islaamic Law) of Allaah, follows the truth, gives priority to the evidences before anyone &#8211; yet in doing so, he does not oppress his brother, nor negate doing justice to him when he differs regarding any issue of <i>ijtihaad</i> in which the evidences are not so apparent. Likewise is the case for those issues in which differences occur due to a different interpretation of the text. So, in such instances he is excused, and it is upon you to sincerely advice him, and to love only the good for him, and not to split-up, nor to have enmity and hatred between you and your brother &#8211; and there is no might, nor any power, except with Allaah. &#8220;5</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>KNOWING THE STRAIGHT PATH</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullaah ibn Mas&#8217;ood <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> said:<br />
<i>The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam drew a line for us and said. &#8220;This is Allaah&#8217;s Straight Path.&#8221; Then he drew lines to its right and left and then said. &#8220;These ore other paths. Upon every one of them there is a devil calling towards it.&#8221; Then he recited:</i> <b>&#8220;Indeed this is My Straight Path, so follow it, and do not follow other paths that will separate you from His Path.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:153].&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, that which is necessary for the Muslims &#8211; both individuals and groups in order to prepare for the mighty task and to achieve the lofty goal, is to truly know the Straight Path, its People, their <i>&#8216;aqeedah</i> (belief) and their <i>manhaj</i> (methodology), knowing also the innovations and evils which cause one to separate from this way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The wisdom in learning about the evil is taken from the hadeeth of Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamaan radiallaahu &#8216;anhu where he said. &#8220;The people used to ask the Messenger of Allaah <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> about the good, but I used to ask him about the evil for fear that it would overtake me &#8230;&#8221;2 And may Allaah have mercy upon the one who said in poetic wisdom:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I learnt what was evil, not for itself, but to avoid it. He who does not know evil from good, falls into it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>CLINGING TO THE ORIGINAL STATE OF AFFAIRS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul-&#8216;Aaliyah (d.90H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; who said:<br />
&#8220;Learn Islaam. Then when you have learnt Islaam, do not turn away from it to the right nor the left. But be upon the Straight Path and upon the Sunnah of your Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and that which his Companions were upon &#8230; and beware of these innovations because they cause enmity and hatred amongst you. But stick to the original state of affairs which was there before they divided.&#8221; So &#8216;Aasim said: I related this to al-Hasan al-Basree so he said. &#8220;He has given you sincere advice and has told you the truth.&#8221;3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is known that this original state of affairs, had as its pure and sweet spring, the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah, built upon the understanding of the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> (the Pious Predecessors) &#8211; the Companions, the <i>Taabi&#8217;een</i> and those that followed them &#8211; about whom the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said. <i>&#8220;The best of mankind is my generation, then those who follow them, then those who follow them.&#8221;</i>4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Aaishah <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhaa</i> said:<br />
A man come to the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and said. Who is the most excellent of mankind? So the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;The generation of those that I am in, then the second, then the third.&#8221;</i>5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this principle &#8211; the obligation of adhering to the Qur&#8217;aan and the authentic Sunnah upon the understanding of the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> &#8211; is the cornerstone principle of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Abu Haneefah (d.150H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;Stick to the narrations and the way of the Salaf and beware of newly invented matters, for all of it is innovation.&#8221;6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Awzaa&#8217;ee (d.157H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said.<br />
&#8220;Patiently restrict yourself to the Sunnah and pause where the people paused, say what they said and avoid what they avoided. Take to the path of your Salafus-Saalih, for indeed, what was sufficient for them, is sufficient for you.&#8221;7</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal (d.241H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;The fundamentals of the Sunnah with us are: Clinging to that which the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> were upon, taking them as our examples to be followed; avoiding innovations, for every innovation is misguidance.&#8221;8</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abdul-Haadee (d.748H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;It is not permissible to invent on interpretation about a verse or a Sunnah which was not there in the time of the Salaf (the Pious Predecessors), nor did they have any knowledge concerning it, nor explain it to the Ummah. Since this would imply that the Salaf were ignorant of the truth in this matter and failed to reach it. Whereas the late-coming opponent is somehow guided to the truth!&#8221;9</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim (d.751H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;Inventing on explanation with regards to the Book of Allaah &#8211; which the Salaf and the Scholars are in opposition to &#8211; necessitates one of two things: Either the explanation itself is a mistake. Or that the sayings of the Salaf &#8211; which differs with such a saying &#8211; are in error! And no one who possess even an ounce of intellect would doubt that the one whose saying is in opposition to that of the Salaf, then he is the one who is in error.&#8221;10</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>SOFTENING THE HEARTS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Along with seeking to understand the correct Islaamic <i>&#8216;aqeedah</i> (beliefs) and <i>fiqh</i> (jurisprudence), <i>tafseer</i> (Qur&#8217;aanic explanation), and <i>hadeeth</i>, on essential part of the way of the Salaf includes understanding matters relating to <i>aadaab</i> and <i>akhlaaq</i> (manners and etiquettes) and <i>tazkiyatun-nufoos</i> (purification of the souls) and reflecting upon the lives of the Salafus-Saaliheen. Since this &#8211; it is hoped &#8211; will enable hearts to cultivate mildness and humility in the worship of Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; and also strengthen the determination to strive to making His Religion uppermost in the hearts of the people and upon the face of this earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn al-Jawzee (d.597H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;I feel that occupying oneself with jurisprudence and acquiring the narrations is hardly enough to correct the heart, unless he adds to that the study of <i>raqaa&#8217;iq</i> (heart-melting narrations) and the study of the lives of the Salaf us-Saaliheen (the Pious Predecessors). Since they attained what is desirous from the narrations and took from the outer actions what is ordered and what is wanted from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I do not inform you of this except after personal trial and experience. Since I have found that the majority of the narrators and the students of Hadeeth are concerned chiefly with attaining the briefest <i>isnaad</i> (chain of narration) and increase in the number of narrations. And the majority of the Jurisprudents are concerned with dialectics and how to win arguments. So how can the hearts be softened with these things? Previously a group of the Salaf would visit a pious servant to see his conduct and manners, not to take from his knowledge. This was because the fruit of his knowledge was his manners and conduct, so understand this. Thus, along with the study of <i>fiqh</i> and Hadeeth, study the lives of the Salaf and those who were <i>zaahid</i> (abstainers) with regards to the world, so that this may be a cause of softness in your hearts.&#8221;11</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yoonus ibn &#8216;Ubayd (d.139H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> -said:<br />
&#8220;With good manners you understand the knowledge. With the knowledge your actions are corrected. With actions wisdom is obtained. With wisdom you understand <i>zuhd</i> (abstinence) and are granted its benefits. With <i>zuhd</i> comes abandoning the world. With abandoning the world comes desire for the Hereafter. With desire for the Hereafter the pleasure of Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; is obtained.&#8221;12</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE FOUNDATIONS FOR UNITY</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said:<br />
<i>&#8220;This knowledge will be carried by the trustworthy ones of every generation. They will expel from it the alteration made by those going beyond bounds; the false claims of the liars and the false interpretations of the ignorant ones.&#8221;</i>13</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is our hope in Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect- that He adorns us with the correct knowledge bequeathed to us by our Salafus-Saalih, and that He aids us in learning their <i>&#8216;aqeedah</i>, so that hearts may embrace it; learning their <i>manhaj</i>, so that people may follow it and learning also their manners and behaviour, so that souls may be cultivated upon it, seeking to convey this to others with the wisdom, patience and forebearance that this pure and sublime message demands. So herein lies the excellence and of the one who reaches it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Rajab (d.795H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;So the beneficial knowledge from amongst all the types of knowledge is to take possession of the texts of the Book and the Sunnah and to understand their meanings, and to limit oneself in that to what is reported from the Companions, the <i>Taabi&#8217;een</i> and their Successors &#8211; with regards to the meaning of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Hadeeth, and what is reported from them as regard to the <i>halaal</i> (lawful) and <i>haraam</i> (prohibited), and <i>zuhd</i>, <i>raqaa&#8217;iq</i>, the accounts (of previous nations and Prophets), and other than that. Striving firstly, to distinguish what is authentic and what is weak; and then secondly, striving to understand and comprehend it. And there is enough in that for the intelligent one, and enough to occupy one who busies himself with beneficial knowledge. And he who stops at that and makes his intention purely for the Face of Allaah and seeks His help &#8211; then Allaah will help him, guide him and grant him success, satisfaction, understanding and inspiration. Then such a person will take the benefits of this knowledge &#8211; which ore found through it alone &#8211; and that is fear of Allaah, as Allaah &#8211; the Exalted and Majestic &#8211; says: <b>&#8220;Indeed, it is only those who have knowledge, amongst His slaves, that truly tear Allaah.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Faatir 35:10].&#8221;14</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Awaa&#8217;ee (d.157H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;Hold fast to the narrations of the Salaf, even if people were to abandon you. And beware of the opinions of the people, no matter how much they beautify it with their speech.&#8221;15</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan al-Basree (d.110H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;If there was a man who reached the first Salaf, then he (this man) was raised up today, he would not recognise anything of Islaam.&#8221; The narrator said: Al-Hasan put his hand on his cheek and said. &#8220;Except for this Prayer.&#8221; Then he said. &#8220;So &#8211; by Allaah &#8211; how is it for the one who lives in this bad time, not having reached the Salafus-Saalih. So he sees on innovator calling to his innovation, and a worldly person calling to the world, but Allaah protects him from that and makes his heart lean towards those Salafus-Saalih, asking about their way, seeking their narrations and following their path. Allaah will recompense him with a greet reward. So be like that &#8211; if Allaah wills.&#8221;16</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">source: From Al-Istiqaamah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>SHAYKH &#8216;ABDUL-&#8216;AZEEZ BIN BAAZ</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: What is the obligation upon the Muslim Scholars with regard to the large number of <i>jam&#8217;iyyaat</i> (societies) and <i>jamaa&#8217;aat</i> (groups) in many of the Islaamic lands and elsewhere, and with regard to the differences that exist between them, to the point that each group declares the others to be misguided. Do you not hold that it is fitting to enter into explaining the like of this matter, and to clarify the truth concerning their differences, for fear that these differences will increase and lead to evil consequences for the Muslims?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: &#8220;Our Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> made clear to us a single way which it is obligatory upon the Muslims to follow and traverse, and that is Allaah&#8217;s Straight Path and the methodology of His upright religion. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And this is My Straight Path, so follow it and do not follow other paths that will separate you from His Path. This has He ordained for you, that you may become pious.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:153]. Just as the Lord of Might and Majesty warned the Ummah (nation) of Muhammad <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> against splitting and disunity, since that is one of the greatest causes of failure and of the enemy taking control, as occurs in the saying of Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic&#8217;s: <b>&#8220;And fold fast altogether to the rope of Allaah and do not be divided.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan 3:101]. And His &#8211; the Most High&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;He has ordained for you the same religion which He ordained for Nooh, and that which We revealed to you, and that which We ordained for Ibraaheem, Moosaa and &#8216;Eesaa <i>&#8216;alayhimus-salaam</i>, saying: that you should establish the religion by doing that which you are ordered with, and make no divisions in it. Intolerable for the Pagans is that to which you call them.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ash-Shooraa 42:13]. So this is a Divine call to unity and for hearts to be harmonised. And in any Islaamic land, if there are many groups for the purpose of good, aid, co-operating in righteousness and piety between the Muslims &#8211; without their being differences between the desires of the companions and followers &#8211; then this is good, is a blessing, and produces great benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if each of them declare the others to be misguided and attack their actions, then this harm is very great and its evil consequences very serious. Then what is obligatory upon the Muslims is to clarify the true state of affairs and to discuss with each group and to sincerely advise all of them that they should proceed upon the way laid down by Allaah for His servants, and upon that which our Prophet Muhammad <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> called to. Then those who ignore this, or continue in their stubbornness, due to personal benefit or goal &#8211; known only to Allaah &#8211; then what is obligatory upon those who know the reality is to make this known about them and to warn against them, so that the people may avoid their path, and that those who do not know the reality of their affair may not fall into it and be led astray, and that they are not turned away from the Straight Path which Allaah ordered that we follow, as occurs in His &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;And this is My Straight Path, so follow it and do not follow other paths that will separate you from His Path. This has He ordained for you, that you may become pious.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:153]. And from that which there is no doubt about is that the multitude of sects and groups in the Islaamic society is, firstly something desired by Shaytaan, and secondly something desired by the enemies of Islaam from amongst mankind. Since agreement and unification of the Muslims, and their being aware of the dangers which threaten them and their <i>&#8216;aqeedah</i> (beliefs), will make them active in refuting and rebutting it, and acting in a unified manner for the benefit of the Muslims &#8211; thus repelling the danger from their religion, their lands and their brothers. And this is something which the enemies &#8211; from amongst mankind and jinn &#8211; are not pleased with. Therefore they are very eager to split-up the Muslims, destroy their unity and to sow the seeds of enmity and discord between them. We ask Allaah that He unites the Muslims upon the truth and that He removes from their society every type of misguidance and every cause of discord. Indeed He is the One Who is able to do that, and He is the One having full power over it.&#8221; 1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: &#8230; and the students of knowledge refer back to you and to the other major Scholars and ask them. So what do you advise them? Do you advise and approve of entering (i.e. joining) the likes of these groups; such as <i>Jamaa&#8217;atul-Ikhwaan</i>, <i>Jamaa&#8217;atut-Tableegh</i>, <i>Jamaa&#8217;atul-Jihaad</i>, and so on, or do you advise them to remain upon seeking knowledge with the students of knowledge from those who call to the way of the Salaf (the Pious Predecessors)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: &#8220;All praise is for Allaah and may Allaah extol and send blessings of peace upon His Prophet. We advise them all to unite upon a single way and that is the way of seeking knowledge and attaining understanding of the Book and the Sunnah, and to proceed along the <i>manhaj</i> (methodology) of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah. I advise them all that their goal should be to follow the Book and the Sunnah and to proceed upon the <i>manhaj</i> of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah, and that they should all call themselves Ahlus-Sunnah or the followers of the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> (Pious Predecessors). But as for <i>tahazzub</i> (bigotted partisanship) for the <i>Ikhwaanul-Muslimeen</i>, or <i>Jamaa&#8217;atut-Tableegh</i>, or so on, then I do not advise that. That is a mistake. Rather we advise them that they should be together upon a single way, a single <i>jamaa&#8217;ah</i>, advising one another with the truth and having allegiance to Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah. This is the correct way to prevent differences. But if there are various groups upon that same way (i.e. of following the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i>) &#8211; a group in such and such a place, and another in such and such a place &#8211; but all of them are upon the <i>Salafee</i>2 way, following the Book and the Sunnah, calling to Allaah and having allegiance to Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah &#8211; without <i>tahazzub</i> (partisanship) and without <i>ta&#8217;assub</i> (bigotted blind-following) &#8211; then that is not harmful &#8211; even if there are a number of groups &#8211; as long as their way and their goal is one.&#8221;3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>SHAYKH SAALIH AL-FAWZAAN</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: Noble Shaykh, with regards to the serious state in which the Ummah of Islaam lives &#8211; a state of confusion in peoples&#8217; thoughts &#8211; particularly in matter relating to the Religion. For the Islamic <i>Jamaa&#8217;ahs</i> (groups) and sects have become many, and each of them claim that their <i>manhaj</i> (methodology) is the correct Islamic methodology which must be followed. So the Muslim is left in a state of confusion as to what he should follow and which one is upon the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: &#8220;Splitting up is not from the Religion, since the Religion commands us with unity and that we should be a single <i>Jamaa&#8217;ah</i> and a single Ummah upon the <i>&#8216;aqeedah</i> (belief) of Tawheed (i.e. to single out Allaah alone for worship) and upon following the Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Indeed this Ummah of yours is a single Ummah and I am your Lord, so worship Me alone.&#8221; </b>[Soorah al-Anbiyaa 21:92]. And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And hold fast altogether to the rope of Allaah and do not become divided.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan 3:103]. And Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Indeed those who split-up their Religion and become sects, you have no part with them in the least. Their affair is with Allaah who will tell them what they used to do.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:159]. So this contains a severe warning against splitting and differing. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:<b> &#8220;And do not be like those who split-up and differed after the clear evidences came to them. For them is a tremendous punishment.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan 3:105].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So our Religion is the Religion of <i>al-Jamaa&#8217;ah</i>, and the Religion of agreement and unity. Splitting is not from the Religion, since the Religion orders that we are a single <i>Jamaa&#8217;ah</i> and the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said:<i> &#8220;The Believer to the Believer is like a building, one part supporting the other.&#8221;</i>4 And he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> also said: <i>&#8220;The example of the Believers with respect to their mutual love, mercy and affection is like the example of a single body.&#8221;</i>5 And it is known that a building and a body are a single cohesive thing, not disunited and fragmented &#8211; since if a building splits then it will collapse; and likewise a body, if it splits, then life will be lost. Thus, there must be a unity and we must be a single <i>Jamaa&#8217;ah</i> whose foundations is Tawheed and whose methodology is the <i>da&#8217;wah</i> (call) of the Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>; and which proceeds upon the Religion of Islaam. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And this is My Straight Path, so follow it, and do not follow other paths that will separate you from His Path.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:153]. So these groups, and this splitting which is present today, is not approved of by Islaam. Rather, Islaam forbids it severely and commands uniting upon the <i>&#8216;aqeedah</i> (belief) of Tawheed and upon the methodology of Islaam, a single <i>Jamaa&#8217;ah</i> and a single Ummah, just as our Lord &#8211; the Most Perfect, the Most High &#8211; ordered. And splitting and their being many (differing) groups and parties is from the plots of the devils &#8211; from the jinn and mankind &#8211; against this Ummah. So the <i>kuffaar</i> (disbelievers) and the <i>munaafiqs</i> (hypocrites) have never ceased, since olden times, introducing their poison in order to split the Ummah. The jews said previously: <b>&#8220;And a party of the People of the Book say: Believe in the morning in that which is revealed to the Muslims, but reject it at the end of the day, so they may turn back.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan 3:72]. Meaning: that the Muslims will leave their religion when they see you leaving it. And the Hypocrites said: <b>&#8220;Do not spend on those who are with Allaah&#8217;s Messenger until they desert him.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Munaafiqoon 63:7]. <b>&#8220;And as for those who erect a mosque by way of disbelief and seeking to harm and disunite the Believers &#8230;&#8221;</b> [Soorah at-Tawbah 9:107].&#8221; 6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q]: What is the ruling with regards to those who align themselves with those <i>jamaa&#8217;ahs</i>, particularly those that are established upon secrecy and giving <i>bay&#8217;ah</i> (pledge of allegiance to the party leader)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: &#8220;The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> informed us that splitting would occur and he ordered us, at that particular time, to come together and to be upon that which the Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and his Companions were upon. So he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;The jews split-up into seventy-one sects and my Ummah would split-up into seventy-three sects. All of them are in the Fire except one.&#8221;</i> They said: Who is it O Messenger of Allaah? So he replied: <i>&#8220;That which I and my Companions are upon this day.&#8221;</i>7 And he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said, when his Companions asked him to advise him: <i>&#8220;I advise you to have taqwaa (fear and obedience) of Allaah and to hear and to obey, even if an Abysinnian slave is a leader over you. And those of you who live long after me will see many differences of opinion. So hold fast to my Sunnah and the guidance of the Rightly-Guided Khaleefahs (Successors) after me; cling to it tightly &#8230;&#8221;</i>8 So this is the <i>manhaj</i> (methodology) which is obligatory for all the Muslims to follow, until the Day of Resurrection. So when disagreements occur then they must return back to that which the Salaf (the Pious Predecessors) of this Ummah were upon, with regards to <i>manhaj</i>, <i>bay&#8217;ah</i> (pledge of allegiance), and other matter connected to the Religion.&#8221;</p>

2. Imaam as-Sam&#8217;aanee (d.562H) said in <i>al-Insaab</i> (3/273): &#8220;As-Salafee: this is an ascription to the Salaf and following their ways, in that which is related from them.&#8221; Ibn al-Atheer (d.630H) said in <i>al-Lubaab fee Tahdheebul-Insaab</i> (2/162), commenting upon the previous saying of as-Sam&#8217;aanee: &#8220;And a group were known by this ascription.&#8221; So the meaning is: that the term Salafee, and its ascription to them, was a matter known in the time of as-Sam&#8217;aanee &#8211; the sixth century &#8211; or before him.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Al-Istiqaamah &#8211; Shawwaal 1418H / February 1998 &#8211; Issue No.8</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]:<b>THE OBLIGATION TO UNIFY THE RANKS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ibn al-&#8216;Uthaymeen &#8211; hafidhahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;From the sincere advice which I hold to be necessary in the Religion to give to the youths, a word which I hope that Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect, the Most High &#8211; will cause to be of benefit, and it is:That they should all be in conformity and harmony, so that they may become strong, and become an obstacle blocking the way of those who plot against Islaam and its people. This is what Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; has enjoined upon us. He &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And hold fast altogether to the rope of Allaah and do not be divided. And remember the favour of Allaah upon you, in that you were once enemies to one another, but He joined your hearts together, so that by His Grace you became brothers.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:103]. And Allaah the Blessed, the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Let there arise from amongst you a group of people inviting to all that is good, enjoining the good and forbidding the evil. It is they who are the successful ones, And do not be like those who differed amongst themselves after the clear proofs had come to them; for them is a painful punishment.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:104-105]. So Allaah ordered that they should all cling together to His rope and He forbade splitting, and in other Aayahs He forbade differing, and informed us that it is the cause of failure and the cause of decline of strength, and He ordered us to persevere patiently. So Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And do not differ, lest you lose courage and your strength departs, and be patient. Indeed Allaah is with those who are patient.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Anfaal 8:46]. And as is known, the people of good who help the youths of the revival in their work &#8211; with what they are able from wealth, and so on &#8211; if they see them splitting in this way, then they will not be so eager to help and assist them. So I call all of our brothers to unite together, and to fear Allaah with regards to themselves and with regards to the Ummah (nation) of Islaam, and that they should not cover up this light which has appeared on the horizon; the call to Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8230;&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;Holding fast to the rope of Allaah altogether and not becoming divided is one of the greatest usool (fundamentals) of Islaam.&#8221;2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]:<b>THE PROHIBITION OF SPLITTING</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan &#8211; hafidhahullaah &#8211; said: &#8220;Splitting up is not from the Religion, since the Religion</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">commands us with unity and that we should be a single Jamaa&#8217;ah and a single Ummah upon the &#8216;aqeedah (belief) of Tawheed (i.e. to single out Allaah alone for worship) and upon following the Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;aloyhi wa sallam. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:<b>&#8220;Indeed this Ummah of yours is a single Ummah and I am your Lord, so worship Me alone.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Anbiyaa 21:92]. And Allaah &#8211; the Most High -said: <b>&#8220;And hold fast altogether to the rope of Allaah and do not become divided.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmaan 3:103]. And Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Indeed those who split-up their Religion and become sects, you have no part with them in the least. Their affair is with Allaah who will tell them what they used to do.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:159]. So this contains a severe warning against splitting and differing. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And do not be like there who split-up and differed after the clear evidences came to them. For them is a tremendous punishment.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:105].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So our Religion is the Religion of al-Jamaa&#8217;ah, and the Religion of agreement and unity. Splitting is not from the Religion, since the Religion orders that we are a single Jamaa&#8217;ah and the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said: <i>&#8220;The Believer to the Believer is like a building, one part supporting the other.&#8221;</i>3 And he sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam also said: <i>&#8220;The example of the Believers with respect to their mutual love, mercy and affection is like the example of a single body.&#8221;</i>4 And it is known that a building and a body are a single cohesive thing, not disunited and fragmented &#8211; since if a building splits then it will collapse; and likewise a body, if it splits, then life will be lost. Thus, there must be a unity and we must be a single Jamaa&#8217;ah whose foundation is Tawheed and whose methodology is the da&#8217;wah (call) of the Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam; and which proceeds upon the Religion of Islaam. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:<b>&#8220;And this is My Straight Path, so follow it, and do not follow other paths that will separate you from His Path.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:153]. So these groups, and this splitting which is present today, is not approved of by Islaam. Rather, Islaam forbids it severely and commands uniting upon the &#8216;aqeedah (belief) of Tawheed and upon the methodology of Islaam, a single Jamaa&#8217;ah and a single Ummah, just as our Lord &#8211; the Most Perfect, the Most High &#8211; ordered. And splitting and their being many (differing) groups and parties is from the plots of the devils &#8211; from the jinn and mankind against this Ummah. So the kuffaar (disbelievers) and the munaafiqs (hypocrites) have never ceased, since olden times, introducing their poison in order to split the Ummah. The jews said previously: <b>&#8220;And a party of the People of the Book say: Believe in the morning in that which is revealed to the Muslims, but reject it at the end of the day, so they turn back.&#8221; </b>[Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan 3:72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: that the Muslims will leave their religion when they see you leaving it. And the Hypocrites said: <b>&#8220;Do not spend on those who are with Allaah&#8217;s Messenger until they desert him.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Munaafiqoon 63:7]. <b>&#8220;And as for those who erect a mosque by way of disbelief and seeking to harm and disunite the Believers &#8230;&#8221;</b> [Soorah at-Tawbah 9:107].&#8221;5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]: <b>THE CONNECTION BETWEEN UNITY AND REFUTING FALSE BELIEFS AND PRACTICES</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez bin Baaz &#8211; hafidhahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There is no doubt that it is obligatory upon the Muslims to unify their ranks and to unite their word upon the truth and to co-operate in goodness and piety against the enemies of Islaam &#8211; as Allaah, the Most Perfect &#8211; ordered them with in His saying: <b>&#8220;And hold fast altogether to the rope of Allaah and do not become divided.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:102]. And likewise, Allaah has warned the Muslims against splitting up, as occurs in His &#8211; the Most Perfect&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;And do not be like those who differed and split-up after the clear evidences came to them.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:105]. However, the order to unify the Muslims and unite their word upon the truth and to hold fast to the rope of Allaah, does not mean that they should not censure wrong beliefs and practices &#8211; whether from the Soofees or other than them. Rather, what the order to hold fast to the Rope of Allaah necessitates is: To order the good; forbid the evil; to clarify the truth, with the clear Sharee&#8217;ah proofs, to whomsoever is misguided or has a mistaken opinion, until they unite upon the truth and turn away from that which opposes it. All of this is included in His &#8211; the Most Perfect&#8217;s &#8211; saying:<b> &#8220;And help you one another in righteousness and piety, and do not help one another in sin and transgression.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:2]. And His &#8211; the Most Perfect&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;Let there arise from amongst you a group of people calling to all that is good, enjoining the good and forbidding the evil, they are the ones who are successful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal&#8217;Imraan 3:1 10]. And when the people of truth hold back from clarifying the mistakes of those who have erred or are mistaken, then they will not have achieved that which Allaah ordered them with, as regards calling to goodness, ordering the good and forbidding the evil. So the person in error will remain upon his error, and the one acting in opposition to the truth will remain upon his mistake. And this is contrary to what Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; prescribed, with regards to sincere advice, co-operation upon goodness, ordering the good and forbidding the evil &#8211; and Allaah alone is the One Who grants success.&#8221;6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said: &#8220;Refuting ahlul-bida&#8217; (the innovators) is a Jihaad, to the extent that Yahyaa ibn Yahyaa (d.226H) said: &#8220;Defence of the Sunnah is more excellent than Jihaad in the path of Allaah.&#8221;7&#8243;8</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Humaydee (d.218H) &#8211; rahimahullaoh &#8211; said: &#8220;By Allaah, that I fight against those who reject the hadeeth of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam is more beloved to me than fighting the unbelievers.&#8221;9</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim (d.751H)- rahimahullaah &#8211; said: &#8220;Jihaad with the clear proofs and the tongue; Comes before Jihaad with the sword and the spear.&#8221;10</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said: &#8220;When some people asked Ahmad bin Hanbal (d.241H) that they felt uneasy about [criticising people] by saying that such and such is this, and such and such is that, he replied: &#8220;lf I were to remain silent, how would the ignorant ones know the authentic [narrations] from the inauthentic?&#8221; Similarly, the innovators who introduce heretical writings which oppose the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah, and those who innovate in matters of worship, then explaining their true condition and warning the Ummah against them is an obligation by the unanimous agreement of the Muslim Scholars. In fact, when Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal was asked whether a person who fasted, prayed and secluded himself in the mosque for worship was dearer to him than a person who spoke out against ahlul-bid&#8217;ah (the innovators), he replied: &#8220;When he fasts and prays and secludes himself, then he does so for the benefit of his own self. However, when he speaks out against the innovators, he does so for the benefit of the Muslims in general, and this is more virtuous.&#8221; So it is clear that opposing the Innovators is of general benefit to the Muslims and is considered one of the types of Jihaad in the path of Allaah. Since purifying the Religion of Allaah, and its minhaaj (methodology), its Shoree&#8217;ah, and defending it from their attacks and that of their enemies is a collective obligation &#8211; a fact which is agreed upon by the Scholars. For if Allaah did not raise up some people to repel the harms [caused by] others, then the Religion would become corrupted. Indeed, this type of corruption is even greater than the corruption resulting from the disbelievers conquering the Muslims. This is because <b>when the disbelievers conquer the Muslims, they do not corrupt their hearts nor their Religion, except after some time. Whereas the innovators corrupt the hearts from the very outset.&#8221;</b>11</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Guidelines for Unifying the Ummah<br />
source: Al-Istiqaamah Issue No.8 &#8211; Shawwal 1418H / February 1998</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THE 3 INFALLIBLES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first and most important of these guidelines is: Clinging to the three infallibles; the Qur&#8217;aan, the Sunnah, and that which the Pious Predecessors of this Ummah had Ijmaa&#8217; (agreement) upon.It is these infallible that determine the correct method of understanding the Religion. It it these infallibles which make up the great usool (fundamentals) that this precious Ummah should be called to gather and unite upon.Ibn Taymiyyah &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said: &#8220;The religion of the Muslims is based upon following the Book of Allaah, the Sunnah of His Prophet &#8216;alayhis-salaam, and that which the Ummah has agreed upon; these are the three infallible usool.&#8221; He also said, &#8220;The ijmaa&#8217; which is affirmed is that which the Pious Predecessors were [agreed] upon.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>TOLERANCE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another important guideline is to cultivate greater tolerance in the Ummah by knowing the etiquettes of differing; which type of differing is permitted and tolerated in Islaam, and which type is actually prohibited and condemned?The prohibited differing involves opposing any of the great usool. This type of differing is forbidden by the Revelation. So whoever opposes these usool, without a valid excuse, has resembled the heretics and deviants.As regards differing in other issues other than the great usool, or in issues of ijtihaad, then such differences are permitted and should be tolerated. It is forbidden to allow such differences to become a source of inciting hatred between Muslims, or a means to split the ranks of this precious Ummah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>ALLEGIANCE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said: &#8220;It is not for anyone to set-up a person for the Ummah; calling to his way, and having walaa (allegiance) or &#8216;adaa (enmity) based upon that, except for the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam. Nor is any speech set-up for them, upon which they form allegiance or enmity, except for the Speech of Allaah, and that of His Messenger, and that which the Ummah has agreed upon.&#8221;It is essential that walaa and &#8216;adaa be formed only upon the basis of Islaam and the Sunnah. As regards the disease of hizbiyyah (partisanship) &#8211; which is where allegiance or enmity is formed upon the basis of either nationalism, groups or parties, or schools of thought &#8211; then this is clearly forbidden. Indeed this disease has destroyed, and continues to destroy, the very fabric of comprehensive Muslim unity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>PURITY</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another essential guideline to purify the intentions such that actions are done only for Allaah&#8217;s sake, and not for the sake of elevating one&#8217;s ego, gaining leadership, or venting personal grudges, jealousy or enmity.Shaykh &#8216;Abdullaah al-Ghunaymaan said: &#8220;It is obligatory upon all those who speak about any affair of the Religion that they do so purely for Allaah&#8217;s sake and sincerely for the truth. They should overcome their souls and strive hard against following their own whims and desires. They should beware of inclining towards worldly matters; such as love of being praised, seeking fame and status, seeking to gain a following, and other such matters. So the one who seeks to gain any of this will only gain the vanities of this world.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>SCHOLARS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet &#8216;alayhis salaam said in an authentic narration: &#8220;Allaah does not take away knowledge by snatching it away from the people, but He takes it away by the death of the Scholars. So when no scholar remains, the people take ignorant ones as their leaders, who give rulings without knowledge; thereby misguiding themselves and misguiding others.&#8221;Thus, goodness remaining in the Ummah is dependant upon the existence of the Scholars; those who preserve the for this Ummah the correct understanding of the religion..There is no way to unify this Ummah, except by clinging to its Scholars. Indeed, without them, deviation and ignorance will continue to spread, which only further weakens the unity of this already fragile Ummah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>HOPE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said: &#8220;Allaah has promised to those amongst you who have faith and do righteous actions that He will grant you the khilaafah (succession of rule) upon the land, as He granted it to those before you&#8230;&#8221; [Soorah an-Noor 24:55].The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said in an authentic narration: &#8220;Give good-tidings to this Ummah about a high position, being established upon the earth, victory, and a lofty position in this world and the Hereafter.&#8221;So it is essential to spread hope throughout this Ummah and not to despair about Allaah&#8217;s promise of victory; which will only be realised on the condition that the Muslims return to acting in accordance with Allaah&#8217;s commands &#8211; inwardly and outwardly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">istiqaamah magazine/july1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an important warning against a disease which has adversely affected many groups who ascribe themselves to the noble task of Da&#8217;wah. Everything which is outside the call of Islaam and the Qur‘aan, with regards to lineage, land, nationality, schools of thoughts and ways, then it is from the calls of jaahiliyyah. perfect opposite is confirmed for Allaah &#8211; the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Islaam has forbidden the calls of <em>jaahiliyyah</em> (the pre-Islaamic days of ignorance) and there are many textual evidences which forbid all of the characteristics and manners of <em>jaahiliyyah</em> and their actions, except those (good and decent) practices which Islaam agreed to.  And there is no doubt that the call to nationalism is from these calls of <em>jaahiliyyah</em>, since nationalism is a call to other than Islaam and an aiding of other than the truth.  And how many ills, evils and serious wars has such calls of <em>jaahiliyyah</em> caused to their people, causing great harm to their souls, their wealth and their possessions. The consequences of such calls (for the Muslims) was a splitting up of their unity and a planting of enmity and hatred of each other in their hearts and a fragmentation and splitting between tribes and nations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) – rahimahullaah – said: [2] “Everything which is outside the call of Islaam and the <em>Qur‘aan</em>, with regards to lineage, land, nationality, schools of thoughts and ways, then it is from the calls of <em>jaahiliyyah</em>. Indeed, even when the <em>Muhaajirs</em> (those Companions who migrated from Makkah to al-Madeenah) and the <em>Ansaars</em> (those Companions who aided and supported those who migrated) argued, such that one of the <em>Muhaajirs</em> said: “O <em>Muhaajirs</em>! (implying; rally to my aid).”  And then one of the <em>Ansaar</em> said: “O Ansaar!”  Upon hearing this, the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “Is it with the calls of <em>jaahiliyyah</em> that you call, and I am still amongst you!”  And he became very angry at that.” [3]<br />
And from the textual evidences pertaining to this issue is Allaah the Most High’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>And stay in your homes and do not display yourselves, like the display of the times of jaahiliyyah</strong> (pre-Islaamic ignorance)<strong>. But establish the Prayer, give the Zakaat and obey Allaah and His Messenger.</strong>” [Sooratul-Ahzaab 33:33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>When those who disbelieved placed in their hearts pride and arrogance the pride and arrogance of jaahiliyyah then Allaah sent down His tranquility upon His Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam and upon the Believers&#8230;</strong>” [Sooratul-Fath 48:26].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “Whosoever leaves off obedience and separates from the <em>Jamaa’ah</em> (united body) and dies, then he dies a death of <em>jaahiliyyah</em>.  Whoever fights under the banner of the blind, becoming angry for <em>’asabiyyah</em> (partisanship and party spirit), or calling to <em>’asabiyyah</em>, or assisting <em>’asabiyyah</em>, then dies, he dies a death of <em>jaahiliyyah</em>.” [4] Also in <em>Saheeh Muslim</em> (8/120), the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “Indeed Allaah has revealed to me that you should have humility, and that no one should act proudly and oppressively over anyone else, nor should anyone boast over anyone else.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is no doubt that the call to nationalism is a call to <em>’asabiyyah</em> (partisanship and party spirit) and it is a call to becoming angry for the sake of <em>’asabiyyah</em> and fighting for <em>’asabiyyah</em>. And there is no doubt also, that the call to nationalism is a call to transgression, pride and arrogance, since nationalism is not a divinely revealed way of life which prevents its people from oppression and proud boasting.  Rather it is an ideology from the time of <em>jaahiliyyah</em> which leads its people to boasting about it and having <em>’asabiyyah</em> for it even if they are the oppressors and the others are the oppressed!  So – O noble reader – consider this and the truth will be clear to you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the textual evidences connected with this is what at-Tirmidhee relates from Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) that he said: “Let people stop boasting about their forefathers who have died, who are merely fuel for the Hellfire; or they will certainly be more insignificant with Allaah than the beetle which roles dung with its nose. Allaah has removed from you the party spirit of the days of <em>jaahiliyyah</em> and the boasting about one’s forefathers.  Indeed a person is either a pious Believer or a wretched sinner. All of mankind are the children of Aadam, and Aadam was created from clay.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) also said: “Indeed there is no excellence for an Arab over a non-Arab, nor a non-Arab over an Arab, nor a white person over a black one, nor a black person over a white one, except through <em>taqwaa</em> (piety and obedience to Allaah).” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this accords with Allaah the Most High&#8217;s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>O mankind! We have created you from male and female and have made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Indeed the most noblest of you with Allaah is the one who has the most taqwaa.</strong>” [Sooratul-Hujuraat 49:13].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah – the One free from all defects – made clear in this noble <em>aayah</em> (verse) that people have been made into nations and tribes so that they may come to know each other, not that they should boast and have pride over one another.  And Allaah the Most High considered the most noblest of them to be the one with the most piety and <em>taqwaa</em>. Likewise, the previously mentioned narration shows the same meaning, and guides to the fact that it is from the ways of <em>jaahiliyyah</em> to vainly boast and to have false pride for one’s fore fathers and ancestry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what the calls of <em>jaahiliyyah</em> lead to, whereas Islaam is in opposition to this.  Rather Islaam calls to modesty, humility, <em>taqwaa</em> and to having love for the sake of Allaah, and that the true and sincere Muslims are merely one of the categories of the children of Aadam (<em>’alayhis-salaam</em>), and that the Muslims are a single body and a single structure; each part supporting the other and each part feeling the pain that the other parts are suffering as occurs in an authentic <em>hadeeth</em> (narration) from the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>), that he said: “The Believer to the Believer is like a solid building, one part supports the other.”  And he interlaced his fingers to demonstrate this. [7].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) also said: “The example of the Believer in their mutual love and mercy is like the example of a body, if one part of the body feels pain, then all the body suffers in sleeplessness and fever.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O people! I call to you in the name of Allaah. Does your nationalism call you to these noble manners of mercy and kindness to the Muslims the Arabs and the non-Arabs and of having mutual sympathy and concern for them, and feeling pain at their pain? No, by Allaah! Rather it calls you to having allegiance with those who have evil character and it calls you to cultivating enmity and hatred for those who deny this false creed of nationalism.  So beware, O Muslim who desires safety and salvation, and consider the reality of the affair with a fair consideration, without being prejudiced with party spirit and desires. Only then you will see the reality as it truly is.  So may Allaah guide me and you to the means of safety and salvation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is related by Imaam al-Bukhaaree in his <em>Saheeh</em> (8/137), that a young man from the <em>Muhaajirs</em> and a young man from the <em>Ansaar</em> quarreled.  So the <em>Muhaajir</em> said: “O <em>Muhaajirs</em>! (meaning: rally to my help).” And the <em>Ansaaree</em> said: “O <em>Ansaar</em>!” So the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) heard this and said: “Is it with the call of <em>jaahiliyyah</em> that you are calling out, and I am present amongst you!”  Even though the term <em>Muhaajir</em> and <em>Ansaar</em> are two ascriptions which are beloved to Allaah the One free from all defects and He has praised these two groups with a very great praise, in His the Most High’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>And the first to embrace Islaam from the Muhaajirs and the Ansaar, and those who followed them in goodness, beliefs and actions. Allaah is well pleased with them, and they are well pleased with Him. He has prepared for them Gardens of Paradise, beneath which rivers flow, to live therein forever. That is the supreme achievement.</strong>” [Sooratut-Tawbah 9:100].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet in the above incident, this ascription to the <em>Muhaajirs</em> and seeking the help from them, and the <em>Ansaar</em> and seeking the help from them, when the likes of this was considered to be from the calls of <em>jaahiliyyah</em>, then what about those who claim allegiance e to nationalism and seek help through that and become angry for that?  Will this not be more fitting to be considered one of the calls from the days of <em>jaahiliyyah</em>?   This is a matter in which there is no doubt, and it is one of the clearest of all matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is what has been established in the authentic <em>hadeeth</em> (narration), from al-Haarith al-Ash’aree (<em>radiyallaahu ’anhu</em>), that the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “I order you with five things which Allaah ordered me with: The <em>Jamaa’ah</em>, listening, obeying, <em>hijrah</em> (migration) and <em>jihaad</em> in the way of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.  So whosoever separates from the <em>Jamaa’ah</em> by a hand span, he throws the yoke of Islaam from his neck, unless he repents.  And whosoever calls with the call of <em>jaahiliyyah</em> (the days of ignorance), then he is from the hoarded heap of Hell Fire.” It was said: Even if he fasts and prays?  He said: “Even if he fasts and prays. So call with the call of Allaah which Allaah gave: The Muslims, the Believers, Worshippers of Allaah.” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>hadeeth</em> is absolutely clear with regards to rendering futile the calls to nationalism.  Its callers deserve that they should be from the heap of Hellfire, even if they fast and they pray and claim that they are Muslims.  So what a severe threat and severe warning is given here; warning every Muslim from the calls of <em>jaahiliyyah</em> and warning them from entering into this even if such calls are adorned with false talks and enchanting speeches.  Rather it is a deception and a blind following which leads it s people to the worst and most despicable of ends. And we ask Allaah for safety and freedom from that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah, Issue No.7 ,July 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And those who were given the Scripture (the Jews and the Christians) did not split-up except out of <i>baghee</i> (hatred and envy) between each other, after the knowledge had come to them.&#8221; </b>[Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:19].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam as-Sa&#8217;dee (d.1376H)- <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This is why Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; ordered the Muslims with<i> ijtimaa&#8217;</i> (collectiveness) in their Religion, and prohibited them from <i>tafarruq</i> (splitting-up). He informed them that they must not reject what Allaah revealed to them from the Book. Indeed the People of the Book (i.e. the jews and the Christians) did not split-up until after Allaah had revealed to them the Scripture, in which He ordered them with<i> ijtimaa&#8217;</i> (being unified). However, they did the opposite to what He ordered them with, due to mutual jealousy and hatred. So hatred and jealousy culminated in them having grudges and enmity between one another, they then fell into differing and splitting up. So &#8211; O Muslims &#8211; beware of doing the likes of this.&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;Allaah explained that their splitting only occurred after the knowledge had come to them, and which showed them what they were commanded to do and to avoid. For Allaah does not leave people to stray, except after giving them guidance, until He explains to them what they were commanded to do. And He informed that the reason for their <i>tafarruq</i> (splitting) was due to <i>baghee</i> (mutual envy, jealousy, hatred) And <i>baghee</i> occurs due to either falling short of the truth, or transgressing the limits. It is due either to abandoning an obligation, or doing something prohibited. So know that this is what necessitates <i>tafarruq</i> (splitting).&#8221;2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE ROOT OF CORRUPTION</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim (d.751H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It is upon the one who speaks in this matter, or any other matter, that he should only do so based upon knowledge and the truth; and that his objective should be sincerity to Allaah, to His Book, to His Messenger; and the giving of sincere advice to his Muslim brothers. But if he makes the truth accord with his own whims and desires, then this will corrupt and ruin the heart, the actions, and the state of affairs. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And if the truth were to be in accordance with their desires, then indeed the heavens and the earth &#8211; and all that is therein &#8211; would be corrupted and ruined.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Mu&#8217;minoon 23:71]. The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;None of you truly believe until he makes</i> <i>his desires accord with what I have been sent with.&#8221;</i>3 So <i>&#8216;ilm</i> (knowledge) and <i>&#8216;adl</i> (justice) are the root of every good, whereas <i>dhulm</i> (oppression) and <i>jahl</i> (ignorance) are the root of every evil. And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; sent His Messenger with the Guidance and the Religion of Truth, and He commanded the doing of justice between people and that none of them should follow their whims and desires. Allaah the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;So call to Islaam and stand firm, and do not follow their whims and desires, but say: I believe in whatever has been revealed by Allaah from the Book, and I have been commanded to do justice between you. Allaah is our Lord and your Lord, for us our deeds and for you your deeds. There is no dispute between us and you. Allaah will assemble us all, and to Him is the final return.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ash-Shooraa 42:15].&#8221;4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>A NECESSARY JIHAAD</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;<i>Jihaad</i> against the <i>nafs</i> (soul) and its whims and desires is the foundation of <i>jihaad</i> against the unbelievers and the hypocrites. Indeed a person will not have the ability to wage <i>jihaad</i> against them, until he wages <i>jihaad</i> against his own soul and its whims and desires first.&#8221;5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Ghunaymaan &#8211; <i>hafidhahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;It is obligatory upon all those who speak about an affair from the affairs of the Religion that they do so purely for Allaah&#8217;s sake, sincerely for the truth. And that they overcome their soul and strive hard against following their whims and desires, not inclining towards worldly matters; such as love of being praised, seeking fame and reputation, gaining a large following, and other such matters. So the one who seeks to gain any of this, will gain only the vanities of this world.&#8221;6</p>

<p><em>Bismillaah wa -Alhamdulillaah wa Salaatu wa Salaam &#8216;alaa Rasulillaah &#8216;amma ba&#8217;d</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Muwahhideen </em>Publications facilitated a LIVE tele-lecture with <em>Shaykh Nu’maan al-Watr (hafidhahullaah)</em>, who is from the <em>mashaayikh </em>of <em>Ba&#8217;daan</em>, <em>Yemen </em>in the district of <em>Ib</em>, and head of <em>Dar-ul-Hadeeth</em> there. The <em>Shaykh</em>addressed us on the topic of <em>Islaam</em> being balanced, between negligence and extremism.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This lecture event was translated LIVE into English by our brother Hisham AbouZeid.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Listen / <a href="http://salafiaudio.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/we_have_made_you_a_balanced_nation_-_shaykh_numaan_al-watr.mp3" target="_blank">Download Mp3 Here</a></strong> (<strong>Time</strong> 49:34)<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh Nu’maan al-Watr (hafidhahullaah)</em> commenced this lecture by stating that Islaam is the middle path; it is the <em>Deen</em> void of <em>shirk</em> and it is the <em>Deen</em> that <strong>Allaah</strong> is pleased with for His slaves. Surely, <strong>Allaah</strong> has relieved us of shackles and chains and made this <em>Deen</em> easy and comprehensible in both creed and application. The creed is compatible with inherent human nature that has not been corrupted and fulfils the needs of the soul and body. It is the <em>Deen</em> that can solve all the problems of mankind; and whoever holds tenaciously to it will find happiness, guidance and safety and will not be humiliated. The believer will become good in himself and would help others attain goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our <em>Shaykh</em> further stated that whoever contemplates, would realise that Islaam is between two falsehoods &#8211; negligence and extremism. This nation is one that is just and its creed is founded upon worshipping Allaah alone without any partners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh Nu’maan</em> then went on to exemplify and explain some of the areas in which <em>Islaam</em> takes the middle course, between negligence and extremism.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From them are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-align:justify;color:#000000;"><strong>Belief in the Prophets</strong> &#8211; Between the Jews who reject the prophets and the Christians who deify them.</span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><em style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Ibaadah</strong></em><span style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong>– Between the indolence of the Christians and the extreme hardship in the worship of the Jews.</span></span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-align:justify;color:#000000;"><strong>Purity</strong> – Between the Christians who hold almost nothing as impure and the extremity of the Jews.</span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Food</strong> – Between the Christians who almost do not discern between </span><em style="text-align:justify;">halaal</em><span style="text-align:justify;"> and </span><em style="text-align:justify;">haram</em><span style="text-align:justify;"> and the Jews  who, due to retribution for their sins, have many things that were made </span><em style="text-align:justify;">haram</em><span style="text-align:justify;"> for them.</span></span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Obeying the ruler</strong> – We obey him in what is in accordance to the obedience of </span><strong style="text-align:justify;">Allaah</strong><span style="text-align:justify;">. However if we see from him disobedience, we do not usurp his rights nor do we revolt against him. Rather, we do not obey him in this disobedience and advise him.</span></span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Obedience to Parents</strong> – Between those who obey their parents even if it means disobeying </span><strong style="text-align:justify;">Allaah</strong><span style="text-align:justify;">and those who neglect their parents to the point of disobedience. Children – We do not relax the rules for them to do as they please nor are we so strict that it falls outside the boundaries of Islaam.</span></span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Women</strong> – The woman is not forbidden to learn and teach, however she is bounded by the </span><em style="text-align:justify;">Shari’ah</em><span style="text-align:justify;">, which insures her protection and that of the society.</span></span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-align:justify;color:#000000;"><strong>Financial transactions</strong> – We neither extract assets from the hands of the people nor do we distribute the wealth of the people amongst the lazy and those who do not work. We are allowed to increase our wealth according to the legislation but engaging in interest has been made impermissible.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Shaykh (hafidhahullaah)</em> ended by saying it is upon us to learn the magnificence of our religion and become acquainted with the tremendous benefits of it in this life and the next. He then made <em>du’aa</em> for us all and asked <strong>Allaah</strong> to make us from those who are guided and guide others and that this sitting be a proof for us and not against us and that this gathering be a reason for happiness in this life and the next.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Wa Billaahi Tawfeeq</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Wa SallAllaahu wa Sallaama wa Barak &#8216;alaa Nabiyanna Muhammad wa &#8216;alaa &#8216;Alyhi wa Sahbyhi wa Sallam</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bismillaah Al-Hamdulillaah wa salatu wa salaamu &#8216;ala rasulullaah<br />
Amma-ba&#8217;d</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>Verily, the one who reads the biography and struggle of the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) will see the following stages:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#c00000;">1</span>&#8211; The stage of Tawheed:</strong> The Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) remained in Makkah for 13 years, calling his people to the Tawheed of Allaah in worship, supplication and legislation &#8211; and the fighting of Shirk &#8211; until this &#8216;Aqeedah became firm and established in the souls of his Companions, and they became courageous, not fearful of anyone except Allaah. Hence, it is obligatory for the callers to Islaam (<em>du&#8217;aat</em>) to start with Tawheed and to warn against Shirk, so that they may become amongst those who take the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) as a model and an example to be followed.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#c00000;">2</span>&#8211; The stage of Brotherhood:</strong> Verily, the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) migrated from Makkah to Madeenah in order to form a Muslim community based upon mutual love. So the first thing he began with was building a mosque in order to gather the Muslims in it for the worship of their Lord, Who ordained the five daily prayers for them to organize their lives. The Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) promptly embarked upon setting up a brotherhood between the <em>Ansaar</em> (the residents of Madeenah) and the <em>Muhaajiroon</em> who had migrated from Makkah and had left their wealth and property behind. Then the Ansaar offered their wealth and property to the Muhaajiroon, and provided them with every assistance that they needed.</p>
<p>The Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) found that the residents of Madeenah from the <em>Aws</em> and the <em>Khazraj</em>* had previous enmity between themselves. So he made peace between them, and Allaah removed hatred and enmity from their hearts. The Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) made them brothers in Eeman and Tawheed, loving each other for the sake of Allaah, as has been reported in the hadeeth: <strong>A Muslim is a brother of another Muslim&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#c00000;">3</span>&#8211; The stage of Preparation: </strong>Verily, the Noble Qur`an has ordered us to make preparations for the enemies. So Allaah, The Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:x-large;">وَأَعِدُّوا لَهُمْ مَا <span style="text-decoration:underline;">ا</span>سْتَطَعْتُمْ مِنْ قُوَّة</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>And make ready against them all you can of power&#8230;</strong> (Al-Anfal, ayah 60)</p>
<p>The Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) explained this verse by saying: <strong>Is the power not warfare?</strong> [Muslim]</p>
<p>So warfare and the study of all its branches is obligatory upon all the Muslims, depending on their ability. This obligation includes studying the use of guns, tanks, planes and other weapons which are needed for warfare.</p>
<p>Woe to the students of the colleges who study warfare and then take part in competitions and races which are not beneficial for the defense of their religion and their sacred places. However, the youth squander their time playing football, and taking part in competitions, during which they display their bigoted team loyalty, which Islaam has ordered us to abolish. They also neglect their prayers, which Allaah has ordered us to preservere.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#c00000;">4</span>&#8211;</strong> When we return to the &#8216;Aqeedah of Tawheed, and we become brothers and sisters &#8211; loving each other for the sake of Allaah &#8211; and we prepare weapons for the enemies, then if Allaah Wills, the Muslims will achieve victory and the Help of Allaah just as the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and the companions after him achieved victory and the Help of Allaah. Allaah, The Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:x-large;">يَاأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِنْ تَنصُرُوا اللَّهَ يَنصُرْكُمْ وَيُثَبِّتْ أَقْدَامَكُمْ </span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Oh you who believe! If you help (in the cause of) Allaah, He will help you, and make your foothold firm.</strong><br />
(Muhammad, ayah 7)</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#c00000;">5</span>&#8211;</strong> By categorizing these stages, we do not mean that they are separate and distinct, i.e. that the stage of brotherhood cannot be present alongside the stage of Tawheed. Rather, it is possible that these stages can co-exist. Allaah, The Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:x-large;">وَكَانَ حَقّاً عَلَيْنَا نَصْرُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>&#8230;and (as for) the believers, it was incumbent upon Us to help (them).</strong> (Ar-Rum, ayah 47)</p>
<p>This noble verse explains that Allaah has promised help for the believers against their enemies, and it is a promise that will not be revoked. Allaah helped His Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) in the Battle of Badr, and He helped the Confederates during other battles and expeditions.</p>
<p>He, The Most High, helped the companions of the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) after him against their enemies. He spread Islaam, opened the lands, and aided the Muslims despite the misfortunes and calamities. It was a reward for the believers, those who were truthful to Allaah in their Eeman, their Tawheed, their worship, and their supplication to their Lord in times of hardship and in times of ease.</p>
<p>The Qur`an relates the condition of the believers during the Battle of Badr, when they were few in number and without many weapons, so they called upon their Lord:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:x-large;">إِذْ تَسْتَغِيثُونَ رَبَّكُمْ فَ<span style="text-decoration:underline;">ا</span>سْتَجَابَ لَكُمْ أَنِّي مُمِدُّكُمْ بِأَلْف ٍ مِنَ الْمَلاَئِكَةِ مُرْدِفِينَ</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>(Remember) when you sought help of your Lord and He answered you (saying): &#8220;I will help you with a thousand of the angels each behind the other (following one another) in succession.&#8221;</strong> (Al-Anfal, ayah 9)</p>
<p>Allaah answered their supplication and aided them with angels who fought with them and struck the necks and limbs of the disbelievers, and that is when He, The Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:x-large;">فَ<span style="text-decoration:underline;">ا</span>ضْرِبُوا فَوْقَ الأَعْنَاقِ وَاضْرِبُوا مِنْهُمْ كُلَّ بَنَان</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>&#8230;so strike them over the necks, and smite over all their fingers and toes.&#8221;</strong> (Al-Anfal, ayah 12)</p>
<p>He, The Most High, brought about help and victory for the believers &#8211; the <em>Muwahhiddeen</em> &#8211; those who singled Him out for worship. He, The Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:x-large;">وَلَقَدْ نَصَرَكُمُ اللَّهُ بِبَدْر ٍ وَأَنْتُمْ أَذِلَّة ٌ فَ<span style="text-decoration:underline;">ا</span>تَّقُوا اللَّهَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ </span><br />
<strong>And Allaah has already made you victorious at Badr, when you were a weak little force. So fear Allaah much that you may be grateful.</strong> (Aali Imran, ayah 123)</p>
<p>One of the supplications of the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) in the Battle of Badr was: <strong>Oh Allaah, fulfill for me that which You promised me. Oh Allaah, if you destroy this group from the people of Islaam, You will not be worshipped on the earth.</strong> [Muslim]</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#c00000;">We see the Muslims of today entering into wars against their enemies in most of the lands, but they are not aided and they do not find victory, so what is the reason for that? Has the Promise of Allaah ascribed to the believers failed to come true? No, never! It has not failed, however, where are the believers in order that He may give them the help and victory mentioned in the verses?</span></strong></p>
<p>We ask the <em>Mujaahideen</em> (those who fight in the Path of Allaah):</p>
<p><strong>1</strong>&#8211; Have they prepared with Eeman and Tawheed which the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) began his call with in Makkah before the fighting?</p>
<p><strong>2</strong>&#8211; Have they acquired the means which their Lord ordered them to acquire in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:x-large;">وَأَعِدُّوا لَهُمْ مَا <span style="text-decoration:underline;">ا</span>سْتَطَعْتُمْ مِنْ قُوَّة</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>And make ready against them all you can of power&#8230;</strong> (Al-Anfal, ayah 60)</p>
<p>Verily, the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) explained it as warfare.</p>
<p><strong>3</strong>&#8211; Did they call upon their Lord and single Him out for supplication at the time of fighting? Or did they associate partners with Him, and then set out to ask help from other than Him, from those whom they believed to have sovereignty, whereas they [those worshipped besides Allaah] were themselves slaves of Allaah, and they were not capable of benefiting or harming anyone. Why do they not follow the example of the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) in his supplication to his Lord alone?</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:x-large;">أَلَيْسَ اللَّهُ بِكَافٍ عَبْدَه</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Is not Allaah Sufficient for His slave?&#8230;</strong> (Az-Zumar, ayah 36)</p>
<p><strong>4</strong>&#8211; Also, are they united and loving one another regarding that which is between them, their distinguishing feature being, the saying of their Lord:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:x-large;">وَلاَ تَنَازَعُوا فَتَفْشَلُوا وَتَذْهَبَ رِيحُكُمْ </span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>&#8230;Do not dispute (with one another) lest you lose courage and your strength depart&#8230;</strong> (Al-Anfal, ayah 46)</p>
<p><strong>5</strong>&#8211; Finally, why did the Muslims leave their &#8216;aqeedah and the commandments of their religion, which orders precedence to be given to knowledge and civilization, in opposition to the rest of the nations? So when they return to their religion, their superiority and honor will return to them. When you implement the required Eeman, then He shall give you the promised help and victory.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:x-large;">وَكَانَ حَقّاً عَلَيْنَا نَصْرُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>&#8230;and (as for) the believers, it was incumbent upon Us to help (them).</strong> (Ar-Rum, ayah 47)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah &#8211; <em>the Mighty and Majestic</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="quran">&#8220;It is He who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth, that He may make it prevail over all other religions, no matter how much the disbelievers detest it.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 61:9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are given the good tidings in this verse that the future is for Islam, which gain dominance, ascendancy and rule over all other religions. Some people may think that this was fulfilled in the time of the Prophet <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> and the Rightly-Guided <em>Khulafah</em> and the righteous kings &#8211; but that is not the case. Rather, only a part of this true promise was fulfilled then &#8211; as the Prophet<em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> indicated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="hadith">&#8220;Night and day will pass away until Al-Lat and Al-&#8216;Uzza are worshipped.&#8221;</span> So &#8216;Aishah &#8211; <em>radhiallahu &#8216;anha</em> &#8211; said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! I thought that when Allah sent down: <span class="quran">&#8216;It is He who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth, that He may make it prevail over all the other religions, no matter how much the disbelievers detest it,&#8217;</span> that it would be complete. He <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>said, <span class="hadith">&#8220;There will be of that what Allah wishes.&#8221;</span> [Related by Muslim (8/182) and also Abu Ya&#8217;la in his <em>Musnad </em>(Q. 216/2)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[In this <em>hadith</em> is a clarification that the prevalence and ascendancy mentioned in this <em>ayah</em> has not yet happened &#8211; its establishment is yet to be fully realised. There is no doubt that this ascendancy and prevalence continued after the death of the Prophet <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, in the age Rightly­-Guided <em>Khulafah</em> and after them. And it not be completed until Islam is established over the whole of this earth &#8211; and this is realisation is certain.]<span id="qtip0" class="toggle">1</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are other <em>ahadith</em> which show how far Islam will reach and dominate and how far it spread, such that there is no doubt that the future is for Islam, by the permission and favour of Allah. So I quote what I am able to these <em>ahadith</em> and hopefully they will strengthen the determination of the workers for Islam; and be a proof against those who are indifferent and those who have despaired!</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Firstly</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="hadith">&#8220;Indeed Allah gathered up the earth for me so that I saw its east and its west; and indeed the dominion of my Ummah will reach what was what was gathered up for me from it.&#8221;</span> [Related by Muslim (8/171), Abu Dawud (no. 4252) and others, from Thawban <em>radhiallahu &#8216;anhu</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And even clearer than it and more general is the [next] <em>hadith</em>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Secondly</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="hadith">&#8220;This affair will reach what is reached by the night and the day; and Allah will not leave a dwelling of brick, nor fur, except that Allah will cause this Din to enter it &#8211; bringing honour or humiliation. Honour which Allah gives to Islam and humiliation which Allah will give to disbelief.&#8221;</span> [<em>Sahih</em>: Related by Ahmad (4/103), Ibn Hibban in his <em>Sahih</em> (no. 1631) and others. <em>Shaykh</em> Al­-Albani authenticated it in <em>Tahdhirus­-Sajid</em> (p. 118)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Therefore, it is upon the Muslims to prepare themselves, by turning to their Lord, holding on to His Book, following the <em>Sunnah</em> of His Prophet <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, turning away from all that Allah has made unlawful and uniting upon that which He &#8211; <em>the Perfect, Most High</em> &#8211; is pleased with.]<span id="qtip1" class="toggle">2</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, there is no doubt that fulfillment of this prevalence and domination necessitates that the Muslims return to spiritual, material and armed strength, so that they are able to overcome the might of <em>kufr</em> (disbelief) and suppression. This good tiding is given to us in the [next] <em>hadith</em>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Thirdly</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Abu Qabil who said: We were with &#8216;Abdullah ibn &#8216;Amr ibn Al-&#8216;As and he was asked which city will be conquered first &#8211; Constantinople or Rome? So &#8216;Abdullah called for a sealed trunk and he said: Take out a book from it.<span id="qtip2" class="toggle">3</span> Then &#8216;Abdullah said: Whilst we were with the Messenger of <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> writing, The Messenger of <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> was asked: Which city will be conquered first, Constantinople or Rome? So Allah&#8217;s Messenger <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> said: <span class="hadith">&#8220;The city of Heraclius will be conquered first.&#8221;</span> &#8211; meaning Constantinople.<span id="qtip3" class="toggle">4</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The conquest mentioned, occurred at the hands of Muhammad al­-Fattah al-Uthmani &#8211; as is well known &#8211; and it occurred more than eight­hundred years after the Prophet <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> foretold of the conquest. So the second conquest will take place, by the permission of Allah &#8211; <em>the Most High</em> &#8211; and it is certain and you will hear of it after a time. There is also no doubt that the fulfillment of the second conquest necessitates the return of the rightly-guided <em>Khilafah</em> to the Muslim <em>Ummah</em>, which is what he <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> foretold with his saying in the [next] <em>hadith</em>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Fourthly</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="hadith">&#8220;Prophethood will remain amongst you for as long as Allah wishes it to, then Allah will raise it up when He wishes to raise it up. Then there will be Khilafah upon the manner of Prophethood and it will remain amongst you for as long as Allah wishes it to, then Allah will raise up when He wishes to raise up. Then there will be harsh kingship which will remain amongst you for as long as Allah wishes it to, then Allah will raise it up when He wishes to raise it up. Then there will be tyrannical kingship and it will remain amongst you for as long as Allah wishes it to, then will raise it up when He wishes to raise it up. Then there will be Khilafah upon the manner of Prophethood.&#8221;</span> Then he was silent. [<em>Sahih</em>: Related by Ahmad (4/273) and others from An-Nu&#8217;man ibn Bashir <em>radhiallahu &#8216;anhu</em>. It was authenticated by <em>Al­-Hafidh</em> Al-&#8216;Iraqi in <em>Mahajjatul­-Qarab fi Mahabbatil-&#8216;Arab</em> (17/2)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the good tidings of the return of strength to the Muslims, and their having the ability to utilise the earth to attain their goals, and that they have a bright future even in the economic and agricultural spheres, is his <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>&#8216;s saying:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Fifthly</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="hadith">&#8220;The Hour will not be established until the land of the &#8216;Arabs returns to being pastures and rivers.&#8221;</span> [Related by Muslim (3/84), Ahmad (2/703) and Al-Hakim (4/477) from Abu Hurayrah <em>radhiallahu &#8216;anhu</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first signs of the fulfillment of this <em>hadith</em> have begun to appear in some parts of the Arab lands, upon which Allah has poured forth His blessings and great favours &#8211; such that plentiful water is extracted from the desert &#8230; and tomorrow is very near for the one who awaits it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It must also be known that his <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>&#8216;s saying: &#8220;A time will not come upon you, except that which comes after it will be worse &#8211; until you meet your Lord.&#8221; [Related by Al-Bukhari from the <em>hadith</em> of Anas <em>radhiallahu &#8216;anhu</em>] Then this <em>hadith</em> must be understood in the light of the preceding <em>ahadith</em> as well as in the light of others &#8211; such as the <em>ahadith</em> about the Mahdi and also the descent of Isa <em>&#8216;alayhis-salam</em> &#8211; which show that this <em>hadith</em> is not to be understood as having no exceptions. Rather, it is general and has exceptions. Thus, it is not permissible to cause the people to understand it or be unrestricted, so that they fall into despair which no Believer should have as an attribute:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="quran">&#8220;Indeed, no one despairs of Allah&#8217;s mercy, except those who disbelieve.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 12:87]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allah to make us true Believer in Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(s) <em>Silsilatul-Ahadethus-Sahihah</em> (pp. 6-8) of <em>Shaykh</em> Al­-Albani. For the sake of brevity and simplicity, the <em>hadith</em> authentication and checkings by the <em>Shaykh</em> have been abridged.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Paving the Way for Victory</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh</em> Al­-Albani says in <em>Fiqhul-Waqi&#8217;</em> (pp. 49­51):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Therefore, the key to a return of the glory of Islam is: implementation of beneficial knowledge and establishing righteous and correct actions, and this is a very great affair which the Muslims cannot reach, except through the <em>manhaj</em> (methodology) of <em>tasfiyah</em> (purification and correction) and <em>tarbiyah</em> (education and cultivation). These being two very great obligations. By the first of these, the following is intended:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Purifying the Islamic <em>&#8216;aqidah</em> from that which is alien to it, such as <em>shirk</em> (associating partners to in those things that are particular to Him), <em>ta&#8217;til</em> (rejection Attributes), <em>ta&#8217;wil</em> (twisting the meanings of Allah&#8217;s Attributes), refusing authentic <em>ahadith</em>, because they are connected to matters of <em>&#8216;aqidah</em>, and their like.</li>
<li>Purifying the Islamic <em>fiqh</em> from the erroneous judgements made, which are contrary to the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, freeing the minds from the fetters of blind­following and the darkness of sectarianism and party­spirit.</li>
<li>Purifying the books of <em>tafsir</em>, <em>fiqh raqa&#8217;iq</em> (matters concerning the heart) and other than that, from <em>ahadith</em> which are weak and fabricated, or the the unsupported narrations from the people of the Book, and the reprehensible narrations.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards the second obligation, then by it I mean: cultivating the young generation upon this Islam, purified all that we have mentioned, giving to them a correct Islamic education from the start &#8211; without any influence from the disbelieving western education.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt, that bringing these two obligations about requires huge efforts and sincere co­operation between all Muslims &#8211; individuals and groups &#8211; from all those who are truly concerned with establishing the desired Islamic society, each one working in his own field and specialty.&#8221;</p>
