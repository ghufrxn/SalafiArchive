<h3 align="center">Prayers (Salat)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.008.345"></a>Volume 1, Book 8, Number 345:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Dhar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;While I was at Mecca the roof of my house was opened and Gabriel descended, opened my chest, and washed it with Zam-zam water. Then he brought a golden tray full of wisdom and faith and having poured its contents into my chest, he closed it. Then he took my hand and ascended with me to the nearest heaven, when I reached the nearest heaven, Gabriel said to the gatekeeper of the heaven, &#8216;Open (the gate).&#8217; The gatekeeper asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel answered: &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; He asked, &#8216;Is there anyone with you?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Yes, Muhammad I is with me.&#8217; He asked, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217; Gabriel said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; So the gate was opened and we went over the nearest heaven and there we saw a man sitting with some people on his right and some on his left. When he looked towards his right, he laughed and when he looked toward his left he wept. Then he said, &#8216;Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious son.&#8217; I asked Gabriel, &#8216;Who is he?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;He is Adam and the people on his right and left are the souls of his offspring. Those on his right are the people of Paradise and those on his left are the people of Hell and when he looks towards his right he laughs and when he looks towards his left he weeps.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he ascended with me till he reached the second heaven and he (Gabriel) said to its gatekeeper, &#8216;Open (the gate).&#8217; The gatekeeper said to him the same as the gatekeeper of the first heaven had said and he opened the gate. Anas said: &#8220;Abu Dhar added that the Prophet met Adam, Idris, Moses, Jesus and Abraham, he (Abu Dhar) did not mention on which heaven they were but he mentioned that he (the Prophet ) met Adarn on the nearest heaven and Abraham on the sixth heaven. Anas said, &#8220;When Gabriel along with the Prophet passed by Idris, the latter said, &#8216;Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious brother.&#8217; The Prophet asked, &#8216;Who is he?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;He is Idris.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;I passed by Moses and he said, &#8216;Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious brother.&#8217; I asked Gabriel, &#8216;Who is he?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;He is Moses.&#8217; Then I passed by Jesus and he said, &#8216;Welcome! O pious brother and pious Prophet.&#8217; I asked, &#8216;Who is he?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;He is Jesus.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I passed by Abraham and he said, &#8216;Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious son.&#8217; I asked Gabriel, &#8216;Who is he?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;He is Abraham. The Prophet added, &#8216;Then Gabriel ascended with me to a place where I heard the creaking of the pens.&#8221; Ibn Hazm and Anas bin Malik said: The Prophet said, &#8220;Then Allah enjoined fifty prayers on my followers when I returned with this order of Allah, I passed by Moses who asked me, &#8216;What has Allah enjoined on your followers?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;He has enjoined fifty prayers on them.&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;Go back to your Lord (and appeal for reduction) for your followers will not be able to bear it.&#8217; (So I went back to Allah and requested for reduction) and He reduced it to half. When I passed by Moses again and informed him about it, he said, &#8216;Go back to your Lord as your followers will not be able to bear it.&#8217; So I returned to Allah and requested for further reduction and half of it was reduced. I again passed by Moses and he said to me: &#8216;Return to your Lord, for your followers will not be able to bear it. So I returned to Allah and He said, &#8216;These are five prayers and they are all (equal to) fifty (in reward) for My Word does not change.&#8217; I returned to Moses and he told me to go back once again. I replied, &#8216;Now I feel shy of asking my Lord again.&#8217; Then Gabriel took me till we &#8221; reached Sidrat-il-Muntaha (Lote tree of; the utmost boundry) which was shrouded in colors, indescribable. Then I was admitted into Paradise where I found small (tents or) walls (made) of pearls and its earth was of musk.&#8221;</p>

He answered the call of nature and was wearing a Syrian cloak. He tried to take out his hands from its sleeve but it was very tight so he took out his hands from under it. I poured water and he performed ablution like that for prayers and passed his wet hands over his Khuff (leather socks) and then prayed .</p>

(It would be better) if you take off your Izar and put it over your shoulders underneath the stones.&#8221; So he took off his Izar and put it over his shoulders, but he fell unconscious and since then he had never been seen naked.</p>

The Prophet rode and Abu Talha rode too and I was riding behind Abu Talha. The Prophet passed through the lane of Khaibar quickly and my knee was touching the thigh of the Prophet . He uncovered his thigh and I saw the whiteness of the thigh of the Prophet. When he entered the town, he said, &#8216;Allahu Akbar! Khaibar is ruined. Whenever we approach near a (hostile) nation (to fight) then evil will be the morning of those who have been warned.&#8217; He repeated this thrice. The people came out for their jobs and some of them said, &#8216;Muhammad (has come).&#8217; (Some of our companions added, &#8220;With his army.&#8221;) We conquered Khaibar, took the captives, and the booty was collected. Dihya came and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! Give me a slave girl from the captives.&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;Go and take any slave girl.&#8217; He took Safiya bint Huyai. A man came to the Prophet and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostles! You gave Safiya bint Huyai to Dihya and she is the chief mistress of the tribes of Quraiza and An-Nadir and she befits none but you.&#8217; So the Prophet said, &#8216;Bring him along with her.&#8217; So Dihya came with her and when the Prophet saw her, he said to Dihya, &#8216;Take any slave girl other than her from the captives.&#8217; Anas added: The Prophet then manumitted her and married her.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thabit asked Anas, &#8220;O Abu Hamza! What did the Prophet pay her (as Mahr)?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Her self was her Mahr for he manumitted her and then married her.&#8221; Anas added, &#8220;While on the way, Um Sulaim dressed her for marriage (ceremony) and at night she sent her as a bride to the Prophet . So the Prophet was a bridegroom and he said, &#8216;Whoever has anything (food) should bring it.&#8217; He spread out a leather sheet (for the food) and some brought dates and others cooking butter. (I think he (Anas) mentioned As-SawTq). So they prepared a dish of Hais (a kind of meal). And that was Walrma (the marriage banquet) of Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">2. And as regards the (verse of) the veiling of the women, I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I wish you ordered your wives to cover themselves from the men because good and bad ones talk to them.&#8217; So the verse of the veiling of the women was revealed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3.

When it rains the water flows in the valley between me and my people so I cannot go to their mosque to lead them in prayer. O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

As if I am looking (just now) as the Prophet was sitting over his Rahila (Mount) with Abu Bakr riding behind him and all Banu An-Najjar around him till he dismounted at the courtyard of Abu Aiyub&#8217;s house. The Prophet loved to pray wherever the time for the prayer was due even at sheep-folds. Later on he ordered that a mosque should be built and sent for some people of Banu-An-Najjar and said, &#8220;O Banu An-Najjar! Suggest to me the price of this (walled) piece of land of yours.&#8221; They replied, &#8220;No! By Allah! We do not demand its price except from Allah.&#8221; Anas added: There were graves of pagans in it and some of it was unleveled and there were some date-palm trees in it. The Prophet ordered that the graves of the pagans be dug out and the unleveled land be level led and the date-palm trees be cut down . (So all that was done). They aligned these cut date-palm trees towards the Qibla of the mosque (as a wall) and they also built two stone side-walls (of the mosque). His companions brought the stones while reciting some poetic verses. The Prophet was with them and he kept on saying, &#8220;There is no goodness except that of the Hereafter, O Allah!

Abu Bakr did not alter it. &#8216;Umar expanded it on the same pattern as it was in the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle by using adobes, leaves of date-palms and changing the pillars into wooden ones. &#8216;Uthman changed it by expanding it to a great extent and built its walls with engraved stones and lime and made its pillars of engraved stones and its roof of teak wood.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbas said to me and to his son &#8216;Ali, &#8220;Go to Abu Sa&#8217;id and listen to what he narrates.&#8221; So we went and found him in a garden looking after it. He picked up his Rida&#8217;, wore it and sat down and started narrating till the topic of the construction of the mosque reached. He said, &#8220;We were carrying one adobe at a time while &#8216;Ammar was carrying two. The Prophet saw him and started removing the dust from his body and said, &#8220;May Allah be Merciful to &#8216;Ammar. He will be inviting them (i.e. his murderers, the rebellious group) to Paradise and they will invite him to Hell-fire.&#8221; &#8216;Ammar said, &#8220;I seek refuge with Allah from affliction.&#8221;</p>

He said, &#8220;Buy her and manumit her. No doubt Al-Wala(1) is for the manumitted.&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood on the pulpit (or Allah&#8217;s Apostle ascended the pulpit as Sufyan once said), and said, &#8220;What about some people who impose conditions which are not present in Allah&#8217;s Book (Laws)?

When he enters the mosque he is considered in prayer as long as he is waiting for the prayer and the angels keep on asking for Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for him and they keep on saying: &#8216;O Allah! Be Merciful to him, O Allah! Forgive him, as long as he keeps on sitting at his praying place and does not pass wind. (See Hadith No. 620).</p>

The people who were in haste left the mosque through its gates. They wondered whether the prayer was reduced. And amongst them were Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar but they hesitated to ask the Prophet. A long-handed man called Dhul-Yadain asked the Prophet, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Have you; forgotten or has the prayer been reduced?&#8217; The Prophet replied, &#8216;I have neither forgotten nor has the prayer been reduced&#8217; The Prophet added, &#8216;Is what Dhul Yadain has said true?&#8217; They (the people) said, &#8216;Yes, it is true.&#8217; The Prophet stood up again and led the prayer, completing the remaining prayer, forgotten by him, and performed Talsrm, and then said, &#8216;Allahu Akbar.&#8217; And then he did a prostration as he used to prostrate or longer than that.

On completion o the prayer, he said, &#8220;Paradise became s near to me that if I had dared, I would have plucked one of its bunches for you and Hell became so near to me that said, &#8216;O my Lord will I be among those people?&#8217; Then suddenly I saw a woman and a cat was lacerating her with it claws. On inquiring, it was said that the woman had imprisoned the cat till it died of starvation and she neither fed it no freed it so that it could feed itself.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While the Muslims were offering the Fajr prayer, Al lah&#8217;s Apostle suddenly appeared before them by living the curtain of the dwelling place of &#8216;Aisha, looked towards the Muslims who were standing in rows. He smiled with pleasure. Abu Bakr started retreating to join the row on the assumption that the Prophet wanted to come out for the prayer. The Muslims intended to leave the prayer (and were on the verge of being put to trial), but the Prophet beckoned them to complete their prayer and then he let the curtain fall. He died in the last hours of that day.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin Samura:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The People of Kufa complained against Sa&#8217;d to &#8216;Umar and the latter dismissed him and appointed &#8216;Ammar as their chief . They lodged many complaints against Sa&#8217;d and even they alleged that he did not pray properly. &#8216;Umar sent for him and said, &#8220;O Aba Ishaq! These people claim that you do not pray properly.&#8221; Abu Ishaq said, &#8220;By Allah, I used to pray with them a prayer similar to that of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and I never reduced anything of it. I used to prolong the first two Rakat of &#8216;Isha prayer and shorten the last two Rakat.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Aba Ishaq, this was what I thought about you.&#8221; And then he sent one or more persons with him to Kufa so as to ask the people about him. So they went there and did not leave any mosque without asking about him. All the people praised him till they came to the mosque of the tribe of Bani &#8216;Abs; one of the men called Usama bin Qatada with a surname of Aba Sa&#8217;da stood up and said, &#8220;As you have put us under an oath; I am bound to tell you that Sa&#8217;d never went himself with the army and never distributed (the war booty) equally and never did justice in legal verdicts.&#8221; (On hearing it) Sa&#8217;d said, &#8220;I pray to Allah for three things: O Allah! If this slave of yours is a liar and got up for showing off, give him a long life, increase his poverty and put him to trials.&#8221; (And so it happened). Later on when that person was asked how he was, he used to reply that he was an old man in trial as the result of Sa&#8217;d&#8217;s curse. &#8216;Abdul Malik, the sub narrator, said that he had seen him afterwards and his eyebrows were over-hanging his eyes owing to old age and he used to tease and assault the small girls in the way.</p>

The man said, &#8220;By Him Who sent you with the Truth, I cannot offer the prayer in a better way than this. Please, teach me how to pray.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;When you stand for Prayer say Takbir and then recite from the Holy Qur&#8217;an (of what you know by heart) and then bow till you feel at ease. Then raise your head and stand up straight, then prostrate till you feel at ease during your prostration, then sit with calmness till you feel at ease (do not hurry) and do the same in all your prayers</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">My father and I went to Abu Barza-al-Aslami to ask him about the stated times for the prayers.

(The sub narrator said: I have forgotten what Abu Barza said about the Maghrib prayer). The Prophet never found any harm in delaying the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer to the first third of the night and he never liked to sleep before it and to talk after it. He used to offer the morning prayer at a time when after finishing it one could recognize the person sitting beside him and used to recite between 60 to 100 verses in one or both the Rakat.&#8221;</p>

The Devils went to their people, who asked them, &#8220;What is wrong with you?&#8221; They said, &#8220;A barrier has been placed between us and the news of heaven. And fire has been thrown at us.&#8221; They said, &#8220;The thing which has put a barrier between you and the news of heaven must be something which has happened recently. Go eastward and westward and see what has put a barrier between you and the news of heaven.&#8221; Those who went towards Tuhama came across the Prophet at a place called Nakhla and it was on the way to Suq &#8216;Ukaz and the Prophet was offering the Fajr prayer with his companions. When they heard the Qur&#8217;an they listened to it and said, &#8220;By Allah, this is the thing which has put a barrier between us and the news of heaven.&#8221; They went to their people and said, &#8220;O our people; verily we have heard a wonderful recital (Qur&#8217;an) which shows the true path; we believed in it and would not ascribe partners to our Lord.&#8221; Allah revealed the following verses to his Prophet (Sura &#8216;Jinn&#8217;) (72): &#8220;Say: It has been revealed to me.&#8221; And what was revealed to him was the conversation of the Jinns.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">One day we were praying behind the Prophet. When he raised his head from bowing, he said, &#8220;Sami&#8217;a-l-lahu Liman hamida.&#8221; A man behind him said, &#8220;Rabbana walaka-l hamd hamdan Kathiran taiyiban mubarakan fihi&#8221; (O our Lord! All the praises are for You, many good and blessed praises). When the Prophet completed the prayer, he asked, &#8220;Who has said these words?&#8221; The man replied, &#8220;I.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I saw over thirty angels competing to write it first.&#8221; Prophet rose (from bowing) and stood straight till all the vertebrae of his spinal column came to a natural position.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Huraira used to say Takbir in all the prayers, compulsory and optional &#8212; in the month of Ramadan or other months. He used to say Takbir on standing for prayer and on bowing; then he would say, &#8220;Salmi&#8217;a-l-lahu Liman hamida,&#8221; and before prostrating he would say &#8220;Rabbana walaka-l-hamd.&#8221; Then he would say Takbir on prostrating and on raising his head from the prostration, then another Takbir on prostrating (for the second time), and on raising his head from the prostration. He also would say the Takbir on standing from the second Rak&#8217;a. He used to do the same in every Rak&#8217;a till he completed the prayer. On completion of the prayer, he would say, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hands my soul is! No doubt my prayer is closer to that of Allah&#8217;s Apostle than yours, and this was His prayer till he left this world.&#8221; And Abu Huraira said, &#8220;When Allah&#8217;s Apostle raised his head from (bowing) he used to say &#8220;Sami&#8217; a-l-lahu Liman hamida, Rabbana walakal-hamd.&#8221; He Would invoke Allah for some people by naming them: &#8220;O Allah! Save Al-Walid bin Al-Walid and Salama bin Hisham and &#8216;Aiyash bin Abi Rabi&#8217;a and the weak and the helpless people among the faithful believers O Allah! Be hard on the tribe of Mudar and let them suffer from famine years like that of the time of Joseph.&#8221; In those days the Eastern section of the tribe of Mudar was against the Prophet.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle fell from a horse and the right side of his body was injured. We went to enquire about his health meanwhile it was time for the prayer and he led the prayer sitting and we also prayed while sitting. On completion of the prayer he said, &#8220;The Imam is to be followed; say Takbir when he says it; bow when he bows; rise when he rises and when he says &#8220;Sami&#8217;a-l-lahu Liman hamida,&#8221; say, &#8220;Rabbana walaka-lhamd&#8221;, and prostrate if he prostrates.&#8221; Sufyan narrated the same from Ma&#8217;mar.

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 12, Number 770:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Do you have any doubt in seeing the full moon on a clear (not cloudy) night?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;No, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; He said, &#8220;Do you have any doubt in seeing the sun when there are no clouds?&#8221; They replied in the negative. He said, &#8220;You will see Allah (your Lord) in the same way. On the Day of Resurrection, people will be gathered and He will order the people to follow what they used to worship. So some of them will follow the sun, some will follow the moon, and some will follow other deities; and only this nation (Muslims) will be left with its hypocrites. Allah will come to them and say, &#8216;I am Your Lord.&#8217; They will say, &#8216;We shall stay in this place till our Lord comes to us and when our Lord will come, we will recognize Him. Then Allah will come to them again and say, &#8216;I am your Lord.&#8217; They will say, &#8216;You are our Lord.&#8217; Allah will call them, and As-Sirat (a bridge) will be laid across Hell and I (Muhammad) shall be the first amongst the Apostles to cross it with my followers. Nobody except the Apostles will then be able to speak and they will be saying then, &#8216;O Allah! Save us. O Allah Save us.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There will be hooks like the thorns of Sa&#8217;dan in Hell. Have you seen the thorns of Sa&#8217;dan?&#8221; The people said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;These hooks will be like the thorns of Sa&#8217;dan but nobody except Allah knows their greatness in size and these will entangle the people according to their deeds; some of them will fall and stay in Hell forever; others will receive punishment (torn into small pieces) and will get out of Hell, till when Allah intends mercy on whomever He likes amongst the people of Hell, He will order the angels to take out of Hell those who worshipped none but Him alone. The angels will take them out by recognizing them from the traces of prostrations, for Allah has forbidden the (Hell) fire to eat away those traces. So they will come out of the Fire, it will eat away from the whole of the human body except the marks of the prostrations. At that time they will come out of the Fire as mere skeletons. The Water of Life will be poured on them and as a result they will grow like the seeds growing on the bank of flowing water. Then when Allah had finished from the Judgments amongst his creations, one man will be left between Hell and Paradise and he will be the last man from the people of Hell to enter paradise. He will be facing Hell, and will say, &#8216;O Allah! Turn my face from the fire as its wind has dried me and its steam has burnt me.&#8217; Allah will ask him, &#8220;Will you ask for anything more in case this favor is granted to you?&#8217; He will say, &#8220;No by Your (Honor) Power!&#8221; And he will give to his Lord (Allah) what he will of the pledges and the covenants. Allah will then turn his face from the Fire. When he will face Paradise and will see its charm, he will remain quiet as long as Allah will. He then will say, &#8216;O my Lord! Let me go to the gate of Paradise.&#8217; Allah will ask him, &#8216;Didn&#8217;t you give pledges and make covenants (to the effect) that you would not ask for anything more than what you requested at first?&#8217; He will say, &#8216;O my Lord! Do not make me the most wretched, amongst Your creatures.&#8217; Allah will say, &#8216;If this request is granted, will you then ask for anything else?&#8217; He will say, &#8216;No! By Your Power! I shall not ask for anything else.&#8217; Then he will give to his Lord what He will of the pledges and the covenants. Allah will then let him go to the gate of Paradise. On reaching then and seeing its life, charm, and pleasure, he will remain quiet as long as Allah wills and then will say, &#8216;O my Lord ! Let me enter Paradise.&#8217; Allah will say, May Allah be merciful unto you, O son of Adam! How treacherous you are! Haven&#8217;t you made covenants and given pledges that you will not ask for anything more that what you have been given?&#8217; He will say, &#8216;O my Lord! Do not make me the most wretched amongst Your creatures.&#8217; So Allah will laugh and allow him to enter Paradise and will ask him to request as much as he likes. He will do so till all his desires have been fulfilled . Then Allah will say, &#8216;Request more of such and such things.&#8217; Allah will remind him and when all his desires and wishes; have been fulfilled, Allah will say &#8220;All this is granted to you and a similar amount besides.&#8221; Abu Said Al-Khudri, said to Abu Huraira, &#8216;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Allah said, &#8216;That is for you and ten times more like it.&#8217; &#8220;Abu Huraira said, &#8220;I do not remember from Allah&#8217;s Apostle except (his saying), &#8216;All this is granted to you and a similar amount besides.&#8221; Abu Sahd said, &#8220;I heard him saying, &#8216;That is for you and ten times more the like of it.&#8221;</p>

Gabriel came to him and said, &#8216;The night which you are looking for is ahead of you.&#8217; In the morning of the 20th of Ramadan the Prophet delivered a sermon saying, &#8216;Whoever has performed I&#8217;tikaf with me should continue it. I have been shown the Night of &#8220;Qadr&#8221;, but have forgotten its date, but it is in the odd nights of the last ten nights. I saw in my dream that I was prostrating in mud and water.&#8217; In those days the roof of the mosque was made of branches of date-palm trees. At that time the sky was clear and no cloud was visible, but suddenly a cloud came and it rained. The Prophet led us in the prayer and I saw the traces of mud on the forehead and on the nose of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. So it was the confirmation of that dream.&#8221;</p>

(O Allah, I seek refuge with You from the punishment of the grave and from the afflictions of Masi,h Ad-Dajjal and from the afflictions of life and death. O Allah, I seek refuge with You from the sins and from being in debt).&#8221; Somebody said to him, &#8220;Why do you so frequently seek refuge with Allah from being in debt?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;A person in debt tells lies whenever he speaks, and breaks promises whenever he makes (them).&#8221; &#8216;Aisha also narrated: I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle in his prayer seeking refuge with Allah from the afflictions of Ad-dajjal.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle to teach me an invocation so that I may invoke Allah with it in my prayer. He told me to say, &#8220;Allahumma inni zalumtu nafsi zulman kathiran, Wala yaghfirudhdhunuba illa anta faghfirli maghfiratan min &#8216;Indika, war-hamni innaka antal-ghafururrahim (O Allah!

<p style="text-align:justify;">When we prayed with the Prophet we used to say, &#8220;Peace be on Allah from His slaves and peace be on so and so.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t say As-Salam be on Allah, for He Himself is As-Salam, but say, &#8216;At-tahiyatu lil-lahi was-salawatu wat-taiyibatu. As-salamu &#8216;Alaika aiyuhan-Nabiyu warahmatu-l-lahi wa barakatuhu. As-salamu &#8216;alaina wa &#8216;ala ibadillahis-salihin.

I heard from ltban bin Malik Al-Ansari, who was one from Bani Salim, saying, &#8220;I used to lead my tribe of Bani Salim in prayer. Once I went to the Prophet and said to him, &#8216;I have weak eye-sight and at times the rainwater flood intervenes between me and the mosque of my tribe and I wish that you would come to my house and pray at some place so that I could take that place as a place for praying (mosque). He said, &#8220;Allah willing, I shall do that.&#8221; Next day Allah&#8217;s Apostle along with Abu Bakr, came to my house after the sun had risen high and he asked permission to enter. I gave him permission, but he didn&#8217;t sit till he said to me, &#8220;Where do you want me to pray in your house?&#8221; I pointed to a place in the house where I wanted him to pray. So he stood up for the prayer and we aligned behind him. He completed the prayer with Taslim and we did the same simultaneously.&#8221;</p>

They have more money by which they perform the Hajj, and &#8216;Umra; fight and struggle in Allah&#8217;s Cause and give in charity.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Shall I not tell you a thing upon which if you acted you would catch up with those who have surpassed you? Nobody would overtake you and you would be better than the people amongst whom you live except those who would do the same. Say &#8220;Sub-han-al-lah&#8221;, &#8220;Alhamdu-lillah&#8221; and &#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8221; thirty three times each after every (compulsory) prayer.&#8221; We differed and some of us said that we should say, &#8220;Subhan-al-lah&#8221; thirty three times and &#8220;Alhamdu lillah&#8221; thirty three times and &#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8221; thirty four times.

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Book 18:</p>
<h3 align="center">Eclipses</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.018.150"></a>Volume 2, Book 18, Number 150:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were with Allah&#8217;s Apostle when the sun eclipsed. Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up dragging his cloak till he entered the Mosque. He led us in a two-Rakat prayer till the sun (eclipse) had cleared. Then the Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;The sun and the moon do not eclipse because of someone&#8217;s death. So whenever you see these eclipses pray and invoke (Allah) till the eclipse is over.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 151:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Masud:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The sun and the moon do not eclipse because of the death of someone from the people but they are two signs amongst the signs of Allah. When you see them stand up and pray.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 152:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The sun and the moon do not eclipse because of the death or life (i.e. birth) of someone but they are two signs amongst the signs of Allah. When you see them offer the prayer.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 153:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The sun eclipsed in the life-time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the day when (his son) Ibrahim died. So the people said that the sun had eclipsed because of the death of Ibrahim. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The sun and the moon do not eclipse because of the death or life (i.e. birth) of some-one. When you see the eclipse pray and invoke Allah.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 154:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the life-time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) the sun eclipsed, so he led the people in prayer, and stood up and performed a long Qiyam, then bowed for a long while. He stood up again and performed a long Qiyam but this time the period of standing was shorter than the first. He bowed again for a long time but shorter than the first one, then he prostrated and prolonged the prostration. He did the same in the second Raka as he did in the first and then finished the prayer; by then the sun (eclipse) had cleared. He delivered the Khutba (sermon) and after praising and glorifying Allah he said, &#8220;The sun and the moon are two signs against the signs of Allah; they do not eclipse on the death or life of anyone. So when you see the eclipse, remember Allah and say Takbir, pray and give Sadaqa.&#8221; The Prophet then said, &#8220;O followers of Muhammad! By Allah! There is none who has more ghaira (self-respect) than Allah as He has forbidden that His slaves, male or female commit adultery (illegal sexual intercourse). O followers of Muhammad! By Allah! If you knew that which I know you would laugh little and weep much.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 155:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When the sun eclipsed in the life-time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle an announcement was made that a prayer was to be offered in congregation.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 156:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) In the lifetime of the Prophet the sun eclipsed and he went to the Mosque and the people aligned behind him. He said the Takbir (starting the prayer) and prolonged the recitation (from the Quran) and then said Takbir and performed a prolonged bowing; then he (lifted his head and) said, &#8220;Sami allahu liman hamidah&#8221; (Allah heard him who sent his praises to Him). He then did not prostrate but stood up and recited a prolonged recitation which was shorter than the first recitation. He again said Takbir and then bowed a prolonged bowing but shorter than the first one and then said, &#8220;Sami &#8216;a-l-lahu Lyman hamidah Rabbana walak-lhamd, (Allah heard him who sent his praises to Him. O our Sustainer! All the praises are for You)&#8221; and then prostrated and did the same in the second Raka; thus he completed four bowing and four prostrations. The sun (eclipse) had cleared before he finished the prayer. (After the prayer) he stood up, glorified and praised Allah as He deserved and then said, &#8220;The sun and the moon are two of the signs of Allah. They do not eclipse because of the death or the life (i.e. birth) of someone. When you see them make haste for the prayer.&#8221; Narrated Az-Zuhri: I said to &#8216;Ursa, &#8220;When the sun eclipsed at Medina your brother (&#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair) offered only a two-Rakat prayer like that of the morning (Fajr) prayer.&#8221; &#8216;Ursa replied, &#8220;Yes, for he missed the Prophet&#8217;s tradition (concerning this matter).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 157:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) On the day when the sun Khasafat (eclipsed) Allah&#8217;s Apostle prayed; he stood up and said Takbir and recited a prolonged recitation, then he performed a prolonged bowing, then he raised his head and said, &#8220;Sami&#8217;a-l-lahu Lyman Hamidah,&#8221; and then remained standing and recited a prolonged recitation which was shorter than the first. Then he performed a prolonged bowing which was shorter than the first. Then he prostrated and prolonged the prostration and he did the same in the second Raka as in the first and then finished the prayer with Taslim. By that time the sun (eclipse) had cleared He addressed the people and said, &#8220;The sun and the moon are two of the signs of Allah; they do not eclipse (Yakhsifan) because of the death or the life (i.e. birth) of someone. So when you see them make haste for the prayer.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 158:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said: &#8220;The sun and the moon are two signs amongst the signs of Allah and they do not eclipse because of the death of someone but Allah frightens His devotees with them.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 159:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amra bint &#8216;AbdurRahman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Jewess came to ask &#8216;Aisha (the wife of the Prophet) about something. She said to her, &#8220;May Allah give you refuge from the punishment of the grave.&#8221; So &#8216;Aisha &#8216; asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle &#8220;Would the people be punished in their graves?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle after seeking refuge with Allah from the punishment of the grave (and thus replied in the affirmative). Then one day, Allah&#8217;s Apostle rode to go to some place but the sun eclipsed. He returned in the forenoon and passed through the rear of the dwellings (of his wives) and stood for the (eclipse) prayer, and the people stood behind him. He stood up for a long period and then performed a prolonged bowing which was shorter than the first bowing. Then he raised his head and prostrated. Then he stood up (for the second Raka) for a long while but the standing was shorter than that of the first Raka. Then he performed a prolonged bowing which was shorter than the first one. Then he raised his head and prostrated. Then he stood up for a long time but shorter than the first. Then he performed a prolonged bowing but shorter than the first. Then he raised his head and prostrated and finished the prayer and (then delivered the sermon and) said as much as Allah wished. And then he ordered the people to seek refuge with Allah from the punishment of the grave.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 160:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the sun eclipsed in the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and an announcement was made that the prayer was to be held in congregation. The Prophet performed two bowing in one Raka. Then he stood up and performed two bowing in one Raka. Then he sat down and finished the prayer; and by then the (eclipse) had cleared &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;I had never performed such a long prostration.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 161:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sun eclipsed in the life-time of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) . Allah&#8217;s Apostle offered the eclipse prayer and stood for a long period equal to the period in which one could recite Surat-al-Baqara. Then he bowed for a long time and then stood up for a long period which was shorter than that of the first standing, then bowed again for a long time but for a shorter period than the first; then he prostrated twice and then stood up for a long period which was shorter than that of the first standing; then he bowed for a long time which was shorter than the previous one, and then he raised his head and stood up for a long period which was shorter than the first standing, then he bowed for a long time which was shorter than the first bowing, and then prostrated (twice) and finished the prayer. By then, the sun (eclipse) had cleared. The Prophet then said, &#8220;The sun and the moon are two of the signs of Allah. They eclipse neither because of the death of somebody nor because of his life (i.e. birth). So when you see them, remember Allah.&#8221; The people say, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We saw you taking something from your place and then we saw you retreating.&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;I saw Paradise and stretched my hands towards a bunch (of its fruits) and had I taken it, you would have eaten from it as long as the world remains. I also saw the Hell-fire and I had never seen such a horrible sight. I saw that most of the inhabitants were women.&#8221; The people asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Why is it so?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Because of their ungratefulness.&#8221; It was asked whether they are ungrateful to Allah. The Prophet said, &#8220;They are ungrateful to their companions of life (husbands) and ungrateful to good deeds. If you are benevolent to one of them throughout the life and if she sees anything (undesirable) in you, she will say, &#8216;I have never had any good from you.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 162:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Fatima bint Al-Mundhir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Asma&#8217; bint Al Bakr said, &#8220;I came to &#8216;Aisha the wife of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) during the solar eclipse. The people were standing and offering the prayer and she was also praying too. I asked her, &#8216;What has happened to the people?&#8217; She pointed out with her hand towards the sky and said, &#8216;Subhan-Allah&#8217;. I said, &#8216;Is there a sign?&#8217; She pointed out in the affirmative.&#8221; Asma&#8217; further said, &#8220;I too then stood up for the prayer till I fainted and then poured water on my head. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle had finished his prayer, he thanked and praised Allah and said, &#8216;I have seen at this place of mine what I have never seen even Paradise and Hell. No doubt, it has been inspired to me that you will be put to trial in the graves like or nearly like the trial of (Masih) Ad-Dajjal. (I do not know which one of the two Asma&#8217; said.) (The angels) will come to everyone of you and will ask what do you know about this man (i.e. Muhammad). The believer or a firm believer (I do not know which word Asma&#8217; said) will reply, &#8216;He is Muhammad, Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) who came to us with clear evidences and guidance, so we accepted his teachings, believed and followed him.&#8217; The angels will then say to him, &#8216;Sleep peacefully as we knew surely that you were a firm believer.&#8217; The hypocrite or doubtful person (I do not know which word Asma&#8217; said) will say, &#8216;I do not know. I heard the people saying something so I said it (the same).&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 163:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Asma:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No doubt the Prophet ordered people to manumit slaves during the solar eclipse.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 164:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amra bint &#8216;AbdurRahman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Jewess came to &#8216;Aisha to ask her about something and then she said, &#8220;May Allah give you refuge from the punishment of the grave.&#8221; So &#8216;Aisha asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle, &#8220;Would the people be punished in their graves?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked Allah&#8217;s refuge from the punishment of the grave (indicating an affirmative reply). Then one day Allah&#8217;s Apostle rode (to leave for some place) but the sun eclipsed. He returned on the forenoon and passed through the rear of the dwellings (of his wives) and stood up and started offering the (eclipse) prayer and the people stood behind him. He stood for a long period and then performed a long bowing and then stood straight for a long period which was shorter than that of the first standing, then he performed a prolonged bowing which was shorter than the first bowing, then he raised his head and prostrated for a long time and then stood up (for the second Raka) for a long while, but the standing was shorter than the standing of the first Raka. Then he performed a prolonged bowing which was shorter than that of the first one. He then stood up for a long time but shorter than the first, then again performed a long bowing which was shorter than the first and then prostrated for a shorter while than that of the first prostration. Then he finished the prayer and delivered the sermon and) said what Allah wished; and ordered the people to seek refuge with Allah from the punishment of the grave.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Masud:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The sun and the moon do not eclipse because of someone&#8217;s death or life but they are two signs amongst the signs of Allah, so pray whenever you see them.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 166:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the lifetime of the Prophet the sun eclipsed and the Prophet (p.b.u.h) stood up to offer the prayer with the people and recited a long recitation, then he performed a prolonged bowing, and then lifted his head and recited a prolonged recitation which was shorter than the first. Then he performed a prolonged bowing which was shorter than the first and then lifted his head and performed two prostrations. He then stood up for the second Raka and offered it like the first. Then he stood up and said, &#8220;The sun and the moon do not eclipse because of someone&#8217;s life or death but they are two signs amongst the signs of Allah which He shows to His worshipers. So whenever you see them, make haste for the prayer.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 167:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sun eclipsed and the Prophet got up, being afraid that it might be the Hour (i.e. Day of Judgment). He went to the Mosque and offered the prayer with the longest Qiyam, bowing and prostration that I had ever seen him doing. Then he said, &#8220;These signs which Allah sends do not occur because of the life or death of somebody, but Allah makes His worshipers afraid by them. So when you see anything thereof, proceed to remember Allah, invoke Him and ask for His forgiveness.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 168:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the day of Ibrahim&#8217;s death, the sun eclipsed and the people said that the eclipse was due to the death of Ibrahim (the son of the Prophet). Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The sun and the moon are two signs amongst the signs of Allah. They do not eclipse because of someone&#8217;s death or life. So when you see them, invoke Allah and pray till the eclipse is clear.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 169:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the life-time of the Prophet the sun eclipsed and then he offered a two Rakat prayer.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 170:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the life-time of the Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) the sun eclipsed and he went out dragging his clothes till he reached the Mosque. The people gathered around him and he led them and offered two Rakat. When the sun (eclipse) cleared, he said, &#8220;The sun and the moon are two signs amongst the signs of Allah; they do not eclipse because of the death of someone, and so when an eclipse occurs, pray and invoke Allah till the eclipse is over.&#8221; It happened that a son of the Prophet called Ibrahim died on that day and the people were talking about that (saying that the eclipse was caused by his death).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 171:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet led us and performed four bowing in two Rakat during the solar eclipse and the first Raka was longer.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 172:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (p.b.u.h) recited (the Quran) aloud during the eclipse prayer and when he had finished the eclipse prayer he said the Takbir and bowed. When he stood straight from bowing he would say &#8220;Sami &#8216;al-l-ahu Lyman hamidah Rabbana walaka-l-hamd.&#8221; And he would again start reciting. In the eclipse prayer there are four bowing and four prostrations in two Rakat. Al-Auza&#8217;i and others said that they had heard Az-Zuhi from &#8216;Ursa from &#8216;Aisha saying, &#8220;In the life-time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle the sun eclipsed, and he made a person to announce: &#8216;Prayer in congregation.&#8217; He led the prayer and performed four bowing and four prostrations in two Rakat.&#8221; Narrated Al-Walid that &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Namir had informed him that he had heard the same. Ibn Shihab heard the same. Az-Zuhrl said, &#8220;I asked (&#8216;Ursa), &#8216;What did your brother &#8216;Abdullah bin AzZubair do? He prayed two Rakat (of the eclipse prayer) like the morning prayer, when he offered the (eclipse) prayer in Median.&#8217; &#8216;Ursa replied that he had missed (i.e. did not pray according to) the Prophet&#8217;s tradition.&#8221; Sulaiman bin Kathir and Sufyan bin Husain narrated from Az-Zuhri that the prayer for the eclipse used to be offered with loud recitation.</p>

<h3 align="center">Times of the Prayers</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.010.500"></a>Volume 1, Book 10, Number 500:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Shihab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once&#8217;Umar bin &#8216;Abdul &#8216;Aziz delayed the prayer and &#8216;Urwa bin Az-Zubair went to him and said, &#8220;Once in &#8216;Iraq, Al-MughTra bin Shu&#8217;ba delayed his prayers and Abi Mas&#8217;ud Al-Ansari went to him and said, &#8216;O Mughira! What is this? Don&#8217;t you know that once Gabriel came and offered the prayer (Fajr prayer) and Allah&#8217;s Apostle prayed too, then he prayed again (Zuhr prayer) and so did Allah&#8217;s Apostle and again he prayed (&#8216;Asr prayers and Allah&#8217;s Apostle did the same; again he prayed (Maghrib-prayer) and so did Allah&#8217;s Apostle and again prayed (&#8216;Isha prayer) and so did Allah&#8217;s Apostle and (Gabriel) said, &#8216;I was ordered to do so (to demonstrate the prayers prescribed to you)?'&#8221; &#8216;Umar (bin &#8216;Abdul &#8216;AzTz) said to &#8216;Urwa, &#8220;Be sure of what you Say. Did Gabriel lead Allah&#8217;s Apostle at the stated times of the prayers?&#8221; &#8216;Urwa replied, &#8220;Bashir bin Abi Mas&#8217;ud narrated like this on the authority of his father.&#8221; Urwa added, &#8220;Aisha told me that Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to pray &#8216;Asr prayer when the sun-shine was still inside her residence (during the early time of &#8216;Asr).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 10, Number 501:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Once a delegation of &#8216;Abdul Qais came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;We belong to such and such branch of the tribe of Rab&#8217;a and we can only come to you in the sacred months. Order us to do something good so that we may (carry out) take it from you and also invite to it our people whom we have left behind (at home).&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8221; I order you to do four things and forbid you from four things. (The first four are as follows):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. To believe in Allah. (And then he: explained it to them i.e.) to testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and (Muhammad) am Allah&#8217;s Apostle</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. To offer prayers perfectly (at the stated times):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. To pay Zakat (obligatory charity)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. To give me Khumus</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The other four things which are forbidden are as follows):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Dubba</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Hantam</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Muqaiyat</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Naqir (all these are utensils used for the preparation of alcoholic drinks).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 10, Number 502:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jarir bin &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I gave the pledge of allegiance to Allah&#8217;s Apostle for to offer prayers perfectly, to pay Zakat regularly, and to give good advice to every Muslim.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 10, Number 503:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Shaqiq:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that he had heard Hudhaifa saying, &#8220;Once I was sitting with &#8216;Umar and he said, &#8216;Who amongst you remembers the statement of Allah&#8217;s Apostle about the afflictions?&#8217; I said, &#8216;I know it as the Prophet had said it.&#8217; &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;No doubt you are bold.&#8217; I said, &#8216;The afflictions caused for a man by his wife, money, children and neighbor are expiated by his prayers, fasting, charity and by enjoining (what is good) and forbidding (what is evil).&#8217; &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;I did not mean that but I asked about that affliction which will spread like the waves of the sea.&#8217; I (Hudhaifa) said, &#8216;O leader of the faithful believers! You need not be afraid of it as there is a closed door between you and it.&#8217; &#8216;Umar asked, Will the door be broken or opened?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;It will be broken.&#8217; &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;Then it will never be closed again.&#8217; I was asked whether &#8216;Umar knew that door. I replied that he knew it as one knows that there will be night before the tomorrow morning. I narrated a Hadith that was free from any mis-statement&#8221; The subnarrator added that they deputed Masruq to ask Hudhaifa (about the door). Hudhaifa said, &#8220;The door was &#8216;Umar himself.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 10, Number 504:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Mas&#8217;ud:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man kissed a woman (unlawfully) and then went to the Prophet and informed him. Allah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And offer prayers perfectly At the two ends of the day And in some hours of the night (i.e. the five compulsory prayers). Verily! good deeds remove (annul) the evil deeds (small sins) (11.114). The man asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle, &#8220;Is it for me?&#8221; He said, &#8220;It is for all my followers.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 10, Number 505:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jarir bin &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were with the Prophet on a full moon night. He looked at the moon and said, &#8220;You will certainly see your Lord as you see this moon, and there will be no trouble in seeing Him. So if you can avoid missing (through sleep, business, etc.) a prayer before the rising of the sun (Fajr) and before its setting (&#8216;Asr) you must do so. He (the Prophet ) then recited the following verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And celebrate the praises Of Your Lord before The rising of the sun And before (its) setting.&#8221; (50.39)</p>

The Prophet got up when the edge of the sun had risen and said, &#8216;O Bilal! What about your statement?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;I have never slept such a sleep.&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;Allah captured your souls when He wished, and released them when He wished. O Bilal! Get up and pronounce the Adhan for the prayer.&#8217; The Prophet performed ablution and when the sun came up and became bright, he stood up and prayed.&#8221;</p>

Then we went to Buthan and he offered the (&#8216;Asr) prayer after sunset and then he offered the Maghrib prayer.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 10, Number 573:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu-l-Minhal:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My father and I went to Abi Barza Al-Aslami and my father said to him, &#8220;Tell us how Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to offer the compulsory congregational prayers.&#8221; He said, &#8220;He used to pray the Zuhr prayer, which you call the first prayer, as the sun declined at noon, the &#8216;Asr at a time when one of US could go to his family at the farthest place in Medina while the sun was still hot. (The narrator forgot what Abu Barza had said about the Maghrib prayer), and the Prophet preferred to pray the &#8216;Isha&#8217; late and disliked to sleep before it or talk after it. And he used to return after finishing the morning prayer at such a time when it was possible for one to recognize the person sitting by his side and he (the Prophet) used to recite 60 to 100 &#8216;Ayat&#8217; (verses) of the Qur&#8217;an in it.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Qurra bin Khalid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once he waited for Al-Hasan and he did not show up till it was about the usual time for him to start his speech; then he came and apologized saying, &#8220;Our neighbors invited us.&#8221; Then he added, &#8220;Narrated Anas, &#8216;Once we waited for the Prophet till it was midnight or about midnight. He came and led the prayer, and after finishing it, he addressed us and said, &#8216;All the people prayed and then slept and you had been in prayer as long as you were waiting for it.&#8221; Al-Hasan said, &#8220;The people are regarded as performing good deeds as long as they are waiting for doing good deeds.&#8221; Al-Hasan&#8217;s statement is a portion of Anas&#8217;s Hadith from the Prophet .</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 10, Number 575:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet prayed one of the&#8217;lsha&#8217; prayer in his last days and after finishing it with Taslim, he stood up and said, &#8220;Do you realize (the importance of) this night? Nobody present on the</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">surface of the earth to-night would be living after the completion of one hundred years from this night.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people made a mistake in grasping the meaning of this statement of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and they indulged in those things which are said about these narrators (i.e. some said that the Day of Resurrection will be established after 100 years etc.) But the Prophet said, &#8220;Nobody present on the surface of earth tonight would be living after the completion of 100 years from this night&#8221;; he meant &#8220;When that century (people of that century) would pass away.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 10, Number 576:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu &#8216;Uthman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdur Rahman bin Abi Bakr said, &#8220;The Suffa Companions were poor people and the Prophet said, &#8216;Whoever has food for two persons should take a third one from them (Suffa companions). And whosoever has food for four persons he should take one or two from them&#8217; Abu Bakr took three men and the Prophet took ten of them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdur Rahman added, my father my mother and I were there (in the house). (The sub-narrator is in doubt whether &#8216;Abdur Rahman also said, &#8216;My wife and our servant who was common for both my house and Abu Bakr&#8217;s house). Abu Bakr took his supper with the Prophet and remained there till the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer was offered. Abu Bakr went back and stayed with the Prophet till the Prophet took his meal and then Abu Bakr returned to his house after a long portion of the night had passed. Abu Bakr&#8217;s wife said, &#8216;What detained you from your guests (or guest)?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Have you not served them yet?&#8217; She said, &#8216;They refused to eat until you come. The food was served for them but they refused.&#8221; &#8216;Abdur Rahman added, &#8220;I went away and hid myself (being afraid of Abu Bakr) and in the meantime he (Abu Bakr) called me, &#8216;O Ghunthar (a harsh word)!&#8217; and also called me bad names and abused me and then said (to his family), &#8216;Eat. No welcome for you.&#8217; Then (the supper was served). Abu Bakr took an oath that he would not eat that food. The narrator added: By Allah, whenever any one of us (myself and the guests of Suffa companions) took anything from the food, it increased from underneath. We all ate to our fill and the food was more than it was before its serving.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr looked at it (the food) and found it as it was before serving or even more than that. He addressed his wife (saying) &#8216;O the sister of Bani Firas! What is this?&#8217; She said, &#8216;O the pleasure of my eyes! The food is now three times more than it was before.&#8217; Abu Bakr ate from it, and said, &#8216;That (oath) was from Satan&#8217; meaning his oath (not to eat). Then he again took a morsel (mouthful) from it and then took the rest of it to the Prophet. So that meal was with the Prophet. There was a treaty between us and some people, and when the period of that treaty had elapsed the Prophet divided us into twelve (groups) (the Prophet&#8217;s companions) each being headed by a man. Allah knows how many men were under the command of each (leader). So all of them (12 groups of men) ate of that meal.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once I came riding a she-ass when I had just attained the  age of puberty. Allah&#8217;s Apostle was offering the prayer at Mina with no wall in front of  him and I passed in front of some of the row. There I dismounted and let my she-ass loose  to graze and entered the row and nobody objected to me about it. </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.009.473"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 9, Number 473: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle came out on &#8216;Id day, he used to  order that a Harba (a short spear) to be planted in front of him (as a Sutra for his  prayer) and then he used to pray facing it with the people behind him and used to do the  same while on a journey. After the Prophet , this practice was adopted by the Muslim  rulers (who followed his traditions). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard my father saying, &#8220;The Prophet led us, and  prayed a two-Rak&#8217;at Zuhr prayer and then a two-Rak&#8217;at &#8216;Asr prayer at Al-Batha&#8217; with an  &#8216;Anza (planted) in front of him (as a Sutra) while women and donkeys were passing in front  of him (beyond that &#8216;Anza).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl (bin Sa&#8217;d): </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The distance between the Musalla of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the  wall was just sufficient for a sheep to pass through . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 9, Number 476: </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that he had heard his father saying, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle  came to us at mid-day and water was brought for his ablution. He performed ablution and  led us in Zuhr and &#8216;Asr prayers with an &#8216;Anza planted in front of him (as a Sutra), while  women and donkeys were passing beyond it.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.009.479"></a></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas Ibn Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever the Prophet went for answering the call of nature,  I and another boy used to go after him with a staff, a stick or an &#8216;Anza and a tumbler of  water and when he finished from answering the call of nature we would hand that tumbler of  water to him. </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.009.481"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 9, Number 481: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Yazid bin Al &#8216;Ubaid: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I used to accompany Salama bin Al-Akwa&#8217; and he used to pray  behind the pillar which was near the place where the Quran&#8217;s were kept I said, &#8220;O Abu  Muslim! I see you always seeking to pray behind this pillar.&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I saw  Allah&#8217;s Apostle always seeking to pray near that pillar.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.009.482"></a></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I saw the most famous people amongst the companions of the  Prophet hurrying towards the pillars at the Maghrib prayer before the Prophet came for the  prayer. </font></p>
<hr>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet entered the Ka&#8217;ba along with Usama bin Zaid,  &#8216;Uthman bin Talha and Bilal and remained there for a long time. When they came out, I was  the first man to enter the Ka&#8217;ba. I asked Bilal &#8220;Where did the Prophet pray?&#8221;  Bilal replied, &#8220;Between the two front Pillars.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.009.484"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 9, Number 484: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Nafi&#8217;: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle entered the  Ka&#8217;ba along with Usama bin Zaid, Bilal and &#8216;Uthman bin Talha Al-Hajabi and closed the door  and stayed there for some time. I asked Bilal when he came out, &#8216;What did the Prophet do?&#8217;  He replied, &#8216;He offered prayer with one pillar to his left and one to his right and three  behind.&#8217; In those days the Ka&#8217;ba was supported by six pillars.&#8221; Malik said:  &#8220;There were two pillars on his (the Prophet&#8217;s) right side.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.009.485"></a></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Nafi: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;The Prophet used to make his she-camel sit across and  he would pray facing it (as a Sutra).&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What would the Prophet do if  the she-camel was provoked and moved?&#8221; He said, &#8220;He would take its camel-saddle  and put it in front of him and pray facing its back part (as a Sutra). And Ibn &#8216;Umar used  to do the same.&#8221; (This indicates that one should not pray except behind a Sutra). </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.009.486"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 9, Number 486: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Do you make us (women) equal to dogs and donkeys? While I  used to lie in my bed, the Prophet would come and pray facing the middle of the bed. I  used to consider it not good to stand in front of him in his prayers. So I used to slip  away slowly and quietly from the foot of the bed till I got out of my guilt. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 9, Number 488: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Salih As-Samman: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I saw Abu Said Al-Khudri praying on a Friday, behind  something which acted as a Sutra. A young man from Bani Abi Mu&#8217;ait, wanted to pass in  front of him, but Abu Said repulsed him with a push on his chest. Finding no alternative  he again tried to pass but Abu Said pushed him with a greater force. The young man abused  Abu Said and went to Marwan and lodged a complaint against Abu Said and Abu Said followed  the young man to Marwan who asked him, &#8220;O Abu Said! What has happened between you and  the son of your brother?&#8221; Abu Sa&#8217;id said to him, &#8220;I heard the Prophet saying,  &#8216;If anybody amongst you is praying behind something as a Sutra and somebody tries to pass  in front of him, then he should repulse him and if he refuses, he should use force against  him for he is a satan.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that Zaid bin Khalid sent him to Abi Juhaim to ask him what  he had heard from Allah&#8217;s Apostle about a person passing in front of another person who  was praying. Abu Juhaim replied, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;If the person who passes in  front of another person in prayer knew the magnitude of his sin he would prefer to wait  for 40 (days, months or years) rather than to pass in front of him.&#8221; Abu An-Nadr  said, &#8220;I do not remember exactly whether he said 40 days, months or years.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The things which annul the prayers were mentioned before  me. They said, &#8220;Prayer is annulled by a dog, a donkey and a woman (if they pass in  front of the praying people).&#8221; I said, &#8220;You have made us (i.e. women) dogs. I  saw the Prophet praying while I used to lie in my bed between him and the Qibla. Whenever  I was in need of something, I would slip away. for I disliked to face him.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>the wife of the Prophet, &#8220;I used to sleep in front of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle with my legs opposite his Qibla (facing him); and whenever he prostrated,  he pushed my feet and I withdrew them and whenever he stood, I stretched them.&#8221;  &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;In those days there were no lamps in the houses.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The things which annual prayer were mentioned before me  (and those were): a dog, a donkey and a woman. I said, &#8220;You have compared us (women)  to donkeys and dogs. By Allah! I saw the Prophet praying while I used to lie in (my) bed  between him and the Qibla.

One of  them said, &#8216;Don&#8217;t you see this (who does deeds just to show off)? Who amongst you can go  and bring the dung, blood and the abdominal contents (intestines, etc). of the slaughtered  camels of the family of so and so and then wait till he prostrates and put that in between  his shoulders?&#8217; The most unfortunate amongst them (&#8216;Uqba bin Abi Mu&#8217;ait) went (and brought  them) and when Allah&#8217;s Apostle prostrated, he put them between his shoulders. The Prophet  remained in prostration and they laughed so much so that they fell on each other. A  passerby went to Fatima, who was a young girl in those days. She came running and the  Prophet was still in prostration. She removed them and cursed upon the Quraish on their  faces. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle completed his prayer, he said, &#8216;O Allah! Take revenge on  Quraish.&#8217; He said so thrice and added, &#8216;O Allah! take revenge on &#8216;Amr bin Hisham, &#8216;Utba  bin Rabia, Shaiba bin Rabi&#8217;a, Al-Walid bin&#8217;Utba, Umaiya bin Khalaf, &#8216;Uqba bin Abi Mu&#8217;ait  and &#8216;Umar a bin Al-Walid.&#8221; Abdullah added, &#8220;By Allah! I saw all of them dead in  the battle field on the day of Badr and they were dragged and thrown in the Qalib (a well)  at Badr: Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said, &#8216;Allah&#8217;s curse has descended upon the people of the  Qalib (well). </font></p>

		<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">I have witnessed some of the Muslim youth fasting, but they do not pray. Is the fast of the person who fasts but does not pray accepted? I have heard some of the preachers telling these youth to break their fast and not to fast, as he who does not pray has no fast?</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whomever the prayer is obligatory upon and he intentionally abandons it, rejecting its obligation, then he has disbelieved according to the consensus of the scholars. Whoever abandons it due to being lax and lazy about it, then he has disbelieved according to the correct opinion from the opinions of the people of knowledge. When it is ruled that he is a disbeliever, then his fasting and other acts of worship are nullified. This due to Allah&#8217;s statement: <strong>And if they had associated partners with Allah, all that they used to do would have been of no benefit to them</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However such a person should not be ordered to abandon fasting. This is because his fasting will only increase him in goodness and closeness to the religion. Also, due to the fear of his heart, it is hoped that it will lead him to return to the performance of the prayer and repentance from abandoning it. And success is from Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and his Companions.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">The Thirteenth and Fourteenth Pillar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Muhammadin wa &#8216;alaa Muhammadin kamaa Salayta &#8216;alaa ibraaheema wa &#8216;alaa Aali ibraaheema Innaka Hameedun Majeed&#8221;</span> [O Allaah, send your praises upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad as you sent praises upon Ibraaheem and the family of Ibraaheem. Verily, You are Most-Praiseworthy, Most Glorified]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This version of the tashahhud is well known. There are other forms of it as well.You may memorize whichever wording of the tashahhud that you like. However, choose one that is agreed upon. And if you hear someone using a tashahhud that varies from this one, do not condemn him.Tha same could be said about sending Salaat on the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) if you have memorized the version mentioned here by the author. There are other ways of saying it as well. And we have stated many times that there exists many ways of doing it. Perhaps all of these ways (of sending salaat on the Prophet) have been gathered together by the great Scholar Ibn Al-Qavvim in his book which is unique in its subject: Jalaa-ul-Afhaam fis-Salaati &#8216;alaa Khair-il-Anaam.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Salaat mentioned here (i.e. above) is known as the Abrahamic Salaat. The most comprehensive form of it is the one that has been agreed upon, which is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Muhammadin wa &#8216;alaa Aali Muhammad kamaa salaita &#8216;alaa Ibraaheema wa &#8216;alaa Aali Ibraaheem. Innaka Hameedun Majeed. Wa Baarik Muhammadin wa &#8216;alaa Aali Muhammad kamaa baarakta &#8216;alaa Ibraaheema wa &#8216;alaa Aali Ibraaheem. Innaka Hameedun Majeed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This manner of saying it is agreed upon. And there are many other ways. However you should take note that none of the versions of the Abrahamic Salaat that have been recorded by Ibn Al-Qayyim in his afore-mentioned book contain an mention of the word &#8220;Sayyidinaa&#8221; our master) such as: &#8220;Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Sayyidinaa Muhammad.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">Many of our sensitive Muslim brothers, if you don&#8217;t say &#8220;<strong>Sayyidinaa</strong>&#8221; when sending Salaat and just say &#8220;Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Muhammad&#8221; , will perhaps think bad thoughts about you and say: &#8220;This person doesn&#8217;t have any respect for Allaah&#8217;s Messenger!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">In fact, this very thing actually did happen, for one time a Moroccan man on Hajj told me: &#8220;0 Shaikh! I have attended your lessons from the first class till now while traveling. But I notice about you that when you send Salaat on the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam), you say &#8216; Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Muhammad&#8217; and I never heard you once say: &#8216; Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Sayyidinaa Muhammad.&#8217; Why is this O Shaikh?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">He asked a good question and I clarified the matter to him, thus reducing the irritation found in him since he would become very annoyed whenever he would hear someone send Salaat on the Prophet and not say: &#8220;Allaahumma Salli Sayyidinaa Muhammad.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">The Muslim common-folk do not make any distinction in matters. Perhaps they think that someone who leaves out the word &#8220;Sayyidinaa&#8221; does not respect the Prophet and does not love him in the manner that he deserves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">The reply: This is ignorance. It may even be called compound ignorance. Compound ignorance is when someone is ignorant and he doesn&#8217;t know that he is ignorant. If you don&#8217;t know that you don&#8217;t know something then this is ignorance on top of ignorance. So what is it that someone with ignorance attached to him knows? Nothing!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point is that Muhammad, the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) is our leader (Sayyid). He is the leader of all of mankind &#8211; all of the descendants of Aadam. This is what I worship Allaah with. We must believe this, in accordance with what he has informed us: &#8220;I am the Sayyid (leader) of mankind on the Day of Judgement. I am the Sayyid (leader) of the children of Aadam, and I do not say this to boast&#8221; We are obligated to believe that he is the Sayyid (leader) of all of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But in spite of this, when he (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) taught the Companions how to send Salaat on him and when he dictated the Abrahamic Salaat to them during the revelation of the ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily Allaah and His Angels send Salaat (praises) on the Prophet. O you who believe, send your praises (Salaat) and greetings (Salaam) on him&#8221;</span> [Surah Al-Ahzaab: 56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When this ayah was revealed, the Companions asked: &#8220;0 Messenger of Allaah(Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam), you have already taught us how to send greetings (of Salaam) upon you, but we have been ordered to (also) send praises (Salaat) upon you, so how do we send Salaat on you?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is possible that this sort of questioning occurred in several different gatherings based on the fact that there are numerous manners of sending Salaat on the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam). The Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) taught his Companions to say it like this: &#8220;Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Muhammad.&#8221; This does not mean that he (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) revoked his status of leadership and that he was no longer a Sayyid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You have noted that at times the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) would condemn people in certain circumstances who would make statements that were understood to contain exaggeration and extremism with regard to himself. He (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) would condemn the one who said: &#8220;You are our Sayyid (leader), son of our Sayyid. And you are the best among us, son of the best among us&#8221; even though he really is the Sayyid (leader) of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, he did this because he feared that this man was being afflicted with extremism. Going to extremes with regard to the righteous people is one of the main causes of others being worshipped besides Allaah. So in order to protect the sanctuary of Tawheed, he told him no. He forbade him from (saying) that, saying: &#8220;I am only a slave, so say: &#8216;The slave and messenger of Alhall.'&#8221; This was even in spite of his prior statement in which he announced that he was the Sayyid (leader) of the children of Aadam. However, there is no contradiction between this statement and that statement since each situation warrants its own statement depending on its circumstances.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The situation in which the Prophet condemned the man was a situation that warranted such a condemnation and warning, whereas the situation in which he (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) announced he was the Sayyid (of mankind) was due to the fact that he was talking about his (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) intercession. So he was clarifying its reality the reality that he is the Sayyid (leader) of all of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point we are trying to make here is: Sending Salaat on the Prophet should be done by using one of the versions that have been reported in the texts. You should not add the phrase Sayyidina (our leader) to it even though the Prophet is our Sayyid. I hope that this point is understood. Furthermore, after making this point clear, I would like to reiterate that we must believe and affirm, in accordance with his report, that the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) is our Sayyid (leader). However, when sending Salaat upon him, we should not say: &#8220;Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Sayyidinaa.&#8221; Rather we should just say: &#8220;Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Muhammad&#8221; since this would be following his example, implementing his teachings, and carrying out his instructions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This statement stuns some people, which is why I must say again that the scholars have unanimously agreed that it is not permissible for a Muslim who wants to worship Allaah through words of supplication that have been reported in the texts to add, subtract, change or replace any of those words.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars of Hadeeth, with their intricate memory and understanding of the texts, use as evidence one single report, which others perhaps are not aware of the basis of proof found in it. This report is about the time when the Prophet taught one of his Companions the supplication one should make when going to bed. The supplication contains the following words:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8220;Aamantu bi-Kitaabik aladhee anzalta wa Nabee&#8217;ik aladhee arsalta.&#8221;<br>
I believe in Your Book that You revealed and in Your Prophet that You sent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Companion began to repeat this supplication in order to memorize it, but then on one occasion, said: &#8220;&#8230;wa Rasoolik aladhee arsalta&#8221; , i.e. &#8220;&#8230;in Your Messenger that You sent.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What did he do? He replaced the word &#8220;Nabee&#8221; (Prophet) with the word &#8220;Rasool&#8221; (Messenger). This Companion then narrated that: &#8220;The Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam), tapped my chest and said: &#8220;No, say: Wa Nabee&#8217;ik aladhee arsalta.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is clear proof that it is not proper for a person who wishes to follow Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) and abide by his teachings to add, subtract, change or replace (these supplications) based on his own accord. The &#8220;Messenger&#8221; and &#8220;Prophet&#8221; are two valid titles for Prophet Muhammad. However, we cannot change the supplication from the manner in which it was reported since that is the way the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) stated it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) does not speak from his own desire. So these were revealed to the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) through revelation from Allaah. Meaning: The legislation of these words of remembrance that are to be said at the time of sleeping came down from the heavrns. So if something was revealed to the Prophet(Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) and he conveyed it to his, Companions in the same manner in which it was sent down, it would not be proper for the Companions to change that. And we should follow their example, and Allaah knows best.</p>

		<p><b>Outset and end of the last third of night</b><b>  [1]<span id="This was published in Al-Da&#096;wah magazine, issue no. 1138, on 2/9/1408 A.H." class="tip"></span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q: It is reported in the Hadith that <a name="Allahdescendseverynighttothe"></a><span id="ContentParagraph"><span id="24854"></span><span style="color:#008000;">Allah descends every night to the lowest heaven in the last third of the night</span> [2].</span> When does the last third of the night begin and end?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: There are Mutawatir Hadiths (a Hadith reported by a significant number of narrators throughout the chain of narration, whose agreement upon a lie is impossible) from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) that prove that Allah descends. The Prophet (peace be upon him) stated, <a name="OurLorddescendstothelowest"></a><span id="ContentParagraph"><span id="13253"></span><span style="color:#008000;">Our Lord descends to the lowest heaven every night when the last third of the night begins when He says, ‘Who calls Me to answer him? Who asks Me to give him? Who asks Me for forgiveness to forgive him?</span> [3]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream) unanimously agreed that Allah descends in a manner that befits Him and that He is not like His creation at all in any of His Attributes, as He states, <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Ikhlas, 112: 1" target="_blank" name="Say(OMuhammad%D8%B5%D9%84%D9%89%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%87%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%85):"></a><em><span style="color:#008000;">Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8220;He is Allâh, (the) One. <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Ikhlas, 112: 2" target="_blank" name="All%C3%A2h-us-Samad(%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D9%8A%D9%8A%D8%B5%D9%85%D8%AF"></a>&#8220;Allâh-us-Samad (السيد الذي يصمد إليه في الحاجات) [Allâh the Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, (He neither eats nor drinks)]</span></em>. <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Ikhlas, 112: 3" target="_blank" name="Hebegetsnot,norwasHebegotten"></a>&#8220;He begets not, nor was He begotten. <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Ikhlas, 112: 4" target="_blank" name="Andthereisnoneco-equalorcomparableuntoHim"></a>&#8220;And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him.&#8221; <span style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-Ikhlas, 112</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says, <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Shura, 42: 11" target="_blank" name="TheCreatoroftheheavensand"></a><em><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him; and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer</span></em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah, we must accept the Ayahs and Hadiths that speak of the Attributes of Allah as they are without <strong>Tahrif</strong> (distortion of the meaning), <strong>Ta`til</strong> (denial of Allah&#8217;s Attributes), <strong>Takyif</strong> (descriptive designation of Allah&#8217;s Attributes), or <strong>Tamthil</strong> (likening Allah&#8217;s Attributes to those of His Creation). At the same time, we must believe in them and believe that what is mentioned in these texts is true without likening Allah to His creation or discussing the nature of His Attributes. Rather, their view concerning His Attributes is like their view concerning His Dhat (Essence). Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah affirm the Essence of Allah without Takyif, or Tamthil, and thus, we must also affirm His Attributes without Takyif or Tamthil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The descent of Allah occurs in every country in a manner that befits Allah, because the descent of Allah is not like the descent of any of His creation. He is described as descending in the last part of the night in all parts of the world in a manner that befits His Majesty, Exalted be He.No one can know how He descends just as no one can know how His Essence is, except Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He states, <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Shura, 42: 11" target="_blank" name="TheCreatoroftheheavensand"></a><em><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him; and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer</span></em>.<span style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-Shura, 42: 11.</span> Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 74" target="_blank" name="Soputnotforwardsimilitudes"></a><em><span style="color:#008000;">So put not forward similitudes for Allâh (as there is nothing similar to Him, nor He resembles anything). Truly! Allâh knows and you know not.<span style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 74</span></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The time of the first and last third of the night differs according to the season; if the night is nine hours long, then the time of descent begins at the onset of the seventh hour and continues until dawn. If the night is twelve hours long, then the last third begins at the beginning of the ninth hour until the break of dawn and so on, depending on how long or short the night is in each place</strong></span>. May Allah grant us success.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The first question of Fatwa no. 19886   </span><br style="color:#000000;"><br style="color:#000000;"><span style="color:#000000;">Q 1: <strong>is the hour that precedes the Fajr (Dawn) Prayer considered as part of the last third of the night?  </strong> </span><br style="color:#000000;"><br style="color:#000000;"><span style="color:#000000;"> A: The hour that precedes the second Fajr (true dawn), which consists of 60 minutes, is part of the last third of the night and is considered to be the last hour of the last third of the night. This is because the <span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong>night begins from the sunset and lasts until the emergence of the second Fajr</strong></span>. It is authentically reported that Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) descends to the worldly heaven in the last third of the night. It was related by Al-Bukhari in his &#8220;Sahih (Book of Authentic Hadith)&#8221;, vol. 2, p. 47, on the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;Our Lord, Blessed and Exalted is He, descends every night to the heaven of the world, when only the last third of the night remains and says, &#8220;Who will supplicate Me that I may respond to him; who will ask Me that I may give him; who will beg My forgiveness that I may forgive him?&#8221; Every Muslim and Muslimah is free to benefit from the blessed times and the times when supplications are answered, to supply themselves with good righteous deeds and supplicate for whatever they like from the matters of the Din (religion) or the Duniya (this world). </span><br style="color:#000000;"><br style="color:#000000;"><span style="color:#000000;">May Allah grant us success!

		<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">The following is an article written by <em>Shaykh Badr al-Badr al-&#8216;Anazy (hafidhahullah)</em> which analyzes the permissibility of the second congregation, based on the <em>ahaadeeth</em> of the Prophet (<em>sallAllahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>) and explanation of our <em>&#8216;Ulamaa`.</em> The This article was translated by our noble brother <em>Abu Afnaan Muhammad &#8216;Abdullah</em> (<em>hafidhahullah</em>), who has explicit written permission from the <em>Shaykh</em> to translate his articles<br>
<a style="font-weight:inherit;color:#0068cf;" href="http://www.mpubs.org/files/20140510_Abu_Afnaan_Permission_From_Shaykh_Badr.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">click here to read</a>.</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"><strong>An excerpt taken from the article ~</strong></p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Imaam Ibn al-Qudaamah</em> mentioned in <em>al-Mughnee</em> (2/117): “It is not disliked to repeat the congregational prayer in the <em>masjid</em>. And this means that if the local<em>imaam</em> prays (with a group) and then another group comes, it is recommended for them to pray as a group and this is the position of <em>Ibn Mas’ood, ‘Ataa, al-Hasan, an-Nakha&#8217;ee </em>and others. However, <em>Saalim, Maalik, Abu Haneefah, ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee</em> and others stated that the congregational prayer is not repeated in a <em>masjid </em>which has an appointed <em>imaam</em> and is not on a passageway, etc. Thus, if he misses the congregation, he is to pray by himself.</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">There is no proof prohibiting the second congregation and that they are to pray by themselves and the <em>hadeeth</em>, “who will give charity to that one” is clear textual proof of its permissibility.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The author, may Allaah have mercy on him, states here that the opening supplication is a recommended act. It is neither a pillar nor a requirement nor a condition. Rather it is supererogatory. He then went on to choose one version of the opening supplication, which is the shortest, amplest, and most comprehensive of these supplications from the perspective of praise, veneration and glorification of Allaah. And it is: <strong>&#8220;Subhaanak Allaahumma wa hi Hamdika. Wa Tabaarakasmuka wa Ta&#8217;aala Jadduka. Wa Laa Ilaaha Ghayruka</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great scholar Ibn Al-Qayyim listed a number of opening supplications in his book Zaad al-Ma&#8217;aad. But he preferred this supplication over the numerous other ones of this nature, some of which are longer. This is due to the fact that this concise supplication contains such praise, veneration and glorification for Allaah the likes of which cannot be found in other supplications. Other supplications consist more of requests and invocations whereas this one consists of (purely) glorification, honoring and exaltation (of Allaah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author then takes it upon himself to explain this supplication as well as what comes after it. The meaning of: &#8220;<strong>Subhaanak Allaahumma</strong>&#8221; is: &#8220;I absolve You, O Lord, in a manner that befits You, from all imperfections.&#8221;  This is an absolving that befits His majesty, and it is derived from the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people are divided in their definitions of absolving Allaah from imperfections. Some people have defined it as negating Allaah&#8217;s Attributes, which is why the <strong>Jahmiyyah and Mu&#8217;tazilah</strong> have negated all of Allaah&#8217;s Attributes, claiming that they are removing imperfections from Allaah. The reason for this (according to them) is because if one affirms Attributes for Allaah, this leads to likening Allaah to His creation. So, according to them, freeing Allaah from imperfections can only be achieved by negating His Attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <strong>Ashaa&#8217;irah and the Matooridiyyah</strong> did the same with respect to the textual Attributes. The textual Attributes are those attributes for which the intellect plays no part in affirming. They are only affirmed by way of narrations and textual proofs. According to the understanding of the Ashaa&#8217;irah, affirming these attributes literally goes against removing imperfections from Allaah. So as a result they resorted to <strong>taweel</strong> (misinterpretation). They did not negate the Attributes as others did. Rather, they claimed that what was literally stated in these texts was not what Allaah intended. So therefore, interpreting them them with other than their literal meanings is binding based on the claim of removing imperfections from Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You will notice that everyone who negates or distorts the meaning of Allaah&#8217;s Attributes claims to be removing imperfections from Allaah by what they do. When the first group negated Allaah&#8217;s Attributes, they did not intend disrespect for Allaah. Rather, according to their claim, they only intended to remove imperfections from Him. But where is this removal of imperfections? They went astray in this regard. Why did they go astray? Because they looked for guidance in other than Allaah&#8217;s Book. <span style="color:#ff6600;">Whoever searches for guidance in other than the Book of Allaah and in other than what the Messenger brought, will no doubt go astray</span>. <strong>This is a principle</strong>. Whoever looks for guidance and truth in other than what the Messenger of Allaah came with will be misguided as recompense for turning away (from the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah). This is since guidance, correctness and truth is restricted to only that which the Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) brought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we want to know the true manner of removing Allaah, from imperfections in a manner that befits His majesty, we should read Allaah&#8217;s statement: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;There is nothing like Him (in comparison), and He is the All Hearer, the All-Seer</span>.&#8221; [Surah Ash-Shooraa: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is there a greater example of removing imperfections from Allaah than this? Allaah affirms Attributes for Himself but negates any comparisons in those Attributes that He has affirmed. This is what is meant by <strong>tanzeeh</strong> (removing imperfections from Allaah). It is that you affirm for Him what He has affirmed for Himself from complete Attributes, perfect Names and flawless Actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Affirm for Him what He has affirmed for Himself. Then negate any comparisons to what He has affirmed (for Himself) since no one can describe Allaah who is more knowledgeable than Him. Also affirm for what His trusted Messenger has described Him with and negate my comparisons to what he (peace be upon him) has affirmed, since no one can describe Allaah from His creation who is more knowledgeable than Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is how Allaah has guided the people of truth and the callers to truth. So they know how to remove imperfections from Allaah without negating His Attributes, distorting their meaning, making comparisons to them or likening them to His creation. This is the point the author is trying to make when he says: &#8220;I absolve You from all imperfections, my Lord, in a manner that befits You.&#8221; This is the type of removing of imperfections from Allaah that befits His majesty, which has been derived from the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Wa bi-Hamdika&#8221;</strong> means: &#8220;while praising You.&#8221; So this consists of removing imperfections from Allaah while at the same time praising Him. But on the other hand, if you have negated Allaah&#8217;s Perfect Attributes, how can you then praise Him?! If you have negated the Attribute of Mercy from Allaah, how can you praise Him? You say that it is impossible for Allaah to have Mercy and that Love is something impossible for Allaah. He is neither loved nor does He love. How then can you praise him when you negate Mercy from Him?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You heard previously the qudsee hadeeth about Al-Faatihah in which it is stated: &#8220;And when the servant says: <strong>Ar-Rahmaan-ir-Raheem</strong>&#8216;, Allaah says: &#8216;<strong>My servant has extolled Me</strong>.&#8221; As for the one who negates the Attribute of Mercy from Allaah, it is not possible for Him to praise Allaah, since praising Allaah can only be achieved through His exemplary Names, Attributes, and Actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Wa Tabaarakusmuka&#8221;</strong> means: Blessing is achieved by mentioning You. Your Name is removed from any imperfections and blessing is achieved through mention of Your Name. This is how the author (Muhammad bin Abdil-Wahhaab) has explained it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Wa Ta&#8217;aala jadduka&#8221;</strong> means: Glorified be Your greatness grandness. The word &#8220;<strong>jadd</strong>&#8221; here takes on the meaning of grandness and self sufficiency. So it means: &#8220;Glorified be Your Grandness and self-sufficiency.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that: &#8220;No one on earth or in heaven is worshipped with due right except for You, O Allaah.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;<strong>with due right</strong>&#8221; must be mentioned when explaining the meaning of &#8220;Laa Ilaaha illaaAllaah&#8221;. You must include &#8220;due right&#8221; or &#8220;rightfully&#8221; or else the meaning will be wrong. If you were to say: &#8220;There is no one worshipped in the heavens or on the earth except for You&#8221; we would be contradicting reality since those who are worshipped are many. But the one who is worshipped after all others have been negated is the One who is worshipped in truth or with &#8220;due right.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no one worshipped on earth or in heaven with due right except for You. As for those who are worshipped in the heavens and the earth, the worship of them is futile and invalid. The sun and the moon are worshipped but worshiping them is invalid. Trees are worshipped. Many of the large trees with many branches (known as dawhaat) are still worshipped today. This goes also for stones, tombs and shrines. The worship of these things is futile.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This also applies to the worship of Jinn and the worship of graves. Every time something is worshipped, it becomes known as a &#8220;god&#8221; according to the language. It is not called Allaah, but rather a &#8220;false&#8221; god. The term &#8220;god&#8221; is general and encompasses the One who is worshipped with due right as well as those that are worshipped wrongfully. The word &#8220;Allaah&#8221; is specifically reserved for the One who is worshipped with due right &#8211; the Creator of the heavens and the earth. There is no one worshipped in the heavens or the earth (with due right) except for you, O Allaah.</p>

	<div class="entry-content th-content">
		<p style="text-align:justify;">Answered by Shaykh Ubayd al Jabiree in Telelink for Sri Lanka:</p>
<div class="qa-faq-answer" style="color:#888888;">
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The original question was if the masjid has a qabr or a grave is it permissible to pray in it. So Shaykh Ubayd (hafidhahullah) he went on after praising Allaah and saying peace and blessings on the Messenger and his family and companions, he went on to say in regards to this question that there are basically two situations.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The first of them is that, if the grave came before the masjid, and the masjid was built because of the grave being there and was built so that the people would worship the person who was in that grave, worshipping besides Allaah.  And the Shaykh goes on to mention that there is a severe threat in regards to this affair. And he went on to mention some of the nusoos, some of the texts in regards to that, like the saying of the Messenger (sallalhualahi wa sallam) that the anger of Allaah is upon the people who take the graves of the Prophets as masaajids.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">And in another narration, that the Prophet (sallalhualahi wa sallam) asked for curse of Allaah to be upon the Jews and Christians, because they took the graves of their Prophets as Masaajids.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">So the Shaykh went on to say that there are many hadith on this issue. So he  said in regards to this, that it is not allowed to pray in it, because this masjid was built, because of the grave, because it was built, to worship other than Allaah.

	<div class="entry-content th-content">
		<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;If one of you comes to the masjid, he should look at the bottom of his shoes. If he sees any impurity on them, he should rub them on the ground. Then he may enter with them (i.e, the shoes) and pray with them on.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is one of the acts of the Sunnah that has been abandoned today. in fact, it is one of the acts of the Sunnah that is fought against by many people. It is even considered a crime in some regions — Entering the masjid with sandals and shoes. If I were to go today and buy a pair of shoes from a store and then put them on and enter the masjid with them -this would be regarded as a crime and considered disrespectful to the mosques and houses of Allaah. The Sunnah has become innovation and innovation has become Sunnah! Praying in shoes was something well established at the time of the Salaf &#8211; they would not differ over it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a matter of fact, everything found in this command (of the Prophet) Should be observed by an individual. So he should check if his shoes are clean upon entering the masjid, acting upon the hadeeth which we just mentioned: &#8220;Then he may enter with them (i.e. the shoes) and pray with them on.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he takes his shoes off, <strong>he should place them between his legs, not in front of him or behind him nor to his right or left</strong>, so as to disturb the people around him. Rather he should place them between his legs, in between his feet. This is what has been reported in the Sunnah and this is what the Salaf of this ummah have followed. This aspect of the Sunnah continues to be practiced in some areas of this country (i.e. Saudi Arabia). However, in some of the other areas of the country as well as some regions abroad, the reaction towards this Sunnah is bad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nevertheless, <strong>we must emphasize here that praying in shoes is Sunnah, i.e. recommended. It is neither obligatory nor is it a condition or requirement for the validity of one&#8217;s prayer.</strong> So if this aspect of the Sunnah conflicts with another good that is found in some masaajid, or if opening the door to entering the masaajid with shoes on leads to squandering money, then this aspect of the Sunnah should be left off temporarily and restrictedly &#8211; to this confined area &#8211; until it is revived in other places similar to these masaajid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The youth should not hasten to enter the masaajid with their shoes on for they will open the door for everyone to do so, and this will lead some people who are in a rush to enter the masjid before checking under their shoes. This will then lead to a squandering of the masjid&#8217;s carpet and we have been prohibited from squandering money.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Squandering money is forbidden while entering the masjid and Praying with shoes on is recommended. So when there exists a conflict such as this, we should work to revive the Sunnah of praying in shoes in masaajid other than these &#8211; i.e. in masaajid that have remained in their pure original state with floors that are covered by dirt and sand &#8211; or in our homes, or in some open land when we go out on a journey or camping. There are many places.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that we should not fight against the act of praying in shoes, nor should we go to the extreme of entering these carpeted masaajid with shoes on thus causing the money spent on them to be squandered. Rather, we should combine between these advantages and those ahaadeeth, and that is by reviving the Sunnah of praying in shoes in other than these types of masaajid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many masaajid and many places (to pray with shoes on). So we must have a good and proper understanding of the Religion and bring together all of the texts. A person should not take one portion or one text or one hadeeth and leave off all of the other texts. Rather, he must always try to reconcile and bring together all of the texts, as much as he is able to.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ibn Qayyim al Jawziyah-May Allah have mercy upon him-stated in his book &#8216;Raising the hands in prayer&#8217;, pg 281:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;What is recommended is that his palms face towards the direction of the Qiblah and that he does not make them face towards his ears. Our scholars (the Hanbalis) and the Shafi&#8217;is have cleary mentioned this and from those who mentioned this is the author of &#8216;al Tatimma&#8217;.</span></p>
<p>However, regarding what many of the common people do from making their palms and fingers face their ears, it opposes the sunnah.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1 &#8211; Giving Attention to the Two Rakat Sunnah for the Fajr Prayer</b><b>[2]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a) From Ayesha <i>&#8211;</i><i>Radi Allaahu anha</i><i>&#8211;</i> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> was not more concerned and did not pay attention to any of the optional prayers like he did for the two Rakat of Sunnah for the Fajr prayer.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b) From Ayesha from the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Two Rakat for Sunnah of Fajr prayer are better than the Dunyaa and everything that is in it.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">c) From Ayesha <i>&#8211;</i><i>Radi Allaahu anha</i><i>&#8211;</i> who said from the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> that he said about the two Rakat when the Fajr prayer time comes in:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘They are more beloved to me than the Dunyaa and everything that is in it.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>2 &#8211; Shortening the Sunnah of the Fajr Prayer</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a) From Ayesha <i>&#8211;</i><i>Radi Allaahu anha</i><i>&#8211;</i> who said that the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> used to pray thirteen Rakah during the night, then he would pray two short Rakah once he had heard the call for the morning prayer.’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the narration of Abu Dawood:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Messenger <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> would pray two Rakah between the Adhan of Fajr and the Iqamah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b) From Ayesha who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> used to pray two shortened Rakah which were before the morning (Fajr) prayer, he would shorten them so much that I would say: Did he recite Soorah Fatiha?’[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Tayeeb Atheema-a-Baadi said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It is established from these Ahadeeth that the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> used to pray them when the Mu’adhin had become silent after the Adhan, and when the time of Fajr had come in and Fajr had lit up.  He <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> used to pray them lightly. As for the wisdom of them being a light prayer, then al-Qurtubi said in al-Mufhim: ‘so that the Messenger <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> could go to the morning prayer early at its beginning time.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the scholars said: ‘So that the Messenger <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </i>could begin the prayer for the day with two light prayers, just as he would do for the night prayer.’ Therefore, praying them lightly is the Sunnah, and that is the clear truth.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Shawkaani said in ‘Nail Awtaar’:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Hadeeth indicates to the legislation of praying it lightly (i.e. not lengthening it).  This was the opinion of the majority of the scholars, the Hanafeeyah opposed them and said that it is recommended to lengthen the recitation.  This opposes the clear evidence.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>3 &#8211; What the Messenger </b><b><i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i></b><b> would Recite in the Two Rakah for the Sunnah of the Fajr Prayer</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a) From Ibn Umar that the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> used to recite in the two Rakat for Fajr, and two Rakat after Maghrib prayer: &lt;&lt;Say to these O<i> Al-Kafiroon </i>&gt;&gt;[8]  &amp; &lt;&lt;Say: He is Allaah, (the) One.&gt;&gt;[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b) From Ayesha who said: ‘the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> used to pray four Rakat before Dhuhr, and two Rakat before Fajr and would not leave them, and she said: and he would say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Two blessed Soorahs which are read in the two Rakat before Fajr: &lt;&lt; Say to these O<i> Al-Kafiroon </i>&gt;&gt;[10]  &amp; &lt;&lt;Say: He is Allaah, (the) One.&gt;&gt;’[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">c) From Ibn Umar <i>&#8211; Radi Allaahu anhu –</i> that the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i><b> </b>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> ‘&lt;&lt;Say: He is Allaah, (the) One.&gt;&gt; is equivalent to a third of the Qur’aan, and &lt;&lt;Say to these O<i> Al-Kafiroon </i>&gt;&gt; is equivalent to a fourth of the Qur’aan, and he would read both of them in the two Rakat of Fajr . . .’[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">d) From the Hadeeth of Abu Hurairah <i>&#8211; Radi Allaahu anhu –</i> that the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i><b> </b>read:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Say to these O<i> Al-Kafiroon </i>&gt;&gt;[13]  &amp; &lt;&lt;Say: He is Allaah, (the) One.&gt;&gt;[14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">in the two Rakah of the Fajr prayer.’ (i.e. the Sunnah of Fajr).[15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">e) From Abul-Gayth from Abu Hurairah that he heard the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> recite in the two Rakah of Fajr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Say: We believe in Allaah and in what has been sent down to us, &gt;&gt; [3:84] in the first Rakah, and in the other Rakah with this Ayaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Our Lord! We believe in what You have sent down, and we follow the Messenger [&#8216;Iesa (Jesus)]; so write us down among those who bear witness (to the truth i.e. <i>La ilaha ill-Allaah </i>&#8211; none has the right to be worshipped but Allaah). &gt;&gt; [3:53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">or:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Verily, We have sent you with the truth (Islaam), a bringer of glad tidings (for those who believe in what you brought, that they will enter Paradise) and a warner (for those who disbelieve in what you brought, they will enter the Hell-fire).<b> </b>And you will not be asked about the dwellers of the blazing Fire.&gt;&gt; [2: 119][16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Atheem-a-Baadi said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘What is established from these Ahadeeth is that the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> sometimes would recite &lt;&lt; Say to these O<i> Al-Kafiroon </i>&gt;&gt; in the first Rakah, and &lt;&lt;Say: He is Allaah, (the) One.&gt;&gt; in the second Rakah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And sometimes he would read in the first of the two Rakah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Say: We believe in Allaah and that which has been sent down to us and that which has been sent down to Ibraheem, Isma’eel, Ishaaq, Ya’qoob, and to <i>Al-Asbaat </i>[the twelve sons of Ya’qoob], and that which has been given to Moosa and ‘Iesa, and that which has been given to the Prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we have submitted (in Islaam). &gt;&gt; [2:136]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and in the second of the two Rakah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Then when ‘Iesa came to know of their disbelief, he said: ‘Who will be my helpers in Allaah’s Cause?’ <i>Al-Hawarioon</i> (the disciples) said: ‘We are the helpers of Allaah; we believe in Allaah, and bear witness that we are Muslims (i.e. we submit to Allaah).’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Lord! We believe in what You have sent down, and we follow the Messenger [&#8216;Iesa (Jesus)]; so write us down among those who bear witness (to the truth i.e. <i>Lâ ilâha ill-Allâh </i>&#8211; none has the right to be worshipped but Allâh). &gt;&gt; [3:52-53].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And sometimes recite in the first of the two Rakah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Say: We believe in Allaah and in what has been sent down to us, &gt;&gt; [2:136]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and in the second of the two Rakah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Say: ‘O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians): Come to a word that is just between us and you, that we worship none but Allaah, and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take others as lords besides Allaah. Then, if they turn away, say: ‘Bear witness that we are Muslims.’&gt;&gt; [3:64].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And sometimes he would recite in the first of the two Rakah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Say: ‘We believe in Allaah and in what has been sent down to us, and what was sent down to Ibraheem, Isma’eel, Ishaaq, Ya’qoob and <i>Al-Asbaat </i>[the twelve sons of Ya’qoob] and what was given to Moosa, &#8216;Iesa and the Prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between one another among them and to Him (Allaah) we have submitted (in Islaam).’&gt;&gt; [3:83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and in the second Rakah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Our Lord! We believe in what You have sent down, and we follow the Messenger [&#8216;Iesa (Jesus)]; so write us down among those who bear witness (to the truth i.e. <i>La ilaha ill-Allaah </i>&#8211; none has the right to be worshipped but Allaah). &gt;&gt; [3:53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">or with this Ayaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Verily, We have sent you with the truth (Islaam), a bringer of glad tidings (for those who believe in what you brought, that they will enter Paradise) and a warner (for those who disbelieve in what you brought, they will enter the Hell-fire).<b> </b>And you will not be asked about the dwellers of the blazing Fire.&gt;&gt; [2:119].’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>4 &#8211; Recommendation to Pray the Two R</b><b>akah at Home</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Tayeeb al-Atheem-a-Baadi said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It is better to pray the two Rakah at home, because the optional pray at home is of a more complete status and has more reward than praying it in the Masjid.  This is affirmed from the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> from his actions and his statements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his actions, is that the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> used to pray them a lot of the time in his home, as has been mentioned in narrations from Ibn Umar, Ibn Abbas, Ayesha and others from the Companions. Actually it has not been affirmed that he performed them in the Masjid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his saying in the Hadeeth of Ibn Umar, as collected by Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawood, Tirmidhi, Nisa’ee and Ibn Majah that the Prophet<i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Perform some of your prayer in your homes, and do not take them as graves.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hadeeth of Jabir collected by Muslim, and Muhammad bin Nasr from Jabir <i>&#8211;</i><i>Radi Allaahu anhu</i><i>&#8211;</i> that he said, the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If one of you has completed the prayer in his Masjid, then he should make a portion of his prayer for the house, since indeed Allaah will place goodness in his home from his prayer.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Nawawi said in the explanation of Muslim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed one is encouraged to pray optional prayer in the home due to it being more hidden away, further away from showing off, more protective from being cancelled out and that the home can get blessings, and that mercy can descend in the home, and the Angels, and that the Shaytaan runs away.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>5 &#8211; Lying down on the Right Hand side after the Two Rakah Sunnah of the Fajr</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Tayeeb al-Atheem-a-Baadi said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It is the Sunnah to lie down on the right side after the Sunnah of the Fajr prayer, whether he performed Tahhajjud (the night prayer) or not, and this is the truth, and this has been narrated from the hadeeth of four people from the Companions of the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</i>, Ayesha, Abu Hurairah, Ibn Abbas and Abdullaah bin ‘Amr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hadeeth of Ayesha, collected by Bukhari that she said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> used to lie down on his right side after praying two Rakats [Sunnah] of Fajr.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, in Muslim from Ayesha the wife of the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> used to pray after finishing the Isha prayer, which the people call ‘al-‘Uttmah’ he would pray eleven Rakah till the Fajr prayer, he would give the Salaam between every two Rakah, and pray one Rakah Witr. And when the Muhaddin would finish from the call to the Fajr prayer, and it would be clear to the Messenger <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i>that it is Fajr time and the Muhaddin would come to the Messenger <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</i>, then he would pray a light two Rakah, then lie down on his right side, until the Muadhin would come to him <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> to make the call that prayer is established.’[17]</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Laying down after the Sunnah prayer for Fajr is not done in the masjid</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani commented on the Hadeeth of Aeysha <i>&#8211;</i><i>Radi Allaahu anha</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘&#8230;then lie down on his right side, until the Muadhin would come to him <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</i><i>.’</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This is a clear proof of the permissibility of laying down between the Sunnah of the Fajr prayer and the obligatory prayer, however, it is not known that anyone from the Companions did so in the Masjid, but rather some of them disliked and criticised this.  Therefore, it should be limited to what the Prophet did in his house as is his <i>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</i>Sunnah.’[18]</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><b>The Messenger </b><b><i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i></b><b> used to say or talk after the two Rakah Sunnah for Fajr</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been collected by Bukhari, Muslim and Abu Dawood from Ayesha who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> used to, once he had prayed the two Rakah of the Sunnah for the Fajr, he would talk to me if I were awake, otherwise he would lie down.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nawawi said in ‘al-Minhaaj Sharh Muslim bin al-Hajjaaj’:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘In this narration is the proof that it is permissible to talk after the Sunnah of the Fajr prayer.  This is our Madhab, and the Madhab of Malik and the majority of the scholars.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Qadi said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Koofeeyoon disliked it, and it is narrated from Ibn Mas’ood and some of the Salaf that this time between two Rakah of the Sunnah for the Fajr and the Fajr prayer is for seeking forgiveness. However, what is correct is that it is permissible due to the action of the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</i>. As for it being regarded as the recommended time for seeking forgiveness then that does not prevent the allowance to speak.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Qastallani said in ‘Irshaad as-Saari’:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘In this Hadeeth, is that there is no problem with permissible speech after the two Rakah Sunnah for the Fajr.  Ibn al-Arabi said: ‘There is no mention or narration of an excellence of remaining silent at the time, rather that is after the obligatory Morning Prayer until sunrise.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>6 &#8211; The Dislike of Praying the Optional Prayer once Fajr Time has come in, other than the Two Rakah Sunnah for the Fajr Prayer</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Taeeb al-Atheem-a-Baadi said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It is disliked to pray the optional prayer after Fajr time has come in, because the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> did not pray more than the two Rakah of the Sunnah even though he had great concern over the prayer.  Yet there is a prohibition from the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> against this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim and Nisa’ee narrated from Hafsah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If the Fajr time came in, the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </i>would not pray except for two light Rakahs.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>7 &#8211; The Dislike for the Worshipper to begin Praying Two Rakah Sunnah for the Fajr After the Muadhin began the Iqama for the prayer.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Taeeb al-Atheem-a-Baadi said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> ‘Know that it is disliked to perform the two Rakah of Sunnah for the Fajr after the Muadhin has begun the Iqama for the prayer, this is whther the worshipper is amongst the rows, or not in the row, whether he knows that he will catch the Rakah with the Imam or not.  This is what has been narrated from the Hadeeth of Abu Hurairah, Abdullaah bin Malik bin Buhaynah, Abdullaah bin Surjiss, Ibn Umar, Jabir, Ibn Abbas, Anas bin Muhammad, Zayed bin Thabit, Abu Musa and ‘Aeysha <i>&#8211;</i><i>Radi Allaahu anhum</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a) As for the Hadeeth of Abu Hurairah, collected by Muslim that the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If the prayer is established then there is no prayer except for the obligatory one.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b) Bukhari collected from Abdullaah bin Malik bin Buhaynah who said: The Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> passed by a man, and the prayer had just been established [the Iqama was called] while that man was praying two Rakah, after the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> finished, the people gathered around him, so the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Is the morning prayer four Rakahs? Is the morning prayer four Rakahs?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Taeeb al-Atheem-a-Baadi discusses the general times that prayer is prohibited: ‘Five types, the prohibition to pray after Fajr and Asr, at the time of sunrise, at sunset, and when the sun has reached its highest point, and every one of these types has exceptions. So we say: from the specific times out of the general times is the Hadeeth of Abu Hurairah which was collected by Bukhari in the ‘Chapter: Whoever catches one Rakah from the Asr prayer before sunset.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari narrates from Yahya from Salmah from Abu Hurairah who said: The Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If one of you catches a Sajdah from the Asr prayer before the sunsets, then he should complete his prayer.  If one of you catches a Sajdah from the morning prayer before the sunrises then he should complete his prayer.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nawawi said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This is a clear evidence that whoever caught and prayed a Rakah of the morning or Asr prayer, and then the prayer time finished before he gave Salam then his prayer is not null and void, rather he should complete it, and his prayer is correct.  There is a consensus about this point regarding the Asr prayer, as for the morning prayer, then Malik, Shaafi’ee, Ahmad and all the scholars accept it except Abu Hanifah <i>-Rahimullaah</i>, since he says that the morning prayer is void due to sunrise, because the time where Salat is prohibited has entered, and this is in contrast to sunset, but the Hadeeth is an evidence against him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Taeeb al-Atheem-a-Baadi also mentions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘From those specific matters for the general prohibition is the Ahadeeth of Anas, Abu Hurairah and Abu Qatadah. As for the Hadeeth of Anas, then that has been collected by the six Imams [Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawood, Tirmidhi, Nisa’ee and Ibn Majah] and Darmi from Anas from the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever forgets a prayer then he should pray it when he remembers, there is no expiation for the missed prayer except to pray it. &lt;&lt; and perform the Salat for My remembrance&gt;&gt; [Taha: 14]’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>8 &#8211; Praying two Rakah Sunnah for the Fajr Prayer after the Obligatory Prayer if You Cannot Pray Before it</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Bazmool said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">‘<b>Whoever misses the two Rakah [Sunnah] of the Fajr prayer</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is legislated for the person who misses the two Rakah of Fajr, that he can then pray them directly after the obligatory prayer or after the sun has risen, and what is better is to pray them after the sun has risen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Abu Hurairah<i> &#8211;</i><i>Radi Allaahu anhu</i><i>&#8211;</i> who said the Messenger of Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever did not pray the two Rakah [Sunnah] of Fajr; then he should pray them after the sun has risen.’[19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I [Bazmool] say: ‘The apparent meaning of the Hadeeth indicates that the Sunnah of Salat al-Fajr is obligatory to be prayed after the sun has risen if you had missed this Sunnah prayer, however, this verdict is shifted to a recommended act due to the proof from the following Hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Qays bin Qahd <i>&#8211;</i><i>Radi Allaahu anhu</i><i>&#8211;</i> that he prayed the Morning Prayer along with the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</i>, but he had not prayed the two Rakah for the Sunnah of the Fajr prayer.  So when the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> gave the Salam from the prayer, Qays gave the Salam with him and then after that he stood and prayed two Rakah of the Sunnah for the Fajr, while the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> was watching him, and he <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i>did not criticize him for it.’ [20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hadeeth shows the permissibility of making up the Sunnah prayer of al-Fajr after the obligatory prayer for the person who had not prayed it before the obligatory prayer.’[21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

Al-Istiqaamah Issue Issue No.2 &#8211; Safar 1417H / July 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>INCREASING EEMAAN (FAITH)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[Q]</i></b>: <span style="color:#ff0000;"><i>Firstly</i></span>: I begin my question by seeking your advice that I may benefit from you with regards to how I may increase my <i> eemaan</i> (faith)?<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;"><i>Secondly</i></span>: I wish to learn about the religion, however Islaamic books are very rare in my country (Algeria), except some books which are with some brothers &#8211; may Allaah reward them with goodness.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;"><i>Thirdly</i></span>: I work as a builder and the people that I work with do not really have sound faith and their speech is nothing more than gossip and obscenities.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;"><i>Fourthly</i></span>: I keep company with a brother whose beliefs are corrupt and who constantly speaks ill of the righteous and believing brothers and I feel very distraught about this. So I hope that you will direct me to a cure for this disease.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[A]</i></b>: <span style="color:#993300;"><strong><i>Firstly</i></strong></span>: We advise you to recite the Qur&#8217;aan frequently and that you increase in your hearing of it and in your recitation of it. Reflect and consider its meaning to the best of your ability and what you do not understand of it, then ask the people of knowledge of your country about it, or write to those outside of your country from the Scholars of Sunnah (Prophetic guidance).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also advise you to increase in the <i> dhikr</i> (remembrance) of Allaah with such remembrances and supplications that are authentically related, such as saying <i>laa ilahaa ilallaah</i> (that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah), or saying <i>subhaanallaah</i> <i>wal-hamdulillaah wa laa ilaha ilallaahu wallaahu akbar</i> (declaring Allaah free from all imperfections, praising Him and declaring that none has the right to be worshipped except Him and that He is greater), and their like. For this purpose, we urge you to refer to books such as al <i>Kalimut-Tayyib</i> of Ibn Taymiyyah, al <i>Waabilus-Sayyib</i> of Ibn al-Qayyim, <i>Riyaadhus-Saaliheen</i> and <i> al-Adhkaar</i> both by Imaam an-Nawawee, and their like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because the remembrance of Allaah increases <i> eemaan</i> (faith) and causes hearts to attain tranquility, as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;Indeed in the remembrance of Allaah do hearts find tranquility.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ar-Ra&#8217;dd 13:28].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also preserve your five daily Prayers, your Fasting and the rest of your obligations &#8211; along with hoping in Allaah&#8217;s mercy and forgiveness and relying upon Him in all your affairs. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;The Believers ate only those who, when Allaah is mentioned, feel a fear in the hearts, and when His Verses are recited to them, it increases their <i>eemaan</i> (faith), and they put their trust and rely upon Allaah alone. They are those who perform the Prayer and spend out of that which We have given them, they are Believers in truth. For them ate grades of dignity and nobility with their Lord, and also forgiveness and generous provisions.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Anfaal 8:2-4].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><i>Secondly</i></strong></span>: Islaamic books are easily found in every Muslim country, especially in public libraries and bookshops. So the one who seeks after them will find them. We advise you to refer to the people of knowledge of the <i> Sharee&#8217;ah</i> (Prescribed Law of Allaah) so that they may direct you to suitable books for you to read, borrow or buy. If there are any problems regarding this, then it is not fitting for us to stop answering your questions from the Pure Revelation &#8211; and We ask Allaah that He makes us firm in that, and only His help is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;"><i>Thirdly</i>, <i>Fourthly</i>:</span> </strong>It is upon you to keep good company and to sit in righteous gatherings in order to benefit from them and their manners and their knowledge and that they may assist you in cultivating obedience to Allaah. So be careful and beware of bad companionship, and evil gathering. Beware, so that they may not influence you, adversely affecting your morals and manners, such that you fall into ill-repute, or that they weaken your resolve and determination in fulfilling your religious obligations and the obligations to your family. Indeed, the Prophet <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> advised the Ummah to sit in good gatherings, and he warned them from the evil and foul gatherings, and he gave a noble example about this, when he said: <i>&#8220;The example of a good companion and a bad companion is like that of a seller of musk, and the one who blows the blacksmith&#8217;s bellows. As for the seller of musk then either he will grant you some, or you buy some from him, or at the very least you enjoy a pleasant smell from him. As for the one who blows the blacksmith&#8217;s bellows, then either he will burn your clothes, or you will get an offensive smell from him.&#8221;</i> This was related by al-Bukhaaree (4/323), from Abu Moosaa al-Ash&#8217;aree <i> radiallaahu &#8216;anhu.</i> 1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>CONCERNING A WOMAN&#8217;S <i>MAHR</i> (DOWRY)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[Q]</i></b>: I and many others have observed that many people are very excessive when it comes to the matter of the <i> mahr</i> (wedding dowry that is paid to the bride), and that they seek great amounts of <i> mahr</i> when it comes to the marriage of their daughters, and they stipulate as a condition the giving of other gifts to them, along with the <i> mahr</i>. This wealth that people demand in such cases, is it <i> halaal</i> (lawful) or <i> haraam</i> (unlawful)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: What is prescribed in the <i> Sharee&#8217;ah</i> is that the <i> mahr</i> should be a small amount and that people should not compete with each other in this regard, acting in accordance with the many <i> ahaadeeth</i> which are related about this. They should also help facilitate marriages and be keen in preserving the modesty and decency of the young Muslim men and women. And it is not permissible for the <i>awliyaa</i> (guardians of the brides-to-be) to demand and stipulate gifts for themselves, since they have no right at all in this matter. Rather the right belongs to the woman, and in some particular cases to the father. He may stipulate a condition as long as it does not harm the daughter, nor lead to the delaying of the marriage. However, if the father forgoes such a right then this is better and more preferable. Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects &#8211; says:<b> &#8220;And marry those amongst you who are single and also marry the pious of your male and female slaves. If they be poor, Allaah will enrich them out of His Bounty.&#8221; </b>[Soorah an-Noor 24:32].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the <i> hadeeth</i> of &#8216;Uqbah ibn &#8216;Aamir <i> radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i>, the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> &#8220;The best dowry is that which is easy.&#8221;</i> This was narrated by Abu Daawood and al-Haakim who authenticated it. And once a woman offered herself to the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> for marriage. However, one of his Companions desired to marry her, so the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said [regarding the <i>mahr</i>]: <i>&#8220;Bring something, even if it be an iron ring.&#8221;</i> So when he could not find even this, the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> married them for the dowry that the man would teach whatever of the Qur&#8217;aan he knew to her. 2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the dowry of the Prophet <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s</i> wives was five-hundred dirhams, which is equivalent to one-hundred and thirty riyaals today. And his daughters were married for the <i> mahr</i> of four-hundred dinaars, which is equivalent to one-hundred riyaals today. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a most beautiful example to follow.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:21].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whenever the difficulties relating to marriage are lightened, then preserving the modesty and decency of young men and women becomes easier, shameful and evil deeds decrease, and the Ummah &#8211; as a result &#8211; will increase in number. However if this matter is made difficult, and people continue competing with each other with regards to the <i> mahr</i> (dowry), then the number of marriages will decrease, fornication will become more widespread and more young men and women will remain unmarried &#8211; except those whom Allaah saves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So my sincere advice to all the Muslims, wherever they may be, is to facilitate the marriage process and to cooperate in this and make it easy. They should turn away from demanding excessive <i> mahr</i> and avoid unnecessary hardships and difficulties in the <i>waleemah</i> (wedding-feast). Rather, they should content themselves with a <i> waleemah</i> that is according to the <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i>, in which the burdens and difficulties for the husband and wife are minimal. May Allaah improve and rectify all the affairs of the Muslims and may He give them the guidance and ability to cling to the <i> Sunnah</i> (Prophetic guidance) in all matters. 3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>IMPURITIES UPON ONE&#8217;S CLOTHING WHILST PRAYING</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[Q]</i></b>: If a person finds some impurity upon his clothes after he has finished praying in it, does the Prayer have to be prayed again?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[A]</i></b>: Whosoever prays, and is unaware that there are impurities upon his body or his clothes during the Prayer, but only realises after he has completed it, then his Prayer will be deemed as correct, according to the most correct position of the Scholars. Similarly, if he was aware of such impurities before the Prayer, but then forgot about this at the time of praying and did not remember except after the Prayer, then his Prayer likewise will be correct. Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic said: <b> &#8220;Our Lord! Do not take us to task if we forget or fall into error.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:286]. It has been authentically related about Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, that one day he <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> led the people in Prayer, wearing his shoes. Then the angel Jibreel came to him during the Prayer and informed him that there was some dirt on his shoes. So the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> removed them and continued with his Prayer and he did not repeat the Prayer.4 This is part of the ease which Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects &#8211; has given to His servants out of His Mercy for them. However, if a person forgets that he had passed wind, then prays in that state, he must &#8211; by <i> ijmaa&#8217;</i> (consensus) of the Scholars &#8211; repeat his prayer again, when he remembers. This is due to the saying of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>: <i> &#8220;The Prayer will not be accepted without purification nor will charity be accepted from wealth that is unlawful.&#8221;</i> This has been related by Muslim in his <i> Saheeh</i> (1/140) and the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s</i> saying: <i> &#8220;The Prayer of any one of you who has released wind will not be accepted, until he makes wudhoo (ablution).&#8221;</i> Related by al-Bukhaaree and Muslim. 5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>SLAUGHTERING FOR OTHER THAN ALLAAH</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[Q]</i></b>: The slaughtering of sheep and other such animals at the graves of the pious people, for their sake and in order to please and draw closer to them, is a custom amongst my family. I have tried to prevent them from doing so, but it has only made them more resolute in doing so. I have said to them that this is shirk (associating partners in the worship) of Allaah. But they respond by saying: We only worship Allaah the way He deserves to be worshipped. However, we visit the graves of the <i>awliyaa</i> (the pious friends of Allaah) and supplicate to Allaah, through the right of the pious people, so that harm and difficulties may be averted from us. I have said to them that this is not from the religion, but they just tell me to leave them alone upon what they are doing. So what do you suggest should be the cure for such people, and what do you suggest I do to counter act this <i> bid&#8217;ah</i> (innovation)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i></i></b><b><i>[A]</i></b>: It is known from the evidences related in the Qur&#8217;aan and the <i> Sunnah</i> that sacrificing for other than Allaah, in order to draw close to other than Allaah &#8211; whether sacrificing for the <i>jinns</i>, <i>awliyaa</i>, idols or other than that from the creation &#8211; is an act of shirk and is an act of <i>jaahiliyyah</i> (pre-Islaamic ignorance) that was practiced by the <i>mushriks</i> (those who worshipped the pious men, <i>jinns</i>, angels, stones, statues, etc, along with worshipping Allaah). Allaah- the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;Say: Indeed my Prayer, my sacrifce, my living and my dying are all for Allaah Lord of the worlds. No partner do I setup with Him in this, and this is what I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:162]. So Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; clearly explains in this verse that sacrificing to other than Allaah is like praying to other than Him. And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;Indeed We have granted to the Prophet sallallaabu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam the Kawthar (a river in Paradise whose banks are lined with tents made from hollow pearls). Therefore turn in Prayer to your Lord and sacrifice to Him alone.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Kawthar 108:1-2]. So Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects &#8211; commanded His Prophet in these noble verses that he should pray only to His Lord and that he should sacrifice to only Him, which was opposite of what the <i>mushriks</i> did, in that they used to prostrate to other than Allaah and to sacrifice to other than Him. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And your Lord has commanded that you worship none but Him.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Israa 17:23]. And He &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;And they have not been commanded except to worship Allaah alone making the religion purely and sincerely for Him.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Bayyinah 98:5]. And there are many other verses with the same meaning. So, since sacrificing is one of the acts of <i> &#8216;ibaadah</i> (worship), then it is obligatory to make this action purely and sincerely for Allaah alone, without directing it to other than Him. Also &#8216;Alee ibn Abee Taalib <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> said that the Prophet <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said:<i> &#8220;May Allaah curse the one who sacrifices to other than Allaah.&#8221;</i> This has been related by Muslim in his Saheeh (no.765).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for supplicating to Allaah and asking Him by the right of the <i> awliyaa</i> or by the right of His Messenger, or by the status of His Messenger &#8211; then this does not constitute shirk, but rather it is a <i> bid&#8217;ah</i> (innovation) which leads to shirk, in the opinion of the majority of Scholars. This is because <i>du&#8217;aa</i> (supplication) is an act of worship, and how it is to be done can only be known from the Revelation. And there is nothing authentically established from our Prophet <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> to show the permissibility or validity of this type of <i> tawassul</i> (seeking the means of nearness to Allaah by invoking an intermediary) in which Allaah is asked through the right of His Prophet or the right of the <i> awliyaa</i> or any of His creation. So it is not permissible for any Muslim to innovate new forms of <i> tawassul</i> which has not been prescribed by Allaah, as He &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:<b> &#8220;Or do they have partners with Allaah who prescribe for them a religion which Allaah has not prescribed.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ash-Shooraa 42:21]. And the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> &#8220;Whosoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it, will be rejected&#8221;</i>, and in another authentic narration: <i> &#8220;Whosoever does an action that I have not commanded, it will be rejected.&#8221;</i> 7 And the meaning of this is that such innovated actions will be rejected and not accepted from its doer. Thus it is obligatory for the Muslims to restrict themselves to only what Allaah has prescribed and to beware of what people have innovated into the religion. As regards the prescribed forms of <i>tawassul</i> then they are: <i>tawassul</i> (seeking the means of nearness to Allaah) through His Names and His Attributes and by righteous actions, and by one&#8217;s <i>eemaan</i> (faith) in Allaah and His Messenger, and other righteous and prescribed actions similar to this. 9</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Author:Imaam Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee<br>
Source:Qiyaam Ramadaan (pg. 28-30)<br>
Translator:isma&#8217;eel alarcon (for al-manhaj.com)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I spoke in detail about this subject in my book <i>Salaat at-Taraaweeh</i> (pg. 101-115), so I felt that I should abridge that discussion here in order to make it easy for the reader and to remind him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The First Manner: </b> consists of thirteen rak&#8217;aat, which is commenced with two short rak&#8217;aat. According to the most correct opinion, these are the two rak&#8217;aat of Sunnah prayer offered after &#8216;Ishaa, or they are two specific rak&#8217;aat by which one begins the Night Prayer, as has been stated previously. Then one prays two very long rak&#8217;aat (after that). Then two more rak&#8217;aat are prayed, and then another two rak&#8217;aat are prayed. Then two more rak&#8217;aat are prayed and another set of two rak&#8217;aat are prayed. Then witr is made with one rak&#8217;ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Second Manner: </b> consists of thirteen rak&#8217;aat. There are eight rak&#8217;aat within them, in which one makes <i>tasleem</i> after every two rak&#8217;aat. Then witr is made with five rak&#8217;aat and one does not sit nor make the <i>tasleem</i> except in the fifth rak&#8217;ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Third Manner: </b> consists of eleven rak&#8217;aat, in which one makes <i>tasleem</i> after every two rak&#8217;aat and then prays witr at the end with one rak&#8217;ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Fourth Manner: </b> consists of eleven rak&#8217;aat, in which one prays four rak&#8217;aat and makes one <i>tasleem</i> after the four. The he prays another four in a similar manner and ends it with three rak&#8217;aat (for witr).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Would the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) remain in the sitting position after every two rak&#8217;aat, when praying a unit of four rak&#8217;aat or a unit of three rak&#8217;aat? We do not find a clear answer for this, but remaining in the sitting position (for <i>tashahhud</i>) while doing a unit of three rak&#8217;aat is not legislated (in the Religion)!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Fifth Manner: </b> consists of eleven rak&#8217;aat, in which one prays eight rak&#8217;aat and does not sit in any of them except for the eighth rak&#8217;ah. While sitting (in the eighth rak&#8217;ah), he makes the <i>tashahhud</i> and sends Salaat on the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) and then stands up again without making the <i>tasleem</i>. Then he makes witr with one rak&#8217;ah and when finished, he makes the <i>tasleem</i>. This consists of nine rak&#8217;aat. Then he prays two rak&#8217;aat after that while in the sitting position.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Sixth Manner: </b> One prays nine rak&#8217;aat, in which he does not sit except after the sixth rak&#8217;ah. Then he makes the <i>tashahhud</i> and sends Salaat on the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) and then stands again without making the <i>tasleem</i>. Then he makes witr with three rak&#8217;aat and when finished, he makes the <i>tasleem</i>, etc. (the rest is the same as the previous manner)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the manners in which it is reported that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) performed the Night Prayer. It is possible to add other types of manners to it, by subtracting what one wishes from each set of rak&#8217;aat until he cuts it down to one rak&#8217;ah, acting on the previously mentioned hadeeth of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam): <b> &#8220;So whoever wishes, then let him pray witr with five rak&#8217;aat, and whoever wishes, then let him pray witr with three rak&#8217;aat, and whoever wishes, then let him pray witr with one rak&#8217;ah.&#8221; </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if one wants, he can pray these five rak&#8217;aat or three rak&#8217;aat with one sitting and one <i>tasleem</i>, as is stated in the Second Manner. And if he wants, he can make <i>tasleem</i> after every two rak&#8217;aat, as is stated in the Third Manner, and this is preferred.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for praying the set of five rak&#8217;aat or three rak&#8217;aat by sitting after every two rak&#8217;aat and not making the <i>tasleem</i>, then we did not find any authentic report that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) used to do this. The <i>asl</i> (foundation) is that it is permissible, but since the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) forbade us from praying witr with three rak&#8217;aat indicating the reason for that by saying: <b> &#8220;And do not liken it to the Maghrib prayer.&#8221; </b> [1] So then anyone that prays the witr in three rak&#8217;aat must not liken it to the Maghrib prayer. This can be done in two ways:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Making the <i>tasleem</i> between the even and odd number rak&#8217;ah (i.e. between the second and the third rak&#8217;ah). This is what is more strong and preferred.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. One does not sit between the even and odd number (i.e. he prays three rak&#8217;aat straight with one <i>tasleem</i>), and Allaah knows best.</p>

	<div class="entry-content th-content">
		<p style="text-align:justify;">See <em>Fataawa Arkaan al-Islam</em> by Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy o­n him), p. 398; <em>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah</em>, 8/300-316).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Eid prayer is o­ne where the imam attends and leads the people in praying two rak’ahs. ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “The prayer of al-Fitr is two rak’ahs and the prayer of al-Adha is two rak’ahs, complete and not shortened, o­n the tongue of your Prophet, and the o­ne who fabricates lies is doomed.” Narrated by al-Nasaa’i, 1420 and Ibn Khuzaymah. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <em>Saheeh al-Nasaa’i</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was narrated that Abu Sa’eed said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to come out o­n the day of al-Fitr and al-Adha to the prayer place, and the first thing he would do was to offer the prayer. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 956</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In the first rak’ah he should say Takbeerat al-ihraam (say “Allaahu akbar” to start the prayer), after which he should say six or seven more takbeers, because of the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), “The takbeer of al-Fitr and al-Adha is seven takbeers in the first rak’ah and five takbeers in the second, apart from the takbeer of rukoo’.” Narrated by Abu Dawood and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <em>Irwa’ al-Ghaleel</em>, 639. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he should recite al-Faatihah, and recite Soorat Qaf in the first rak’ah. In the second rak’ah he should stand up saying takbeer, and when he has stood up completely he should say takbeer five times, and recite Soorat al-Faatihah then Soorat al-Qamr. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to recite these two soorahs during the two Eids. Or if he wishes he can recite Soorat al-A’la in the first rak’ah and Soorat al-Ghaashiyah in the second, because it was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to recite al-A’la and al-Ghaashiyah in the Eid prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The imam should revive the Sunnah be reciting these soorahs so that the Muslims will become familiar with the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the prayer, the imam should address the people. Part of the khutbah should be addressed specifically to the women, telling them of the things that they should do and warning them against the things that they should avoid, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to do.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">The fifth question of Fatwa no. 9527<br>
Q 5: <span style="color:#993300;">How many Rak‘ahs (units of Prayer) are there in Salat-ul-Khusuf (Prayer on a lunar eclipse)? And what is to be recited in them?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">A: Salat-ul-Kusuf (Prayer on a solar eclipse) and Salat-ul-Khusuf (Prayer on a lunar eclipse) are each comprised of two Rak‘ahs (units of Prayer). Recitation in both Salahs (Prayers) is performed out loud. <strong>In each Rak‘ah, there are two Ruku‘s (bowing), the second of which is always shorter than the first, and there are also two recitations</strong>. After the Takbirat-ul-Ihram (saying: &#8220;Allahu Akbar [Allah is the Greatest]&#8221; upon starting Prayer), Surah Al-Fatihah and a long Surah are recited. After the first Ruku‘, Surah Al-Fatihah and a long Surah are recited, which is shorter than the preceding recitation. There are two Sujuds (Prostrations) in each Rak‘ah. This is the most authentic report mentioned regarding this Salah.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>How should Salat-ul-Kusuf be done? </strong><span style="color:#888888;">Fatwas of Ibn Baz &#8211; <a title="Salat-ul-Kusuf (Eclipse Prayer)" href="http://www.alifta.net/fatawa/fatawaDetails.aspx?View=Page&PageID=2223&PageNo=1&BookID=14" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span style="color:#888888;">alifta.net</span></a></span><strong><br>
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: How should Salat-ul-Kusuf (Prayer on a solar eclipse) and Salat-ul-Khusuf (Prayer on a lunar eclipse) be performed? Is there any difference between them? What is your opinion on the reports published by the papers about the timings of a solar or lunar eclipse?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: There are authentic Hadith in which the Prophet (peace be upon him) showed how Salat-ul-Kusuf can be performed. He (peace be upon him) ordered that people should be called to it by announcing<strong> as-salatu jami&#8217;ah &#8220;&#8216;Gather for Salah&#8221;.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most authentic reports concerning this Salah show that it consists of<strong> two Rak&#8217;ahs</strong> and that in <strong>each Rak&#8217;ah one should make two recitations and perform two Ruku&#8217; (bowings) and two Sujud (prostrations)</strong>. The person should make lengthy recitation, Ruku&#8217; and Sujud. The first recital and Ruku&#8217; should be longer than the second ones. Similarly, the recitation in the second Rak`ah should be shorter than the second recital in the first Rak`ah. The person should make Ruku&#8217; in the second Rak`ah for a shorter time than the two Ruku&#8217; in the first one. During the second Rak`ah, the person should make a second recital and Ruku&#8217; for a shorter time than the first in the same Rak`ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the two Sujud, it is a Sunnah (recommended) to be lengthy providing that this does not cause any difficulty to the Ma&#8217;mums because this was the Prophet&#8217;s (peace be upon him) way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Upon completing Salah, the Imam, if he is knowledgeable, is allowed to give a <strong>sermon</strong> and tell people that the solar and lunar eclipse are two signs of Allah (Exalted be He) by which He frightens His servants. The Muslims, upon seeing it, are prescribed to offer Salah, remember Allah (Exalted be He), make Du`a&#8217; and Takbir, give in charity and emancipate a believing slave until the end of the eclipse. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, <span style="color:#339966;">&lt;&lt;Verily the sun and the moon are two signs among the signs of Allah by which He frightens His servants and they do not eclipse on account of the death or birth of anybody&gt;&gt;</span>. So when you see either of them, observe Prayer, and supplicate Allah (may He be Exalted) till it is cleared from you. Another narration reads, &lt;&lt;<span style="color:#339966;">So whenever you see them, haste to remember Allah, invoke Him and ask Him for forgiveness</span>.&gt;&gt; It is narrated in some Hadith that the person should give in charity and emancipate slaves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">The astronomical reports about the timing of the eclipse must not be taken as the basis for offering Salat-ul-Kusuf</span>. Some people of knowledge, including Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and his knowledgeable disciple Ibn Al-Qayyim, may Allah be merciful with both of them, supported this view saying that the astronomers may sometimes be wrong and then these reports are not reliable and people should not offer Salat-ul-Kusuf depending on them. Rather, they have to offer the Salah upon seeing the eclipse when it is happening.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The publications of the astronomers&#8217; reports about the timing of eclipse should be banned by the Ministry of Information lest some people should be deceived by them. These publications may make people feel less fear upon seeing the eclipse. Allah (Exalted be He) has made them to be frightening and hence, people remember, fear, invoke Allah, and treat their slaves well. May Allah grant us success!</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Eclipse Prayer can be done individually or in congregation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Do we have to pray Salaatul Khusoof (eclipse prayer) even if we do not witness it? And are there any specific ad&#8217;iyah (pl. duâaa) that we have to say in the day or during the eclipse?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer: The Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم said: &#8220;The sun and the moon are two signs from the signs of Allaah. They do not eclipse for the death of anyone neither their life (i.e. birth). Allaah uses these to strike fear into His slaves. So when you see them offer the prayer and supplicate until the eclipse passes away.&#8221;[1] If someone establishes that an eclipse is present then he should pray the Eclipse Prayer (Salaatul Khusoof), whether he has to pray it individually or in congregation and similarly whether it is a man or a woman. It is performed as described in the Shareeâah (Legislation).</p>
