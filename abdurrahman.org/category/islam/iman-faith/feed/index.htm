<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>v. Reading the Life-Histories of the Salaf of this Ummah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Salaf of this ummah: the Companions of the Prophet &#8211; <em>sallallahu alaihe wa-sallam</em> &#8211; and their students and successors in righteousness, people of the first period of Islaam, are the best of all generations. They are the defenders of Islaam, guides for humankind and lions of combat. They are the participants of the great and momentous incidents and events and the bearers and transmitters of this religion to all who came after them. They have the strongest eemaan amongst the people, they are the most well grounded in knowledge, have the most pious of hearts and the purest of souls. The specifically chosen amongst them are the Companions of the Prophet &#8211; <em>sallallahu alaihe wa-sallam</em> -, whom Allaah favored with the sight of His Prophet &#8211; <em>sallallahu alaihe wa-sallam</em> -. He gratified them by granting them sight of his guise and honored them by allowing them to hear his voice and listen to his speech. They received the religion from him in a fresh and new manner, it took root in their hearts, their souls found tranquility with it and they remained firm on it on par with the stability of the mountains. It suffices as a representation of their excellence that Allaah addressed them with His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;You are the best people ever raised up for mankind&#8230;&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan (3): 110]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of which is, you are the best of all peoples and the most beneficial for the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Saheeh Muslim, Aboo Hurayrah, may Allaah be pleased with him, reports that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; <em>sallallahu alaihe wa-sallam</em> &#8211; said: <i>&#8220;The best of my ummah, is the generation that I have been sent in, then those who proceed after them &#8230;&#8221;</i>[Muslim, 4/1964. It is also related in both Saheehs by &#8216;Imraan ibn Husayn with the following wording: <i>&#8216;The best of my ummah is my generation, then those who proceed them&#8230;&#8217; </i>al-Bukhaaree, (7/3 Fath) and Muslim, 4/1964]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One who studies the condition of these righteous people, reads their biographies, perceives their sublime qualities and virtues and reflects on what they were upon, such as the tremendous character and mannerisms they had; their adherence to the noble Messenger &#8211; <em>sallallahu alaihe wa-sallam</em> -; their preservation over eemaan, fear of sins and disobedience; wariness of riyaa&#8217; and hypocrisy; their responsiveness to obedience; vying in performance of good deeds; their aversion to this transitory world and dedication to the everlasting Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One who does this, will come across during this contemplation and study, a number of fine qualities and numerous characteristics and attributes that attract him towards a truthful impersonation of them and a desire to adorn oneself with their qualities. Mention of them, reminds of Allaah and contemplation over their condition, strengthens eemaan and cleanses the heart. Fine indeed, is the verse of poetry:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Relate again their tale to me, 0 caravan leader for their tale polishes the very thirsty heart.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The areas for the study and refection on the biographies of these righteous people are the books of Taareekh (History), as-Siyar (Biographies), az-Zuhd (asceticism), or-Raqaa&#8217;iq (heart-softening narratives), al-War&#8217; (piety) and others. One benefits from those of the reports that have been authenticated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This contemplation and study produces fine imitation of them as Shaykh al-Islaam writes: <strong>&#8220;Whoever resembles them more, it will be a greater perfection in himself.&#8221;</strong> Furthermore, whoever resembles a people, becomes one of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of these aforementioned issues increase eemaan and strengthen it. They are issues that are classified under the beneficial knowledge derived from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger &#8211; <em>sallallahu alaihe wa-sallam</em> &#8211; and that which the Salaf of this ummah were upon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>The World and its Allurements</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the second external factor, which bears effect on a person&#8217;s eemaan by decreasing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, one of the causes of the decrease and weakness of eemaan is to be engrossed with the transient things of this temporary worldly life; to occupy one&#8217;s time with it; be devoted to seeking it and to race after its pleasures, temptations and seductions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever the servants longing for this world intensifies and his heart becomes attached to it, his obedience will weaken and his eemaan will decrease accordingly. Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy upon him, says: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;The extent of the servants desire for the world and of his pleasure with it determines his slackness towards obedience of Allaah and seeking the Hereafter.&#8221;</strong></span> [al-Fawaa&#8217;id, pg. 180]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, Allaah, the Wise, the All-Aware, censured the world in His Book and made clear its vileness and wretchedness in many aayaat in the Noble Qur&#8217;aan, Allaah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">اعْلَمُوا أَنَّمَا الْحَيَاةُ الدُّنْيَا لَعِبٌ وَلَهْوٌ وَزِينَةٌ وَتَفَاخُرٌ بَيْنَكُمْ وَتَكَاثُرٌ فِي الْأَمْوَالِ وَالْأَوْلَادِ ۖ كَمَثَلِ غَيْثٍ أَعْجَبَ الْكُفَّارَ نَبَاتُهُ ثُمَّ يَهِيجُ فَتَرَاهُ مُصْفَرًّا ثُمَّ يَكُونُ حُطَامًا ۖ وَفِي الْآخِرَةِ عَذَابٌ شَدِيدٌ وَمَغْفِرَةٌ مِّنَ اللَّهِ وَرِضْوَانٌ ۚ وَمَا الْحَيَاةُ الدُّنْيَا إِلَّا مَتَاعُ الْغُرُورِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Know that the life of this world is only play and amusement, pomp and mutual boasting among you, and rivalry in respect of wealth and children, just like the vegetation after rain, which pleases the tillers; afterwards it dries up and you see it turning yellow; then it becomes straw. But in the Hereafter there is a severe torment</b> (for the disbelievers, evil-doers)<b>, and there is forgiveness from Allaah and </b>(His)<b> Good Pleasure </b>(for the believers, good-doers)<b>, whereas the life of this world is only a deceiving enjoyment.&#8221;</b></span>[Soorah al-Hadeed (57):20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَاضْرِبْ لَهُم مَّثَلَ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا كَمَاءٍ أَنزَلْنَاهُ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ فَاخْتَلَطَ بِهِ نَبَاتُ الْأَرْضِ فَأَصْبَحَ هَشِيمًا تَذْرُوهُ الرِّيَاحُ ۗ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ مُّقْتَدِرًا الْمَالُ وَالْبَنُونَ زِينَةُ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا ۖ وَالْبَاقِيَاتُ الصَّالِحَاتُ خَيْرٌ عِندَ رَبِّكَ ثَوَابًا وَخَيْرٌ أَمَلًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And put forward to them the example of the life of this world, it is like the water </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(rain)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;">,which We send down from the sky. The vegetation of the earth mingles with it, and becomes fresh and green. But </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(later)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;"> it becomes dry and broken pieces, which the winds then scatter. And Allaah is Able to do everything. Wealth and children are the adornment of the life of this world. But the everlasting righteous deeds are better with your Lord, for rewards and better in respect of hope&#8221;</span></b>[Soorah al-Kahf (18):45-46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَفَرِحُوا بِالْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا وَمَا الْحَيَاةُ الدُّنْيَا فِي الْآخِرَةِ إِلَّا مَتَاعٌ &#8230;</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;&#8230; and they rejoice in the life of the world, whereas the life of this world as compared with the Hereafter is but a brief passing enjoyment&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah ar-Ra&#8217;d (13):26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ لَا يَرْجُونَ لِقَاءَنَا وَرَضُوا بِالْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا وَاطْمَأَنُّوا بِهَا وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ عَنْ آيَاتِنَا غَافِلُونَ أُولَٰئِكَ مَأْوَاهُمُ النَّارُ بِمَا كَانُوا يَكْسِبُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Verily, those who hope not for their meeting with Us, but are pleased and satisfied with the life of the present world, and those who are heedless of Our Aayaat </b>(proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.)<b>. Those, their abode will be the Fire, because of what they used to earn.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah Yoonus (10):7-8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This contains the greatest warning to one who is pleased with the life of this world, is comforted by it, is heedless of the aayaat of Allaah and who does not hope to meet Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, Allaah says in censuring those of the believers who are pleased with this world:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا مَا لَكُمْ إِذَا قِيلَ لَكُمُ انفِرُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ اثَّاقَلْتُمْ إِلَى الْأَرْضِ ۚ أَرَضِيتُم بِالْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا مِنَ الْآخِرَةِ ۚ فَمَا مَتَاعُ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا فِي الْآخِرَةِ إِلَّا قَلِيلٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;O you who believe! What is the matter with you, that when you are asked to march forth in the Cause of Allaah </b>(i.e., Jihaad)<b> you cling heavily to the earth? Are you pleased with the life of this world rather than the Hereafter? But little is the enjoyment of the life of this world as compared with the Hereafter.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah at-Tawbah (9):38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;By Allaah, it is not poverty that I fear for you, but l fear that the world will be spread out for you just as it was spread out for those before you and then you will compete for it just as they competed for it and then you will be destroyed just as they were destroyed.&#8221; </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hadeeth is agreed upon [i.e., both al-Bukhaaree and Muslim relate it. [t]. Al-Bukhaaree, (6/258, 7/320 Fath) and Muslim, 4/2273 from the hadeeth of &#8216;Amr Ibn &#8216;Awf, may Allaah be pleased with him]. In another wording of theirs, <i>&#8220;… you will be distracted just as they were distracted.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are other such texts, which are great in number. Thus, one who wants his eemaan to have growth, strength, safety from weakness and decrement must strive against his soul in distancing himself from this world, its temptations, seductions and distracting amusements, and what a multitude they are.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This can only be achieved and become true after considering two matters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The first:</strong></span> to consider and look at the world, its rapid termination, passing away and disappearance; its deficiency and vileness; the pains of competing against one another for it and coveting it and what this contains of agony, embitterment and adversity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The end of all that will be disappearance and discontinuance along with the regret and sorrow that follows on from it. Thus, its seeker can never be free of anxiety and worry before he attains it or even when he actually achieves it and he can never be free of grief and distress after it passes on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">The second:</span></strong> to consider and look at the Hereafter and its approach and arrival that is inevitable; its perpetuity and eternity; the glory of what it is within it of blessings and joy; the disparity between such things and what is in this world. It is as Allaah said:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَالْآخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ وَأَبْقَىٰ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Although the Hereafter is better and more lasting&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah al-A&#8217;laa (87):17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are blessings that are perfect and everlasting, whereas these (things of the world) are fantasies that are deficient, sporadic and transitory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one contemplates over these two matters and considers them and looks into them in a proper manner, this will direct him to prefer the Everlasting Hereafter to the transient world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The greatest aid for him in fulfilling this is to take a look at the state of Messenger and his biography as well as his Companions. The fact that they renounced the world, turned their hearts away from it and discarded it. They never accustomed themselves with it and instead deserted it. They never inclined towards it and they regarded it to be a prison and not a heaven and thus, abstained from it in a true manner and if they had desired it they would have acquired every loved thing and arrived at every cherished matter from it. Indeed, the keys to the treasures of the world were offered to the Prophet but he rejected them. The world also poured out to the Companions but they did not opt for it and did not exchange their portion of the Hereafter for the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They knew that the world was a crossing point and passageway not a place of dwelling and settling, that it was a place of transit (&#8216;<em>uboor</em>) and not a place of happiness (<em>suroor</em>) and that it was a summer cloud which will soon disperse and an apparition no sooner is it completed than is it on the brink of departure.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Allaah has said:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">أَفَرَأَيْتَ إِن مَّتَّعْنَاهُمْ سِنِينَ  ثُمَّ جَاءَهُم مَّا كَانُوا يُوعَدُونَ مَا أَغْنَىٰ عَنْهُم مَّا كَانُوا يُمَتَّعُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Tell Me, if We do let them enjoy for a number of years, then afterwards comes to them that </b>(punishment) <b>which they had been promised; all that with which they used to enjoy shall not avail them&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah ash-Shu&#8217;araa&#8217; (26):205-207]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَيَوْمَ يَحْشُرُهُمْ كَأَن لَّمْ يَلْبَثُوا إِلَّا سَاعَةً مِّنَ النَّهَارِ يَتَعَارَفُونَ بَيْنَهُمْ ۚ قَدْ خَسِرَ الَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا بِلِقَاءِ اللَّهِ وَمَا كَانُوا مُهْتَدِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;And on the Day when He shall gather </b>(resurrect)<b> them together, </b>(it will be as if)<b> they had not stayed </b>(in the life of this world and graves, etc.)<b> but an hour of a day. They will recognize each other.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah Yoonus (10):45]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَيَوْمَ تَقُومُ السَّاعَةُ يُقْسِمُ الْمُجْرِمُونَ مَا لَبِثُوا غَيْرَ سَاعَةٍ ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ كَانُوا يُؤْفَكُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;And on the Day that the Hour will be established, the <em>Mujrimoon</em> </b>(criminals, disbelievers, polytheists, sinners, etc.)<b> will swear that they stayed not but an hour…&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah ar-Room (30):55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is the one who is beseeched to aid us with eemaan and to protect us from trials and temptations, the apparent and hidden.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Reciting the Noble Qur&#8217;aan and Contemplating on it</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is one of the greatest branches of knowledge that can lead to the increase, stability and strengthening of eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has revealed His lucid Book to His servants as a source of guidance; mercy, light and glad tidings and as a remembrance for those who remember.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَهَٰذَا كِتَابٌ أَنزَلْنَاهُ مُبَارَكٌ مُّصَدِّقُ الَّذِي بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;And this is a blessed Book that We have sent down, confirming that which came before it.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam (6):92]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">وَهَٰذَا كِتَابٌ أَنزَلْنَاهُ مُبَارَكٌ فَاتَّبِعُوهُ وَاتَّقُوا لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;And this is a blessed Book that We have sent down, so follow it and fear </b>(Allaah)<b>, that you may receive mercy.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam (6):155]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَلَقَدْ جِئْنَاهُم بِكِتَابٍ فَصَّلْنَاهُ عَلَىٰ عِلْمٍ هُدًى وَرَحْمَةً لِّقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Certainly, we have brought to them a Book, which we have explained in detail, upon knowledge, as a guidance and a mercy to a people who believe.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah al-A&#8217;raaf (7):52]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَنَزَّلْنَا عَلَيْكَ الْكِتَابَ تِبْيَانًا لِّكُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةً وَبُشْرَىٰ لِلْمُسْلِمِينَ&#8230;</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;And We have sent down to you the Book, as a clarification of everything, a guidance, a mercy and as glad tidings for the Muslims&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah an-Nahl (16):89]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>كِتَابٌ أَنزَلْنَاهُ إِلَيْكَ مُبَارَكٌ لِّيَدَّبَّرُوا آيَاتِهِ وَلِيَتَذَكَّرَ أُولُو الْأَلْبَابِ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;<em>(This is a)</em> Book that We have sent down to you, full of blessings, so that they may ponder over its <em>aayaat</em>, and that those of understanding may remember.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah Saad (38):29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِنَّ هَٰذَا الْقُرْآنَ يَهْدِي لِلَّتِي هِيَ أَقْوَمُ وَيُبَشِّرُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ الَّذِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ الصَّالِحَاتِ أَنَّ لَهُمْ أَجْرًا كَبِيرًا</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Verily, this Qur&#8217;aan guides to that which is most just and right, and gives glad tidings to the believers who work righteous deeds, that they shall have a great reward.&#8221;</b> </span>[Soorah al-Israa (17):9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">وَنُنَزِّلُ مِنَ الْقُرْآنِ مَا هُوَ شِفَاءٌ وَرَحْمَةٌ لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ ۙ وَلَا يَزِيدُ الظَّالِمِينَ إِلَّا خَسَارًا</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;And We send down of the Qur&#8217;aan that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe, and it increases the oppressors in nothing but loss.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah al-Israa (17):82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَذِكْرَىٰ لِمَن كَانَ لَهُ قَلْبٌ أَوْ أَلْقَى السَّمْعَ وَهُوَ شَهِيدٌ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Verily, therein is indeed a reminder for him who has a heart or gives ear while he is heedful.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah Qaaf (50):37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These noble aayaat contain mention of the excellence of the Noble Qur&#8217;aan, the Book of the Lord of the Worlds. The fact that Allaah made it blessed and a guidance for the worlds. He placed within it a cure for illnesses, especially, the illnesses and diseases of misconceptions and desires of the heart. He made it a source of glad tidings and mercy for the worlds and as a form of remembrance for those who remember. He made it a guide towards that which is most just and upright, and He mentioned aayaat and threats by which they may fear or would cause them to remember and reflect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, one who reads the Qur&#8217;aan, and ponders and reflects over its aayaat finds within it such knowledge and learning, which strengthen, increase and develop his eemaan. This is because he will come across within the discourse of the Qur&#8217;aan, a King, who possesses all dominion, for whom alone, is all praise. The reigns of all affairs are in His hand alone, they emanate from Him and return to Him. He has ascended above His throne and not a single secret in the regions of His dominion escapes Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is aware of what is in the souls of His slaves, fully cognizant of their hidden and public deeds. Solely, He disposes of the affairs of the Kingdom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He hears and sees, gives and withholds, rewards and punishes, and honors and abases. He creates and sustains, and gives life and causes death. He decrees, executes and disposes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He invites His servants and directs them towards what constitutes their happiness and success. He entices them towards this, and warns them of what will cause their ruin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He introduces Himself to them by His names and attributes. He woos them with His favors and blessings and reminds them of His favors upon them. He commands them with what entitles them to the completion of such favors and blessings and warns them of His vengeance. He reminds them of the honor He has prepared for them if they obey Him, and of the punishment He has prepared for them if they disobey Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He informs them of how He handles His awliyaa&#8217; and His enemies, and of the outcome of both. He praises His awliyaa&#8217; for their righteous actions and fine qualities. He censures His enemies for their bad deeds and distasteful characteristics.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He puts forward parables and provides numerous types of proofs and truths. He replies to the misconceptions of His enemies with the finest of answers. He gives credit to the truthful and denies the liar. He speaks the truth and guides towards the path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He invites to the abode of peace and safety (i.e., Paradise). He mentions its description, its beauty and its bliss. He warns against the abode of destruction (i.e., the Hellfire re). He mentions its torment, its ugliness and its pains.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He reminds His slaves of their necessity towards Him, their dire need of Him, and that they can never be independent of Him ever for the blink of an eyelid. He informs them that He can dispense of them and of all creation, and that He Himself is the Rich and is not dependent on anything, whereas, everything besides Him is inherently in need of Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He makes known to them, that no one attains an atom&#8217;s worth or more of good except by His Favor and Mercy, and that no one attains an atom&#8217;s worth or more of bad except by His justice and wisdom. One witnesses from His speech, His reproach of His beloved in the most gracious of ways and despite that, He dismisses their mistakes and forgives their slips. He accredits their excuses, rectifies their corruption, defends and protects them. He is their victor, their guardian over their welfare and the one who delivers them from all difficulties. He is the One who will keep His promise to them, He is their only patron and protector. He is their true patron and protector and their victor over their enemies. How fire a patron and victor He is!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, the servant never ceases to benefit from reflecting on the Book of Allaah. His heart bears witness to such types of knowledge that increase his eemaan and strengthen it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can this not be so? When he finds within the Qur&#8217;aan, a King who is glorious, merciful, generous and beautiful; this is His standing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how can he not love Him, compete to attain a nearness to Him or use up his energy in trying to show love for Him?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can He not be more beloved to him than anything else? How can he not prefer His pleasure to anyone else&#8217;s pleasure?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can he not be attached to His remembrance? How can his love for Him, his desire to meet Him and feeling close to Him not be his nourishment, strength and medicine, in that if he were to be bereft of this, he would become corrupt and ruined and would not benefit from his life? [Refer to al-Fawaa&#8217;id of Ibn al-Qayyim, pages 58-60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Aajurree, may Allaah have mercy upon him, said: &#8220;Whoever contemplates His words, will know the Lord and he will know of His great power and capability, His immense favor upon the believers, and of the obligation upon himself to worship Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, the person imposes this duty upon himself thereby being on his guard against that which his Generous Patron and Protector has warned of and coveting that which He has made desirous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever is of this description when reciting the Qur&#8217;aan or when listening to it when recited by another, the Qur&#8217;aan will be a cure for him. He becomes rich without money, he attains power and strength without kinsfolk and finds intimacy in that which others feel alienation towards.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His desire when opening a Soorah for recitation will be, ‘when will I accede to the admonition contained within what I recite?&#8217; and his desire will not be, ‘when will I complete this Soorah?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His aspiration is none other than, &#8216;When will I understand what Allaah is addressing me with? When will I restrain (from committing sins)? When will I take heed?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because reciting the Qur&#8217;aan is worship and it is not to be done so in a state of heedlessness, and Allaah is the one who grants the tawfeeq towards that?&#8221; [Akhlaaq Hamlah al-Qur&#8217;aan, by al-Aajurree, page 10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For this reason, Allaah, the Generous, orders His servants and encourages them to ponder over the Qur&#8217;aan, Allaah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>أَفَلَا يَتَدَبَّرُونَ الْقُرْآنَ ۚ وَلَوْ كَانَ مِنْ عِندِ غَيْرِ اللَّهِ لَوَجَدُوا فِيهِ اخْتِلَافًا كَثِيرًا</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Do they not then contemplate on the Qur&#8217;aan? Had it been from other than Allaah, they would surely have found therein much contradiction.&#8221;</b> </span>[Soorah an-Nisaa&#8217; (4):82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>أَفَلَا يَتَدَبَّرُونَ الْقُرْآنَ أَمْ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبٍ أَقْفَالُهَا</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Do they not then contemplate on the Qur&#8217;aan, or are there locks upon their hearts?&#8221;</b> </span>[Soorah Muhammad (47):24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah proclaims that He only revealed the Qur&#8217;aan so that its <em>aayaat</em> would be pondered over, He says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>كِتَابٌ أَنزَلْنَاهُ إِلَيْكَ مُبَارَكٌ لِّيَدَّبَّرُوا آيَاتِهِ وَلِيَتَذَكَّرَ أُولُو الْأَلْبَابِ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;(This is a) Book that We have sent down to you, full of blessings, so that they may ponder over its aayaat, and that those of understanding may remember.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah Saad (38):29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also explains that the reason behind the lack of guidance for the one who deviates from the straight path is his disregard for reflecting on the Qur&#8217;aan and being too proud to listen to it, He says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>قَدْ كَانَتْ آيَاتِي تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ فَكُنتُمْ عَلَىٰ أَعْقَابِكُمْ تَنكِصُونَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>مُسْتَكْبِرِينَ بِهِ سَامِرًا تَهْجُرُونَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>أَفَلَمْ يَدَّبَّرُوا الْقَوْلَ أَمْ جَاءَهُم مَّا لَمْ يَأْتِ آبَاءَهُمُ الْأَوَّلِينَ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Indeed, My aayaat used to be recited to you, but you used to turn back on your heels. With haughtiness, you talked evil about it (i.e., the Qur&#8217;aan) throughout the night. Have they not then pondered over the Word (i.e., the Qur&#8217;aan) or has there come to them what had not come to their fathers of old?&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah al-Mu&#8217;minoon (23):66-68]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He mentions of the Qur&#8217;aan that it increases the believers in eemaan if they read it and contemplate on its aayaat, Allaah says:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّمَا الْمُؤْمِنُونَ الَّذِينَ إِذَا ذُكِرَ اللَّهُ وَجِلَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَإِذَا تُلِيَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ آيَاتُهُ زَادَتْهُمْ إِيمَانًا وَعَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;The believers are none other than those whose hearts feel fear when Allaah is mentioned. When His aayaat are recited to them, they (i.e., the aayaat) increase them in their eemaan and upon their Lord (alone), they rely.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah al-Anfaal (8):2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah relates about the righteous amongst the Ahl al-Kitaab, that when the Qur&#8217;aan is recited to them they fall upon their faces in humble prostration and in a state of weeping, and that it increases them in humility, eemaan and submission. Allaah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>قُلْ آمِنُوا بِهِ أَوْ لَا تُؤْمِنُوا ۚ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْعِلْمَ مِن قَبْلِهِ إِذَا يُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ يَخِرُّونَ لِلْأَذْقَانِ سُجَّدًا </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَيَقُولُونَ سُبْحَانَ رَبِّنَا إِن كَانَ وَعْدُ رَبِّنَا لَمَفْعُولًا </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَيَخِرُّونَ لِلْأَذْقَانِ يَبْكُونَ وَيَزِيدُهُمْ خُشُوعًا</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Say, &#8216;Believe in it (i.e., the Qur&#8217;aan) or do not believe (in it). Verily, those who were given knowledge before it, when it is recited to them, they fall upon their faces in humble prostration, and they say:&#8221; How perfect is our Lord! Truly, the promise of our Lord will be fulfilled:&#8217; They fall upon their faces weeping and it adds to their humility.&#8221; </b></span>[Soorah al-Israa&#8217; (17): 107- 109]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also informs that if He were to send down the Glorious Qur&#8217;aan upon a mountain, it would humble itself and rupture because of the fear of Allaah. He made this as a parable for the people to demonstrate to them the greatness of the Qur&#8217;aan. He says:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">لَوْ أَنزَلْنَا هَٰذَا الْقُرْآنَ عَلَىٰ جَبَلٍ لَّرَأَيْتَهُ خَاشِعًا مُّتَصَدِّعًا مِّنْ خَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ ۚ وَتِلْكَ الْأَمْثَالُ نَضْرِبُهَا لِلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Had We sent down this Qur&#8217;aan on a mountain, you would surely have seen it humbling itself and rending asunder out of fear of Allaah. Such are the parables that We put forward to mankind that they may reflect.&#8221;</b></span>[Soorah al-Hashr (59):21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He described the Qur&#8217;aan as being the best of speech, parts of it resembling other parts and He repeated some of it so that it would be understood. He mentioned that the skins of the righteous shiver in fear and hope when they hear the Qur&#8217;aan. He says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>اللَّهُ نَزَّلَ أَحْسَنَ الْحَدِيثِ كِتَابًا مُّتَشَابِهًا مَّثَانِيَ تَقْشَعِرُّ مِنْهُ جُلُودُ الَّذِينَ يَخْشَوْنَ رَبَّهُمْ ثُمَّ تَلِينُ جُلُودُهُمْ وَقُلُوبُهُمْ إِلَىٰ ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ هُدَى اللَّهِ يَهْدِي بِهِ مَن يَشَاءُ ۚ وَمَن يُضْلِلِ اللَّهُ فَمَا لَهُ مِنْ هَادٍ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Allaah has sent down the best speech, a Book, its parts resembling each other in goodness and truth, oft repeated. The skins of those who fear their Lord shiver from it. Thereafter, their skin and hearts soften to the remembrance of Allaah. That is the guidance of Allaah. He guides with it whom He pleases and whomever Allaah sends astray, has no guide whatsoever.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah az-Zumar (39):23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah censures the believers for their lack of humility when listening to the Qur&#8217;aan and He cautions them to not resemble the disbelievers in this regard. He says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>أَلَمْ يَأْنِ لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَن تَخْشَعَ قُلُوبُهُمْ لِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ وَمَا نَزَلَ مِنَ الْحَقِّ وَلَا يَكُونُوا كَالَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ مِن قَبْلُ فَطَالَ عَلَيْهِمُ الْأَمَدُ فَقَسَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ ۖ وَكَثِيرٌ مِّنْهُمْ فَاسِقُونَ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">Has not the time come for the hearts of those who believe to be affected by Allaah&#8217;s reminder </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(i.e., the Qur&#8217;aan) </span><b><span style="color:#008000;">and of the truth that has been revealed, and not to be like those who had been given the Book before, whereby the term was lengthened for them and their hearts became hard and many of them are rebellious.</span>&#8220;</b> [Soorah al-Hadeed (57): 16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These aforementioned aayaat contain the clearest indication of the importance of the Qur&#8217;aan, the required attention that has to be paid to it, its powerful effect upon the hearts, and that it is the greatest matter that increases eemaan, especially, if the recitation is performed upon contemplation, reflection and on trying to understand its meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy upon him, says: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;In short, there is nothing more beneficial for the heart than reading the Qur&#8217;aan with contemplation and reflection. The Qur&#8217;aan encompasses all the levels of the travelers, the conditions of the workers, and stations of those possessing knowledge. It is the Qur&#8217;aan that generates love, desire, fear, hope, repentance, reliance, pleasure, entrustment, gratitude, patience and the rest of the different states that are life to the heart and perfection of it. Likewise, it repels all the rebuked characteristics and actions that cause the corruption and ruin of the heart.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If people were to possess a realization of what recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan with contemplation contains, they would devote themselves to it at the expense of anything else. When the person reads it with reflection and he comes across an aayah that he is in need of, for the cure of his heart, he repeats it, even if he does so a hundred times or the whole night. Hence, to recite a single aayah of the Qur&#8217;aan with contemplation and reflection is better than reciting the Qur&#8217;aan to completion without any contemplation or reflection. It is also more beneficial for the heart and more conducive to attaining eemaan and tasting the sweetness of the Qur&#8217;aan &#8230;</strong></span>&#8221; [Miftaah Daar as-Sa&#8217;aaadah, page 204]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad Rasheed Ridaa states: &#8220;Know that strength of religion and culmination of eemaan and certainty does not come about except by reading the Qur&#8217;aan very often and listening to it upon contemplation with the intention of being guided by it and to act on its commands and prohibitions. The correct and submissive eemaan increases, strengthens, develops and its effects such as righteous actions and abandonment of disobedience and corruption, all arise in pro-portion to the contemplation of the Qur&#8217;aan. It also decreases and weakens in proportion to not contemplating on the Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most of the Arabs only believed when they heard the Qur&#8217;aan and understood it. They did not conquer the lands, inhabit cities, nor did their population grow and their power become greater except because of the Qur&#8217;aan&#8217;s effective guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the nobles of Makkah who opposed and stood in enmity, strove against the Prophet and tried to prevent him from conveying the message of his Lord by stopping him from reciting the Qur&#8217;aan to the people:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا لَا تَسْمَعُوا لِهَٰذَا الْقُرْآنِ وَالْغَوْا فِيهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَغْلِبُونَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">And those who disbelieve say, &#8216;Do not listen to this Qur&#8217;aan and make noise in the midst of it (being recited) so that you may overcome …</span>&#8216;&#8221;</b> [Soorah Fussilat (41):26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The weakness of Islaam since the Middle ages up to the point where most of its empire disappeared is only so because of the abandonment of the contemplation of the Qur&#8217;aan, of reciting it and acting by it.&#8221; [Mukhtasar Tafseer al-Manaar, 3/170]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, the Noble Qur&#8217;aan is one of the greatest fortifiers of eemaan and the most beneficial reasons behind its increase.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It increases the eemaan of the slave in many diverse ways. Ibn as-Sa&#8217;dee says: &#8220;It increases it in many ways. Indeed, as for the believer, by simply reciting the aayaat of Allaah and becoming acquainted with the truthful information and fine rulings present within it, he attains an abundant goodness from the affairs of eemaan. How will it then be if he contemplates on it proficiently and understands its aims and secrets?&#8221; [At-Tawdeeh wa al-Bayaan li Shajarah al-Eemaan, Page 27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, one must know that the increase of eemaan that arises from the recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan does not happen unless one concentrates on understanding the Qur&#8217;aan, applying it and acting by it. The case is not that he simply reads it without understanding or contemplation, as many people who read the Qur&#8217;aan will find it to be their adversary and opponent on the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been affirmed on the Prophet &#8211; sallallahu alaihe wa-sallam &#8211; that he said: <i>&#8220;Verily, Allaah raises up a people with this Book and He abases others.&#8221;</i> [Related by Muslim, 1/559] It has also been affirmed that he (- sallallahu alaihe wa-sallam -) said: <i>&#8220;&#8230; and the Qur’aan is either a proof for you or against you.&#8221; </i>[Related by Muslim, 1/203]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is a proof for you and it increases your eemaan if you act by it or it is a proof against you and it decreases your eemaan if you neglect it and do not observe its boundaries.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qatadah stated: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Not a single person sits down with this Qur&#8217;aan except that he then rises with either some increase or decrease.&#8221;</strong></span> [Related by Ibn al-Mubaarak in az-Zuhd, page 272, al-Aajurree in Akhlaaq Hamlah al-Qur&#8217;aan, page 73, al-Marwazee in Qiyaam al-Layl, Page 77 of the concise version. Al-Baghawee mentioned it in his Tafseer, 3/133]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan al-Basree says in clarifying the meaning of contemplating the Qur&#8217;aan: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;&#8230; However, by Allaah, it is not by memorizing its letters and neglecting its boundaries. To the extent that one of them says, ‘I recited the whole Qur&#8217;aan and did not miss out a single letter!’ and by Allaah, he missed out the whole of the Qur&#8217;aan: no Qur&#8217;aan is seen in his character or deeds! To the point that one of them says, ‘Verily I can recite a Soorah with a single breath!’ By Allaah, these are not recites or scholars, they are not wise or pious. Whenever the recites are of this type, may Allaah not increase their like amongst the people!&#8221;</strong></span> [Related by &#8216;Abdur Razzaaq in his Musannaf 3/363, Ibn al-Mubaarak in az-Zuhd, page 274, al-Aajurree in Akhlaaq Hamlah al-Qur&#8217;aan, page 41, and al-Marwazee in Qiyaam al-Layl, Page 76 of the concise version]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah have mercy upon al-Hasan. I wonder as to what he would say if he witnessed the recites of our present time? Recites, who have been infatuated with being melodious, with correctly pronouncing the letters and flowering them, whilst they squander and neglect the limits.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In fact, the ears of the people when listening to the Qur&#8217;aan, also turn to the pronunciation of the words and the melody whilst neglecting to hearken or to contemplate on the word of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In any case, there is no objection whatsoever to the tajweed of the Qur&#8217;aan, to recite it slowly and melodiously, and to render it in a fine way. The objection however, is in over burdening oneself and being obstinate in pronouncing the letters without paying any regard or attention to establishing the commands that were the reason for the revelation of the Qur&#8217;aan. To the extent that you do not see in many of them the fear brought about by the limits of Allaah, indeed, nor do you see within them application of the Qur&#8217;aan in character or deed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You find a reciter amongst them, who has memorized the Qur&#8217;aan and who correctly pronounces the letters, shaving his beard or lengthening his lower garment. In fact, he may neglect performing prayer in its totality or in congregation, and other such sinful acts, to the extent that one of them &#8211; and Allaah&#8217;s help is sought &#8211; opened a music party for an immoral woman with aayaat of the Noble Qur&#8217;aan. He recited as an introduction to her singing, aayaat from the Noble Qur&#8217;aan!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The speech of our Lord is too great to be dishonored by the likes of such. It suffices me to repeat what al-Hasan, may Allaah have mercy upon him, said, &#8216;Whenever the reciters are of this type, may Allaah not increase their like amongst the people!&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-&#8216;Arabee mentioned, when describing the reciters of his time being preoccupied with reciting the words of the Qur&#8217;aan accurately while neglecting its rulings, and taking it up as a profession when the Qur&#8217;aan was only revealed to be acted by: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;&#8230; but when this recitation became a profession, they beautified it and vied with it, spent their life &#8211; without any need for them &#8211; on it. One of them dies and he was able to raise the Qur&#8217;aan in speech as a pot is raised but he broke its meanings as a vessel is broken. Thus, he was not consistent with any of its meanings.&#8221;</span></strong> [Al-&#8216;Awaasim min al-Qawaasim 2/486,within the book Aaraa&#8217; Abee Bakr Ibn al-&#8216;Arabee al-Kalaamiyyah by &#8216;Ammaar at-Taalibee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, the Muslim must learn how to derive benefit from the Qur&#8217;aan before he begins to recite it in order for its benefit to be achieved. Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy on him, mentioned in this respect a principle that is of great standing and enormous benefit. It is, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;if you want to attain benefit from the Qur&#8217;aan, bring your heart together upon reciting or listening to it, and divert your hearing to it, and be present in front of it, in the manner of one who is present and spoken to by the One who spoke it, How perfect He is&#8221; </strong></span>[Al-Fawaa&#8217;id, page 5. Also, refer to al-Fataawa of Ibn Taymiyyah, I 6/48-51 and 7/236-237]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever applies this principle and traverses upon this methodology when reciting the Qur&#8217;aan or when listening to it, will succeed with both knowledge and action. His eemaan will increase and it will establish itself like towering mountains, and Allaah is the One who is asked to give us the tawfeeq towards that and every good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, contemplation and reflection over the aayaat of Allaah are of two types: &#8220;Contemplation over it to arrive at the intended meaning of the Lord and contemplation over the meanings of what Allaah called His servants to reflect on. The first is contemplation over the Qur&#8217;aanic evidence and the second is contemplation over the witnessed evidence. The first is contemplation over His aayaat that are heard (i.e., the Qur&#8217;aan) and the second is contemplation over His aayaat that are witnessed (i.e., the universe and what it contains).&#8221; [Miftaah Daar as-Sa&#8217;aadah, page 204] This was stated by lbn al-Qayyim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The discussion mentioned here centers on the contemplation of Allaah&#8217;s aayaat that are heard. As for reflection on His aayaat that are  seen and witnessed, discussion on this will follow shortly by the will of Allaah.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>Reflecting on the Universal Signs (Aayaat Kawniyyah) of Allaah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For certain, contemplating over these signs, studying the diverse and amazing creations of Allaah such as the sky, the earth, the sun, the moon, planets and stars, night and day, mountains and trees, rivers and oceans and the many other creations of Allaah that cannot be enumerated, is without doubt one of the greatest causes for eemaan and the most beneficial reasons behind its fortification.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Contemplate the creation of the sky, look back up at it time after time. See how it is the greatest sign in its elevation and height, and in its extent and stationeries, whereby it does not climb up like fire or fall descending like a heavy object. It has no pillars and is neither connected from above. Rather, it is held by the might of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Next, contemplate its evenness and levelness, there is no rift, split or fissure within it. It does not have any curvature or crookedness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then consider the color it has been given, which is the best of colors, the most agreeable to one&#8217;s sight and that which strengthens it the most.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ponder on the creation of the earth and at its construction. You will notice that it is one of the greatest signs of its Maker and Originator. Allaah created it as a resting place and a bed. He made it subservient to His slaves. Allaah placed within it their livelihood and nourishment. He laid down pathways so that they may wander about the land in search for their needs and disposals. He established the earth firmly with mountains, making them pegs, protecting the earth from shaking along with its inhabitants and He expanded its sides and spread it out.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He extended the earth, spread it out and enlarged it from all its sides. He made it a receptacle for the living, containing them from above as long as they are alive and He made it a receptacle for the dead, containing them from underneath when they die. Thus, its outer is a homeland for the living and its inner is a homeland for the dead.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereafter look at it when it is dead, barren and humbled. When Allaah sends down the rains upon it, it stirs and grows. Thus, it rises and turns green and produces every type of lovely growth. It brings forth wondrous vegetation in appearance and sensation, which are delightful to the onlookers and amicable to the feasters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Next, consider how Allaah has perfected the sides of the earth with mountains that are unshakeable, towering, stern and solid. Consider how He has erected them so perfectly. How he elevated them and made them the most solid parts of the earth, so that they would not dwindle away with the stretch of years and continual succession of rain and wind. Rather, He perfected its creation, fortified its foundation and deposited within them such benefits, metals, minerals and springs, of which He desired.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now ponder on this delicate and fine air that is held captive between the sky and earth. It is sensed through feeling when blown; its substance is felt and its form cannot be seen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It runs between the sky and earth and the birds circle and fly in it, swimming with the aid of their wings just as the fish of the sea swim in water. Its sides and ripples collide against each other when in commotion just as the waves of the ocean clash.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consider how Allaah forms with this wind, clouds that are held between the sky and earth. The wind excites the clouds causing them to rise and become dense, Allaah then combines them together and merges them. The winds then impregnate it; these winds are those that Allaah named <em>lawaaqih</em>, (i.e., impregnators [Refer to <em>Soorah al-Hijr</em> (15):22]). Allaah then drives it by the wind to the land in need of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When it rises and ascends above the land, its water falls upon it. Allaah dispatches the winds whilst the clouds are in the atmosphere; the winds scatter and separate the clouds so that they do not harm or destroy something if the water were to descend upon it in its entirety. Once the land takes its fill and need, the clouds leave off the land and disperse. Thus, these clouds water the earth and are carried by the winds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Next, consider these oceans surrounding the land regions, which are gulfs of one great sea of water surrounding the whole earth such that even the lands, mountains and cities that are visible, are in relation to the water, like a small island in a massive ocean. The rest of the earth is submerged in water. If the Lord did not hold it with His power and will and if He did not hold back the water, it would overflow onto the lands and rise above it all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Contemplate on the night and day; they are amongst the most amazing signs of Allaah. See how He made the night for resting and as a covering. It coats the world causing the cessation of activities. Animals retire to their dwellings and the birds to their nests. The souls relax and take rest from the pains of their labor and tiredness until when the souls are reposed and have taken sleep and now look forward to their livelihood and its disposal, the Splitter of the morning (Allaah) brings forward the day, His army giving glad tidings of the morning. It vanquishes that darkness and tears it asunder, unveiling the darkness from the world, thereafter, the inhabitants are able to see. The animals then circulate about the land and proceed to manage their livelihood and welfare and the birds depart from their nests.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What a returning and arising, which is so indicative of the capability of Allaah towards the major return!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ponder on the condition of the sun and moon when rising and setting to establish the state of night and day. If it were not for the rising of the sun and moon, the affair of this world would become inoperative. How would the people attend to their livelihood and dispose of their affairs whilst the world upon them is dark? How would they take pleasure in their life with the absence of light? So:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>تَبَارَكَ الَّذِي جَعَلَ فِي السَّمَاءِ بُرُوجًا وَجَعَلَ فِيهَا سِرَاجًا وَقَمَرًا مُّنِيرًا وَهُوَ الَّذِي جَعَلَ اللَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَارَ خِلْفَةً لِّمَنْ أَرَادَ أَن يَذَّكَّرَ أَوْ أَرَادَ شُكُورًا</strong> </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Blessed be He who has placed in the heaven huge stars and has placed therein a great lamp (i.e., the sun) and a moon giving light. He is the one who placed the night and day in succession, for such who desires to remember or desires to show his gratitude.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah al-Furqaan (25):61-62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Examine the creation of the animals, with all their diverse characteristics, species, forms, usefulness, colors and endowed marvels. Some of them walk upon their bellies, some on two legs and some on four. Some of them have feet as weapons in the form of claws; some have beaks as weapons, like the eagle, vulture and the crow. Others have teeth as weapons and yet others have horns as weapons for use in defense of themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reflect and take heed in general from the setting of this world, the formation of its parts and the excellence of its arrangement and order, proving most cogently the perfection of the capability of its Creator and the perfection of His knowledge, wisdom, benevolence and delicateness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you do reflect on the world, you will notice it to be like a house that has been built and prepared with all of its apparatus, interests and all that it is in need of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, the sky is its roof that is hoisted above it. The land is its bed; it is a mat, bedding and an abode for the occupant. The sun and moon are two lamps that shine within it. The stars are lights, an adornment and guide for those who move about along the paths of this house. Gems and minerals are stored within it, like the provisions and storehouses that have been prepared and set; each and every thing of it is for its own specific purpose and use that befits it. All kinds of vegetation have been prepared for the purposes of the house. Varieties of animals have been laid out for its welfare, for mounting; providing milk; nourishment; clothing; enjoyment; employment and keeping guard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, the human being has been declared as the king, being commissioned with all of this. He is the one who rules and disposes by his actions and commands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Within all this, is the greatest sign and strongest proof of the Creator, the All-knowing, the Wise and fully cognizant, who has set proper measure and order for his creation in the finest way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In fact, reflect and take heed in particular, from Allaah&#8217;s creation of yourself, O person.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consider the start, middle and end of your creation. Look with all insight at the beginning of your creation, from a trickle of dirty despised fluid; whereby the Lord of all lords extracted this fluid from between the back-bone and ribs, guided it by His might with the narrowness of its channels and the diversity of its passages up until Allaah brings it to its abode and place of assembly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">See how Allaah united the male and female and placed love between them and how He led them with the chain of desire and love to come together, which is the cause behind the synthesis and formation of a child.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look at how He predestined those two fluids despite the distance apart from each person. He brought them from the depth of veins and organs and gathered them to one place. He prescribed for them a firmly established dwelling. Air cannot get to it to spoil it; cold cannot get to it to harden or congeal it and no accidentals extend to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah then transforms that white saturated trickle into a red clinging-like substance (that resembles a leech), which inclines towards a black color. Allaah then makes it into a chewed lump (of flesh) completely different to the clinging-like substance in its color, essence and form. Allaah then fashions it into bare bones without any clothing, which is contrary to the chewed lump in form, look, proportion, feel and color and so on, the stages of a person&#8217;s creation make a gradual process up until he emerges upon these forms that Allaah has fashioned him with; He originated for him, hearing, sight, a mouth, nose and the rest of the openings. He extended and spread out his legs and arms and separated their ends into fingers and toes and then further split them into phalanxes. He also assembled the inner organs such as the heart, stomach, liver, spleen, lungs, womb, intestines; each one has a proportion and benefit specific to it, so how perfect is, the One Who created (everything) and then proportioned (each thing appropriately) and Who measured and guided, Who said:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَفِي أَنفُسِكُمْ ۚ أَفَلَا تُبْصِرُونَ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;And also in your own selves, will you not then see?&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah adh-Dhaariyaat (51):21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;All of creation, from the atom to the Throne, are connected pathways to acquiring knowledge of Allaah and are profound evidences pointing to His eternality. The Universe, in totality, is made up of tongues uttering the oneness of Allaah. The world, in its entirety, is a book, of which the letters of its particulars are read by the discerning, all according to the level of their insights.&#8221; [See Dhayl Tabaqaat al-Hanaabilah of Ibn Rajab, 1/307. This is a saying of &#8216;Uthmaan Ibn Marzooq al-Qurashee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, reflect on these and other signs, which Allaah has created within the Heavens and earth. Contemplation, close examination and meditation on these signs yield immense benefits in the strengthening and steadfastness of one&#8217;s eemaan, because he apprehends through these signs, the oneness of his King and Creator and His perfection. Consequently, his love, glorification and veneration of Allaah will increase as will his obedience, submission and humbleness before Him. These are amongst the greatest benefits resulting from this reflection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy upon him, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;If you consider what Allaah has invited His servants to reflect on in His Book, it will impart you with knowledge of Allaah, of his oneness, His attributes of perfection and qualities of magnificence such as the extensiveness of His capability and knowledge and the perfection of His wisdom, mercy, benevolence, kindness, compassion, justice, pleasure, anger, reward and punishment. Thus, with this (all), He introduced Himself to His servants and encouraged them to reflect on His signs.&#8221;</strong></span> [Miftaah Daar as-Sa’aadah of Ibn al-Qayyim, page 204]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn as-Sa&#8217;dee, may Allaah have mercy upon him, states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;"> &#8220;&#8230; and one of the causes and incentives for eemaan is reflecting on the universe; on the creation of the heavens and earth and on the diverse types of creation contained within them; to look at the human himself and the attributes he possesses, for this is a strong incentive for eemaan.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">This is because of the greatness of creation found within these present entities, which points towards the might, capability and greatness of their Creator.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">It is also because of the prevalent beauty, order and perfection that baffles the learned, which point to the vastness of Allaah&#8217;s knowledge and the comprehensiveness of His wisdom and it is also because of the assorted benefits and abundant blessings that cannot be counted and are innumerable, which point to the magnitude of Allaah&#8217;s mercy, generosity and benevolence.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">All of this calls to the glorification of its originator and maker, to gratitude of Him, to becoming attached to His remembrance and having sincerity of religion to Him alone; this is the spirit  and secret of eemaan.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[At-Tawdeeh wa al-Bayaan, page 31. See or-Riyaad an-Naadhirah also by Shaykh as-Sa&#8217;dee, pages 238-280]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For this purpose, Allaah, <em><strong>al-Kareem</strong></em>, encourages His servants in His book to contemplate on these signs and indications and He directs them to study and reflect in many places within His Book. This is because of the many advantages for the slaves and the immense returns they attain from it. Allaah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِنَّ فِي خَلْقِ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَاخْتِلَافِ اللَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ وَالْفُلْكِ الَّتِي تَجْرِي فِي الْبَحْرِ بِمَا يَنفَعُ النَّاسَ وَمَا أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مِن مَّاءٍ فَأَحْيَا بِهِ الْأَرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا وَبَثَّ فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ دَابَّةٍ وَتَصْرِيفِ الرِّيَاحِ وَالسَّحَابِ الْمُسَخَّرِ بَيْنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ لَآيَاتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Verily, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day, and the ships that sail through the sea with that which is of use to mankind, and the water which Allaah sends down from the sky and makes the earth alive therewith after its death, and the moving </b>(living)<b> creatures of all kinds that he has scattered therein, and in the veering of winds and clouds which are held between the sky and the earth, are indeed signs for people of understanding&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah al-Baqarah (2):164]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ أَنْ خَلَقَكُم مِّن تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ إِذَا أَنتُم بَشَرٌ تَنتَشِرُونَ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;And among His signs is that He created you from dust and behold, you are human beings, becoming widespread.&#8221;</b> </span>[Soorah ar-Room (30):20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ خَلْقُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَمَا بَثَّ فِيهِمَا مِن دَابَّةٍ ۚ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ جَمْعِهِمْ إِذَا يَشَاءُ قَدِيرٌ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;And among His signs is the creation of the heavens and earth, and of all the creatures He has dispersed within them. And He is ever-potent over assembling them all if He so desires&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah ash-Shooraa (42):29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>أَفَلَا يَنظُرُونَ إِلَى الْإِبِلِ كَيْفَ خُلِقَتْ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَإِلَى السَّمَاءِ كَيْفَ رُفِعَتْ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَإِلَى الْجِبَالِ كَيْفَ نُصِبَتْ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَإِلَى الْأَرْضِ كَيْفَ سُطِحَتْ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Do they not look at the camels: how they have been created? And at the heaven: how it is raised? And at the mountains: how they have been rooted and firmly fixed? And at the earth: how it has been spread out?&#8221;</b></span>[Soorah al-Ghaashiyah (88):17-20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are other numerous similar <em>aayaat</em> in the Qur&#8217;aan, in which Allaah calls His servants to look at His signs and manifestations of his actions that represent the most supreme evidence of His oneness and singularity and for His might, will and knowledge. It is also evidence of His benevolence, gentleness and generosity. This is the greatest invitation of His servants towards having love of Allaah, thanking Him, glorifying Him, obeying Him and being attached to His remembrance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In conclusion, it becomes evident that study and contemplation of the Universe remains as one of the greatest causes of eemaan and the most beneficial incentives for it.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Pillars of <em>Eemaan</em></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قال : وأركانه ستة : أن تؤمن بالله ، وملائكته ، وكتبه ، ورسله ، واليوم الآخر ، وتؤمن بالقدر خيره وشره</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Its pillars are six: to have <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, and to have <em>eemaan </em>in Pre-Decree, the good of it, and the bad of it</strong>.</span><sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">43</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">43</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p>[Note: Shaykh Fawzan covers <strong><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2016/06/18/difference-between-pillars-and-branches-of-eemaan/">Difference between Pillars and Branches of Eemaan</a></strong>  before explaining the Pillars]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying: «<strong>Its pillars are six</strong>» meaning: it supports which it is established upon, and if they are absent, then it will be absent, or if one of them is absent, then it will be absent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are six pillars, and they are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The first one: «To have <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah.»</span></strong> So, the first pillar is having <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah, and it includes the three categories of <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em>: <em>Eemaan</em> that Allaah the Perfect and Most High is One, Unique, Alone, the Perfect Lord and Master whom everything depends totally upon, Who has no Partner in His Lordship, nor in His Right to worship, nor in His Names and Attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The second one: «<em>Eemaan</em> in the Angels»</span></strong> &#8216;<em>Malaa.ika</em>&#8216; (angels) is the plural of <em>malak</em> (angel). Its origin in the language is <em>mal.ak</em> (ملأك), so it was then made easier to pronounce and was said as &#8216;<em>malak</em>.&#8217; The angels are beings created by Allaah in the world of the <em><u>gh</u>ayb</em> (hidden and unseen). Allaah created them to worship Him, and to carry out His commands, He the Perfect and Most High, within His dominion. They are different types; every type has a duty which it is entrusted with and which it carries out. They do not disobey Allaah regarding that which He commands them, and they do whatever they are commanded. So, from them, there are those who are entrusted with the revelation, and he is Jibreel <em>`alaihissalaam</em>. He is the noblest one from the angels; he is <em>ar-Roo<u>h</u>ul-Ameen</em> (the Trustworthy Spirit) and he is described as <em><u>Sh</u>adeedul-Quwaa</em> (the Mighty in Strength). And from them, are those entrusted with bearing the Throne:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِينَ يَحْمِلُونَ الْعَرْشَ وَمَنْ حَوْلَهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Those who bear the Throne and those who are around it</strong></span>.» [40:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Most High said,</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَالْمَلَكُ عَلَىٰ أَرْجَائِهَا ۚ وَيَحْمِلُ عَرْشَ رَبِّكَ فَوْقَهُمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ ثَمَانِيَةٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the angels will be at its edges, and eight angels, will, on that Day, bear the Throne of your Lord</strong></span>.» [69:17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Throne is the most tremendous of the created things, and no one knows its greatness except for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. It will be carried by the angels &#8211; and this is a proof of the tremendous size of the angels, their great strength and their nature. He, the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ فَاطِرِ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ جَاعِلِ الْمَلَائِكَةِ رُسُلًا أُولِي أَجْنِحَةٍ مَّثْنَىٰ وَثُلَاثَ وَرُبَاعَ ۚ يَزِيدُ فِي الْخَلْقِ مَا يَشَاءُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>All praise is for Allaah, the Creator and Originator of the heavens and the earth, the One who made His angel messengers with wings, &#8211; two, three, and four. He increases in creation whatever He wishes</strong></span>.» [35:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, from them are those who have six hundred wings, such as Jibreel <em>`alaihis<u>s</u>alaatu wasalaam</em>. No one knows their tremendous size except for Allaah, the Perfect and Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ &#8211; لَا يَسْبِقُونَهُ بِالْقَوْلِ وَهُم بِأَمْرِهِ يَعْمَلُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Rather, they are honoured servants. They do not proceed Him in speaking, and they act upon His commands</strong></span>.» [21:26-27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From them are those who are entrusted with the rain-drops and the plants, and he is Mikaeel. And from them are those who are entrusted with blowing the horn, and he is Israafeel. He will blow the horn and everything will perish. He, the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَنُفِخَ فِي الصُّورِ فَصَعِقَ مَن فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَن فِي الْأَرْضِ إِلَّا مَن شَاءَ اللَّهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the horn will be blown, and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is upon the earth, will swoon</strong> (drop down dead)<strong> except whomever Allaah wishes</strong>.</span>» [39:68]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then it will be blown for a second time, and the souls will return to their bodies:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> ثُمَّ نُفِخَ فِيهِ أُخْرَىٰ فَإِذَا هُمْ قِيَامٌ يَنظُرُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then it will be blown again and they will be standing, looking on</strong></span>» [39:68]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The souls will fly from the <em>Qarn</em>, which is the horn, back to their bodies, and they will enter into them and they will come to life by the Permission of Allaah, then they will proceed to the gathering place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them are those who are entrusted with taking of the souls at the end of their lifespans, and he is <em>Malak al-Mawt</em> (the Angel of Death). He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ يَتَوَفَّاكُم مَّلَكُ الْمَوْتِ الَّذِي وُكِّلَ بِكُمْ ثُمَّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكُمْ تُرْجَعُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: The angel of death, who has been entrusted with you, will take your souls, then you will be returned to your Lord</strong>.</span>» [32:11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he has with him assistance from the angels:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">تَوَفَّتْهُ رُسُلُنَا وَهُمْ لَا يُفَرِّطُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Our Messengers </strong>(from the angels)<strong> take his soul, and they do not neglect their duty</strong>.</span>» [6:61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: they are the helpers for the angel of death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them are those who are entrusted with the foetuses in the wombs. The Messenger of Allaah <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">» إن أحدكم يجمع خلقه في بطن أمه أربعين يوما نطفة ، ثم يكون علقة مثل ذلك ، ثم يكون مضغة مثل ذلك ، ثم يرسل إليه الملك «</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>The creation of each one of you is brought together in the abdomen of his mother for forty days as a sperm drop, then he will be a clinging clot of blood for the like of that, then he will be a piece of flesh for the like of that, then the angel is sent to him</strong>.»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[Hadith Reported by al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree no. 3208 and Muslim no. 2643 from a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Abdullaah ibn Mas`ood, <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu `anhu</em>.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them are those who are entrusted with recording the deeds of the descendents of Aadam. He, the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِنَّ عَلَيْكُمْ لَحَافِظِينَ  &#8211; كِرَامًا كَاتِبِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And there are watchers over you and there are honourable scribes writing down your deeds</strong></span>.» [82:10-11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They stay with you throughout the night and the day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">»يتعاقبون فيكم ملائكة بالليل ، وملائكة بالنهار «</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>The angels of the night and the day come to you in succession</strong>.»</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Hadith Reported by al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree no. 555 and Muslim no. 632 from a <em><u>h</u>adeet<u>h</u></em> of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu `anhu</em>.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they gather together at the <em>Fajr</em> and <em>`A<u>s</u>r</em> prayer. They bear witness for those people who pray with Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. Therefore, He, the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ قُرْآنَ الْفَجْرِ كَانَ مَشْهُودًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the recitation of the Qur`aan in the <em>Fajr</em> prayer is witnessed</strong>.</span>» [17:78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: The angels attend it, the angels of the night and the angels of the day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them are those who are entrusted with guarding the descendants of Aadam from disagreeable things; they guard them from calamities, from enemies, creatures; the wild animals, serpents or snakes, for as long as he lives, he has angels guarding him from dangerous things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He may sleep between wild animals and snakes in open desert, (so) who repels the snakes, the wild animals and creatures from him? He has angels whom Allaah, He the Most High, has placed in their service. Allaah said with regard to them:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَهُ مُعَقِّبَاتٌ مِّن بَيْنِ يَدَيْهِ وَمِنْ خَلْفِهِ يَحْفَظُونَهُ مِنْ أَمْرِ اللَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There are angels guarding him in succession, from in front of him and from behind him by the Command of Allaah</strong></span>.» [13:11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: by the Command of Allaah, they guard the children of Aadam from disagreeable things and from dangers, until his lifespan draws to a close. So, when his lifespan comes to an end, they leave him. And that which Allaah has decreed to occur will occur, be it death or being stopped by something which leads to death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them are angels who are entrusted with carrying out the commands in different areas of the heavens and the earth. No one knows them except for Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From them are angels who seek out the gatherings of remembrance of Allaah and they attend them, just as Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">»ما اجتمع قوم في بيت من بيوت الله ، يتلون كتاب الله ، ويتدارسونه بينهم ، إلا نزلت  عليهم السكينة ، وغشيتهم الرحمة ، وحفتهم الملائكة«</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>No people gather in a house from the houses of Allaah, reciting the Book of Allaah and studying it amongst them, except that (<em>as-sakeenah</em>) tranquility descends upon them, and mercy covers them, and the angels encircle them with their wings</strong>.»</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Hadith Reported by Muslim no. 2699 from a <em><u>h</u>adeet<u>h</u></em> of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu `anhu</em>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are angels who travel about upon the earth, seeking out the circles of the remembrance of Allaah and attending them.</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;"> [Hadith Reported by al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree no. 6408 from a <em><u>h</u>adeet<u>h</u></em> of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu `anh</em>.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No one knows all about the angels, their types and characteristics except for Allaah. However, as for what occurs in the texts of the Qur`aan and the authentic <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>, then we affirm it, and we believe it as our <em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) ; and whatever has not been mentioned to us, then we withhold from it, and we do not delve into it, because this is from <em>`ilmul-<u>gh</u>ayb</em> (the knowledge of the hidden and the unseen) which we do not enter into, except with a proof.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, having <em>eemaan</em> in the angels is a pillar from the pillars of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever denies the angels and says: &#8220;<em>There are no angels (in existence) because we do not see them</em>,&#8221; then this person will be a disbeliever, an apostate and heretic, and Allaah&#8217;s refuge is sought. This is because he does not have <em>eemaan</em> in the <em><u>gh</u>ayb</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, the person who interprets the angels away and says: &#8220;<em>The angels are just abstract things and not bodily beings; they are just thoughts or promptings which occur to a person. If they are good promptings, then they are angels, and if they are evil promptings, then they are devils</em>,&#8221; this is a saying involving apostasy, and Allaah&#8217;s refuge is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unfortunately, this is found in <em>Tafseerul-Manaar</em>, it was quoted by Mu<u>h</u>ammad Ra<u>sh</u>eed Ridaa from his <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> Mu<u>h</u>ammad `Abdah. This is speech of the philosophers and it is <em>baa<u>t</u>il</em> (false and futile). Whoever truly holds this as his creed and belief, he is a disbeliever. However, we hope that he was just quoting it, and he did not believe it, however, he quoted it without criticism, and that is dangerous. This is false and futile speech, and it is disbelief in the angels. We ask Allaah for safety and security.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a person should not enter with his own intellect and thinking into this, nor should he quote anything from the philosophers and heretics with regard to anything from the affairs of the religion and the matters of <em>`ilmul-<u>gh</u>ayb</em>. Rather, he should rely upon the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>. This is what is obligatory. And he mentions in <em>Tafseerul-Manaar</em> that he was quoting from the book <em>I<u>h</u>yaa Uloom ad-Deen</em> of al-<u>Gh</u>azaalee, and Allaah knows best. And the book <em>I<u>h</u>yaa Uloom ad-Deen</em> of al-Ghazaalee contains terrible and calamitous things, and it contains some things from good and benefits, however, it contains a great deal of matters which can cause destruction, and it contains a great deal of poison. It is a book which is mixed up, its evil is more than its good. So therefore, it is not befitting that the beginner or the common person should look into it, unless he has the knowledge and ability to distinguish between the truth and falsehood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the angels are not abstract things as is said, rather, the angels have bodies and forms, they can take on different forms which Allaah gives them the ability to take on. Therefore, Jibreel <em>`alaihis-salaam</em> came to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> in the form of a man. So, Allaah gives them the ability to take forms for the benefit of the descendants of Aadam, because the descendants of Aadam are not able to see the angels in the form upon which Allaah created them. So, he came to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> in the form of a man out of kindness to the sons of Aadam. And they are not seen in their true forms and realities, except at the time of punishment. He, the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَ الْمَلَائِكَةَ لَا بُشْرَىٰ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُجْرِمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>On the Day when they will see the angels, there will be no glad tidings on that Day for the criminals</strong></span>.» [25:22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At death, the person will see them, he will see the angels of death, however, in this world and once he is alive, he does not see them because he is not able to see them. Allaah created them from light and He created the devils from Fire, just as occurs in the <em>Qur`aan</em>, and He created Aadam from earth, so Allaah has full ability over everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the disbelievers believed that the angels are the daughters of Allaah. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَجَعَلُوا الْمَلَائِكَةَ الَّذِينَ هُمْ عِبَادُ الرَّحْمَٰنِ إِنَاثًا ۚ أَشَهِدُوا خَلْقَهُمْ ۚ سَتُكْتَبُ شَهَادَتُهُمْ وَيُسْأَلُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they made the angels, who are servants of the Most Merciful, females. Did they witness their creation? Their testimony will be written and they will be questioned about it</strong>.</span>» [43:19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The third one: «<em>Eemaan</em> in his books»</span></strong> They are the Books which Allaah sent down to the Messengers for the guidance of mankind. We have <em>eemaan</em> that they are the speech of Allaah in reality, and we have <em>eemaan</em> in whatever Allaah named from them and in whatever He has not named. Allaah named to us from them the <em>Tauraat</em>, the <em>Injeel</em>, the Tremendous Qur`aan, the <em>Zaboor</em>, and the Scripture given to Ibraaheem and Moosaa. We have <em>eemaan</em> in them and we have <em>eemaan</em> in those that Allaah did not name to us from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, <em>eemaan</em> in the previous scriptures is <em>eemaan</em> in general terms, whereas <em>eemaan</em> in the Qur`aan is <em>eemaan</em> in the details of everything contained in it. This is because it is our Book and was sent down to our Prophet Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em>sallallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>. Whoever denies one <em>aayah</em> or one letter from its letters, then he is a <em>kaafir</em> and a <em>murtad</em> (apostate) who has left <em>Islaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, whoever believes in a part of the Qur`aan and disbelieves in a part, then he is a <em>kaafir</em>, and one who believes in some of the scriptures and disbelieves in some, then he is a <em>kaafir</em>. Whoever says: &#8220;I believe in the Qur`aan, but I do not believe in the <em>Tauraat</em> and the <em>Injeel</em>,&#8221; then he is a <em>kaafir</em>.  Or says: &#8220;I believe in the <em>Tauraat</em> and the <em>Injeel</em>, but I do not believe in the <em>Zaboor</em> which was sent to Daawood <em>`alaihissalaam</em>,&#8221; then he is a <em>kaafir</em>. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَآتَيْنَا دَاوُودَ زَبُورًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We gave the <em>Zaboor</em> to Daawood</strong>.</span>» [4:163]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or one who denies the scriptures of Ibraaheem, then he is a <em>kaafir</em>, because he has denied the truth of that which Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, said. He is denying His Messengers, so therefore, he is a <em>kaafir</em>, because he has denied a pillar from the pillars of <em>eemaan</em>.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The fourth one: «<em>Eemaan</em> in his Messengers»</span></strong> Having <em>eemaan</em> in all of the Messengers, from the first of them to the last of them, those whom Allaah has named from them and those He did not name.  We have <em>eemaan</em> in all of them, and that they are Messengers of Allaah in truth. They came with the Message and they conveyed it to their nations. So, whoever disbelieves in a single Prophet, then he is a disbeliever in all of the Messengers, because of His saying, the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَكْفُرُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَيُرِيدُونَ أَن يُفَرِّقُوا بَيْنَ اللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَيَقُولُونَ نُؤْمِنُ بِبَعْضٍ وَنَكْفُرُ بِبَعْضٍ وَيُرِيدُونَ أَن يَتَّخِذُوا بَيْنَ ذَٰلِكَ سَبِيلًا أُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْكَافِرُونَ حَقًّا ۚ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لِلْكَافِرِينَ عَذَابًا مُّهِينًا  وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا بِاللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَلَمْ يُفَرِّقُوا بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِّنْهُمْ أُولَٰئِكَ سَوْفَ يُؤْتِيهِمْ أُجُورَهُمْ ۗ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Those who disbelieve in Allaah and His Messengers and wish to make a distinction between believing in Allaah and His Messengers. They say: &#8220;We believe in some of them and we disbelieve in some,&#8221; and they wish to take a path in between. They are the disbelievers in truth. And We have prepared a humiliating punishment for the disbelievers</strong>. <strong>And those who truly believe in Allaah and His Messengers and do not differentiate in believing in any of them</strong>, <strong>to them He will soon give their rewards</strong>. <strong>And Allaah has always been One who Forgives Extensively and Bestows Mercy</strong></span>.» [4:150-152]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore disbelieving in a single Prophet or a single Messenger is to disbelieve in all of them. He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">كَذَّبَتْ قَوْمُ نُوحٍ الْمُرْسَلِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The people of Noo<u>h</u> rejected the Messengers</strong></span>.» [26:105]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though they only rejected Nooh, their denial of Noo<u>h</u> became a denial of the rest of the Messengers. Likewise, whoever disbelieves in `Eesaa and Mu<u>h</u>ammad, such as the Jews, or whoever disbelieves in Mu<u>h</u>ammad, such as the Christians, then he is a disbeliever in all of them. There must be <em>eemaan</em> in all of the Messengers `<em>alaihumu<u>s</u>alaatu wasalaam</em>, those whom Allaah has named from them and those He has not named.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has named some of them as occurs in <em>Sooratul-An`aam</em>:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَتِلْكَ حُجَّتُنَا آتَيْنَاهَا إِبْرَاهِيمَ عَلَىٰ قَوْمِهِ ۚ نَرْفَعُ دَرَجَاتٍ مَّن نَّشَاءُ ۗ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ حَكِيمٌ عَلِيمٌ </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُ إِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ ۚ كُلًّا هَدَيْنَا ۚ وَنُوحًا هَدَيْنَا مِن قَبْلُ ۖ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِهِ دَاوُودَ وَسُلَيْمَانَ وَأَيُّوبَ وَيُوسُفَ وَمُوسَىٰ وَهَارُونَ ۚ وَكَذَٰلِكَ نَجْزِي الْمُحْسِنِينَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَزَكَرِيَّا وَيَحْيَىٰ وَعِيسَىٰ وَإِلْيَاسَ ۖ كُلٌّ مِّنَ الصَّالِحِينَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَالْيَسَعَ وَيُونُسَ وَلُوطًا ۚ وَكُلًّا فَضَّلْنَا عَلَى الْعَالَمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong style="color:#008000;">And that was Our Proof which We gave to Ibraaheem against his people. We raise in degrees whomever We wish. Indeed, your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing. And We bestowed upon him</strong> <b style="color:#008000;">Is-haaq and Yaqoob, We guided them all, and Noo</b><u style="color:#008000;font-weight:bold;">h</u><b style="color:#008000;">, We guided before, and from his </b><span style="color:#008000;"><b>descendants</b></span><b style="color:#008000;"> were Daawood, Sulayman, Ayyoob, Yusuf, Moosaa, and Haaroon. Likewise shall We reward the doers of good. And Zakariyyah, and Ya</b><u style="color:#008000;font-weight:bold;">h</u><b style="color:#008000;">yaa, and Ilyaas, all of them were from the righteous. And Ismaa`eel, and al-Yas`aa, and Yoonus and Loot, all of them We gave excellence over the people of the world</b></span>.» [6:83-86]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He mentioned a number of them together in these <em>aayahs</em> and in other <em>aayahs</em>. So, we have <em>eemaan</em> in those whom Allaah has named from them and we have <em>eemaan</em> in those whom Allaah has not named from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The fifth one: «The Last Day» <em>Eemaan</em> in the Last Day is the fifth pillar.</span></strong> The Last Day &#8211; what is meant by it is <em>Yawm al-Qiyaamah</em> (the Day of Resurrection). It is called the Last Day because it comes after the <em>Yawm al-Awal </em>(the First Day), and that is the Day of this world. This world is the First Day, and the Resurrection is the Last Day. Having <em>eemaan</em> in the Last Day is to have <em>eemaan</em> in whatever will occur after death from the punishment of the grave and its bliss and the questioning of the two Angels in the grave. Everything that will occur after the grave is a part of <em>eemaan</em> in the Last Day, likewise, <em>eemaan</em> in <em>al-Ba`<u>th</u> </em>(dead being brought to life), <em>an-Nu<u>sh</u>oor</em> (Resurrection), <em>al-Ma<u>hsh</u>ara</em> (the Gathering Place), <em>al-<u>Hi</u>saab</em> (Reckoning), <em>Waznul-A`maal</em> (Weighing of the Deeds), <em>a<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>iraat </em>(Bridge over the Hell-Fire), <em>al-Mizaan</em> (the Balance upon which the good and bad deeds will be weighed), and <em>al-Jannah</em> (Paradise) and <em>an-Naar</em> (Fire). So the details of what will occur on the Last Day, we have <em>eemaan</em> in it &#8211; in general and with the specifics &#8211; beginning with death right until the inhabitants of Paradise settle in Paradise and the inhabitants of the Fire are in the Fire. Everything which is authentic in that regard, we have <em>eemaan</em> in it. We do not have any doubt at all about anything from it. Whoever doubts about anything from it, then he is a <em>kaafir</em> and a <em>murtad</em> upon <em>Islaam</em> &#8211; everything to which the term the Last Day applies and what is contained in it.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The sixth pillar: «And to have <em>eemaan</em> in pre-decree</span></strong>, the good of it, and the bad of it.» You have <em>eemaan</em> that whatever occurs from this creation, from good or evil, from disbelief or true faith, from blessings or punishments, from ease or hardship, from sickness or health, from life or death &#8211; everything occurs in this creation is pre-decreed. It does not just occur like that. It is not just a matter which happens on its own, meaning: it just initially comes about, not being pre-decreed. So, you have <em>eemaan</em> that it all comes about with the decree and ordainment of Allaah. And you have <em>eemaan</em> that whatever befalls you would not have missed you and whatever missed you was not going to come upon you, and that this was by the ordainment of Allaah and His pre-decree. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَا أَصَابَ مِن مُّصِيبَةٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَلَا فِي أَنفُسِكُمْ إِلَّا فِي كِتَابٍ مِّن قَبْلِ أَن نَّبْرَأَهَا ۚ إِنَّ ذَٰلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>No calamity befalls on the earth nor in yourselves except that it was already written in a Book, before We created it. That is easy for Allaah</strong>.</span>» [57:22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is <em>eemaan</em> with the pre-decree.<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Eemaan</em> in pre-decree includes four levels, whoever does not have <em>eemaan</em> in all of them is not a believer in pre-decree.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first level</strong>: Knowledge that Allaah has known everything, always. He knows what occurs, whatever has occurred and whatever will occur without end. So, Allaah knew it always before it was and before it occurred. He, the Perfect and Most High, knew it with His Eternal Knowledge &#8211; which is His Attribute &#8211; has always been and will be forever. This is the level of knowledge, whoever denies it is a <em>kaafir</em>.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second level</strong>: The level of writing down in the <em>Law<u>h</u> al-Ma<u>h</u>foodh</em> (the Preserved Tablet). And it is that Allaah wrote down everything in the Preserved Tablet. Nothing occurs except that it was written down in the Preserved Tablet. There is nothing that occurs and it is not written there, therefore He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَا أَصَابَ مِن مُّصِيبَةٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَلَا فِي أَنفُسِكُمْ إِلَّا فِي كِتَابٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>No calamity befalls on the earth nor in yourselves except that it was already written in a Book</strong></span>.» [57:22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: the Preserved Tablet. Allaah wrote in it the decreed measures of everything. Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">» أول ما خلق الله القلم ، قال : اكتب ، قال : وما أكتب ؟ قال : اكتب ما هو كائن إلى يوم القيامة «</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«The first thing that Allaah created was the pen.<br />
He said: &#8220;Write.&#8221;<br />
It said: &#8220;And what shall I write?&#8221;<br />
He said: &#8220;<strong>Write whatever will occur until the Day of Resurrection</strong>.&#8221;»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[Hadith Reported by Aboo Daawood no. 3800, at-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee no. 2155 from a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Ubaadah ibn a<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>aamit, <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu `anhu</em>.] [Declared authentic by <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> al-Albaanee (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>)].</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, whoever denies the writing and says: &#8220;Allaah knows everything, however He did not write anything down in the Preserved Tablet,&#8221; this person is a <em>kaafir</em> and an apostate who has left the religion of <em>Islaam</em>.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third level</strong>: Allaah&#8217;s <em>Ma<u>sh</u>ee.ah</em> (Will) which is in effect. It is that Allaah, the Perfect, wishes a thing and wills it to occur. So, there is nothing that occurs except that Allaah wished and willed it to occur just as it is in the Preserved Tablet and just as He knew it, He the Perfect and Most High. He wills everything to occur at its time. He wills everything to occur at a certain time. Nothing occurs without the will of Allaah or without His wish. So, whoever says: &#8220;<em>Things occur without Allaah wishing them to or without Allaah&#8217;s willing them to</em>,&#8221; then he is a <em>kaafir</em>.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The fourth level</strong>: The level of creating and bringing it into exist. Allaah created it everything. When He wishes and wills it, He, the Perfect and Most High, creates it and brings it about. So everything is something created by Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, and it is from the creation of Allaah. It is an action done by the servants and something earned by them [meaning deeds].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these four levels, there must be <em>eemaan</em> in them, otherwise the person will not be a believer in pre-decree, the level of knowledge, writing, wish and will, and creation and the bringing into existence. It is essential to have <em>eemaan</em> in all of these. Whoever denies anything from them, then he is a <em>kaafir</em> and an apostate who has left the religion of <em>Islaam</em>, because he has denied a pillar from the pillars of <em>eemaan</em>, and it is <em>eemaan</em> in the pre-decree.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Proof for the Pillars of <em>Eemaan</em></strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">والدليل على هذه الأركان الستة قوله تعالى :</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The proof for these six pillars is His saying He, the Most High:</span></strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَّيْسَ الْبِرَّ أَن تُوَلُّوا وُجُوهَكُمْ قِبَلَ الْمَشْرِقِ وَالْمَغْرِبِ وَلَٰكِنَّ الْبِرَّ مَنْ آمَنَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ وَالْمَلَائِكَةِ وَالْكِتَابِ وَالنَّبِيِّينَ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And righteousness is not that you turn your faces towards the East or the West; but rather, righteousness is the righteousness of those who have <em>eemaan </em></strong>(truly believe<strong>) in Allaah, the Last Day, the Angels, the Books, and the Prophets</strong></span>.» [2:177]  <sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">44</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">44</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> having explained these pillars mentions the proof from the Qur`aan and <em>Sunnah</em>, because any matter from the matters of the religion, of worship, <em>`aqeedah</em> and the matters of legislated rulings, require a <em>daleel</em> (proof). If it does not have a proof, it will not be <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (correct). So, the <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> having mentioned the six pillars of <em>eemaan</em>, he mentions their proof from the Qur`aan firstly and then from the <em>Sunnah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the Qur`aan is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">.. لَّيْسَ الْبِرَّ أَن تُوَلُّوا وُجُوهَكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">« <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And righteousness is not that you turn your faces </strong></span>» [2:177]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Birr</em> (righteousness) is the doing of good which draws one closer to Allaah and leads to His Paradise. So, all actions of good are from <em>al-birr</em>. <em>Al-Birr</em> is a general word which covers all types of good and all types of acts of obedience. They all enter under the title of <em>birr</em> and under the title of <em>taqwaa</em> (dutifulness to Allaah).So, <em>al-birr</em> and <em>taqwaa</em> are comprehensive terms which gather all the characteristics of good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَّيْسَ الْبِرَّ أَن تُوَلُّوا وُجُوهَكُمْ قِبَلَ الْمَشْرِقِ وَالْمَغْرِبِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">« <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And righteousness is not that you turn your faces towards the East or the West</strong></span>. » [2:177]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a refutation of the Jews who criticized the changing of the <em>Qiblah</em> (direction of the prayer) from Jerusalem to the honored <em>Ka`bah</em>. They criticized this and denied it along with their knowledge that they knew that it was true. However, they denied it as a case of obstinate rejection, haughtiness and envy towards the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi was allam</em> and towards this nation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says: It is not righteousness that you turn your faces in a certain direction from the directions without a command from Allaah. But rather, righteousness is obedience to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. If He commands you with a command, it is obligatory upon you to comply with it. This is righteousness. So, if He commands you to face Jerusalem, then righteousness at that time is to face the direction of Jerusalem, because it was obedience to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. Then, when He commands you to face the <em>Ka`bah</em>, righteousness is to face the <em>Ka`bah</em>. So, righteousness goes along with the command of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You are slaves. It is obligatory upon you to comply. If Allaah commands you to face a certain direction, it is obligatory upon you to comply. But as for clinging in a bigoted manner to one certain direction, saying: &#8220;<em>It is not correct except to face it,</em>&#8221; then the meaning of this is the following of desires and tribalism. Whereas the true servant goes along with the commands of Allaah wherever they go. He does not raise any objection to the command of Allaah, since facing a direction after it has been abrogated will not be obedience to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. So, acting upon that which has been abrogated and leaving that which abrogates is not obedience to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, rather it is just obedience to desires and tribalism. So, righteousness is connected to obedience to Allaah; in whichever directions He turns you, you turn in that direction if you are true in your servitude to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; لَّيْسَ الْبِرَّ أَن تُوَلُّوا وُجُوهَكُمْ قِبَلَ الْمَشْرِقِ وَالْمَغْرِبِ وَلَٰكِنَّ الْبِرَّ مَنْ آمَنَ بِاللَّهِ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And righteousness is not that you turn your faces towards the East or the West; but rather, righteousness is the righteousness of those who have <em>eemaan </em></strong>(truly believe)<strong> in Allaah </strong></span>&#8230;» [2:177]</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ودليل القدر قوله تعالى:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And the proof for pre-decree is His Saying, He the Most High:</strong></span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّا كُلَّ شَيْءٍ خَلَقْنَاهُ بِقَدَرٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We have created all things in accordance with a predetermined measure</strong></span>.» [54:49] <sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">45</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">45</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof for the sixth pillar from the pillars of <em>eemaan</em> is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّا كُلَّ شَيْءٍ خَلَقْنَاهُ بِقَدَرٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We have created all things in accordance with a predetermined measure</strong></span>.» [54:49]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Everything which Allaah created is predetermined in His Knowledge, His Writing, His Wish and Will, He the Perfect and Most High. It is not something which spontaneously occurs or something accidental, rather it is something preceded with the Knowledge of Allaah, written in the Preserved Tablet, and something preceded in the Wish and Will of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">والدليل من السنة حديث جبريل المشهور:</span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>»</strong>عن عمر  رضى الله عنه قال : بينما نحن جلوس عند رسول الله  صلى الله عليه وسلم  إذ طلع علينا رجل ، شديد بياض الثياب ، شديد سواد الشعر<strong>«</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">And the proof from the <em>Sunnah</em> is the famous <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Jibreel:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">From `Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu`anhu</em> who said: «<strong>Whilst we were sitting with Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>, a man came to us whose clothing was very white and whose hair was very black</strong>.»</span> <sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">48</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">48</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Speech with regard to <em>Islaam</em>, <em>eemaan</em> and <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em> has preceded and the pillars of each level. The <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) has mentioned the evidences for each level from the Qur`aan. All of that has preceded and finished.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, the <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) mentioned a proof for these levels from the <em>Sunnah</em>, the <em>Sunnah</em> of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>; so he mentioned the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Jibreel.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He [Jibreel] came to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> whilst he was with his companions. He came to them in the form of a man and he sat with the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>, and asked him about <em>Islaam</em>, <em>eemaan</em>, and <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em>. Then, he asked him about the Last Hour and its signs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is called the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Jibreel or it is called the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Umar. It is a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> which occurs through a number of chains of narration from a group of the companions, so it is an authentic <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>. The <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) mentioned the narration of `Umar ibn al-<u>Kh</u>a<u>tt</u>aab [<strong>1</strong>] of this <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>. There is variations in the wordings of the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> in other narrations. However, the meaning is one and the same.</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[<strong>1</strong>] Hadith Reported in <u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> Muslim no. 8. Refer to <em>Jaami` al-Uloom wal-<u>H</u>ikam</em> of Ibn Rajab 1/93, second <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Whilst we were sitting with Allaah&#8217;s Messenger</strong> <strong><em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em></strong>» It was from their usual practice, may Allaah be pleased with them, that they would gather together in the presence of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> in the mosque, and that they would take knowledge from him and listen to his (<em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>) answers when he responded to questions. So, whilst they were like that in their normal condition, a man entered upon them through the door.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man «<strong>whose clothing was very white and whose hair was very black</strong>.» Meaning: Jibreel <em>`alaihissalaam</em>. He came in the form of this man and he did not come to them in his angelic form, because they would not have been able to look upon him in his angelic form.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">»لا يرى عليه أثر السفر ، ولا يعرفه منا أحد ، حتى جلس إلى النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم  فأسند ركبتيه إلى ركبتيه ، ووضع كفيه على فخذيه ، وقال : يا محمد أخبرني عن الإسلام «.</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>«No signs of having traveled could be seen upon him and none of us knew him until he sat with the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>. He placed his knees against his knees and placed his hands upon his thighs and said:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>&#8216;O Mu<u>h</u>ammad, inform me about <em>al-Islaam</em>.&#8217;»</strong></span><sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">49</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">49</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>«No signs of having traveled could be seen upon him and none of us knew him»</strong>: Meaning: from those who were present. This was something amazing: he had not arrived from a journey so that it could be said: &#8220;He is from other than the people of al-Madeenah.&#8221; Yet, they did not recognize him. He was not from the people of the city so that they could recognize him. So, they were confused about him. He was not someone who had come from a journey nor was he someone from the people of the town. If he had arrived from a journey, then the signs of having traveled would have appeared upon him, his clothing and his color, because the effects of traveling appear upon a traveler. No one from those present recognized him, so he was not from the people of the city. Yet he had not arrived from a journey. So what could this man be? This is what they found strange.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>«He sat with the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>»</strong>: In front of him with the sitting of a student with his teacher.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>«He placed his two knees against the two knees of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam»</em></strong>: Meaning: He was very close to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>«He placed his two hands upon his thighs»</strong>: Meaning: Upon the thighs of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <strong>«</strong><strong>he said: &#8216;O Mu<u>h</u>ammad&#8217;»</strong>: He addressed him by his name and he did not say: &#8216;O Messenger of Allaah.&#8217; Perhaps he did that, <em>`alaihissalaam</em>, in order that the companions should think that he was from the people of the desert (i.e. Bedouin), because it was from the habit and custom of the people of the desert that when they used to address the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>, they would do so by his name. This is because the people of the desert have their own nature and customs. And it was also an addition in rendering it something strange and obscure so that they would not recognize him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>«He said: &#8216;O Mu<u>h</u>ammad, inform me about <em>al-Islaam</em>&#8216;»</strong>: Meaning: explain to me the meaning of <em>Al</em>&#8211;<em>Islaam</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قال» : <strong>أن</strong> <strong>تشهد</strong> <strong>أن</strong> <strong>لا</strong> <strong>إله</strong> <strong>إلا</strong> <strong>الله</strong> <strong>،</strong> <strong>وأن</strong> <strong>محمدا</strong> <strong>رسول</strong> <strong>الله</strong><strong> صلى الله عليه وسلم</strong><strong>  </strong><strong>وتقيم</strong> <strong>الصلاة</strong> <strong>،</strong> <strong>وتؤتي الزكاة</strong> <strong>،</strong> <strong>وتصوم</strong> <strong>رمضان</strong> <strong>،</strong> <strong>وتحج</strong> <strong>البيت</strong> <strong>إن</strong> <strong>استطعت</strong> <strong>إليه</strong> <strong>سبيلا</strong> <strong>،</strong> «<strong>فقال</strong><strong> : </strong><strong>صدقت</strong> <strong>،</strong> <strong>فعجبنا</strong> <strong>له</strong> <strong>يسأله</strong> <strong>ويصدقه</strong> .</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">He said: «<strong>It is that you testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah <em><u>s</u>allallaahu `alaihiwasallam</em>, and you establish the prayer, give <em>Zakaah</em>, fast <em>Ramadaan</em>, and perform Hajj (pilgrimage) to the House if are able to make your way to it</strong>.» He said: &#8216;You have spoken the truth.&#8217; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">So we were amazed at him, asking him the question and then stating that he had spoken the truth</span>.<sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">50</span>]</sup></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong><em>Islaam</em> is that you testify</strong> <strong>that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah <em><u>s</u>allallaahu `alaihiwasallam</em>, and you establish the prayer, give <em>Zakaah</em>, fast <em>Ramadaan</em>, and perform pilgrimage to the House if are able to make your way to it</strong>» The Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> mentioned to him the pillars of <em>Islaam</em> which are essential and are such that if they are implemented, <em>Islaam</em> is brought about. And whatever is extra to them from the other matters, then they are matters of completion. The Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> limited himself to an explanation of the pillars of <em>Islaam</em> since the shorter an answer is, the easier it will be for the student and the listener. It will be easy for him to memorize and preserve it. Whereas, if the answer is prolonged, it becomes difficult and confusing for those who are present, and perhaps most of them will not comprehend it. Therefore, this is a proof that a person who is questioned &#8211; it is befitting that he should strive to make an abridgement as far as he is able to and he should limit himself to that which is necessary. Otherwise, the fact is that <em>Islaam</em> is more than that. These are its pillars and its supports which it stands upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>He said:</strong> <strong>You have spoken the truth</strong>» This was a second amazing thing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: «<strong>We were amazed at him, asking him a question and then saying that he had spoken the truth</strong>» It showed that he was a person of knowledge. He was not asking in the manner of a person who is ignorant, rather he was asking and he had knowledge as is shown by the fact that he said: «<strong>You have spoken the truth</strong>.» That proves that he was a person of knowledge. Therefore, why he did ask the question?</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قال : فأخبرني عن الإيمان ، قال» :<strong>أن</strong> <strong>تؤمن</strong> <strong>بالله</strong> <strong>،</strong> <strong>وملائكته</strong> <strong>،</strong> <strong>وكتبه</strong> <strong>،</strong> <strong>ورسله</strong> <strong>،</strong><strong>  </strong><strong>واليوم</strong> <strong>الآخر</strong> <strong>،</strong> <strong>وتؤمن</strong> <strong>بالقدر</strong> <strong>خيره</strong> <strong>وشره</strong> «، قال : صدقت.</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">He said: &#8216;Inform me about <em>eemaan</em>.&#8217; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">He said: «<strong>It is that you have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) in Allaah, in His Angels, in His Books, in His Messengers, in the Last Day, and you have <em>eemaan</em> in the pre-decree, the good of it and the bad of it</strong>.» </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">He said: &#8216;You have spoken the truth.&#8217;</span> <sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">51</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">51</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>«He said: &#8216;Inform me about <em>eemaan</em>.&#8217; He said:</strong> «<strong>It is that you have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) in Allaah, in His Angels, in His Books, in His Messengers, in the Last Day, and you have <em>eemaan</em> in the pre-decree, the good of it and the bad of it</strong>»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> mentioned to him the six pillars of <em>eemaan</em> after he mentioned the pillars of <em>Islaam</em>.<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Islaam</em> and <em>eemaan</em>, when they are mentioned together, <em>Islaam</em> means outward actions and <em>eemaan</em> means inward actions, the actions of the heart and what occurs in it with regard to <em>ta<u>s</u>deeq</em> (affirmation) and <em>`ilm</em> (knowledge). Both <em>Islaam</em> and <em>eemaan</em> are essential together, <em>Islaam</em> being the outward actions and <em>eemaan</em> being the inward actions, because of his saying <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">»<strong>الإسلام</strong> <strong>علانية</strong> <strong>،</strong> <strong>والإيمان</strong> <strong>في</strong> <strong>القلب</strong>«</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong><em>Islaam</em> is apparent and <em>eemaan</em> is in the heart</strong>.»<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If both are mentioned together, each one has a separate and specific meaning to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one of them is mentioned on its own, the other one enters within it. If <em>eemaan</em> is mentioned on its own, <em>Islaam</em> enters within it. If <em>Islaam</em> is mentioned on its own, <em>eemaan</em> enters into it, because <em>Islaam</em> will not be correct without <em>eemaan</em> and <em>eemaan</em> will not be correct without <em>Islaam</em>. Both are essential.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are inseparably linked, therefore they say: <em>Islaam</em> and <em>eemaan</em> are from those titles which when they come together, they separate, and when they occur singularly, they come together. Meaning: each of them enters into the other one, because they are inseparably linked and one cannot be separated from the other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, he asked him about the outward actions and about the inward actions. And he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> explained to him the pillars of both <em>Islaam</em> and <em>eemaan</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قال : أخبرني عن الإحسان ، قال» : أن تعبد الله كأنك تراه ، فإن لم تكن تراه فإنه  يراك ، «قال : فأخبرني عن الساعة ، قال» : ما المسئول عنها بأعلم من السائل.  «</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">He said: Inform me about <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em>. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">He said: «<strong>That you worship Allaah as if you were seeing Him, and even though you do not see Him, He, certainly, sees you</strong>.» </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">He said: &#8216;Inform me about the Last Hour.&#8217; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">He said: «<strong>The one who is being asked about it does not know any better than the one who is asking</strong>.»</span><sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">52</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">52</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>He said: Inform me about <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em>. He said</strong>: «<strong>That you worship Allaah</strong>&#8230;» It has already preceded that the person of <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em> is the person who worships Allaah as if He were actually seeing Him, and upon certainty as if he were seeing Allaah. Or that he worships Him upon the basis of his being observed and he knows that Allaah sees him, therefore he perfects the action, because Allaah is observing him. So, the person of <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em> worships Allaah, either seeing Him with his heart &#8211; and that is more complete &#8211; or upon the basis that he is being watched. And he knows that Allaah is seeing him in whatever place and with whatever action he is doing. This is <em>Al i<u>h</u>saan.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>He said: &#8216;You have spoken the truth. Inform me about the Last Hour</strong>.&#8217; Meaning: about the establishment of the Hour. When will it be? This question &#8211; the answer of it is not known to anyone, except to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, because the establishment of the Hour &#8211; its appointed time is not known except to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We know that the Hour will be established. We have no doubt about that. Whoever doubts that, then he is a disbeliever. We know that the Hour will be established and it will certainly occur. However, the time at which Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, will establish the Hour, He has not informed us about it and He has not explained it to us. He has kept it secret within His Knowledge. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah! With Him is the knowledge of the Hour</strong></span>.» [31:34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ السَّاعَةِ أَيَّانَ مُرْسَاهَا ۖ قُلْ إِنَّمَا عِلْمُهَا عِندَ رَبِّي ۖ لَا يُجَلِّيهَا لِوَقْتِهَا إِلَّا هُوَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They ask you about the Hour: &#8216;When will it come about?&#8217; Say: &#8216;Its knowledge is with my Lord alone. None can reveal its time but He</strong></span>.&#8217;» [7:187]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is the One who knows it, He the Perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَعِندَهُ مَفَاتِحُ الْغَيْبِ لَا يَعْلَمُهَا إِلَّا هُوَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And with Him are the keys to the hidden and unseen, none knows them but He</strong></span>.» [6:59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From it [the hidden and unseen] is the time and establishment of the Hour.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> said to Jibreel: «<strong>The one who is being asked about it does not know any better than the one who is asking</strong>» Meaning: I and you are the same. We do not know when the Hour will be established. Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, did not make anyone aware of that, neither the Angels, the Messengers, nor anyone. Rather, He kept it secret in His Knowledge, He the Perfect and most High.</p>

<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قال : فأخبرني عن أماراﺗﻬا ، قال» : أن تلد الأمة ربتها«</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">He said: &#8216;Then inform me about its signs.&#8217; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">He said: «<strong>That the slave-girl will give birth to her mistress</strong>.»</span><sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">53</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">53</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>He said: &#8216;Then inform me about its signs&#8217;</strong>: (الأمارات) is the plural of (أمارة). It means the sign. As for (الإمارة) with the <em>kasrah</em>, then it means <em>al-wilaayah</em> (leadership).<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8216;Inform me about its signs&#8217;</strong>: Meaning: the signs which indicate the closeness of its Establishment. Yes. The Hour has signs, and Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, has made them clear. From them are the smaller signs, from them are major signs and from them are the intermediate signs. And from them are signs which are very close to the Hour that will occur at its establishment. They will be close to its establishment. As for the other signs, then they come before that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars say: The signs for the hour are of three types: Smaller signs which come [quite some time] before it, intermediate signs, and major signs. The lesser and intermediate signs have already occurred or most of them have occurred. As for the major signs: the appearance of the <em>Dajjaal</em>, the descent of `Eesaa (<em>`alaihissalaam</em>), the emergence of the beast, and the emergence of <em>Ya&#8217;jooj</em> and <em>Ma&#8217;jooj</em>. These will occur at the actual establishment of the Hour and will quickly follow on in succession.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>He said: &#8216;Inform me about its signs&#8217;</strong>: Since its signs are known, the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> answered him and said: «<strong>That the slave-girl will give birth to her mistress</strong>.» This is from the signs of the Hour. The slave girl [meaning] one who is owned and <em>rabbataha</em> means her female-owner (mistress).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">»<strong>وأن</strong> <strong>ترى</strong> <strong>الحفاة</strong> <strong>العراة</strong> <strong>العالة</strong> <strong>رعاء</strong> <strong>الشاء</strong> <strong>يتطاولون</strong> <strong>في</strong> <strong>البنيان</strong> «.</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">«<strong>And that you will see barefoot, unclothed, destitute shepherds vying with each other in building tall buildings</strong>.»</span><sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">54</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[54] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>That the slave-girl will give birth to her mistress</strong>.» The explainer said: Its meaning, and Allaah knows best, is that towards the end of time, there will be many captives or slaves taken, meaning: there will be many occurrences of intercourse with slave-girls, meaning: the owned slave-girls. They will give birth to daughters and the slave-girl&#8217;s daughter will be a free woman and she will be a mistress to her mother and an owner of her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also said: Its meaning is that disobedience to parents will be abundant such that the daughter will act as if she is a mistress to her mother.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>And that you will see barefoot</strong>»: This is a second sign.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Barefoot</strong>»: Those who have no shoes because of poverty and destitution.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Unclothed</strong>» Those who do not have clothing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Destitute</strong>» The poor and needy people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Shepherds</strong>» (<strong>رعاء</strong>) is the plural of (راع), those who shepherd the sheep. In origin, those people are found in the desert areas, in their own dwellings and they move about from one place to another. But at the end of time, they will take residence in the cities and they will build tall palaces and towering buildings. This is from the signs of the Hour, when the desert people change and become modern and they start to vie with each other in tall buildings. They compete with each other in adorning them. This was not from their custom in any way. They will change to be rich people, having wealth and people who manifest it [i.e. what they have]. This is from the signs of the Hour.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as you know, the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> did not speak from his own desires, just as you know today, how the condition of the people is. The peoples conditions have changed. The poor have turned into rich people having vast riches. The desert people have become modernized and they have competed in building tall buildings. This is in confirmation of the truth of what Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> said.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قال : فمضى ، فلبثنا مليا ، فقال» : <strong>يا</strong> <strong>عمر</strong> <strong>أتدري</strong> <strong>من</strong> <strong>السائل</strong> ؟ «قلت : الله ورسوله أعلم ، قال» : هذا جبريل أتاكم يعلمكم أمر دينكم «</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">He said: Then he went away and we remained for some time. So he said: «<strong>O&#8217; `Umar! Do you know who the questioner was?</strong>» I said: &#8216;Allaah and His Messenger know best.&#8217; He said: «<strong>This was Jibreel, he came to you to teach you the affair of your religion</strong>.»</span><sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">55</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">55</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>He said: Then he went away and we remained for some time</strong>: Meaning: for a short time.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> then said: </strong>«<strong>O `Umar! Do you know who the questioner was?</strong>» Do you [people] know who the questioner was?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one narration the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">»علي بالرجل«</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Bring the man to me</strong>.»<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, they looked for him, but could not find him.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>He said</strong>: «<strong>This was Jibreel, he came to you to teach you the affair of your religion</strong>.» The one who entered and asked these questions was Jibreel <em>`alaihissalaam</em>. He came in the form of a man, just as was described, in order to teach those present the affairs of the religion in the manner of question and answer.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>This <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> proves a number of tremendous matters: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: The religion is divided into three levels: <em>Islaam</em>, <em>eemaan</em>, and <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em>, each level being higher than the one before it. Each level has pillars: The pillar of <em>Islaam</em>, the pillars of <em>eemaan</em>, and <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em> is a single pillar.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: It shows teaching by way of questions and answers. This is a teaching method which succeeds, because it is better for arousing attention and conveying knowledge if the person is questioned. His mind is therefore made ready and he seeks the answer. So, he seeks the answer and then he gives the answer to him, and he is desiring it, so this will establish it firmly.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly</strong>: In the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> there is a proof that whoever is asked about some knowledge and he does not know, then it is upon him to say: Allaah and His Messenger know best. He should refer knowledge back to the one who knows it. He should not speak with an answer when he does not know it and he should not make a guess. This is not permissible. The Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>, when he was asked about the Hour, he said: «<strong>The one who is being asked about it does not know any better than the one who is asking</strong>.» And when he said to the Companions: «<strong>Do you know who the questioner was?</strong>» They did not know him, they said: Allaah and His Messenger know best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This shows that with regard to matters relating to the <em>Islaamic</em> legislation and that of the religion, it is not permissible to speak about them based upon conjecture, because this will be a case of <em>takalluf</em> (unnecessary overburdening oneself). However, whoever has knowledge should respond and whoever does not have knowledge should say: &#8216;Allaah knows best.&#8217; And whoever says: &#8216;I do not know,&#8217; has given a response.<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Imaam</em> Maalik (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) was asked forty questions and he gave an answer to six of them. With regard to the rest, he said: &#8216;I do not know.&#8217; So questioner said to him: &#8216;I have come from such-and-such place. I have traveled and tired out my riding animal and you say: &#8216;I do not know?&#8217; So he said: &#8216;Ride your animal and go back to the land which you came from and say: &#8216;I asked Maalik and he said: &#8216;I do not know.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is not a defect that when a person does not know an answer regarding matters of the <em>Islaamic</em> legislation that he should say: &#8216;I do not know.&#8217; Even if he is a scholar. The Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> said: «<strong>The one who is being asked about it does not know any better than the one who is asking</strong>.»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>, when he was asked certain questions and he did not possess revelation from Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, he would wait until the revelation descended from Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. Do you not recite [a number of times]: &#8216;They ask you about such-and-such. They ask you about such-and-such. Then say: &#8216;Such-and-such.&#8217;</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْخَمْرِ وَالْمَيْسِرِ ۖ قُلْ فِيهِمَا إِثْمٌ كَبِيرٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong><span style="color:#008000;">They ask you about intoxicants and gambling. Say: &#8220;In them is a great sin.</span>&#8220;</strong>» [2:219]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْأَهِلَّةِ ۖ قُلْ هِيَ مَوَاقِيتُ لِلنَّاسِ وَالْحَجِّ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They ask you about the crescent moons. Say: &#8220;They are signs to mark time periods for the people and for the Hajj</strong>.</span>&#8220;» [2:189]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>, when he was asked a question and he did not have an answer, he would wait until revelation came down to him from Allaah. So that should be even more the case with anyone else besides him. He should wait until he asks someone else or until he researches the matter in the books of the people of knowledge to attain the answer. As for being hasty, then this is extremely dangerous and it contains showing bad manners towards Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, since the one who gives the answer is answering about Allaah&#8217;s legislation. He is saying: &#8216;Allaah has made such-and-such permissible,&#8217; or &#8216;He has made such-and-such forbidden,&#8217; or &#8216;He has legislated such-and-such.&#8217; So the matter is extremely dangerous.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The fourth matter</strong>: The <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> contains a proof for the manners of the student. Jibreel was the noblest one of the angels, he sat in front of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and placed his knees against the knees of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and placed his hands upon his thighs and asked with good manners. This was in order to teach the people good manners with which they should adopt towards the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a part of what the <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> indicates and it contains.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The fifth matter</strong>: It is an explanation of some of the signs of the Hour. He mentioned two signs: that the slave-girl will give birth to her mistress and some of the scholars say: its meaning «<strong>the slave-girl will birth to her mistress</strong>» is that disobedience and bad treatment towards the parents will be frequent at the end of time. So the daughter becomes as if she is one in charge of her mother, commanding her and forbidding her and being stern with her.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Belief in the Messengers</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah sent all of the messengers as bringers of good tidings and as warners, and the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">رُّسُلًا مُّبَشِّرِينَ وَمُنذِرِينَ لِئَلَّا يَكُونَ لِلنَّاسِ عَلَى اللَّهِ حُجَّةٌ بَعْدَ الرُّسُلِ ۚ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ عَزِيزًا حَكِيمًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Messengers were sent as bringers of glad tidings and as warners so that the people should have no excuse with Allaah after the sending of the messengers. And Allaah is ever All Mighty, All Wise.</span> </strong>[4:165] <sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">74</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">74</span>]:<strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Eemaan</em> in the Messengers is one of the six pillars of <em>eemaan</em>; he <em>sallallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> said:<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“</strong><strong><em>Eemaan</em></strong><strong> is that you truly believe in Allaah and in His Angels and in His Books and in His Messengers&#8230;”</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Hadeeth reported by al Bukhaaree (50) and Muslim (8,9 &amp; 10) from the hadeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>i Allaahu‘ anhu</em>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So having eemaan in the Messengers is one of the pillars of eemaan; so it is essential to have eemaan in all of the messengers, from the first of them to the last of them. So whoever denies a single messenger, then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) in all of them, just as He, the Most High, said:<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَكْفُرُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَيُرِيدُونَ أَن يُفَرِّقُوا بَيْنَ اللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَيَقُولُونَ نُؤْمِنُ بِبَعْضٍ وَنَكْفُرُ بِبَعْضٍ وَيُرِيدُونَ أَن يَتَّخِذُوا بَيْنَ ذَٰلِكَ سَبِيلًا &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">أُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْكَافِرُونَ حَقًّا ۚ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لِلْكَافِرِينَ عَذَابًا مُّهِينًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Those who disbelieve in Allaah and in His Messengers want to make a distinction between believing in Allaah and in His Messengers and they say, “We believe in some of them and we disbelieve in some.”</strong></span><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they wish to take a path in between that. They are the disbelievers in truth and We have prepared a humiliating punishment for the disbelievers. </strong></span>[4:150-151]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there must be <em>eemaan</em> in all of the Messengers from the first of them to the last of them, those whom Allaah has named from them in His Book, and those He has not named. For the Messengers are many; and therefore there occurs in the hadeeth that they number:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“One hundred and twenty four thousand (prophets) and the messengers from them were three hundred and fifteen all together.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[Hadeeth reported by Ahmad in his <em>Musnad</em> from the hadeeth of Aboo Umaamah al Baahilee <em>ra<u>d</u>i Allaahu ‘anhu</em> and declared to be <em>saheeh</em> by al Albaanee in as Saheehah (2668)]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there were many messengers; from them were those whom Allaah named in His Book and from them were those He did not name. So it is obligatory upon us to have eemaan in all of them, from the first of them to the last of them.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">: وأولُهُمْ نوحٌ عليهِ السلامُ، وآخِرُهُم محمدٌ صلى الله عليه وسلم وهو خاتِمُ النَّبيينَ والدليلُ على أنَّ أوَّلُهُم نوح قوله تعالى</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And the first of them was Nooh, ‘<em>alaihissalaam</em>, and the last of them was Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>; and the proof that the first of them was Nooh, ‘<em>alaihissalaam</em>, is His saying, He the Most High:</span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّا أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ كَمَا أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَىٰ نُوحٍ وَالنَّبِيِّينَ مِن بَعْدِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We have sent you </strong>(O Muhammad), <strong>with Revelation, just as We sent Revelation to Nooh and to the prophets who came after him </strong></span>[4:163] <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>75</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">75</span>]:<strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof that the first of them was Nooh is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; إِنَّا أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We sent revelation to you…</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was an address to the Prophet <em>sallallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> كَمَا أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَىٰ نُوحٍ وَالنَّبِيِّينَ مِن بَعْدِهِ ۚ وَأَوْحَيْنَا إِلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَالْأَسْبَاطِ وَعِيسَىٰ وَأَيُّوبَ وَيُونُسَ وَهَارُونَ وَسُلَيْمَانَ ۚ وَآتَيْنَا دَاوُودَ زَبُورًا </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>… just as We sent revelation to Nooh and the prophets who came after him; and We sent revelation to Ibraaheem and Isma’eel and Is-haaq and Ya’qoob and to the tribes </strong>(of Banu Israeel)<strong> and to ‘Eesaa and Ayyoob and Yoonus and Haaroon and Sulaymaan; and We gave the Zaboor to Daawud. </strong></span>[4:163]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah mentioned a number of their names together in this aayah, just as He mentioned a number of their names together in the aayah from Soorah al An’aam:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِهِ دَاوُودَ وَسُلَيْمَانَ وَأَيُّوبَ وَيُوسُفَ وَمُوسَىٰ وَهَارُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And from his descendants were Daawood and Sulaymaan and Ayyoob and Yoosuf and Moosaa and Haaroon…</span> </strong>[6:84]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">to the end of the aayaat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the first of them was Nooh  &#8211; <em>‘alaihissalaatu wassalaam</em> – as proven by His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> .. وَالنَّبِيِّينَ مِن بَعْدِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the prophets who came after him…</strong></span> [4:163]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah sent him (Nooh) to his people when they went beyond the limits (<em>ghuloo</em>) concerning the righteous people after the people had been upon the religion of <em>Tawheed</em> from the time of Aadam <em>‘alaihissalaam</em> for ten generations and they were upon <em>Tawheed</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when the people of Nooh came, there were amongst (those people) righteous men. Then when those righteous men died, the people grieved severely for them. So Satan seized the opportunity and said to them, “<em>Make images of those righteous people and set them up in the places where you sit in order that when you see these images, you will remember their condition and you will gain enthusiasm upon worship</em>.” So therefore they made images of those dead people and they set them up in the sitting places but they (these images) were not worshipped to begin with because of the presence of scholars who used to explain <em>Tawheed</em> to the people and used to criticize shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then when the people of knowledge died and the first generation passed away, a later generation came &#8211; and the scholars had died – Satan came and said to them, “<em>Your forefathers only erected these images in order to worship them and they used to seek rain near them (these images)</em>.” So he made worship of them seem to be good, so they worshipped them besides Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in this way, shirk came about upon the Earth; so Allaah therefore sent His Prophet Nooh  &#8211; <em>‘alaihissalaatu wassalaam</em> – calling them to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and seeking to return them to <em>Tawheed</em>, which was the religion of their forefather Aadam – ‘alaihissalaam.  However they (Nooh’s people) were obstinate and haughty:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَالُوا لَا تَذَرُنَّ آلِهَتَكُمْ وَلَا تَذَرُنَّ وَدًّا وَلَا سُوَاعًا وَلَا يَغُوثَ وَيَعُوقَ وَنَسْرًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they said, “Do not forsake those objects that you worship! Do not forsake Wadd nor Suwaa’ nor Yaghooth nor Ya’ooq nor Nasr.</span> </strong>[71:23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Abbaas said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« هذه أسماء رجال صالحين ، صوروا صورهم ونصبوها على مجالسهم فآل ﺑﻬم الأمر إلى أن عبدوها من دون الله »</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“These were the names of righteous men; they made images of them and they set them up in their sitting places, and this eventually led them to worshipping them besides Allaah.”</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Hadith Reported by al Bukhaaree as narration 4920]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when Nooh – <em>‘alaihissalaatu wassalaam</em> &#8211; came to them and forbade them from worshipping them and he commanded them to worship Allaah, they said, “<em>Do not abandon those objects that you worship; do not obey Nooh but rather continue upon your kufr and transgression and obstinacy!</em>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the first shirk that occurred upon the Earth and its cause was the images. And therefore the Prophet <em>sallallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« إن أشد الناس عذابا عند الله يوم القيامة المصورون »</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The people who will receive the severest punishment on the Day of Resurrection will be those who make images.”</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Hadith Reported by al Bukhaaree (5950) and Muslim (2109) from hadeeth of ‘Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood <em>ra<u>d</u>i Allaahu ‘anhu</em>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« إن الذين يصنعون هذه الصور يعذبون يوم القيامة ، يقال لهم : أحيوا ما خلقتم »</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Those people who make these images will be punished on the Day of Resurrection. It will be said to them, “Give life to that which you have created.”</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Hadith Reported by al Bukhaaree (5951) and Muslim  (2108) from hadeeth of ‘Abdullaah ibn ‘Umar  <em>ra<u>d</u>i Allaahu‘ anhumaa </em>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They will be commanded to breathe the spirit of life into these images; and this will be a case of <em>ta’jeez</em> (giving them a command to show their inability) and as a punishment for them, and Allaah’s refuge is sought. This is because making images is a route from the routes which lead to shirk, just as happened with the people of Nooh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the first of the Messengers was Nooh. And as for the seal of the Messengers and the last of them, then he was Muhammad <em>sallallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَّا كَانَ مُحَمَّدٌ أَبَا أَحَدٍ مِّن رِّجَالِكُمْ وَلَٰكِن رَّسُولَ اللَّهِ وَخَاتَمَ النَّبِيِّينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Muhammad is not the father of any of your men but rather he is the Messenger of Allaah and the final one of the prophets</span>. </strong>[33:40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« وأنا خاتم النبيين لا نبي بعدي »</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>I am the seal of the Prophets; there will be no prophet after me.</strong><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[Hadith Reported by Aboo Daawud (4252) and at Tirmidhee from hadeeth of Thawbaan <em>ra<u>d</u>i Allaahu ‘anhu</em> and declared <u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> by al Albaanee]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So through him, the Heavenly Messages were concluded. So no prophet will be raised and sent after him until the Hour is established. However his <em>Sharee’ah</em> (Revealed Law) will remain until the Hour is established and his religion will remain until the Hour is established, as has preceded.  So whoever claims Prophethood after Muhammad <em>sallallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> then he is a disbeliever; and whoever believes (this false claimant to Prophethood) then he (too) is a disbeliever in Allaah, because there will be no prophet after him <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And many people have claimed Prophethood after him; and Allaah has exposed them and has made their falsehood apparent. And from the last of them – in what we know – was al Qaadiyaanee, Ghulaam Ahmad al Qaadiyaanee, the Indian; the one who in the beginning claimed to be upon knowledge and worship, then he claimed that he was ‘Eesaa ibn Maryam, then he claimed Prophethood. And he now has followers who call themselves the Qaadiyaanees. And the Muslims have declared them to be disbelievers and they have shunned them and counted them as being a disbelieving sect  outside of Islaam. And they are a people who are shunned and banished – and all praise is for Allaah – from the lands of the Muslims. And they (the Qaadiyaanees) are active (in dawah). However their activities end in failure.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, in summary, there will be no prophet after the Messenger of Allaah <em>sallallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>. Whoever claims prophet hood after him, then he is a great liar, just as he <em>sallallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« لا تقوم الساعة حتى يبعث دجالون كذابون ، قريبا من ثلاثين كلهم يزعم أنه رسول الله »</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The Hour will not be established until <em>dajjaals</em> (great tricksters), great liars are sent, close to thirty, each one of them claiming that he is a messenger of Allaah.”</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Hadith Reported by al Bukhaaree (3609) and Muslim after the narration 2923 in the Book of Trials and Tribulations from the hadeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>i Allaahu ‘anhu</em>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who claim falsely to be prophets are many but Allaah exposes their affair and uncovers them and shows how debased they are to the people. And whoever believes them, then he is a disbeliever because he is denying the Truth of what has been said by Allaah and His Messenger <em>sallallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and the consensus of the Muslims upon the fact that Prophethood was concluded with Muhammad <em>sallallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And Allaah sent a Messenger to every nation, from Nooh until Muhammad, commanding them to worship Allaah alone, and forbidding them from the worship of <em>at-taaghoot</em> and the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِي كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولًا أَنِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُوا الطَّاغُوتَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We certainly sent a messenger to every nation ordering them that they should worship Allaah </strong>(alone)<strong> and they should shun the</strong> <strong><em>Taaghoot</em></strong> </span>[16:36] <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>76</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">76</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying: “<strong>Allaah sent a messenger to every nation</strong>…”, Meaning: Allaah sent a messenger to every nation of mankind in order to establish the proof upon them so that they would not be able to say, “<em>No bringer of good tidings nor any warner came to us!</em>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And because of His saying, He the Most High:<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَا كُنَّا مُعَذِّبِينَ حَتَّىٰ نَبْعَثَ رَسُولًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We do not punish until We have sent a messenger. </strong></span>[17:15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah sent a messenger to every nation from the previous nations, just as He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِن مِّنْ أُمَّةٍ إِلَّا خَلَا فِيهَا نَذِيرٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There was not a previous nation except that Allaah sent a warner to them.</strong></span> [35:24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However it is obligatory that we are aware of what was the call of the Messengers? The call of all the messengers, from the first of them to the last of them, was the call to tawheed as per His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِي كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولًا أَنِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُوا الطَّاغُوتَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We certainly sent a messenger to every nation ordering them that they should worship Allaah </strong>(alone)<strong> and they should shun the <em>taaghoot</em>.</strong> </span>[16:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So everything that is worshipped besides Allaah is <em>Taaghoot</em>, as will follow with regards to the types of the <em>Taaghoots</em> – that from their types is that which is worshipped besides Allaah whilst he is pleased with that, as will follow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the meaning of His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> .. وَاجْتَنِبُوا الطَّاغُوتَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And shun the Taaghoot…</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">means to keep away from worshipping the false objects of worship and the idols and the graves and the tombs; these are <em>taaghoots</em>. So the noble <em>aayah</em> proves that the call of the Messengers, all of them, was concentrated upon <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em> from the first of them to the last of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as He, the Perfect and Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلَّا نُوحِي إِلَيْهِ أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا أَنَا فَاعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We did not send any messenger before you except that We revealed to him that none has the right to be worshipped except Me so worship Me alone.</strong></span> [21:25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يُنَزِّلُ الْمَلَائِكَةَ بِالرُّوحِ مِنْ أَمْرِهِ عَلَىٰ مَن يَشَاءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ أَنْ أَنذِرُوا أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا أَنَا فَاتَّقُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He (Allaah) sends down the angels with the Revelation from His Command to whomever He wishes from His servants ordering them, “Warn the people that none has the right to be worshipped except Me, so therefore fear and be dutiful to Me.” </strong></span>[16:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the call of the Messengers, all of them, was to <em>tawheed</em> and to singling out Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, with worship and to forbidding shirk. This was the call of the Messengers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then after <em>tawheed</em> comes the Revealed Laws with regards to the <em>halaal</em> (permissible) and the <em>haraam</em> (forbidden). And the details of the Revealed Laws varied in accordance with the variation between the nations and the needs of the nations. And Allaah abrogated from them whatever He wished, and then all of them were abrogated through the Revealed Law of Islaam &#8211; the <em>halaal</em> and the <em>haraam</em>, the rulings and the acts of worship and the commands and the prohibitions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the foundation (of the Revealed Laws) then it was <em>tawheed</em>; then this did not vary and it was not abrogated. This was a single religion; the religion of all the Messengers from the first of them to the last of them was one religion (in this respect) – just as He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لِكُلٍّ جَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ شِرْعَةً وَمِنْهَاجًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And for each people We laid down a prescribed law and a detailed way to follow.</span> </strong>[5:48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the religion of <em>tawheed</em> is the worship of Allaah with that which He legislated at each time in accordance with its particular circumstances. So if a Revealed Law was abrogated then the people moved onto the new abrogating Law.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever insists and remains upon that which has been abrogated, and avoids that which is abrogating, then he will be a disbeliever in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic because the religion which has been abrogated will not be a religion after its being abrogated. Rather it will only be religion before it was abrogated. So when it has been abrogated, then it will not be religion. The religion will be that which comes later (abrogates). Therefore the Revealed Law of Islaam abrogated whatever came before it from the Revealed religious laws.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever remains upon Judaism or Christianity after the sending of Muhammad <em>sallallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) because he is acting upon a religion which has been abrogated, whose time has come to an end.</p>

<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whoever denies the Resurrection is a disbeliever, and the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">زَعَمَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا أَن لَّن يُبْعَثُوا ۚ قُلْ بَلَىٰ وَرَبِّي لَتُبْعَثُنَّ ثُمَّ لَتُنَبَّؤُنَّ بِمَا عَمِلْتُمْ ۚ وَذَٰلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Those who disbelieve claim that they will not be resurrected. Say </strong>(O Muhammad)<strong>, ‘Yes, by my Lord you will certainly be resurrected and then you will certainly be informed of the deeds which you did. And that is easy for</strong><strong> Allaah. </strong></span>[64:7] <sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">73</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">73</span>]:<strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying: “<strong>Whoever denies the Resurrection is a disbeliever</strong>…” &#8211; because he has denied a pillar from the pillars of eemaan and because he is denying Allaah and to His Messengers and to His Books because Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, informed about the Resurrection and the Messengers informed about the Resurrection and the Books informed about the Resurrection. So whoever denies it then he is a disbeliever. And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">.. زَعَمَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Those who disbelieve <em>za’ama </em>claim…</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Az –za’m</em> means “a lie” ( a false claim)</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَن لَّن يُبْعَثُوا ..</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">…that they will not be resurrected.</span> </strong>[64:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the aayah proves that denying the Resurrection is <em>kufr</em> (disbelief). They say, “there is no resurrection after death” &#8211; the people of <em>shirk</em> and the worshippers of idols in the time of the Prophet <em>sall Allaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> used to dispute about the Resurrection.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَإِذَا كُنَّا عِظَامًا نَّخِرَةً  &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">قَالُوا تِلْكَ إِذًا كَرَّةٌ خَاسِرَةٌ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“How can that occur when we have become crumbled bones?” They said, “That would be a return resulting in loss.” </strong></span>[79:11-12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَن يُحْيِي الْعِظَامَ وَهِيَ رَمِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Who can give life to the bones when they have crumbled to dust?” </strong></span>[36:78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from their disputing was:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَيَعِدُكُمْ أَنَّكُمْ إِذَا مِتُّمْ وَكُنتُمْ تُرَابًا وَعِظَامًا أَنَّكُم مُّخْرَجُونَ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">هَيْهَاتَ هَيْهَاتَ لِمَا تُوعَدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Does he </strong>(the Prophet Saalih) <strong>promise you that when you have become dust and bones that you will then be brought out anew from your graves? How far fetched, how far fetched is what you are being promised.” </strong></span>[23:35-36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; to the rest of the sayings of the disbelievers from the previous nations and from the people of shirk in the time of the Prophet<em> sall Allaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>. So whoever denies the Resurrection then he will be along with those disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No one denies the Resurrection except for a disbeliever. And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, has commanded His Prophet <em>sall Allaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> to swear an oath by Him upon the Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> قُلْ </span><span style="color:#000000;">بَلَىٰ وَرَبِّي </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say,&#8221;Yes, by my Lord…&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an oath.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> لَتُبْعَثُنَّ ثُمَّ لَتُنَبَّؤُنَّ بِمَا عَمِلْتُمْ ..</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;…you will certainly be resurrected </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(from your graves)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, and then you will certainly be informed of the deeds which you did </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(in the world)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">.&#8221; </span></strong>[64:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This aayah is one of the three <em>aayaat</em> in which Allaah commanded His Prophet to swear an oath upon the Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first aayah is from Soorah Yoonus:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَيَسْتَنبِئُونَكَ أَحَقٌّ هُوَ ۖ <span style="color:#0000ff;">قُلْ إِي وَرَبِّي</span> إِنَّهُ لَحَقٌّ ۖ وَمَا أَنتُم بِمُعْجِزِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they question you, “Is is true?” Say, “Yes, by my Lord, it is indeed true and you cannot render Allaah incapable.” </strong></span>[10:53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second is in Soorah Saba’:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا لَا تَأْتِينَا السَّاعَةُ ۖ <span style="color:#0000ff;">قُلْ بَلَىٰ وَرَبِّي</span> لَتَأْتِيَنَّكُمْ عَالِمِ الْغَيْبِ ۖ لَا يَعْزُبُ عَنْهُ مِثْقَالُ ذَرَّةٍ فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَلَا فِي الْأَرْضِ وَلَا أَصْغَرُ مِن ذَٰلِكَ وَلَا أَكْبَرُ إِلَّا فِي كِتَابٍ مُّبِينٍ لِّيَجْزِيَ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌ وَرِزْقٌ كَرِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And those who disbelieve say, “The Hour will not come upon us.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say, “Yes, by my Lord, the Knower of the hidden and the unseen, it shall certainly come upon you. Not even the amount of the tiniest ant in the Heavens or the Earth escapes Him – nor anything smaller nor anything greater  &#8211; except that it is confirmed in a Clear Book.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">In order that He should reward those who believe and do righteous deeds. For them there will be forgiveness and generous provision.</span></strong> [34:3-4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah commanded His Prophet to swear by Him upon the Resurrection and upon the establishment of the Hour.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the third aayah is that which is with us from Soorah at Taghaabun:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">زَعَمَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا أَن لَّن يُبْعَثُوا ۚ <span style="color:#0000ff;">قُلْ بَلَىٰ وَرَبِّي</span> لَتُبْعَثُنَّ ثُمَّ لَتُنَبَّؤُنَّ بِمَا عَمِلْتُمْ ۚ وَذَٰلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Those who disbelieve claim that Allaah will not resurrect them after death.  </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(O Muhammad)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, ‘Yes, by my Lord you will certainly be resurrected (from your graves), and then you will certainly be informed of the deeds which you did (in the world).  And that is easy for Allaah.</span></strong>[64:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Wisdom behind the Resurrection is recompensing the servants for their deeds. And His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>…then you will certainly be informed…</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning – that you will be informed of your deeds and recompensed for them.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Belief in the Resurrection</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And after they have died, the people will be resurrected, and the proof is His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مِنْهَا خَلَقْنَاكُمْ وَفِيهَا نُعِيدُكُمْ وَمِنْهَا نُخْرِجُكُمْ تَارَةً أُخْرَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>From the Earth We created you </strong>(O Mankind)<strong>, and to it We shall return you </strong>(after death)<strong> and from it We shall raise you to life again. </strong></span>[20:55]<sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">70</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">70</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He moved on, to another fundamental principle, which is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>eemaan (true faith) in <em>al-ba’th</em> (the Resurrection)</strong></span> – meaning that death alone is not what is wanted. We know and everyone knows &#8211; even the disbelievers and the atheists and the evil heretics &#8211; all of them know that death will certainly occur. No one denies death, because it is something which is experienced. However the important matter is the Resurrection after death; this is the point of disagreement between the believers and the disbelievers, the Resurrection after death. And it (the Resurrection) is the restoration of the bodies which have rotted away and become decayed bones and dust and which have separated in the Earth. They will be restored and rebuilt just as they were before, because the One who created them in the first place is fully able to bring them back again.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the souls will be blown into them, then they will move and proceed from the graves to the <em>Mahshar</em> (GatheringPlace) because of His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَوْمَ يَخْرُجُونَ مِنَ الْأَجْدَاثِ سِرَاعًا كَأَنَّهُمْ إِلَىٰ نُصُبٍ يُوفِضُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>On the Day when they will come out from the graves, they will be as if they are racing to a finishing post. </strong></span>[70:43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَخْرُجُونَ مِنَ الْأَجْدَاثِ كَأَنَّهُمْ جَرَادٌ مُّنتَشِرٌ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">مُّهْطِعِينَ إِلَى الدَّاعِ ۖ يَقُولُ الْكَافِرُونَ هَٰذَا يَوْمٌ عَسِرٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They will come forth from the graves as if they are scattered locusts, rushing towards the caller. </strong></span>[54:7-8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No one will stay back. So this Resurrection is true, there is no doubt about it. And whoever denies it is a disbeliever in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. And having eemaan in the Resurrection is one of the six pillars of eemaan about which the Prophet <em>sall Allaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“(Eemaan) is that you truly believe in Allaah and in His Angels and in His Books and in His Messengers and in the Last Day  and that you truly believe in Pre-decree, the good of it and the bad of it.”</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Reported by al Bukhaaree (50) and Muslim from the hadeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>i Allaahu ‘anhu </em>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever does not truly believe in the Resurrection and in the Last Day, then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (a disbeliever) in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, even if he bears witness to ‘<em>laa ilaaha ill Allaah</em>’ and that ‘Muhammad <em>rasool ullaah</em>’ and even if he prays and fasts and performs Hajj and gives the <em>Zakaat</em> and does the actions of obedience. If he denies the Resurrection or doubts about it, then he will be a disbeliever in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proofs for the Resurrection are many; from them is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">.. مِنْهَا خَلَقْنَاكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>From it We created you…</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: the Earth, when He created Aadam ‘alaihissalaam, the father of mankind.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">.. وَفِيهَا نُعِيدُكُمْ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And to it We shall return you…</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning; after death, in the graves.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِنْهَا نُخْرِجُكُمْ تَارَةً أُخْرَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And from it We shall bring you out again.</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this aayah includes the beginning and the final return:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مِنْهَا خَلَقْنَاكُمْ وَفِيهَا نُعِيدُكُمْ وَمِنْهَا نُخْرِجُكُمْ تَارَةً أُخْرَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>From it We created you and to it We shall return you and from it We shall bring you out again. </strong></span>[20:55]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also the saying of Allaah, the Most High:<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَاللَّهُ أَنبَتَكُم مِّنَ الْأَرْضِ نَبَاتًا &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ يُعِيدُكُمْ فِيهَا وَيُخْرِجُكُمْ إِخْرَاجًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And Allaah created you from the (dust of) the Earth, then He will cause you to return (to being dust) within the Earth, then He will bring you forth and restore you to</strong><strong> life. </strong></span>[71:17-18] <sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">71</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">71</span>]  <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">.. وَاللَّهُ أَنبَتَكُم مِّنَ الْأَرْضِ نَبَاتًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah created you from the </strong>(dust of)<strong> the Earth…</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When He created Aadam ‘<em>alaihissalaam</em> from it.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">.. </span><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ يُعِيدُكُمْ فِيهَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then He will return you to it…</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Through death and the graves.<em> </em></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَيُخْرِجُكُمْ إِخْرَاجًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He will bring you out from it. </strong></span>[71:17-18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Resurrection. They will come out from the graves and they will proceed to the <em>Ma<u>h</u>-shar</em> (the Gathering Place).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قَالَ فِيهَا تَحْيَوْنَ وَفِيهَا تَمُوتُونَ وَمِنْهَا تُخْرَجُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He said, &#8220;Upon the Earth you will live and upon it you will die and from it you will be brought out.&#8221; </strong></span>[7:25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: you will live upon its surface and you will die upon it and you will come out from it for the Resurrection on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are proofs from the Qur&#8217;aan for the Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also to be found an intellectual proof from the Qur&#8217;aan itself and it is that the One who is able to bring the creation about initially is able to restore the creation even more so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَهُوَ الَّذِي يَبْدَأُ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ وَهُوَ أَهْوَنُ عَلَيْهِ ۚ وَلَهُ الْمَثَلُ الْأَعْلَىٰ فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۚ وَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He</strong> (<strong>Allaah</strong>)<strong> is the One who created the creation to begin with, then He restores it and that is even easier for Him. And for Him is the highest description in the Heavens and the Earth. And He is the All Mighty, the All Wise. </strong></span>[30:27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The One who was able to bring the people into existence from non existence is able to restore them after death even more so. This is a proof which is textual and intellectual.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the proofs for the Resurrection is that which occurs to the Earth with regards to its being brought to life with plants. So you can see the Earth being dead, having no plants upon it, being barren. Then Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, sends down rain upon it, then He causes plants to grow which were dead stubble previously. Likewise the bodies which are within the Earth; they were stored within the Earth and Allaah will send down rain upon them and then the bodies will grow and become complete. And then the souls will be breathed into them. So indeed you see the Earth, how it can be dry and arid, but then it comes to life with that (vegetation) which grows from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Majestic and Most High – He is the One who gives life to the Earth after its death:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ أَنَّكَ تَرَى الْأَرْضَ خَاشِعَةً فَإِذَا أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهَا الْمَاءَ اهْتَزَّتْ وَرَبَتْ ۚ إِنَّ الَّذِي أَحْيَاهَا لَمُحْيِي الْمَوْتَىٰ ۚ إِنَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And from His signs is that you see the Earth dry and barren. Then when We send down water upon it, it rises and stirs to life with vegetation. The One who gives life to it will certainly give life to the dead. Indeed He has full ability over everything</span>. </strong>[41:39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the One who has ability over giving life to the Earth after its death is able to give life to the bodies after their death because both are cases of coming to life after death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the proofs for the Resurrection is that if were to be no Resurrection then that would necessitate that the creation of Mankind was meaningless because they (the people) live  &#8211;  the obedient, dutiful, believer in Allaah and His Messengers live;  and the disbeliever, the atheist, the evil heretic, the wicked tyrant, the arrogant one, the sinner live – all of them live and then they die, without this believer receiving anything from his reward or without this disbeliever and this evil heretic and this atheist and this tyrannical oppressor of the people receiving any of his recompense whatsoever?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So does this befit Allaah that He would leave the people in this manner without rewarding the people of eemaan for their eemaan, and the people who did good for their good, and the people of crimes and disbelief for their crimes and <em>kufr</em>? This would not befit the Wisdom of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, and therefore He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلِلَّهِ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ لِيَجْزِيَ الَّذِينَ أَسَاءُوا بِمَا عَمِلُوا وَيَجْزِيَ الَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُوا بِالْحُسْنَى</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And to Allaah belongs whatever is in the Heavens and in the Earth, so that He will recompense those who did evil for what they did and He will reward those who did good with the best reward. </strong></span>[53:31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this will not occur except on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise in His saying, He the Perfect:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَمْ حَسِبَ الَّذِينَ اجْتَرَحُوا السَّيِّئَاتِ أَن نَّجْعَلَهُمْ كَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ سَوَاءً مَّحْيَاهُمْ وَمَمَاتُهُمْ ۚ سَاءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And do those who commit evil deeds think that We will treat them just the same as those who believe and do righteous deeds in their life and in their death? Evil is the judgment that they make. </strong></span>[45:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And, He the Perfect and Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَمْ نَجْعَلُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ كَالْمُفْسِدِينَ فِي الْأَرْضِ أَمْ نَجْعَلُ الْمُتَّقِينَ كَالْفُجَّارِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Shall We make those who truly believe and who do righteous deeds just like those who cause corruption upon the Earth? Or shall We make those who are dutiful to Allaah just the same as the wicked evil doers? </strong></span>[38:28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Perfect and Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَفَحَسِبْتُمْ أَنَّمَا خَلَقْنَاكُمْ عَبَثًا وَأَنَّكُمْ إِلَيْنَا لَا تُرْجَعُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do you think that We created you without purpose and that you will not be returned to Us? </strong></span>[23:115]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَيَحْسَبُ الْإِنسَانُ أَن يُتْرَكَ سُدًى &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">أَلَمْ يَكُ نُطْفَةً مِّن مَّنِيٍّ يُمْنَىٰ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ كَانَ عَلَقَةً فَخَلَقَ فَسَوَّىٰ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">فَجَعَلَ مِنْهُ الزَّوْجَيْنِ الذَّكَرَ وَالْأُنثَىٰ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">أَلَيْسَ ذَٰلِكَ بِقَادِرٍ عَلَىٰ أَن يُحْيِيَ الْمَوْتَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Does man think that he will be left without having duties placed upon him? Was he not a drop of sperm emitted? Then he was a clot of blood and Allaah created him and fully formed him? And produced from him offspring, male and female? Is the One who did that not able to give life to the dead?</span> </strong>[75:36-40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He rebutted the disbeliever who said,</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَن يُحْيِي الْعِظَامَ وَهِيَ رَمِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Who will give life to the bones when they are decayed away? </strong></span>[36:78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ يُحْيِيهَا الَّذِي أَنشَأَهَا أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ ۖ وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ خَلْقٍ عَلِيمٌ  &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُم مِّنَ الشَّجَرِ الْأَخْضَرِ نَارًا فَإِذَا أَنتُم مِّنْهُ تُوقِدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “He who created him in the first place will give life to him; and He has full knowledge of every created thing. He who produces fire for you from the green tree, then you use it to light your own fires</span>. </strong>[36:78-80]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The One who is able to bring out fire which burns from a fresh green tree &#8211; is He not able to give life to the dead?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the evidences for the Resurrection is using as evidence the creation of the Heavens and the Earth. So the One who created these tremendously huge and awesome created things is fully able to restore man to life because the One who is able to do something tremendous will be able to do something less, even more so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَوَلَيْسَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ بِقَادِرٍ عَلَىٰ أَن يَخْلُقَ مِثْلَهُم ۚ بَلَىٰ وَهُوَ الْخَلَّاقُ الْعَلِيمُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Is the One who created the Heavens and the Earth not able to create the like of them? Yes, indeed! And He is the All Knowing Creator who creates again and again.</strong></span> [36:81]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَخَلْقُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ أَكْبَرُ مِنْ خَلْقِ النَّاسِ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The creation of the Heavens and the Earth is greater than the creation of mankind. However most of mankind do not know.</strong></span> [40:57]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are the evidences for the Resurrection which confirm that Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, will resurrect those who are in the graves and that He will recompense every doer of deeds in accordance with his deeds; if good, then with good and if evil, then with evil. So let the disbeliever disbelieve and let the wicked person and the evil heretic and the apostate be upon evil – because in front of him there lies the Resurrection and the Rising from death and the Recompensing and the Reckoning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the believer, the one who is dutiful to Allaah, who worships Allaah and seeks to draw closer to Allaah, then his deeds will never be lost. For there is an appointment where Allaah will recompense him for his deeds and will give him multiplied reward and will give him things that he did not think of or expect.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second Level is <em>Eemaan</em> </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">المرتبة الثانية : الإيمان : وهو بضع وسبعون شعبة ، فأعلاها قول : لا إله إلا الله ، وأدناها إماطة الأذى عن الطريق ، والحياء شعبة من الإيمان </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The second level is <em>al-Eemaan </em></strong>(true faith)<strong> and it has seventy and odd branches, its highest of them is the saying of &#8220;<em>Laa ilaaha illAllaah</em>&#8221; and the lowest of them is removal of that which is harmful from the path; and <em>al-<u>h</u>ayaa</em></strong> (a sense of shame)<strong> is a branch of <em>eemaan</em></strong></span>.<sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">42</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">42</span>] : <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Eemaan</em> is more inclusive than Islaam, so every believer is a Muslim, but not every Muslim is a believer. So <em>eemaan</em> is more inclusive with respect to itself, and it is more specific with regard to its people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Eemaan</em> in the language is <strong><em>at-tasdeeq</em></strong> (to believe, to attest with the heart).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High, said upon the tongue of the brothers of Yoosuf:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> وَمَا أَنتَ بِمُؤْمِنٍ لَّنَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>you won&#8217;t believe us.</strong></span> (12:17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for [the meaning of] <em>eemaan</em> in the legislation, then it is as explained by the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> and <em>Jamaa`ah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Speech of the tongue, belief of the heart, and action of the limbs.<br />
It increases with obedience, and it decreases through sin.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is with this explanation, a reality relating to the legislation, because realities are three: a reality which relates to the language, a reality with regards to the legislation, and a reality relating to people&#8217;s custom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the explanation of <em>eemaan</em> with this explanation is a reality relating to the legislation. So, <em>eemaan</em> moves from the meaning in language to the meaning in Islaamic legislation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, <em>eemaan</em> is: speech upon the tongue &#8211; there has to be speech and acknowledgment with the tongue. And it is belief in the heart, when a person speaks upon his tongue, he must be believing it in his heart, otherwise he will be just like the hypocrites, those who:<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> يَقُولُونَ بِأَلْسِنَتِهِم مَّا لَيْسَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They say with their tongues that which is not in their hearts. </strong></span>[48:11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And speech upon the tongue, and belief in the heart will not suffice, rather there must be action on the limbs also, and carrying out the obligatory duties is essential, and avoiding the prohibitions. So the person does the acts of obedience and he avoids the forbidden acts, all of this is from <em>eemaan</em>. <strong>With this definition, it comprises the whole of the religion</strong>. However, these acts of obedience and these many legislated duties, some of them are a part of the reality of <em>eemaan</em>, and some of them are things which are a completion of <em>eemaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>Eemaan</em> has pillars and branches</strong></span>, and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> explained them in two <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>. He explained the <em>arkaan</em> (pillars) of <em>eemaan</em> in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Jibreel, and he explained the branches of <em>eemaan</em> in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of «<strong><em>Eemaan</em> is seventy and odd branches</strong>». This will follow <em>in shaa&#8217; Allaah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Eemaan</em> and <em>Islaam</em>, if they are mentioned together, then each of them has its own meaning. When only one of them is mentioned, then it enters along with the other. If they are mentioned together, then Islaam is explained to be the outward actions, and they are the five pillars of Islaam, and e<em>emaan</em> is explained to be the inward actions which are the six pillars, and their places are in the heart. All of these must be found together in a Muslim. The Muslim must be one who has <em>eemaan</em> and who establishes the pillars of Islaam and the pillars of <em>eemaan</em> &#8211; he must gather all of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">»الإيمان بضع وسبعون شعبة ، أو بضع وستون شعبة«</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong><em>Eemaan</em> is of seventy and odd branches, or sixty and odd branches</strong>.» There are two narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[Reported by al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree (9) with the wording «sixty and odd» and Muslim (35) with both wordings from a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>i Allaahu `anhu</em>.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying «<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>odd</strong></span>»: it is a number between three and nine. So if it is said: «ten and odd,» then it means a number between thirteen until nineteen, and if it is said «odd» on its own, then it means something between three and nine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying «<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>branches</strong></span>»: a branch is a part of the thing, meaning that the pillars have seventy and odd parts or sections.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying «<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>the highest one of them</strong></span>»: meaning: the highest of the branches is the saying <em>Laa ilaaha illaAllaah</em>.  It is the head of Islaam and it is the head of <em>eemaan</em>, it is the first pillar, and it is the entry point of the religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying «<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>the lowest one of them</strong></span>»: meaning: the last of them and the least one of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying «<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>removing that which is harmful from the path</strong></span>»: meaning: removing that which is harmful from the path which is walked upon. And «<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>that which is harmful</strong></span>» is everything which causes harm to the people, whether it be thorns, rocks, filthy things or refuse, everything which causes harm to people upon their path. And placing that which is harmful upon their path is forbidden, because the path is for those who wish to precede upon it, and harm impedes those who want to proceed, or puts them in danger, such as stopping his car upon the road, this is from causing harm &#8211; and letting water flow out from the house unto the path, this is from harm &#8211; and putting rubbish upon the pathway, this is from causing harm, whether it be upon the road, the town, or in the countryside &#8211; placing a rock, pieces of timber, iron upon the pathways of the people, digging holes in the roads of the people &#8211; all of this is from causing harm. So if a Muslim comes and removes this harm, and clears the path of it, then this is a proof for his <em>eemaan</em>. So, placing that which is harmful upon the path is from the branches of <em>kufr</em>, and removing harm from the path is from the branches of <em>eemaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying «<span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>al-<u>h</u>ayaa</em> (true sense of shame is a branch of <em>eemaan</em>)</strong></span>»: <em>al-<u>h</u>ayaa</em> is a characteristic which Allaah places in a person which leads him to carry out whatever will beautify and adorn him; and which prevents him from things which will contaminate and disfigure him. And <em>al-<u>h</u>ayaa</em> which leads a person to perform that which is good, and to withhold from that which is evil is praiseworthy. As for shame or shyness which prevents a person from doing something good, from seeking knowledge, and from asking about things which are a problem to his understanding, then this is blameworthy shyness. This is because it is blameworthy embarrassment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the pillars of <em>eemaan</em> are many as you have come to know there are seventy and odd. <em>Al-Imaam</em> al-Bayhaqee wrote a large work in which he mentioned the branches of <em>eemaan</em>, it has an abridgment which has been printed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the proofs of the scholars that <em>eemaan</em> is speech upon the tongue, belief in the heart and action on the limbs is his saying <em><u>s</u>allallaahu `alaihi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">» أعلاها لا إله إلا الله «</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">« <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The highest of them is none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah</strong></span>. » This is a proof for sayings. And his saying <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">» أدناها إماطة الأذى عن الطريق «</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">« <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And removal of that which is harmful from the path </strong></span>» is an action. It proves that actions are from <em>eemaan</em>. And his saying <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">» الحياء شعبة من الإيمان «</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">« <span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>al-<u>h</u>ayaa</em> is a branch from <em>eemaan </em></strong></span>.» This is something in the heart, <em>al-<u>h</u>ayaa</em> is in the heart. This is a proof that <em>eemaan</em> is sayings upon the tongue, belief in the heart, and actions upon the limbs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwa no. 21436</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Praise be to Allah Alone and peace and blessings be upon the Last Prophet. To continue,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta&#8217; had read the letter received by his Eminence, the Grand Mufty (Islamic scholar qualified to issue legal opinions) from a number of inquirers whose names are registered at the Secretariat General of the Council of Senior Scholars nos.(5411) ,(1026), (1016),(1395), (1650), (1893), (2106) dated 7/11/1420, 7/2/1421, 7/2/1421, 3/8/1421, 17/3/1421, 25/3/1421, 7/4/1421 A.H., successively.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The inquirers asked many questions to the following effect: Lately, the idea of <em><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/al-murjiah/"><strong>Irja</strong></a></em>&#8216; (a deviant conviction claiming that Faith is restricted to belief not deeds) has dreadfully spread. Many writers have been propagating it, depending on some incomplete quotations from the Shaykh of Islam Ibn Taymiyyah&#8217;s writings, something which leads many people to confusion with respect to the definition of <em>Iman</em> (faith). They try to exclude the element of deeds from the definition of <em>Iman</em>. They claim that anyone who abandons all deeds will still be saved (from Hellfire). This definitely facilitates the committing of sins, acts of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and <em>Riddah</em> (apostasy) for people attain <em>Iman</em> in light of this conviction, even if they do not abide by religious obligations, avoid prohibitions, or act in accordance with Shari`ah (Islamic law). There is no doubt that this conviction has a severe effect on Islamic societies, issues of `<em>Aqidah</em> (creed) and worship. Therefore, I hope Your Eminence will reveal the reality of this conviction and its bad effects, and the truth that is based on the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet). I hope you will also verify the writings reported from Shaykh-ul-Islam so that all Muslims can be sure about and have knowledge of their religion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: After the Committee studied the inquiry, it answered as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The mentioned sayings are attributed to <strong><em>Al-Murji&#8217;ah</em></strong> (a deviant Islamic sect claiming that Faith is restricted to belief not deeds) who exclude deeds from the definition of <em>Iman</em>. They claim that <em>Iman</em> is achieved by belief with the heart and utterance with the tongue, whereas the deeds, according to their view, are a condition for attaining perfection but are not considered a prerequisite for it. Thus, according to their conviction, anyone who believes with their heart and utters with their tongue will be a perfect <em>Mu&#8217;min</em> (believer), even if they abandon obligations and violate prohibitions, they will also be entitled to enter <em>Jannah</em> (Paradise) without observing any good deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>This has led to many null ideas, including the restriction of <em>Kufr</em> (disbelief) to denial of faith and <em>Al-Istihlal</em> (deeming what is <em>Haram</em> (prohibited) to be lawful) by heart. In fact, all these sayings are false, deviant and contradict the Qur&#8217;an, Sunnah and the way of <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah</em> (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream); the predecessors and successors.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>However this opens the door to the people of evil and mischief to deviate away from their religion and be free from Allah&#8217;s (Glorified be He) commands, prohibitions, fear and reverence.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>This also deactivates the concept of Jihad (struggling in the cause of Allah), enjoining good and forbidding evil.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Furthermore, this also equates between good and bad, obedient and disobedient people, a person who abides by Allah&#8217;s Shari`ah and the <em>Fasiq</em> (someone flagrantly violating Islamic law) who abandons His Commands and Prohibitions since deeds do not violate <em>Iman</em> as they claim.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why Imams of Islam concentrated on clarifying the falseness of this conviction and replying to its supporters in the past and the present. They also allocated a chapter for this issue in the books of `<em>Aqidah</em> and compiled complete books in this regard, such as the Shaykh of Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful to him) and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful to him) mentioned in <em>Al-`Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Among the fundamentals of <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah w-Al-Jama`ah</em> is that Din (religion of Islam) and <em>Iman</em> are attained by words and actions and that <em>Iman</em> increases by acts of obedience and decreases by acts of disobedience.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also mentioned in his book Al-Iman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;In this chapter, we find several sayings of the Salaf (righteous predecessors) and the Senior Scholars of Sunnah in explaining <em>Iman</em>. Sometimes they say: It is utterance and action and some others say: utterance, action and intention. Others say: <em>Iman</em> is utterance with the tongue, belief with the heart, and acts with organs. All these definitions are true.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, he (may Allah be merciful to him) added:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The Salaf strictly censured <em>Al-Murji&#8217;ah</em> for excluding actions from <em>Iman</em>. However, their claim that all people have the same degree of <em>Iman</em> is absolutely fraudulent. Belief, love, fear of Allah, knowledge, etc., of people vary from one person to another.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He added:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Regarding this basic origin, <em>Al-Murji&#8217;ah</em> deviated from what was clarified in the Qur&#8217;an, Sunnah, opinions of the <em>Sahabah</em> (Companions of the Prophet) and the <em>Tabi`un</em> (Followers, the generation after the Companions of the Prophet), rather they founded their opinion on their own understanding and linguistic interpretation [of texts]; this is certainly the manner of people of <em>Bid`ahs</em> (innovations in religion).&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among the proofs that indicate that deeds are included in Iman and that they affect it positively or negatively is Allah&#8217;s saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The believers are only those who, when Allâh is mentioned, feel a fear in their hearts and when His Verses (this Qur’ân) are recited unto them, they (i.e. the Verses) increase their Faith; and they put their trust in their Lord (Alone); Who perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât) and spend out of that We have provided them. It is they who are the believers in truth</span>. (Qur&#8217;an &#8211; Surah Al-Anfaal  Verses: 2-4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Successful indeed are the believers. Those who offer their <em>Salât</em> (prayers) with all solemnity and full submissiveness. And those who turn away from <em>Al-Laghw</em> (dirty, false, evil vain talk, falsehood, and all that Allâh has forbidden). And those who pay the <em>Zakât</em>. And those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts, from illegal sexual acts) Except from their wives or (the slaves) that their right hands possess, &#8211; for then, they are free from blame; But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors; Those who are faithfully true to their <em>Amanât</em> (all the duties which Allâh has ordained, honesty, moral responsibility and trusts) and to their covenants; And those who strictly guard their (five compulsory congregational) <em>Salawât</em> (prayers) (at their fixed stated hours). </span>(Qur&#8217;an &#8211; Surah Al-Muminoon  Verses: 1-9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, the Messenger (peace be upon him) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>Iman</em> (Faith) has over seventy branches, the most superior of which is the declaration that there is no deity except Allah, and the lowest of which is the removal of (anything) harmful from the street, and modesty is a branch of Iman.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh-ul-Islam (may Allah be merciful to him) also mentioned inhis book Al-Iman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;The origin of Iman is in the heart, including utterance and action. It is recognition of belief, love and submissiveness. Whatever rests in the heart should be manifest in action. If a person does not act in accordance to it, this indicates absence or weakness of Iman. This is why the visible deeds are a reflection of the <em>Iman</em> of heart and a confirmation to what exists in it. They constitute evidence of it and they are a branch and part of full <em>Iman</em>.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Thinking of what<em> Al-Khawarij</em> and <em>Al-Murji&#8217;ah</em> say with respect to the meaning of <em>Iman</em> reveals that this includes disobedience of the Messenger. Obeying Allah (Exalted be He) and His Messenger (peace be upon him) denotes the perfection of <em>Iman</em>, and that Allah (Exalted be He) would never render a sinner to be a <em>Kafir</em>. <strong>Suppose</strong> that some people went to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and told him: &#8216;We believe in what you have brought us by our hearts and bear witness (that there is no deity except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah) with our tongues, but we do not abide by your commands and prohibitions; as we do not offer prayers, fast, perform Hajj or believe what is told to us; we do not return trusts, fulfill our promises, maintain the ties of kinship or observe any good acts which you ordained us; we drink intoxicants and commit incest and adultery; we kill as many people as we can of your Companions and Ummah (nation) and take their money; we may even kill you too and fight with your enemies against you.&#8217; Can any rational person imagine that the Prophet (peace be upon him) would answer them by saying: &#8216;You are the perfect <em>Mu&#8217;minun</em> (believers) and you are the ones entitled to my intercession on the Day of Resurrection, and it is expected that none of you would enter Hellfire?&#8217; On the contrary, every Muslim indisputably knows that the Prophet (peace be upon him) would have told them: &#8216;You are the most disbelieving people ever to what I came with&#8217; and that he would have executed them if they had not repented.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;When the word of <em>Iman</em> is generally mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah, it is meant with dutifulness, piety, and religion as previously mentioned, for the Prophet (peace be upon him) declared that <em>Iman</em> has over than seventy branches, the best of which is to witness that there is no Deity but Allah, and the least is to remove harm from the road. Therefore, whatever pleases Allah falls under the meaning of <em>Iman</em>. All this is also included in the meaning of dutifulness when generally mentioned, and so are the <em>Taqwa</em> (fear/wariness of offending Allah) and the <em>Din</em> (religion of Islam). It was also narrated that when people asked about Iman, Allah revealed the following Ayah: <span style="color:#008000;">It is not Al-Birr (piety, righteousness, and each and every act of obedience to Allâh, etc.) that you turn your faces</span> .What is meant here is that <em>Iman</em>, which is accompanied by action, is praised, other than that which is devoid of it.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said about Iman; anyone who reports other than this on his authority will be inventing lies against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">Whereas what was mentioned in the Hadith concerning the entrance of some people into <em>Jannah</em> despite that they had never done any good is not absolute to anyone who abandons deeds while being capable of doing them. Rather it is restricted to those who have excuses for abandoning deeds or for any other reason that is consistent with the objectives of Shari`ah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After clarifying this issue, the Permanent Committee warns against arguing over the fundamentals of `<em>Aqidah</em>, because of the serious consequences resulting from this. It recommends resorting to the books of the Righteous Salaf and leading Muslim scholars which are based on the Qur&#8217;an, Sunnah and accounts of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also warns against referring to any books that carry views opposing the original references, or modern books that are issued by authors who have not acquired knowledge through scholars or from original sources. Those people are intruders to this one great fundamental of `<em>Aqidah</em>. They adopt the views of <em>Al-Murji&#8217;ah</em> and falsely attribute them to <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah W-al-Jama`ah</em>, causing confusion to people. They also wrongly ascribe these views to the Shaykh of Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful to him) and other Imams of the Salaf through incomplete quotations. We advise them to fear Allah and to return to the Right Path, and not break the unity (of Muslims) by promoting this deviant belief. The Committee also warns Muslims against being tempted and falling into the trap of those opposing <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah W-al-Jama`ah</em>. May Allah guide everyone to useful knowledge, righteous deeds and good understanding of the religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.<br />

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 50: Points 84-86</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[84] And know that the beginning of Islaam is the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is His slave and His Messenger. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[85] And that whatever Allaah says is just as He said and nothing can contradict what He says and He is true to what He has said. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[86] And to have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in all of the revealed laws.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/know-that-the-beginning-of-islaam-is-ash-shahaadataan" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said, “<strong>And you should know, O Muslim, O <em><u>t</u>aalib al-`ilm</em> (seeker of knowledge),” </strong>meaning you should be certain and understand clearly <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“that the beginning, the first part of Islaam is the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah.” </strong></span>These two are the first pillar from the pillars of Islaam as occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth of Jibreel in which Jibreel <em>`alayhissalaam</em> said to the Prophet<em> <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Tell me about Islaam.” He said, “Islaam is that you testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah and that you establish the prayer and that you give the Zakaat and that you fast Rama<u>d</u>aan and that you perform <u>H</u>ajj to the house if you are able to make the way to it.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <strong><em>Ash-Shahaadataan</em></strong> (the two testifications) are the first thing which mankind is to be called to. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“I have been commanded to fight against the people until they say: &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped except Allaah&#8221;. So if they say it then they have rendered their blood and their property secure from me except on account of a right of Islaam and their reckoning will be with Allaah.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when he (the Prophet) sent Mu`aa<u>dh</u> to Yemen, he said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Indeed you are going to a people from the People of the Scripture, so let the first thing that you call them to be the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the first thing, which the people are to be called to because it is the entry point into the religion of Islaam. As for those who are lax about <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and do not give importance to it from the companions of the various calls and the present day methodologies utilising <em>da`wah,</em> then this is contrary to this tremendous fundamental principle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what is required with regard to the two testifications is not just to pronounce them upon the tongue. Rather, what is required is to state them upon the tongue whilst being aware of their meaning and to act in accordance with what they necessitate. However, whoever testifies that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah then it will be accepted from him. So if he is then upright upon it then he is a Muslim but if something appears from him, which contradicts them then he will be an apostate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the meaning of the testification that <em>Laa ilaaha illallaah</em>, that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah is that you hold as your belief in your heart and that you state upon your tongue and you affirm and you acknowledge that none is deserving of worship (<em>ibaadah)</em> except for Allaah and that everything that is worshipped besides Him is false and futile. And worship of it is false and futile.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْحَقُّ وَأَنَّ مَا يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ هُوَ الْبَاطِلُ وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْكَبِيرُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>That is because Allaah, He is the one who is truly deserving of worship and those whom they worship and invoke besides Him, that is false and futile. And Allaah is the Most High and Exalted One, the Incomparably Great One.</strong></span>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ajj (22), <em>aayah</em> 62)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the meaning of the testification <em>Anna Mu<u>h</u>ammadur-Rusoolullaah</em>; that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah, is that you acknowledge outwardly and inwardly that he is the Messenger of Allaah. As for a person who states it upon his tongue but he does not acknowledge his messengership inwardly then this one is a <em>munaafiq</em> (hypocrite).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>إِذَا جَاءَكَ الْمُنَافِقُونَ قَالُوا نَشْهَدُ إِنَّكَ لَرَسُولُ اللَّهِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ إِنَّكَ لَرَسُولُهُ وَاللَّهُ يَشْهَدُ إِنَّ الْمُنَافِقِينَ لَكَاذِبُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>When the hypocrites come to you </strong>(Mu<u>h</u>ammad<em> <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em></span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, they say, “We testify that you are the Messenger of Allaah.” And Allaah knows that you indeed are His Messenger and Allaah testifies that the hypocrites are certainly liars in their testifying.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Munaafiqoon (63), <em>aayah</em> 1)</p>
<p><strong> يَقُولُونَ بِأَفْوَاهِهِم مَّا لَيْسَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They say with their mouths that which is not in their hearts.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah</em> 167)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the meaning of the testification that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah; <em>Mu<u>h</u>ammadur-Rusoolullaah</em> is, in summary:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>To obey him in whatever he commanded and to attest to the truth of whatever he informed of and to avoid whatever he forbade and prohibited and that Allaah should not be worshipped except with that which He legislated.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>To obey him in whatever he commanded; </strong>so if the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> commanded a matter then you must comply with it.</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا كَانَ لِمُؤْمِنٍ وَلَا مُؤْمِنَةٍ إِذَا قَضَى اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ أَمْرًا أَن يَكُونَ لَهُمُ الْخِيَرَةُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِمْ ۗ وَمَن يَعْصِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلَالًا مُّبِينًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And it is not for a believing man nor for a believing woman when Allaah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any choice with regard to their affair. And whoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger then he has strayed with a clear straying.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-A<u>h</u>zaab (33), <em>aayah</em> 36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>To attest to the truth of whatever he informed of;</strong> he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed about some affairs of the <em>ghaib</em> (the hidden and the unseen) of the past and the future. So, he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is to be believed regarding whatever he informed of and he did not speak from desires.</p>
<p><strong>إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا وَحْيٌ يُوحَىٰ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">It is just revelation sent to him.</span> </strong>(Sooratun-Najm (53), <em>aayah</em> 4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, his <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informing about something is something true and something certain. No doubt can come upon it if it is authentic from him <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the phrase: <strong>“and to avoid whatever he forbade and prohibited,” </strong>avoiding whatever the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> forbade and prohibited, that is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا آتَاكُمُ الرَّسُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَاكُمْ عَنْهُ فَانتَهُوا ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And whatever the Messenger gives you then accept it and whatever he forbids you from, then desist and fear and be dutiful to Allaah. Indeed Allaah is severe in punishment. </strong></span>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ashr (59), <em>aayah</em> 7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And that Allaah is not to be worshipped except with that which He legislated.” </strong>Whatever the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> legislated; conveying it from Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. And this negates innovations and newly introduced affairs and baseless practices, which the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> did not command. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever does an action, which our affair is not in accordance with then it is rejected.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it then it is rejected.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“And beware of newly introduced affairs.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Adhere to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly guided orthodox Khulafaa· </span></strong><span style="color:#808000;">(Caliphs)</span><strong><span style="color:#808000;"> who come after me. Cling onto it and bite upon it with your pre-molar teeth. And beware of the newly introduced affairs for every newly introduced affair is a bid`ah </span></strong><span style="color:#808000;">(innovation)</span><strong><span style="color:#808000;"> and every innovation is a going astray</span><em>.</em></strong><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And every <em>`ibaadah</em> (worship), which the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> did not legislate then it is <em>baatilah</em> (false and futile) and there will be no reward in doing it. Rather, there will be sin in it because it is a <em>bid`ah</em> (innovation) and innovation takes a person further away from Allaah and will not draw him closer to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And you should know that the beginning of Islaam is the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger.” </strong></span>This is the first pillar and it is the entrance. Then after it comes the <em><u>S</u>alaah</em> (prayer) then after it comes the <em>Zakaat</em> then fasting <em>Rama<u>d</u>aan</em> then <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> to Allaah’s sacred house, then the rest of the duties and laws of the religion. All of them follow on from the two testifications; the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And that whatever Allaah said then it is just as He said and none can contradict what He has said and He is true to what He has said.”</span> </strong>Whatever Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, said then it is just as He has said. No doubt can ever come upon it. Allaah, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَنْ أَصْدَقُ مِنَ اللَّهِ حَدِيثًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And who is truer in speech than Allaah. </span><br />
</strong><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> 87)</span></p>
<p><strong>وَمَنْ أَصْدَقُ مِنَ اللَّهِ قِيلًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And who is truer than Allaah in saying.</span><br />
</strong><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> 122)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: no-one is truer than Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. And if Allaah, the Perfect makes a promise (<em>wa`d)</em> then He does not break it.</p>
<p><strong>وَعْدَ اللَّهِ ۖ لَا يُخْلِفُ اللَّهُ وَعْدَهُ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The promise of Allaah, it is a promise of Allaah, Allaah does not break His promises. However, most of mankind do not know that Allaah will certainly carry out His promise. </strong></span>(Sooratur-Room (30), <em>aayah </em>6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, when He makes a promise then He does not break His promise. And if He <em>tawa`adah</em> (threatens) something then He may pardon, He the Perfect and Most High. So there is a difference between <em>al-wa`d</em> (promises) and <em>at-tawa`ud</em> (threats). So <em>al-wa`d</em> (the promise), He never breaks a promise. And as for <em>at-tawa`ud</em> (a threat) that He has made; <em>al-wa`eed</em> (a threat) then Allaah, the Majestic and Most High may pardon and overlook and may not carry out the <em>wa`eed</em> (threat) as a mercy from Him, He, the Perfect, and as a favour from Him, He, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And to have <em>eemaan</em> in all of the revealed laws.” </strong></span>It is obligatory to have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in all of the revealed laws, which Allaah sent down to His Messengers, all of them, in general with regard to those, which have been left unspecified and specifically with regard to those that have been mentioned specifically.</p>
<p><strong>قُولُوا آمَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَمَا أُنزِلَ إِلَيْنَا وَمَا أُنزِلَ إِلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَالْأَسْبَاطِ وَمَا أُوتِيَ مُوسَىٰ وَعِيسَىٰ وَمَا أُوتِيَ النَّبِيُّونَ مِن رَّبِّهِمْ لَا نُفَرِّقُ بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِّنْهُمْ وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُسْلِمُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say, “We truly believe in Allaah and in whatever was sent down to us and in whatever was sent down to Ibraaheem and Ismaa`eel and Is<u>h</u>aaq and Ya`qoob and to the tribes and whatever was given to Moosaa and `Eesaa and whatever the Prophets were given from their Lord. We do not make any distinction between any of them and we submit as Muslims to Him.</strong></span>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah</em> 136)</p>
<p><strong>قُلْ آمَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَمَا أُنزِلَ عَلَيْنَا وَمَا أُنزِلَ عَلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَالْأَسْبَاطِ وَمَا أُوتِيَ مُوسَىٰ وَعِيسَىٰ وَالنَّبِيُّونَ مِن رَّبِّهِمْ لَا نُفَرِّقُ بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِّنْهُمْ وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُسْلِمُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “We have <em>eemaan</em> </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(we truly believe)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> in Allaah and in whatever was sent down to us and in whatever was sent down to Ibraaheem and Ismaa`eel and Is<u>h</u>aaq and Ya`qoob and to the tribes and whatever was given to Moosaa and `Eesaa and to the Prophets from their Lord. We do not make any distinction between them and we are Muslims submitting to Him.</span> </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>84)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, we have <em>eemaan</em> (we truly believe) in all of the divine laws sent down and we truly believe that Allaah, the Majestic and Most High legislates for each time whatever is suitable for it and then He abrogates that with another revealed law, which is suitable for those who come after them. So, when Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was sent, he came with a revealed law, which was firmly grounded and will remain until the Hour is established. It will not be abrogated and it will never be changed. It is suitable for every time and place.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 31 : Point 39</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>واعلم بأن الدنيا دار إيمان وإسلام وأمة محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم فيها مؤمنون مسلمون في أحكامهم ومواريثهم وذبائحهم والصلاة عليهم ولا نشهد لأحد بحقيقة الإيمان حتى يأتي بجميع شرائع الإسلام فإن قصر في شيء من ذلك كان ناقص الإيمان حتى يتوب واعلم أن إيمانه إلى الله تعالى تام الإيمان أو ناقص الإيمان إلا ما أظهر لك من تضييع شرائع الإسلام</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that this world is an abode of <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) and Islaam and the nation of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in it are believers and Muslims with regard to rulings, inheritance, slaughtering animals and with regard to praying the funeral prayer over them. And we do not bear witness for any of them that he is a true believer unless he fulfils all of the duties of Islaam. So if he neglects any of that then he will be deficient in <em>eemaan</em> until he repents and you should know that his <em>eemaan</em> is left to Allaah, the Most High, to judge whether he is complete in <em>eemaan</em> or incomplete in <em>eemaan</em> unless he manifests to you neglect of the Islaamic duties.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/this-world-is-an-abode-of-eemaan-and-islaam" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And you should know that this world is an abode of <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) and Islaam”, </strong>meaning Islaam and <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) are in this world; <em>duniya</em>, which is the abode of action. As for the <em>aakhirah</em> (Hereafter) and it is the abode of <em>jazaa </em>(recompense). So Islaam and <em>eemaan</em> are to be found in this world. As for one who dies on other than Islaam and eemaan then he is a kaafir, a disbeliever and it will not benefit him, that on the Day of Resurrection when he witnesses that which he disbelieved in, that he then believes in it or that he wishes to return and seeks from his Lord that he can return in order to believe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>وَلَوْ تَرَىٰ إِذْ وُقِفُوا عَلَى النَّارِ فَقَالُوا يَا لَيْتَنَا نُرَدُّ وَلَا نُكَذِّبَ بِآيَاتِ رَبِّنَا وَنَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if only you could see when they are held in the Fire and they will say, woe to us, would that we could be sent back into the world and then do not deny the signs of our Lord and so that we could be from the believers.  </strong></span>(Sooratul-An’aam (6), <em>aayah</em> 27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is a distinction between Islaam and <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) because the <em>deen</em> (religion) is of three levels:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><em>Islaam</em></li>
<li><em>Al-eemaan</em> (true faith)</li>
<li><em>Al-i<u>h</u>saan</em> (perfection of worship). &#8211; highest level</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth of Jibreel and the broadest and widest of these three levels is the level of Islaam because Islaam is <em>al-Istislaam bid-dhaahir</em> (to surrender outwardly) and he may be a believer inwardly or he may be a hypocrite who is just submitting outwardly but  a disbeliever inwardly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <em>eemaan</em>, it is not applied to the hypocrite; <em>munaafiq</em>, for the believer who is complete in his <em>eemaan</em> enters into it and the believer who is deficient in his <em>eemaan</em> enters into it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when they Islaam and <em>eemaan</em> are mentioned together then in that case Islaam means the outward rulings and what is meant by <em>eemaan</em> are the inner rulings.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth of Jibreel that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“Islaam is that you testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah and that you establish the prayer and that you give the zakaah and that you fast ramadaan and that you perform Hajj to the house.” </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the outward actions; actions of the tongue and the limbs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jibreel said to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Inform me about eemaan (true faith).”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“It is that you truly believe in Allaah and in His angels and in His books and in His Messengers, in the Last Day and that you truly believe in Al-Qadr (predecree), the good of it and the bad of it.</span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the inward actions, in other words, the actions of the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Islaam and <em>eemaan</em> must be combined so if only one of them is mentioned then the other one enters within it. So if <em>eemaan</em> alone is mentioned then Islaam enters within it and if Islaam is mentioned then <em>eemaan</em> enters within it. And therefore, the People of Knowledge say Islaam and <em>eemaan</em> if they come together then they separate in meaning, when they are found separate then they come together, each one of them will have the meaning of both, meaning, in meaning just like the case of <em>faqeer</em> (the poor person) and <em>al-miskeen</em> (the destitute person), if they are mentioned together meaning in a text then the <em>faqeer</em> (the poor person) has a certain meaning and the word <em>al-miskeen</em> (the destitute person) has a separate meaning. When only one of them is mentioned then the other one enters within it.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and the nation of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in it are believers and Muslims with regard to their rulings and with regard to their inheritance and with regard to the animals that they slaughter and with regard to the funeral prayer over them”, </strong>the nation of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> are Muslims and believers (<em>mu`minoon)</em> because whoever is a believer (a <em>mu`min)</em> then he will be a Muslim automatically. Whereas whoever is a Muslim then he may be a believer; a <em>mu`min</em> but he may be a hypocrite (<em>munaafiq)</em>. However, as for correct Islaam then it must have <em>eemaan</em> along with it even if it is a small amount.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">قَالَتِ الْأَعْرَابُ آمَنَّا ۖ قُل لَّمْ تُؤْمِنُوا وَلَٰكِن قُولُوا أَسْلَمْنَا</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The desert Arabs, bedouins said, “we have believed.” Say, “you are not believers but rather you should say <em>aslamnaa</em> (we have submitted).”</span>  </strong>(Sooratul-Hujuraat (49), <em>aayah </em>14)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and the nation of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in it are believers and Muslims with regard to their rulings and with regard to their inheritance”, </strong>the Muslim even if he is only such outwardly then he will have the ruling of the Muslims. They should ally themselves to him and if he dies, they should wash him and shroud him and pray the funeral prayer over him and bury him in the graveyard of the Muslims and whilst he is alive, they should love him and ally themselves with him and they have mercy amongst themselves and they behave as brothers between themselves. This is the nation of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The likeness of the believers with regard to the mutual love and mutual mercy and mutual compassion is the likeness of a single body. If one part of it has a complaint then the rest of the body suffers sleeplessness and feverishness on account of it.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em>`alayhis-salaatu was-salaam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The believer to the believer is just like a solid structure each part of which supports the rest (and he interlaced his fingers).”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the  believers are brothers; <em>ikhwaa</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ِنَّمَا الْمُؤْمِنُونَ إِخْوَةٌ فَأَصْلِحُوا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“The believers are but brothers.” </strong></span>(Sooratul-Hujuraat (49) <em>aayah</em> 10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Brothers with regard to <em>eemaan </em>not in lineage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“nation of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> are believers and Muslims with regard to their slaughtered animals”, </strong>the meat sacrificed by a Muslim is <em>halaal</em> (lawful) even if he is a <em>faasiq</em> (sinner) as long as he has not exited from Islaam then the meat that he has slaughtered is <em>halaal</em> (permissible) and the hypocrite if he slaughters also, then we will eat it based upon his being judged to be a Muslim as long as it does not become clear that he is a hypocrite; <em>munaafiq</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إِلَّا مَا ذَكَّيْتُمْ</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Except for that which you (plural) slaughter. </strong>(</span>Sooratul-Maa`idah(5), <em>aayah </em>3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an address to the Muslims and He made permissible the sacrifices of <em>Ahl ul-Kitaab</em> (People of the Book).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَطَعَامُ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ حِلٌّ لَّكُمْ</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And the meat of those who were given the scripture is lawful for you.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Maa`idah(5), <em>aayah </em>5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning the sacrificed animals because they sacrifice upon the legislated manner in accordance with what they have from the scripture. As for the animals sacrificed by the idol worshippers and the <em>kuffaar</em> (disbelievers) and the atheists and the apostates then we do not eat that because it is a sacrifice of a disbeliever (<em>kaafir</em>) and it is impure because the sacrifice of a disbeliever is dead meat. So it is impure on account of the disbelief since it is affected by the one who sacrifices it so it will be foul because the one who slaughters it is foul and it is affected by him and the fact that Allaah, the Majestic and Most High has permitted for us the slaughtered meat of the People of the Book specifically. This is a proof that the slaughtered meat of other than them is forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and with regard to the funeral prayer over them”, </strong>the prayer is performed over every Muslim even if he was a sinner and a disobedient one or a hypocrite who did not make his hypocrisy apparent as long as he did not exit from Islaam then the prayer is performed for him and supplication is made for him and forgiveness is sought for him and he inherits from his close Muslim relative and his close Muslim relative inherits from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And we do not bear witness for any of them that he is a true believer unless he fulfils all of the duties of Islaam”,</strong> meaning we do not declare anyone pure such that we say so and so is a <em>mu`min</em> (believer) because bearing witness for him that he is a believer (<em>mu`min)</em> is a witness that he may not be deserving of and therefore when  a man said to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Give something to so and so because he is a believer.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Our Muslim (or he is a Muslim).”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the person said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Give to so and so because he is a believer (from the booty).”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Our Muslim (or he is a Muslim).”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> intended by this that the person should not declare someone to be pure and perfect by saying he’s a believer. Rather, he should apply the general term to him and say he is a Muslim and he may be a Muslim who is firm upon Islaam and he may be a Muslim who has sins and acts of disobedience and deficiencies and he may be a hypocrite so you should not bear witness for him with completeness.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“So if he neglects anything from that then he will be deficient in <em>eemaan</em> unless and until he repents”, </strong>the `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) of the <em>Ahl ul-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em> is that sins even if they are major sins (<em>kabaa&#8217;ir</em>) as long as they are less than <em>shirk</em> then they do not cause the Muslim to exit from Islaam or they do not exit him from the domain of <em>eemaan</em>. Rather, he will be a believer (<em>mu`min)</em> in accordance with his <em>eemaan</em>, a sinner in accordance with the level of his major sin or you say &#8220;he is a believer who is deficient in <em>eemaan&#8221;</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and know that his <em>eemaan</em> is left to Allaah, the Most High whether he is complete in <em>eemaan</em> or deficient in <em>eemaan</em>”, </strong>meaning we accept from him what is apparent and we entrust his hidden state to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“unless he manifests to you neglect of the duties of Islaam”, </strong>meaning unless he commits something, which nullifies a person’s Islaam and from them is to neglect or abandon the religious duties of Islaam so then you will judge that he is guilty of apostasy just as if he abandoned the prayer deliberately or if he spoke with a word of disbelief such as abusing Allaah or abusing the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> or abusing the religion of Islaam for then you would judge that he is guilty of <em>riddaa</em> (apostasy) in accordance with what has become apparent. So whoever manifests something, which nullifies Islaam along with removal of any valid excuse and removal of any preventing factors and is he misinterpreting something or is he just blindly following someone else or is he <em>jaahil</em> (one who is totally ignorant), was he angry. For in that case, he will not be judged to be an apostate along with these preventing factors.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Side point: As occurs here in the text, <strong>“this world is a place of eemaan and Islaam”, </strong>when the two are mentioned together they separate in meaning. Islaam means the outward duties of Islaam; the prayers, the <em>zakaat</em> and so on and so forth whereas <em>eemaan</em> in that case refers to the inner actions and beliefs of the heart.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 21 : Point 24</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And to have faith that <em>eemaan</em> is speech and action and intention and acting correctly. It increases and decreases. It increases as Allaah wishes and it can decrease until nothing remains of it.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F366690143&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/eeman-is-belief-of-the-heart-expression-upon-the-tongue-action-upon-the-limbs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-eemaan</em> in the language means <em>at-tasdeequl- jaazim</em> (definite affirmation) which is accompanied by faith and not affected by doubt. So it is said <em>aamana lahu</em> – meaning, &#8216;he believed him&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You will not believe us</strong></span><br />
(Soorah Yoosuf (12), aayah 17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: you will not believe us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And Loot believed in him</span></strong><br />
(Sooratul-`Ankaboot (29), aayah 26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He believed his paternal uncle Ibraaheem <em>`alayhis-salaatu was-salaam.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in the legislation then it is: belief of the heart and expression upon the tongue and action upon the limbs. It increases with obedience and it decreases with disobedience. It will not be <em>eemaan</em> except with these things combined.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever believes with his heart, but does not believe with his tongue, then he will not be a believer. Because Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, said with regard to the disbelievers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">We know that what they say grieves you, however they do not hold you to be a liar, but rather the wrongdoers just outwardly reject Allaah’s signs.</span></strong> (Sooratul-An`aam (6), aayah 33)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said with regard to Fir`own:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And you know that no one sent down these signs except for the Lord of the heavens and the earth.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Israa· (17), aayah 102)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Majestic and Most High, said about the disbelievers who denied His signs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they denied them outwardly but they were certain of them in themselves, doing so as a result of their wrongdoing and haughtiness.</strong></span> (Sooratun-Naml (27), aayah 14)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So believing in the heart will not suffice, as is said by the<strong> Murji·ah</strong>; and it is not <em>eemaan</em>. And likewise <em>eemaan</em> upon the tongue also will not suffice, because this is the <em>eemaan</em> of the hypocrites, the <strong>munaafiqeen</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They (the hypocrites) say upon their tongues that which is not in their hearts</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fat.h (48), aayah 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And having belief in the heart and speech upon the tongue, these two will not suffice also, as is said by some of the Murji·ah. This is not sufficient. There must be action upon the limbs. So the person who believes in his heart and upon his tongue, however he does not pray ever, and nor does he fast, nor does he perform the obligatory Hajj, nor does he do any action from the actions at all, this is a disbeliever. Even if he believes upon his tongue and speaks (upon his tongue) and has belief in his heart and bears witness to that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah. But however his leaving off action without any excuse, this will not make him a believer. Unless it is the case that he has left off action due to an excuse, such as a person who has been forced, or a person who forgets, or a person who is ignorant; and likewise the person who enters into Islaam and is not able to act, such that he accepts Islaam and then he dies in that condition. Then this person, his lack of action is not counted against him, because he was not able to act. And likewise the mentally handicapped; this person is not able to act. But as for the person who is able to act but he abandons it altogether, then he is not a Mu·min (not a believer).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of them add to the definition of <em>eemaan</em>, just as the author mentioned, a fourth matter: ‘<strong>following the Sunnah</strong>’. And they say <em>eemaan</em> is speech and belief and action and Sunnah, meaning, following the Sunnah, excluding by that the innovators, those who do not act upon the Sunnah, rather they only act upon newly introduced affairs. And this was mentioned by the author here in his saying, “<strong>and intention and acting correctly</strong>,” meaning acting upon the Sunnah. As for the person who does actions wrongly, acting upon innovations and false superstitions and newly introduced affairs, then he will not be a believer. [05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘And it increases through obedience.’</strong> This is from the completion of the definition, that <em>eemaan</em> increases through obedience. And this is clear in the Qur·aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And Allaah increases those who are guided in guidance</span></strong><br />
(Sooratul-Maryam (19), aayah 76)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And when His ayaahs are recited to them, it increases them in eemaan</span></strong><br />
(Sooratul-Anfaal (8), aayah 2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And so that those who believe can increase in eemaan</span></strong><br />
(Sooratul-Muddaththir (74), aayah 31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This clearly shows that <em>eemaan</em> increases through obedience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘And it decreases through sin/disobedience to Allaah’.</strong> Because something which can increase, then it can also decrease. And also there occurs in the hadeeth that the person who does not refuse an evil with his heart, then there is no <em>eemaan</em> even to the level of a mustard seed beyond that.6 So this shows that <em>eemaan</em> can become so weak that it becomes like a mustard seed. And there occurs in the authentic hadeeth that there will come out from the Fire whoever has in his heart the slightest slightest mustard seed of <em>eemaan</em>. [07] So this proves that <em>eemaan</em> can become weak, until it is just like a mustard seed. And He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">On that day they were closer to disbelief than they were to <em>eemaan </em></span></strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), aayah 167)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With them their <em>eemaan</em> was weak, and it was closer to disbelief. So this shows that the <em>eemaan</em> can be so weak to the extent that a person can become closer to disbelief. And Allaah’s refuge is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the meaning of his saying, <strong>“and it can decrease until nothing remains of it.”</strong> It can decrease until nothing remains from it. There may remain from it the amount of a mustard seed. And this will benefit the person on the Day of Resurrection. He will exit the Fire with it. And if there does not remain even a mustard seed, then he will be from the people of the Fire, those who will remain forever in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[05] Translator’s side point: Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee hafizahullaah said about this point (where Imaam al-Barbahaaree said that <em>eemaan</em> is: speech and action and <em>niyyah</em> [intention]), “ ‘Speech and action and belief’ and that is what the author rahimahullaah meant by his saying “and <em>niyyah</em>”, intention. So what is intended by <em>niyyah</em> is belief and attestation.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[07] Reported by al-Bukhaaree (no. 6565) and Muslim (no. 193) as a hadeeth of Anas radiyAllaahu `anhu</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 20 : Point 21</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have eemaan that Paradise, al-Jannah, is true and the Fire, an-Naar, is true and that they are already created. The Paradise is in the seventh heaven and its ceiling is the Throne, al-`Arsh, and the Fire is beneath the seventh earth, the lowest one; and they are both already created. Allaah, the Most High, knew the number of the people of Paradise and who will enter it and the number of the people of the Fire and who will enter it. They will never pass away. They will both last along with Allaah always, for ever and ever. And Aadam `alayhis-salaam was in the everlasting created Paradise, and he was removed from it after he disobeyed Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/paradise-and-hellfire-are-true-and-are-already-created-they-will-never-pass-away" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>From the pillars of <em>eemaan</em></strong> is to have <em>eemaan</em> in the Last Day with everything within it. And from that which will be within the Last Day is Paradise and the Fire, and they are the abode of recompense. So the true believers will be in Paradise which was prepared for the people of taqwaa, people who were fearful of Allaah and were dutiful to Him.And the disbelievers will be in the Fire which was prepared for the disbelievers. So these two are the abode of recompense; and this world is the abode of action with no recompense in it. So the Hereafter is the abode of recompense, and there is no action in that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever does not believe in Paradise and the Fire then he is a <em>kaafir</em>, a disbeliever, since it is essential that <em>eemaan</em> includes everything that is authentic with regard to the Last Day, and from that is the Paradise and the Fire. This is mentioned in the Qur&#8217;aan in different places. So the person who disbelieves in them or who explains them away, such as the <strong>Qaraamitah</strong> and the <strong>Baatiniyyah</strong> who explain them away, then they are disbelievers in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there must be <em>eemaan</em> in the Paradise and the Fire and that they are two real abodes; an abode for the people who were dutiful to Allaah and an abode for the disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And these two will remain and they are present now, they are already created now, and they will remain and not pass away. He, the Most High, said with regard to the Paradise:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>It is already prepared for those who are dutiful to Allaah.</strong></span><br />
(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), aayah 133)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said with regard to the Fire:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Already prepared for the disbelievers</span></strong><br />
(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), aayah 131)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word &#8216;<strong>prepared</strong>&#8216;, is a proof that it is already present and prepared, and it does not mean that it will be created later on, with the evidence that the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> mentions some things which prove that Paradise and the Fire are already present. From them is his saying <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“The severity of the summertime heat is from the breathing out of the Hellfire.”</span></strong> [01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said with regard to the severity of cold in the winter,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000080;">“Allaah has given two breaths to the Hellfire: a breath in the summertime and that is the hottest that you experience, and a breath in the wintertime and that is the severity of the cold. So that is from the coldness of the Hellfire.” </span></strong>[02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this proves that they are both already present. And Paradise, likewise, is present. Allaah has already prepared it for the people of <em>taqwaa</em> (the dutiful ones). And He has appointed angels over both of them. And there occurs in a hadeeth of `Ubaadah ibn asSaamit <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> that Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000080;">“Whoever bears witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah, and that `Eesaa is the slave of Allaah and His Messenger, and a soul created by means of His word which He sent to Maryam, and a soul created by Him, and that <em>Paradise is true, and the Fire is true</em>, then Allaah will enter him into Paradise whatever his deeds were.”</span></strong> [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The witness for the topic here is in his saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“&#8230;and that Paradise is true and the Fire is true&#8230;”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the initial supplication of the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> that he made in the night prayer, that he would say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>“The meeting with you is true, and your promise is true, and Paradise is true, and the Fire is true.”</strong></span> [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and they are both already created”</strong>. Meaning, they are already created now. [05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Paradise, al-Jannah (literally the garden), is in the seventh heaven and its ceiling is the `Arsh, the Throne,”</strong> This is authentic in the hadeeth,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000080;">“In Paradise there are a hundred levels Allaah has prepared for those who fight Jihaad in Allaah’s cause. Between each of the two levels is the like of what is between the heaven and the earth. So if you ask of Allaah, then ask Him of al-Firdows, for it is the centre of Paradise and the highest part of Paradise. And above it is the Throne of the Most Merciful. And from it flow the rivers of Paradise”.</span></strong> [06]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This proves that Paradise is in heaven, in the highest of the heavens, `illeeyeen. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>But no, the book of the righteous is certainly in `illeeyeen (the highest [seventh] heaven)</strong></span> (Sooratul-Mutaffifeen (83), aayah 18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The highest thing. And the Fire is in the lowest of the low places. He Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>But no, the book of the wicked ones is certainly in sijjeen (the lowest of the seven earths). And what will explain to you what sijjeen is.</strong></span> (Sooratul-Mutaffifeen (83), aayahs 7-8)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying,<strong> “Allaah always knew the number of the people of Paradise and who will enter it.”</strong> Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, knew everything with His Eternal Knowledge. And from that is that He knew the people of Paradise and who will enter it. And He knew the people of the Fire and who will enter it. Nothing escapes His Knowledge, He the Perfect and Most High. He knew everything and He wrote it down in the Preserved Tablet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“These two will never pass away.”</strong> Paradise and the Fire are two abodes that will remain and will never pass away. And this contains a refutation of those who think that the Paradise and the Fire will pass away, and who say, “So that nothing will share along with Allaah in remaining always.” And they are those who deny there having being continuous existence in the past and continuous existence in the future out of ignorance from them. And we say, there is indeed a difference between Allaah’s Remaining Forever and the remaining forever of Paradise and the Fire. The Remaining Forever of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, is as befits Him. It is an Attribute from His Attributes, He, the Majestic and Most High. But as for the remaining of the Paradise and of the Fire then it is that Allaah will cause them to remain, and that Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, creates. So it is a remaining forever that is earned (given to them). Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, He is the One Who gives it ‘remaining forever’. But as for Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, then His Eternity and His Remaining Forever is an Attribute from His Attributes, sifatun thaateeyah, an Attribute of His Self.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“They will remain along with Allaah always,”</strong> The remaining of these two will be along with Allaah Remaining. And Allaah’s Remaining, there is no end to it. So likewise the remaining of the Paradise and the Fire, there is no end to them. And there is no resemblance between the two remainings and these two remaining forever/eternally, just like the rest of the attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“for all time, forever.”</strong> ‘For all time, forever’ &#8211; this is for emphasis.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and Aadam `alayhis-salaam, he was in the Paradise that will remain, the created one.”</strong> When Allaah created Aadam, and when He honoured him as He did, and when He manifested his virtue over the angels, then Iblees envied him for that and he refused to prostate to him. So he disobeyed Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, on account of envy and pride. So Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, said to Aadam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Dwell you and your wife in Paradise and eat from it freely wherever you wish.</strong> </span>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 35)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah caused them to dwell in Paradise as an honour to both of them. And this Paradise is in heaven. Then when Iblees beguiled Aadam, and Aadam ate from the tree which he had been forbidden from, then Allaah send Aadam down and He sent Iblees down to the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We said get down from it all of you</strong></span><br />
(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 38)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they went down to the earth. And Allaah forgave Aadam because he repented to Allaah, he and his wife.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O our Lord we have wronged ourselves and if You do not forgive us and have Mercy upon us we will certainly be amongst the losers.</strong></span> (Sooratul- A`raaf (7), aayah 23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And Aadam disobeyed his Lord and he erred. Then his Lord chose him and guided him to repent</strong></span> (Soorah TaaHaa (20), aayahs 121 – 122)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Aadam and Howwaa· <em>`alayhimas-salaam</em>, they both turned to Allaah in repentance, so Allaah accepted their repentance. As for Iblees, then he persisted upon his error and he did not repent. And therefore Allaah banished him away from His Mercy and He cursed Him, and He made him a leader for every evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“So he was expelled from it after he disobeyed Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.”</strong></span> His being removed from Paradise was as a punishment for his sin. However he repented to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, as Allaah mentioned in the Qur&#8217;aan. [07]</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">[01] Reported by al-Bukhaaree (no. 535 and no. 536) and Muslim (no. 615) from the hadeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>radiyAllaahu `anh</em>. The narration of al-Bukhaaree is from Aboo Hurayrah and Ibn `Umar <em>radiyAllaahu `anhum</em>.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[05] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee <em>hafizahullaah</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“There are two matters of belief here, two matters which the people of the Sunnah affirm here. And these are two points which are denied by the Mu`tazilah and the Jahmeeyah and some sects from the people of innovation. And these points are: <strong>Firstly</strong>, that Paradise and the Fire are already present, already created. And <strong>secondly</strong>, that Allaah has written for both of them that they will remain forever.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">[06] This is reported by al-Bukhaaree (no. 2790) as a hadeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[07] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee <em>hafizahullaah</em> said in his taped explanation,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The texts which prove that Paradise and the Fire will remain without any end, that is proven in authentic texts:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They will remain therein forever</strong></span> (Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), aayah 57)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in a hadeeth that death will be brought in the form of a ram, and it will be slaughtered between Paradise and the Fire. Then it will be said, <span style="color:#000080;"><strong>“O people of Paradise, everlasting life with no death. And O people of the Fire, everlasting life with no death.”</strong></span> (Reported by al-Bukhaaree [no.4730] as a hadeeth of Aboo Sa`eed al-Khudree <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs with regard to Paradise:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They will have therein everlasting bliss</strong></span> (Sooratut-Towbah (9), aayah 21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs with regard to the Fire:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they will have everlasting punishment</span></strong> (Sooratul-Maa·idah (5), aayah 37)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning forever/eternal. It will not come to an end. So this is the position of the Ahlus-Sunnah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Somebody asked Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee: <span style="color:#ff0000;">“Is it correct that Ibnul-Qayyim used to say that the Fire will come to an end?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh made it clear that this is not correct from Ibnul-Qayyim that he said that the Fire will come to an end, as some people quote from him. But rather they have made a misunderstanding here of something that occurs in his book, <em>Haadiyul-`Arwaah ilaa Bilaadil-`Afraah</em>. In that book he mentions the different saying of the people with regard to whether the Fire will come to an end or not. He quotes six or seven different sayings from the people (what they say). Shaykh as-Suhaymee said, “What makes his position very clear is another of his books, al-Waabilus-Sayyib. In that book he makes his position very clear, that indeed the Hellfire will never come to an end. The Hellfire the abode of the disbelievers, the Paradise the abode of the believers and will never end.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 19 : Point 20</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have eemaan in the Prophets and in the Angels.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F365836907&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/eemaan-in-the-prophets-and-in-the-angels" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From that fundamentals of eemaan and the pillars of eemaan is to have eemaan in the malaa·ikah (Angels) and in the anbiyaa (Prophets). And this is as occurs in the hadeeth of Jibreel <em>`alayhis-salaam</em>, when he said to the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, “Inform me about eemaan (true faith). So he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“(It) is that you truly believe in Allaah and His Angels and in His Books and in His Messengers and in the Last Day and that you truly believe in pre decree, the good of it and the bad of it.”</span></strong> [01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in the Qur&#8217;aan,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Righteousness is not that you turn your faces either to the east or to the west. But rather righteousness is the righteousness of the one who truly believes in Allaah and in the Last Day and in the Angels and in the Book and in the Prophets.</strong></span> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 177)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The Messenger believes in that which was sent down to him from his Lord and also the believers. All of them believe truly in Allaah and in His Angels and in His Books and in His Messengers. They say, we do not make any distinction in believing between any of His Messengers. And they say we hear and we obey.</strong> </span>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 285)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, we truly believe in Allaah and in what was send down to us and in what was send down to Ibraaheem and Ismaa`eel and Is&#8217;haaq and Ya`qoob and to the Tribes and what Moosaa and `Eesaa were given and what the Prophets were given from their Lord. We do not make any distinction </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(with regard to believing)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> between any of them. And we submit as Muslims to Him.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 136)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory to have <em>eemaan</em> in the Angels, all of them. Those whom Allaah has named from them and those whom He has not named. And the <em>malaa&#8217;ikah</em> (the Angels) is the plural of <em>malak</em>. And they are species of being from the world of the hidden and the unseen. Allaah created them from light. Then as for the Jinn, then Allaah created them from fire. And as for mankind then Allaah created them from teen (clay) and then from a feeble fluid, just as Allaah the Perfect and Most High mentioned. So a person must have <em>eemaan</em> in the Angels all of them, those whom Allaah has named from them and those He has not named. We believe in all of them. As for one who believes in some of them and disbelieves in others, then he is a disbeliever in all of them (a <em>kaafir</em>). He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say, whoever is an enemy to Jibreel, then he </strong>(Jibreel)<strong> brought it (the Qur&#8217;aan) down to your heart by the permission of Allaah, confirming that which came before it and a guidance and glad tidings for the believers. Whoever is an enemy to Allaah and to his Angels and to His Messengers and to Jibreel and to Meekaal then Allaah is an enemy to the disbelievers.</strong></span> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayahs 97 &#8211; 98)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the person who disbelieves in a single Angel from the Angels, he is a disbeliever in all of the Angels. Such as the Jews, those who say, &#8220;<em>Jibreel is an enemy to us. If the one who came down to Muhammad had been other than Jibreel, we would have obeyed him. However Jibreel came down to him and he is our enemy. So we will not believe in him.”</em> [02] So therefore Allaah sent down this aayah. [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, whoever is an enemy to Jibreel, then he brought it down to your heart by the permission of Allaah</span></strong> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 97)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it (the Revelation) is not from Jibreel. Rather it is from Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. And Jibreel was only a messenger from Allaah entrusted with bringing the Revelation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And amongst the deviant sects who ascribe themselves to Islaam are those who say that Jibreel betrayed his trust, because Messengership should have gone to `Alee. However, (they say) Jibreel betrayed his trust and gave it instead to Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. Their poet said, “The trustworthy one was treacherous (Jibreel) and he withheld it from Haydar,” meaning from `Alee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author said, <strong>“That we have eemaan in the Messengers (rusul) and in the Prophets (anbiyaa·).”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Prophet (<em>nabeey</em>) is one who had a Revealed Way sent to him, but he was not commanded to convey it to others. Whereas a Messenger (<em>rasool</em>) was one who had a Revealed Way sent to him by Revelation and he was commanded to convey it.[04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Whoever is an enemy to Jibreel, then he brought it down to your heart by the permission of Allaah</strong></span> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 97)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the difference between <em>an-nabeey</em> (Prophet) and <em>ar-rasool</em> (Messenger) is that a Messenger (<em>rasool</em>) is sent with a Revealed Way, sent down to him. Contrary to a Prophet (<em>nabeey</em>), for he is sent with a Revealed Way sent down to Messengers who came before him, like the Prophets of the Banoo Israa·eel (Children of Israa&#8217;eel); because they were sent with the message of Moosaa <em>`alayhis-salaam</em>, with the Towraat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">We sent down the Towraat which contained Guidance and Light by which the Prophets, those who submitted to Allaah, judged for the Jews and the rabbis and also the priests</span></strong> (Sooratul-Maa·ida (5), aayah 44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they judged by the Towraat which had been sent down to Moosaa `alayhis-salaam and they did not come with an independent Legislation. Contrary to a Messenger (rasool), for he comes with an independent Legislation and he is commanded to convey it. But as for a Prophet (nabeey), he is commanded to convey the Message from someone before him, and Revelation might be sent to him with regard to a specific matter. This is the difference.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Muhammad Amaan al-Jaami`</strong> rahimahullaah said in his explanation of the Three Principles, <em>“They disagree with regard to the difference between a Prophet (nabeey) and a Messenger (rasool). So some of them define it and say: a Prophet is one who is sent with a Message to act upon it, but he was not given the duty of calling to it. However the second definition is that a Prophet (nabeey) is one who was sent with a Message of someone who was before him and he does not have his own independent Message, as was the case with many Prophets from the Banoo Israa·eel. And the second definition is more befitting whereas the first one is what is famous.”</em> (He goes on to mention that it is not befitting to say a nabeey is one who has Revelation but he does not have to convey it to anyone).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whoever disbelieves in a single Prophet, then he is a disbeliever in all of them. He is a disbeliever even in the Prophet who he claims that he believes in, because the Prophets were all brothers. He <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008080;"><strong>The Prophets were brothers with different mothers.</strong> </span>[05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They were a single chain. Their way was one. So whoever denies a single one of them, then he is denying all of them, because what this one had, the other one had. All of them were Messengers from Allaah. So the person who claims that he believes in Moosaa, such as the Jews, but then disbelieves in `Eesaa and in Muhammad <em>`alayhimus-salaatu was-salaam</em> then those people are disbelievers (<em>kaafiroon</em>) in all of the Prophets, even in the Prophet who they claim they are believing in. And he was Moosaa <em>`alayhis-salaam</em>. Because the book which Moosaa came with contained a mention of Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The one (the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) whom they find written down with them in the Towraat and in the Injeel. He commands them with the good and he forbids them from the evil. And he declares lawful for them the good and pure things. And he forbids the filthy and evil things for them. And he releases them from the burdens and the fetters that were upon them. So those who believe in him and honour him and aid him and who follow the Light which came down with him, then they will be the successful ones.</span></strong> (Sooratul-A`raaf (7), aayah 157)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Those to whom we gave the Scripture they know him (the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) just as they recognize their own sons.</strong> </span>(Sooratul- Baqarah (2), aayah 146)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However envy (<em>hasad</em>) led them to disbelieve in Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> because they wanted that Prophethood should not depart from the Banoo Israa&#8217;eel. So therefore they sought to monopolize the bounty of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Or do they envy the people for that which Allaah gave to them from His bounty.</strong></span> (Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), aayah 54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what led them do this was <em>al-hasad</em> (envy) and transgression. Otherwise they knew that he was indeed the Messenger of Allaah because they found him written in the Towraat and in the Injeel. Likewise `Eesaa <em>`alayhis-salaam</em> he foretold of the good news of the coming of Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And remember when `Eesaa ibn Maryam said, O Children of Israa·eel, I am Allaah’s Messenger to you, confirming what came before me from the Towraat and giving news of the coming of a Messenger who will come after me whose name will be Ahmad.</span></strong> (Sooratus-Saff (61), aayah 6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And who is this Messenger who came after `Eesaa? No Messenger came after `Eesaa, except for Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his name was Ahmad and his name was Muhammad. He had many names. So the person who disbelieves in `Eesaa he is a disbeliever in all of them. And the one who disbelieves in Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is a disbeliever in all of them. And therefore He, the Majestic and Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The people of Nooh denied the Messengers</span></strong><br />
(Sooratush-Shu`araa· (26), aayah 105)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though the first of the Messengers was Nooh and they denied Nooh. However He said that they denied the Messengers, meaning those who came after him, because whoever denies one Messenger then he has denied all of the Messengers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The people of `Aad denied the Messengers</span></strong><br />
(Sooratush-Shu`araa· (26), aayah 123)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Thamood denied the Messengers</span> </strong><br />
(Sooratush-Shu`araa· (26), aayah 141)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The people of al-Aykah (people of Madyan) denied the Messengers</strong> </span>(Sooratush-Shu`araa· (26), aayah 176)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a person who disbelieves in one, he is a disbeliever in all of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Those who disbelieve in Allaah and in His Messengers and they wish to make a difference between believing in Allaah and in His Messengers and they say, we will believe in some and disbelieve in others. They want to take a way in between. They are the disbelievers in truth.</strong> </span>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), aayahs 150 – 151)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though they believed in some of them, however believing in some is not sufficient. There must be <em>eemaan</em> in all of them, because they are all Messengers from Allaah. All of them came from Allaah the Perfect and Most High. The earlier ones of them foretold the later ones. And the later ones of them believed in the first ones <em>`alayhimus-salaatu was-salaam</em>. This is the position of the Muslims and of the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] Reported by Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 8) as hadeeth of Umar ibnul-Khattaab radiyAllaahu`anh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] The like of this story was reported by Imaam Ahmad in his Musnad, volume 1 page 274.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] Reported by al-Bukhaaree as a hadeeth of `Abdullaah ibn Salaam that he said about Jibreel, <strong>“That is the enemy to the Jews from the Angels.”</strong> So therefore he <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> recited this aayah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04]<strong> Translator’s side point:</strong> Some of the other scholars mention a slightly different definition, amongst them Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymeeyah in his book an-Nuboowaat, where he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em> “A Prophet (nabeey) is one whom Allaah the Most High has sent with a Revealed Way (Legislation) which Allaah commands him to convey to his own followers, but not to the opponents. Whereas a Messenger is one whom Allaah the Most High sent with Revelation (a Revealed Way) to call all of the people in his time to, whether they are opponents or those who agree with him, whether it is a new Revealed Way or one from before.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[05] Reported by al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh (no. 3443) and reported by Muslim (no. 2365) as a hadeeth of Aboo Hurayrah radiyAllaahu`anh. And the wording of al-Bukhaaree is: <strong>“The Prophets are </strong>[lit. paternal] <strong>brothers, their mothers are different, but their Religion is one.”</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Or like the one who passed by a town in ruin up to its roofs. He said: &#8220;How will Allah ever bring it to life after its death&#8221; So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him up (again). He said: &#8220;How long did you remain (dead)&#8221; He (the man) said: &#8220;(Perhaps) I remained (dead) a day or part of a day.&#8221; He said: &#8220;Nay, you have remained (dead) for a hundred years, look at your food and your drink, they show no change; and look at your donkey! And thus We have made of you a sign for the people. Look at the bones, how We bring them together and clothe them with flesh.&#8221; When this was clearly shown to him, he said, &#8220;I know (now) that Allah is able to do all things.&#8221;</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 2.259)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(Have you not looked at him who disputed with Ibrahim about his Lord)</span> means, &#8220;Have you seen anyone like the person who disputed with Ibrahim about his Lord&#8221; Then, Allah connected the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(Or like the one who passed by a town in ruin up to its roofs)</span> to the Ayah above by using `or&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Ali bin Abi Talib said that the Ayah (2:259) meant `Uzayr. Ibn Jarir also reported it, and this explanation was also reported by Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim from Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Sulayman bin Buraydah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujahid bin Jabr said that the Ayah refers to a man from the Children of Israel, and the village was Jerusalem, after Nebuchadnezzar destroyed it and killed its people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(in ruin)</span> means, it became empty of people. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(up to its roofs)</span> indicates that the roofs and walls (of the village) fell to the ground. `Uzayr stood contemplating about what had happened to that city, after a great civilization used to inhabit it. He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(Oh! How will Allah ever bring it to life after its death)</span> because of the utter destruction he saw and the implausibility of its returning to what it used to be. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him up (again).)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The city was rebuilt seventy years after the man (`Uzayr) died, and its inhabitants increased and the Children of Israel moved back to it. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>When Allah resurrected `Uzayr after he died, the first organ that He resurrected were his eyes, so that he could witness what Allah does with him, how He brings life back to his body.</strong></span> When his resurrection was complete, Allah said to him, meaning through the angel,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(&#8220;How long did you remain (dead)&#8221; He (the man) said: &#8220;(Perhaps) I remained (dead) a day or part of a day.&#8221;)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars said that since the man died in the early part of the day and Allah resurrected him in the latter part of the day, when he saw that the sun was still apparent, he thought that it was the sun of that very day. He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(&#8220;Or part of a day. &#8221; He said: &#8220;Nay, you have remained (dead) for a hundred years, look at your food and your drink, they show no change.&#8221;)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He had grapes, figs and juice, and he found them as he left them; neither did the juice spoil nor the figs become bitter nor the grapes rot.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(And look at your donkey!),</span> &#8220;How Allah brings it back to life while you are watching.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(And thus We have made of you a sign for the people)</span> that Resurrection occurs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(Look at the bones, how We Nunshizuha)</span> meaning, collect them and put them back together. In his Mustadrak, Al-Hakim, recorded that Kharijah bin Zayd bin Thabit said that his father said that the Messenger of Allah read this Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(how We Nunshizuha.)</span> Al-Hakim said; &#8220;Its chain is Sahih and they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not record it.&#8221; The Ayah was also read,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(نُنْشِرُهَا)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Nunshiruha&#8221; meaning, bring them back to life, as Mujahid stated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(And clothe them with flesh. )</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Suddi said, &#8221; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>`Uzayr observed the bones of his donkey, which were scattered all around him to his right and left, and Allah sent a wind that collected the bones from all over the area. Allah then brought every bone to its place, until they formed a full donkey made of fleshless bones. Allah then covered these bones with flesh, nerves, veins and skin. Allah sent an angel who blew life in the donkeys&#8217; nostrils, and the donkey started to bray by Allah&#8217;s leave.&#8221; All this occurred while `Uzayr was watching</strong></span>, and this is when he proclaimed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(He said, &#8220;I know (now) that Allah is able to do all things,&#8221;)</span> meaning, &#8220;I know that, and I did witness it with my own eyes. Therefore, I am the most knowledgeable in this matter among the people of my time.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>140.Eemaan is one entity, and its people regarding it are the same. **</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>141.And variation in excellence between them is by fear and dutifulness, and by opposing desires, and by adhering to what has most right.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Quote from Shaykh Fawzan</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This is a mistake. Because eeman is not one entity and its people are not all the same. Rather eeman varies in levels of excellence and it increases and it decreases, except in the view of the murji&#8217;ah&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Commentary from Imam Ibn Baz</strong> (Source : <a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;PageID=94&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=14">alifta.net</a>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His statement, &#8220;<em>Faith is the same for the faithful in terms of its basis</em>&#8221; is disputable, even Batil (null and void), for the faithful are not the same in terms of faith. Rather, they vary considerably in faith. The faith of the messengers is not like that of others. Similarly, the faith of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs and the rest of the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet), may Allah be pleased with them, is like not that of others. Likewise, the faith of Mu&#8217;mins (believers) is not like that of Fasiqs (people flagrantly violating Islamic law). Faith varies according to the awareness of Allah, His names, attributes, and Shari`ah (Islamic law), according to Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream), unlike Al-Murji&#8217;ah (a deviant Islamic sect claiming that Faith is restricted to belief, not deeds) and those who follow them. Allah is the One sought for help.</p>

<p><em>Posted with kind permission from <strong>Dawud Burbank</strong> rahimahullaah</em></p>
<p><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Commentary from Shaykh Ibn Baz : ( from </strong><a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;PageID=94&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=14"><strong>alifta.net</strong></a>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This restriction should be considered. A disbeliever embraces Islam on the pronunciation of the Two Shahadahs (Testimonies of Faith) if he has not already pronounced them. If he has already pronounced them, he re-embraces Islam by Tawbah (repentance to Allah) for the cause for his disbelief. He may get out of the fold of Islam for many reasons other than ingratitude, as indicated by scholars in the Chapter on the Ruling on the Murtad (Apostate). Such causes include blasphemy against Islam or the Prophet, peace be upon him, or making a mockery of Allah, His Messenger, Book, or anything of His Shar` (Law) for Allah, Exalted be He, says: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><em>Say, &#8216;Is it Allah and His verses and His Messenger that you were mocking?&#8217; Make no excuse; you have disbelieved after you had believed.</em></span>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the causes for disbelief is idolatry, supplicating to the dead, making Istighathah (beseeching for help) to them and the like, for this contradicts the testimony of &#8220;There is none worthy of Worship except Allah,&#8221; which indicates that worship is an exclusive right of Allah Alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Other causes for disbelief are making Du`a&#8217; (supplication), Istighathah, Ruku` (bowing), Sujud (Prostration), slaughtering, making a vow, and the like to something other than Allah. He who does any of these things to something other than Allah, including idols, angels, Jinn (creatures created from fire), the dead, and other creatures, commits Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and does not act upon the testimony of &#8220;There is none worthy of Worship except Allah&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All such acts bring one out of the fold of Islam, according to the Ijma` (consensus of scholars) of the scholars. These are not merely acts of ingratitude. The evidence for this is derived from the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Prophet. There are many other acts that cause a Muslim to be declared a disbeliever and they are not then merely acts of ingratitude. Such acts are cited by the scholars in the Chapter on the Ruling on the Murtad. So you can refer to them. May Allah grant us success.</p>

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Explanation – Point [105]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This follows on from what preceded from the speech about Pre-ordainment and Pre-decree. And it has already preceded that from the levels of having <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in Pre-ordainment and Pre-decree is having <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in whatever He wrote in <em>Al-Law<u>h</u> Al-Ma<u>h</u>foo<u>z</u></em> (the Inscribed or Preserved Tablet).  And that is, that Allaah created the creation and the first thing that He created was the Pen (<em>Qalam</em>) and He said to it, “Write!” So it replied, “What should I write?” So He said, “Write whatever is going to happen until the Day of Resurrection.” So the Pen wrote down, by the command of Allaah for it to write down, whatever was going to happen until the Day of Resurrection, as occurs in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And no one knows how the Preserved Tablet (<em>Al-Law<u>h</u></em>) is, and how the Pen is, except Allaah. And they are two created things from the things which Allaah the Mighty and Majestic has created; we have <em>eemaan</em> in that. And so, therefore, the author said: <strong>“We have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in the Preserved Record and in the Pen, and in whatever has been inscribed in it.” </strong>Meaning: <em>Al-Law<u>h</u> Al-Mahfoo<u>z</u></em> (The Preserved Tablet) and the writing that is in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is the second level from the levels of <em>eemaan</em> in Pre-ordainment and Pre-decree, and it is: <em>eemaan</em> in the writing in the Preserved Tablet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [105][2]<span style="font-size:13.3333px;">[3]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] This is a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Aboo Daawood and At-Tirmi<u>dh</u>ee and Aboo Ya`laa from the statement of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, and it is also reported by Al-Bayhaqee as a statement of the Companion, which carries the ruling of being from the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. It was declared <em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Translator’s Side Point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Mu<u>h</u>ammad ibn `Abdul `Azeez ibn Manee`, made a note on this point: <strong>We have eemaan in the Preserved Tablet</strong>; he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah, the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Indeed, it is a Praiseworthy Qur·aan contained in a Preserved Tablet.<br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Burooj (85), <em>aayaat </em>21-22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the Noble Qur·aan is written down in the Preserved Tablet, just as Allaah, the Perfect, mentioned. And Jibreel <em>`alayhis-salaam</em> heard it from Allaah and conveyed it to our Prophet Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em>`alayhi<u>s</u> <u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>. So it was sent down from your Lord in truth, and He did not say ‘from the Preserved Tablet’. And there is no contradiction between its being in the Preserved Tablet and between its being sent down from Allaah, as was clarified by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah. And <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>ul-Islaam said also, that the Preserved Tablet is above the heavens and there occurs in a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> that no one looks into it except Allaah, the Mighty and the Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: So this shows the misguidance of those who state that the soul of a person can see what is contained in the Preserved Tablet. This is just a statement from the philosophers and from the people of superstitious stories from the worshippers – whether righteous or unrighteous, as is their firm belief. So beware of it because it is a lie.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Pen which is mentioned, then it is what Allaah created; and it wrote the measure of everything in the Preserved Tablet just as occurs in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Ubaadah ibn A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>aamit reported by Aboo Daawood from the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The first thing that Allaah created was the Pen and He said to it, “Write!” So it said, “O my Lord, and what shall I write?” He said, “Write down the decreed measure of everything right until the Hour is established.”’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the scholars disagree – was the Pen the very first thing that was created or was it the <em>`Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Allaah’s Throne)? They have two sayings in that regard. Ibn Al-Qayyim mentions both of them in his Nooniyyah and he preferred the view that the Pen was created after the <em>`Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne).”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Translator’s Side Point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah, </em>he said on this point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I say, with regard to the Preserved Tablet, it is what is mentioned in the saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed, it is a Praiseworthy Qur·aan contained in a Preserved Tablet.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Burooj (85), <em>aayaat </em>21-22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that is from the <em><u>Gh</u>ayb</em> (Hidden and Unseen) which it is obligatory that we have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) in it. And its true reality is not known except to Allaah. And the belief that some righteous people can look into what’s contained in it – this belief is <em>kufr</em> (unbelief) in the <em>aayaat</em> and <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> which clearly state that no one knows the <em><u>Gh</u>ayb</em> (Hidden and Unseen) except Allaah, the Most High.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s Side Point:</strong> With regard to the point about which was created first: the Pen or the Throne, <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>)<em>, </em>he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The explainer (Ibn Abil-`Izz in his explanation of A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>a<u>h</u>aawiyyah), he explained here, that the scholars differed whether the Pen was the very first thing created or the Throne (`<em>Ar<u>sh</u></em><u>)</u>. The scholars had two sayings in that regard and there is no third (saying). (Some of the scholars of the <em>Sunnah</em> said that Allaah’s Throne was first and then the Pen was created and some said that the Pen was created and then after that, Allaah’s Throne was created, and there is no third saying).”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And in my view the most preferable one is the first (that the Pen was the very first thing created) as is clearly stated in my note (that he made for A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>a<u>h</u>aawiyyah). And I say now, whether what is most correct is this or that, then this difference shows that the scholars are agreed that there was a first created thing. And the idea that created things came into creation and there is always something before it, they are contrary to this agreement (of the scholars).”</p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Pillars of Eemaan</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Its pillars are six: to have eemaan in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, and to have eemaan in Pre-Decree, the good of it, and the bad of it</strong>.</span>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">43</span>]</p>
<hr />
<p>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">43</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Eemaan (true faith) is composed of pillars and branches, so what is the difference between these two?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The difference is that the pillars are essential. So, if one of them passes away, then eemaan itself passes away, because a thing will not be established except upon its supporting pillars. If a pillar from its pillars is missing, then it will not be realized and brought about. As for the branches, then they are things which complete and perfect it, eemaan does not pass away if something from them is omitted, rather they are things which complete it &#8211; either they are <em>wajibaat</em> (obligatory things) or <em>mustahabbaat</em> (recommended things). So, the obligatory things are for the obligatory completion of eemaan, and as for the recommended things, then they are for desirous completion of eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a Muslim leaves something from the obligatory duties, or he does something from the forbidden things, then his eemaan will not pass away totally in the view of the Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah, rather, the obligatory perfection is missed out on. So, he will be deficient in eemaan or he will be a <em>faasiq</em> (sinful person), just as will be the case if he were to drink alcohol, steal, commit fornication, or do something from the major sins. This one will be a person who has done something forbidden, and who had committed a major sin. However, he does not become a disbeliever through that, and he does not depart from eemaan. Rather, he is a <em>faasiq</em> and the <em>hadd</em> (prescribed punishment) will be established upon him if the sin had a prescribed punishment. And likewise, whoever leaves an obligation such as abandoning being dutiful and righteous towards the parents, or maintaining ties of kinship, these are obligatory acts, so whoever abandons them, then his eemaan is deficient, and he is sinful because of his abandoning the obligatory duty. So, he will be a sinner either by abandoning something obligatory or by doing something forbidden and whichever is the case, he will not exit from eemaan, rather he will be a believer who is deficient in his eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the position of the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah</em>, contrary to the Khawaarij and the Mu`tazilah, who declare the person who commits a major sin to be a disbeliever. So, the Khawaarij declare him to be a <em>kaafir</em> and to have exited from the religion, and the Mu`tazilah declare that he has exited from the religion, however, they do not enter him into disbelief, rather, he is in a station in between the two stations; he is not a mu`min (believer) and he is not a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever). This is their position and it is an innovated position, it is contrary to the proofs and to what the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah</em> are upon. And the reason in that [their erroneous conclusion] is they are falling short in the use of evidence since they take hold of the evidences containing textual threats, and they abandon the evidences of promise, such as His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاءُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah does not forgive that anything be associated with Him, but He forgives whatever is less than that for whomever He wishes</strong></span>.» [4:48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is from the evidences of promises, it proves that the sinful person who does not reach the level of shirk and kufr, there is hope for him of forgiveness, and that he is open to receiving the threat and punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you take this along with His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يَعْصِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَإِنَّ لَهُ نَارَ جَهَنَّمَ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا أَبَدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Whoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger, then for him will be the Fire of Hell, they will dwell therein forever</strong></span>.» [72:23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever takes hold of what is apparent here will declare those who commit sins to be disbelievers unrestrictedly. But if he refers it back to his saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاءُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah does not forgive that anything be associated with Him, but He forgives whatever is less than that for whomever He wishes.</strong></span>» [4:48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the truth will become clear to him, and that this person does not exit from the religion, rather he does have a threat of the fire. So, if Allaah wishes, He will forgive him, and if He wishes, He will punish him. He may receive expiating affairs which wipe away sins in this world, or he may receive punishment in the grave which wipes away these evil acts. And those expiating affairs which wipe away sins are many, such that he is tried with calamities, punishments in this world, or that he is punished in his grave, or otherwise that is put off until the Day of Resurrection, and then He is beneath Allaah&#8217;s Wish and Will. This is the position of the Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah, and this is difference between the branches and the pillars. So, whoever leaves something from the pillars, then he becomes a disbeliever. Whoever denies Tawheed and commits shirk along with Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, then he becomes a disbeliever because he has left the first pillar. And whoever denies any one of the Messengers, then he becomes a disbeliever because he has abandoned the pillars from the pillars of Islaam. Whoever denies the Angels, then he becomes a disbeliever and he exits from the religion, and whoever disbelieves in the Resurrection, Paradise, Fire, the Bridge of the Fire, the Balance, or anything which is established from the affairs of the Hereafter, then he becomes a disbeliever because of that. This is because he has denied a pillar from the pillars of eemaan. Likewise, whoever denies pre-decree (al-Qadar) and says: &#8220;<em>Things just occur without prior ordainment and without pre-decree from Allaah, events just unexpectedly occur and happen</em>,&#8221; as is said by the extremists from the Mu`tazilah &#8211; then he also becomes a disbeliever, because he has denied pre-decree.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for whoever leaves something from the branches, then this causes his eemaan to be deficient, either it will be a deficiency in the obligatory perfection or it will be a deficiency in the recommended perfection. However, he does not become a disbeliever on account of that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Belief in the Oneness and Uniqueness of Allaah (Tawheed) does not only mean to accept that there is no Creator but Allaah, and that Allaah is the Sovereign Rabb (Lord). The person who admits to this fact yet at the same time insists to associate partners with Allaah in worship, is a Mushrik (committing Shirk) even though he may daily utter the Shahaadah. Tawheed, however, embodies the love of Allaah alone; submission, humility, complete obedience, and sincerity of worship to Allaah alone. All of our life must be for His sake. Whoever acknowledges this meaning of Tawheed then he understands the saying of the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Allaah forbade the admittance to Hell of anyone who says laa ilaaha illal-laah ‘There is no true God Who deserves to be worshipped except Allaah,’ seeking the Face of Allaah.”</strong></span> [Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Ahmad].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hypocrites may utter the Shahaadah yet it is known that they are in the lowest part of Hell . Their declaration is not sincere:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Verily the hypocrites will be in the lowest depth (grade) of the Fire; no helper will you find for them.&#8221;</strong></span>(Qur&#8217;an, soorat an-Nisaa’, 4:145)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a must that the declaration of the Shahaadah be confirmed in the heart as well as by the tongue. The heart is the &#8220;king&#8221; and the rest of the body is the &#8220;army&#8221; under its command. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Verily, there is a piece of flesh in the body if it is good the rest of the body becomes good; and if it is bad, the rest of the body becomes bad, and that is the heart .”</strong></span> [Part of an authentic hadeeth reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once the Shahaadah is established in the heart it will then help transform the status of the person such that the Fire of Hell will be forbidden to him. It has been narrated that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Whoever says laa ilaaha illal-laah, &#8216;there is no true God Who deserves to be worshipped but Allaah&#8217; and declares Kufr (Disbelief) in whatever is worshipped besides Allaah then his money and blood are Haram (forbidden to be harmed in his money and blood) and the judgment (upon this person) is up to Allaah.&#8221;</span></strong> [Collected by Muslim and Ahmad].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above hadeeth is a great explanation for the true meaning of &#8216;There is no true God but Allaah&#8217;. It emphasizes that there must be a complete dissociation from anyone /anything taken as a deity besides Allaah.<span style="color:#ff0000;"> There can be no worship offered to a righteous man, a star, moon, fire, river, cow, Buddha, Ghandi, Jesus, Khomeini, Malcom X or Y!, Farakhan, graves, statues, money, lust, heads of states, and so forth</span>. Islaam abolishes all forms of man-made deities. When the person disbelieves in offering worship to other than Allaah, then he becomes a Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is very clear that the disbelievers (Kuffar) of Mecca knew what the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) meant by the word he brought to them from Allaah: &#8220;There is no true God but Allaah.&#8221; They believed that Allaah was the Sustainer, the One Who gives life and causes death. But when Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) told them to say: &#8220;There is no true God Who deserves to be worshipped except Allaah,” their answer was:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Has he made the &#8220;gods&#8221; (all) into one God (Allaah) Verily, this is a curious thing !&#8221;</strong> </span>(Qur&#8217;an, soorat Saad, 38:5).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They knew that the declaration of the Shahaadah meant the abolishing of everything introduced between them and Allaah; an end to their intermediary &#8220;gods.&#8221; This was the reason behind their rejection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This testimony of Tawheed is pure from any falsehood. It brings eternal abode in Paradise for those who fulfill its conditions and what it entails. Its rejection brings eternal abode in An-Naar (Hell). May Allaah guide me and you to be amongst those who love this declaration as well as abide by its meaning.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Third Level is <em>al-I<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Definition of <em>I<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">المرتبة الثالثة : الإحسان ، ركن واحد ، وهو &#8221; أن تعبد الله كأنك تراه ، فإن لم تكن تراه فإنه يراك&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third level is <em>al-i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em>. It is a single pillar and it is: «<strong>That you worship Allaah as if you were seeing Him, and even though you do not see Him, He certainly sees you</strong>.»<sup>46</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[46] <em>Al-I<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em> in the language means to perfect something and complete it. It is derived from <em>al-<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>usun</em> which means <em>al-jamaal</em> (beauty), the opposite of ugliness. It is divided into categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: Perfection of what lies between the servant and his Lord. This is what is meant.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: Perfection of what is between the servant and the rest of the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly</strong>: Doing well and perfecting what you do. When a person makes something or does an action, then it is obligatory upon him that he perfects it and does it completely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first type</strong> is <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em> (perfection) of what lies between the servant his Lord. The Messenger <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> explained it when Jibreel asked him in the presence of the companions as will follow. He said: «<strong><em>I<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan </em>is that you worship Allaah as if you were seeing Him, and even though you do not see Him, He certainly sees you</strong>.»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em> between the servant and his Lord is his perfecting the action which Allaah has made a duty upon him, that he does it correctly, purely and sincerely for the Face of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. So, an action in which there is <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em> between the servant and his Lord is that which is done sincerely for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and done with the following of the Messenger <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em>. The Prophet <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> made clear that <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em> is of two levels, one of them being higher than the other:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first level</strong> is that you worship Allaah as if you were seeing Him such that your certainty and <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah reaches such a level that it is as if you are actually seeing Allaah with your eyes. You have no hesitancy or doubt, rather it is as if Allaah is in front of you, He the Perfect and Most High, and you are seeing Him openly. Whoever reaches this level has reached the limit of <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em>. You worship Allaah as if you are seeing Him on account of the completeness of certainty and sincerity, which is as if you are seeing Allaah with your eyes. Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, will not be seen in this world, rather He will only be seen in the Hereafter. However, you see Him with your heart to the extent that it is as if you are seeing Him with your eyes. Therefore, He will reward the people of <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em> in the Hereafter that they will see Him, He the Perfect and Most High. This is since they used to worship Him as if they were seeing Him in this world. So, Allaah rewards them by giving them the opportunity to see Him with their eyes in the abode of bliss. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>For the people of <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em> there will be the best reward of Paradise and something extra</strong>.» <strong>[10:26]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Something extra is looking upon the Face of Allaah. The reason is that they perfected their deeds in this world, so Allaah gave them the best reward which is Paradise. And He will give them an increase which is seeing Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. So therefore, you worship Allaah as if you are actually witnessing Him, upon love and longing to meet Him, He the Perfect and Most High. You feel delight in obedience to Him and you feel calm and obedience to Him, He the Perfect and Most High. You eagerly desire obedience to Him. This is the path of the people of <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second level</strong>: If you do not reach this tremendous level, then you worship Him upon the path of <em>al-muraqabah</em> (watchfulness) such that you know that Allaah sees you, knows your condition, and knows what lies within yourself. Therefore, it is not befitting that you should disobey Him and contradict His command when He sees and observes you. This is a good state, however, it is less than the first one. So, as long as you know that He sees you, then you therefore perfect your worship of Him and you do it well, because you know that Allaah is seeing you. And for Allaah is the Highest example. If you were in front of a created being who had status and he commanded you with a command, and you were carrying this matter out in front of him and he was looking at you, would it be befitting that you be negligent in the performance of this action?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So in summary, <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em> is of two levels</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The level of witnessing with the heart</strong>: It is that you worship Allaah as if you are seeing Him from the strength of certainty and <em>eemaan</em>. It is as you are seeing Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, with your eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second level</strong>: It is that you worship Allaah knowing that He sees you and observes you, therefore, you do not disobey Him and contradict His command, He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the level of <em>al-i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em> and it is highest of the levels of the religion. Whoever reaches it has reached the highest of the levels of the religion. Before it is the level of <em>eemaan</em>, and before that is the level of <em>al-Islaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The <em>deen</em> has a number of domains</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first domain</strong>: <em>al-Islaam</em>. It is wide to such an extent that the hypocrite enters within it and is called a Muslim and is treated like the Muslims, because he has submitted to <em>Islaam</em> outwardly. So therefore, he enters within the domain of <em>Islaam</em>. And the person who is weak in <em>eemaan</em> [enters the domain of <em>Islaam</em>], but he has nothing from <em>eemaan</em> except a mustard seed of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second domain</strong>: It is more restricted and more specific &#8211; the domain of <em>al-eemaan</em>. The hypocrite in belief does not enter into it whatsoever. Rather, only the people of <em>eemaan</em> enter into it, and they are two categories: those who are complete in <em>eemaan</em> and those who are deficient in <em>eemaan</em>. So, the sinful believer and dutiful believer both enter into it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third domain</strong>: It is more restricted than the second one &#8211; the domain of <em>al-i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em>. It just as the Prophet <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> made clear. No one will enter into it except the people of complete <em>eemaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Evidence for <em>al-I<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">والدليل قوله تعالى:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Allaah is with those who fear Him and are dutiful to Him; and He is with those who are people of <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em></strong>.» <strong>[16:128]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وقوله تعالى:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>And place your reliance upon the All-Mighty, the Bestower of Mercy. He who sees you when you stand to pray. And who sees your movements along with those who pray along with you. Indeed! He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing</strong>.» <strong>[26:217-220]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وقوله تعالى:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>And you are not (O Mu<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>ammad <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em>) engaged in any matter nor do you recite the Book of Allaah, &#8211; nor do you do any action (O people), except that We are witness in your deeds when you do them. And not even that which is of the weight of the tiniest ant is hidden from your Lord on the earth or in the heavens. Nor is there anything smaller than that or greater than it except that it is written in a Clear Book</strong>.» <strong>[10:61]</strong><sup>[47]</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[47] This is the proof for the first level of <em>al-i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Allaah is with those who fear Him and are dutiful to Him, and He is with those who are people of <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em></strong>.» <strong>[16:128]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>aayah</em> proves that Allaah is with the people of <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em>. They are those who worship Allaah as if they were seeing Him, so Allaah is with them in a specific sense of <em>Ma`iyyah</em> &#8211; the <em>Ma`iyyah</em> with regard to aiding, helping, and <em>tawfeeq</em> (guiding them to and granting them attainment of correctness).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>And place your reliance upon the All-Mighty, the Bestower of Mercy. He who sees you when you stand to pray. And who sees your movements along with those who pray along with you</strong>.» <strong>[26:217-219]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a proof for the second level. This is a proof for his saying [<em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em>]: «<strong>Then, He certainly sees you</strong>.»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>And place your reliance</strong>» Meaning: trust your affairs «<strong>to the All-Mighty, the Bestower of Mercy</strong>» He is Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>When you stand to pray</strong>» You stand for worship and the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>And who sees your movements along with those who pray along with you</strong>» He sees you whilst you are performing your <em>rukoo`</em> (bowing) and whilst you are performing your <em>sajdah</em> (prostration). He sees you in all the states of worship; standing, bowing, and prostrating. He, the Perfect and Most High, sees you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Indeed! He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing</strong>» The One who hears your sayings. The One who knows your sayings, He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>And you are not (O Mu<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>ammad <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em>) engaged in any matter nor do you recite the Book of Allaah, &#8211; nor do you do any action (O people), except that We are witness in your deeds when you do them</strong>.» <strong>[10:61]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a proof for the second level.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>And you are not (O Mu<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>ammad <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em>) engaged in any matter</strong>» This is an address to the Messenger <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em>. In any affair from your affairs, from the affairs of worship or other than it &#8211; all of your actions and your movements &#8211; you will not be engaged in any affair at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Nor do you recite from it (i.e. Book of Allaah)</strong>» Meaning: from Allaah, because the Qur`aan is from Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. Or the pronoun could refer back to the affair, so the meaning would be: From the affairs which you are engaged in is recitation of the Qur`aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Nor do you do (O people)</strong>» This is [an address] for all of the nation, for the Messenger <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> and other than him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Any action</strong>» Meaning: Any action from the actions, whether good or bad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Except that We are witness [in your deeds]</strong>» We are seeing you, observing you, and witnessing you. This is a proof for his saying <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em>: «<strong>Then indeed, He sees you</strong>.»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>When you do them</strong>» You are carrying it out and you are doing it. So, this gives a proof for the second level from the levels of <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em>, in that He, the Majestic and Most High, witnesses the action of every doer of an action. He, the Perfect and Most High, sees him, knows him, and observes him. Nothing is hidden from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Nothing whatsoever in the earth or in the heavens is hidden from Allaah</strong>.» <strong>[3:5]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em> between the servant and in the creation, then its meaning is: doing good to them and withholding from harming them. Such that you feed the hungry person, cloth the person without clothing, assist the needy person with your position, and that you intercede for the one who needs to be interceded for. You do that which is good with all the different aspects of good. You are hospitable to the guest and you are generous towards the neighbor. Nothing but good emanates from you towards the neighbor, and you withhold harming him. So, no harm comes from you towards him or towards anyone else. For from the people, there are who are such that nothing but harm comes from them, and from the people, there are those whom harm and good comes. And from the people, there are those whom nothing but good comes from them. This is the highest of the levels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Doing good towards the people and withholding harm from them is <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em> (good and fine treatment) towards the people:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Do good. Allaah loves <em>al-Mu<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>sineen</em> (the doers of good)</strong>.» <strong>[2:195]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even towards the animals, it is obligatory that you treat them well and make available for them whatever they need and that you withhold harming them and that you are gentle with them. This is from <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em> towards the animals. Even a person who is going to be rightfully executed, you should not torture him, rather, you should execute him in a fine and tranquil manner. A person who is obligatory to execute, and someone it is obligatory to carry a <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>add</em> (prescribed punishment) upon, then it is carried out upon him with gentleness. There is to be no mutilation, no torture, and no beating to death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">»إن الله كتب الإحسان على كل شيء ، فإذا قتلتم فأحسنوا القتلة ، وإذا ذبحتم فأحسنوا الذبح«</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Allaah has obligated <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em> with regard to everything. So, when you kill, then kill in a fine manner. And when you slaughter an animal, then slaughter in a good manner</strong>.»[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, [the principle of <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em> applies] to execution or other than it from that which necessitates prescribed punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>When you slaughter</strong>» Meaning: when you slaughter animals which are to be eaten, then slaughter in a fine manner:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">»وليحد  أحدكم شفرته ، وليرح ذبيحته«</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Let one of you sharpen his knife and give relief to the animal which he is slaughtering</strong>.»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, you are to treat with <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em> even the animals. Allaah forgave the prostitute woman from the People of Israaeel on account that she gave a drink of water to a dog which had its tongue hanging out from thirst. So, she gave it water to drink and Allaah thanked her for that and forgave her, her sin.[2] This is a tremendous sin and it is prostitution, meaning: <em>zinaa</em> (fornication). But Allaah forgave her on account of that &#8211; because she treated the thirsty animal in a fine manner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how about something other than a dog? If you were to treat a hungry person from the Muslims with <em>i<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>saan</em>, or from the descendents of Aadam, even if he is a disbeliever &#8211; if you were to treat him well, then Allaah, the Majestic and Most High will thank you for that fine treatment. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Do good. Allaah loves <em>al-Mu<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>sineen</em> (the doers of good)</strong>.» <strong>[2:195]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third type</strong>: It is perfection of the action. Whatever action you do, it is obligatory that you perfect it and not so that it should be said: &#8220;So-and-so has done such-and-such very well.&#8221; There occurs in the <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>adee<span style="text-decoration:underline;">th</span></em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">»إن الله يحب إذا عمل أحدكم عملا أن يتقنه«</p>

<li style="text-align:justify;">A deaf person who cannot hear,</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">A dumb person,</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">A senile person and</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">whoever dies without the Dawa’ of a Prophet having reached him.</li>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said: ‘Whoever has any extra food then he should come with it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the people began coming with measures of food, some more and some less.  All that the army had was twenty-odd <em>Saa’</em> (a unit of measure).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> sat next to the food and supplicated for blessings then he said: ‘Take the food and be calm.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a man began taking food in his bag and his sack and they all began taking the food in their containers to the extent that a man would tie up the sleeves of his shirt and fill it up.  Even after they had all taken their food, the food remained as it had been.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said: ‘I testify that there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah and that I am the Messenger of Allaah. No rightful slave of Allaah comes with this testification except that Allaah saves him from the heat of the Fire.’</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Worship Allaah as if you see Him, if you do not see Him, then know that He sees you.Count yourself amongst the dead, be careful of the supplication of the oppressed since it is indeed answered.  Whoever from amongst you can attend the two prayers, <em>Isha</em> and <em>Fajr</em> prayer even if you have to crawl, then you should do so.’</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he should spittle to his left three times and seek refuge from the Shaytan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 117</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His Praise  and Blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Meaning of The Shahaadah: Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 13:</strong> You explained the meaning of the Shahaadah: La Ilaaha Illallaah. So, what is the meaning of the Shahaadha: Muhammad Rasoolullaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong> As for the meaning of the testification that Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the Messenger of Allaah [Muhammad Rasoolullaah] then it is the attestation with the <strong>tongue</strong> and the belief with the <strong>heart</strong> that Muhammad bin ‘Abdullaah al- Qurashee al-Haashimee is the Messenger of Allaah to all of the creation, to the Jinn and mankind, as stated by Allaah, The Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Verily! I am Allaah’s Messenger to you all. He is the One to whom the Dominion of the heavens and the earth belongs, none has the right to be worshipped but Him; It is He Who gives life and causes death. So believe in Allaah and His Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write, who believes in Allaah and in His Words [this Qur’aan] and follow him so that you may be guided.</em></span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-A’raaf (7): 158].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, The Most High, also Said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>(Exalted is) Blessed be He Who sent down the Criterion [of right and wrong, i.e. the Qur’aan] to His slave [Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم] that he may be a warner to the ‘Aalameen (mankind and Jinn).</em></span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-Furqaan (25): 1].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Shahaadah necessitates that</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">you <strong>believe</strong> whatever Allaah’s Messenger informed you of;</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">you <strong>comply</strong> with whatever he commands;</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">you <strong>avoid</strong> whatever he forbade and prohibited, and that</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">you do not worship Allaah except with that which he <strong>prescribed</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also necessitates that</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">you do not believe that Allaah’s Messenger has any share nor any right in Ar-Ruboobiyyah or in controlling the affairs of the creation, nor any right to be worshipped at all.<span style="line-height:1.5;">Rather, he صلى الله عليه و سلم is a slave worshipper, not one to be worshipped; and that he is a Messenger who is not to be belied. </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">It is not in his power to bring harm or benefit, neither for himself nor for others, except as Allaah Wills.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is evident in the Saying of Allaah, The Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Say [O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم]: “I do not tell you that with me are the treasures of Allaah, nor that I know of al-Ghayeb (the hidden and unseen); nor I tell you that I am an angel. I but follow what is revealed to me (by inspiration).”</em></span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-An’aam (6): 50].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is a slave of Allaah who acts as he is commanded and follows the orders he is given. And Allaah, The Most High, Says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">[Say O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم]: “It is not in my power to cause (bring) you harm or bring (guide) you to the Right Path.” Say: “None can protect me from Allaah’s Punishment [if I were to disobey Him], nor should I find refuge except in Him.”</span></em> [Qur’aan, soorat al-Jinn (72): 21-22].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, The Most High, also Says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم): “I possess no power of benefit or hurt to myself except as Allaah Will. And if I had the knowledge of the Ghayeb, I shoud have secured for myself an abundance of wealth, and no evil should have touched me. I am but a warner, and a bringer of glad tidings unto people who believe.”</em></span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-A’raaf (7): 188].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this is the meaning of the testimony of Laa Ilaaha Illalaah, Muhammad Rasoolullaah. From this meaning the person knows that nothing from the creation deserves the right to be worshipped, not the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه و سلم nor anyone from the creation who is below him in rank; and that worship an only be for Allaah, alone; and that the right of Allaah’s Messenger upon us is to give him the rank and standing which Allaah, The Most High, gave to him: The slave of Allaah and His Messenger.</p>

Of negating faith from yourself &#8211; Shaykh ibn&#160;Uthaymeen</span></a></p>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong>بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet ( <span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">صلى الله عليه وسلم</span>‎<em>) </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<em><span style="color:#008000;">Whoever Allah wants good for, He gives him understanding of the religion</span></em>.”[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And understanding of the religion demands <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>acceptance of it</strong></span>, because every person who understands and knows the religion, he <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>accepts it, and loves it</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Exalted, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">But no, by your Lord, they have not believed, until they make you (O Muhammad <span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">صلى الله عليه وسلم</span>‎) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.</span></em> (An-Nisa 4:65).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this form of swearing stresses &#8211; by use of the statement (No!), and swearing particularly by the Rububiyyah of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, over His slaves, and it is the mention of Allah’s Rububiyyah over His Messenger &#8211; it stresses the negation of faith from Whoever does not abide by these three matters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The First:</strong></span> Judgement of the Messenger ( <span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">صلى الله عليه وسلم</span>‎) based on His saying: &#8220;<em><span style="color:#008000;">until they make you judge in all disputes between them</span></em>&#8221; meaning (by you), the Messenger ( <span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">صلى الله عليه وسلم</span>‎).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever seeks judgement from other than Allah and His Messenger, he is not a believer. He is either a disbeliever whose disbelief has brought him out of the religion, or a disbeliever whose disbelief is less than that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Second:</span></strong> The chest being open to the judgement; such way that they do not find any resistance in themselves for his decision. They rather find acceptance and openness to what the Prophet ( <span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">صلى الله عليه وسلم</span>‎) decided.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Third:</span></strong> That they submit, which is stressed; meaning with complete submission.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So beware O Muslim! Of negating faith from yourself.</strong> Let us draw an example for this: Two men were arguing about the Shari&#8217;ah ruling on an issue. One of them brought evidence from the Sunnah, while the other found difficulty and felt constricted by that. How could he abandon who he follows, so as to follow this Sunnah? This man, without a doubt, has deficient faith, because the believer, in truth, is he who, when he has a text from the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger ( <span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">صلى الله عليه وسلم</span>‎) he feels as if he has won the greatest of spoils, and he will be joyful for that, and say: &#8220;<strong>All praise is due to Allah who guided me to this</strong>.” But so-and-so, who is partisan to his opinion, and tries to turn the textual proofs upside down, so that he can make them agree with what he likes, not what Allah and His Messenger intended, then this one is in a tremendous state of danger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>[1] Reported by Al-Bukhari (71) and Muslim (1037) from Mu&#8217;awiyah bin Abi Sufyan, may Allaah be pleased with him.</em></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Consequence of the One who Does not Believe in the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;<br />
</em>Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’</span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;">By the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’  </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 157 – From Abu Hurairah from the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘By Him in whose Hand is my soul; there is not a person who hears about me from this<em>Ummah</em>, not a Jew, nor a Christian, then does not believe in me, except that he will be from the people of the Hell-Fire.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ibn Munda in ‘Tawheed’ and Muslim in his Saheeh, likewise Abu ‘Awaanah and Ahmad]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">‘The hadeeth is clear in that whoever hears about the Prophet  <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and what he was sent with, and then it reaches that person in the way that Allaah revealed it to the Messenger  <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>, and does not believe in the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> then his path is to the Hell-Fire.  There is no difference in this between a Jew, or a Christian, or a fire-worshipper, and the atheist.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">My belief is that if many of the non-Muslims were granted the opportunity to become acquainted with the principles, beliefs and worship that Islaam came with, then they would hasten to enter into Islaam in crowds, as it occurred in the beginning of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">If only some of the Islaamic countries would send callers to the western countries, from those who have knowledge of Islaam and know its reality, and that they know what has attached itself to Islaam from superstitions, <em>Bida’</em> (innovations) and lies. So that the one who calls to Islaam will be able to present it in a good manner to those he is calling, and this requires the caller to have knowledge of the Book and the authentic Sunnah, and he knows some of the common foreign languages. This is a matter which is honourable and it is something nearly lost.  So this issue requires keen preparation, so perhaps they will begin this preparation.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from Silsilah Ahadeeth as-Saheehah  by Shaykh al-Albaani (vol 1/157)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 3093 From Sa’eed bin Jubair <em>Mursal</em> that the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">‘There is no-one who hears about me from this <em>Ummah</em>, not a Jew, nor a Christian, then does not believe in me, except that he will be from the people of the Hell-Fire.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Sa’eed bin Jubair said: ‘I began to say: Where is the confirmation of that in the Book of Allaah?!’ Sa’eed continued: ‘It was very rare that I heard a hadeeth from the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> except that I found a confirmation for that in the Qur’aan; until I found this <em>Ayaah</em>: &lt;&lt; وَمَنْ يَكْفُرْ بِهِ مِنَ الْأَحْزَابِ فَالنَّارُ مَوْعِدُهُ &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;but those of the sects (Jews, Christians and all the other non-Muslim nations) that reject it (the Qur’aan), the Fire will be their promised meeting-place &gt;&gt; includes all the different nations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Tabari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">‘It is possible to include this hadeeth to be from what is a clarification and explanation of the saying of Allaah Ta’ala: &lt;&lt; وَمَا كُنَّا مُعَذِّبِينَ حَتَّى نَبْعَثَ رَسُولًا &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning).&gt;&gt; along with the point where the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>said: ‘hears of me’ i.e. that he hears about the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> upon reality as a human, a Messenger, a Prophet.  So whoever hears about the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>upon other than what he <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>was upon, other than what he <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>was upon from guidance, light and excellent manners; due to some of the ignorant Muslims, or the misguided callers from the Christian evangelists and atheists, who present the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>to their people in other than his real way that he was well known for.  So the likes of these people have not heard of the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>, and the<em>Dawa</em> has not reached them, so the warning mentioned in the hadeeth does not include them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">And this is like the saying of the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>: ‘Whoever sees me in his sleep then it is as if he sees me in his wakeful state, since indeed Shaytaan cannot resemble me.’ [Silsilah Saheeh No.1004]  i.e. sees him in this real form and his characteristics which he was upon in his lifetime.  So whoever really claims that he saw an old Shaykh with a white beard, then he has not seen the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>; because this characteristic opposes that which the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>was upon, from that which is known from his characteristics <em>SallAllaahu Ta’ala alayhi wa Alahi wa sallam</em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from the book: <strong>Tools for the Patient &amp; Provisions for the Thankful<br />
</strong>By Shaykh ul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Imaan</em> is of two halves; half is patience (<em>Sabr</em>) and half is being thankful (<em>Shukr</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">More than one from amongst the <em>Salaf</em> said: ‘Patience is half of<em>Imaan</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullaah bin Masood <em>&#8211; radi Allaahu anhu –</em> said: ‘<em>Imaan</em> is of two halves: half is patience and half is gratitude.’<br />
This is why Allaah <em>– Subhanahu –</em> combines patience and being thankful in His saying: &lt;&lt;<em>Truly, in this there are signs for every patient, thankful person.</em>&gt;&gt;[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Allaah has mentioned in the verses of soorat Ha Mim ‘Ain Seen Qaaf 33, and soorat Saba 19, and in soorat Luqman 31.  Indeed there are considerations which have been mentioned for these classifications of patience and gratitude:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First Consideration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That <em>Imaan</em> is a definition for all sayings, actions and intentions. And this is divided into two divisions: performing righteous actions and leaving prohibitions; so doing an action is obedience to Allaah and that is the reality of <em>Shukr</em>. Leaving a prohibition is being patient in keeping away from sins, and all of the <em>Deen</em> is about these two aspects: doing that what you have been commanded to do, and leaving what you have been commanded to leave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second Consideration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That <em>Imaan</em> is built upon two pillars: <em>Yaqeen</em> (certainty), and <em>Sabr</em>(patience). They are two pillars that are mentioned in His <em>Ta’ala</em>’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<em>And We made from among them (Children of Israel), leaders, giving guidance under Our Command, when they were patient and used to believe with certainty in Our Ayaat</em>&gt;&gt;[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So with <em>Yaqeen</em>, the reality of commands and prohibitions is known, and the reality of reward and punishment is also known.  With patience commands are carried out, and patience also stops a person from doing that which he has been prohibited from.  He will not achieve true faith in fulfilling commands and keeping away from prohibitions, knowing these commands and prohibitions are from Allaah, nor will he achieve true faith of reward and punishment, except with <em>Yaqeen</em> (certainty).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not possible for the slave to remain steadfast upon carrying out commands, and stopping oneself from prohibitions except with patience, therefore patience becomes half of <em>Imaan</em>, and the second half of <em>Imaan</em> is being thankful, by carrying out what he has been commanded with, and leaving that which he has been prohibited from.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Third Consideration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Imaa</em>n is sayings and actions.  Sayings of the heart, and sayings of the tongue.  Actions of the heart, and actions of the limbs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The explanation of this is: whoever knows Allaah with his heart, and does not affirm it with his tongue then he cannot be a believer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Allaah said concerning the people of Pharaoh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <em>And they belied the Ayaat, wrongfully and arrogantly, though they themselves were convinced thereof [i.e. those (Ayaat) are from Allaah]</em> &gt;&gt;[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And like wise, Allaah said concerning the people of ‘Aad and the people of Salih :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<em>And ‘Ad and Thamûd (people)! And indeed (their destruction) is clearly apparent to you from their (ruined) dwellings. Shaytan made their deeds fair seeming to them, and turned them away from the Right Path, though they were intelligent.</em> &gt;&gt;<em><strong>[4]</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Musa said to Pharaoh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(( <em>Musa  said: “Verily, you know that these signs have been sent down by none but the Lord of the heavens and the earth as clear evidences</em> ))<em><strong>[5]</strong></em><em>.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these people achieved the sayings of the heart: which are <em>al-Ma’rifah</em> (knowing) and <em>‘ilm</em> (knowledge), but despite this they were not regarded as believers.  Also, the person who says with his tongue that which is not in his heart is not regarded as a believer, but rather he is regarded as being from the hypocrites.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, the one who knows with his heart and affirms it with his tongue is not regarded as a believer with just that, until he performs actions of the heart from love and hate, friendship and hostility; so he loves for Allaah and His Messenger, and he has loyalty to the<em>‘Aawliyah </em>(friends) of Allaah and he shows enmity to the enemies of Allaah, and he submits his heart to Allaah Alone.  Submitting oneself to following His Messenger and obedience to Him (Allaah), and adhering to His <em>Sharia’</em> externally and internally, and if he does this, it is not sufficient for him to have complete <em>Imaan</em> until he does that what he has been commanded with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these four <em>‘Arkaan </em>(pillars) are the <em>‘Arkaan</em> of <em>Imaan </em>upon which<em>Imaan</em> is built, and it is: going back to knowledge and action, and abstaining from that which is prohibited, which is also regarded as action. Both knowledge and action cannot be achieved except with patience, so <em>Imaan</em> becomes two halves: one of which is patience, and the other which is the result of this patience, is knowledge and action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Fourth Consideration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The soul has two forces: a driving force, and a restraining force, and the soul is always going back and forth between the rules of these two forces; driven towards that which it loves, and abstaining from that which it dislikes.  The whole of the <em>Deen</em> is based upon, motivating oneself and abstaining.  Motivation towards obedience, and abstention from sinning against Allaah. It is not possible to achieve any of these except by patience</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Fifth Consideration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The whole of the <em>Deen</em> is hope and fear, so the believer is one who has hope and fear.  Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> said: &lt;&lt;<em>Verily, they used to hasten on to do good deeds, and they used to call on us in hope and in fear</em>&gt;&gt;[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in  the supplication at the time of going to sleep, which Bukhari narrated in his ‘<em>Saheeh</em>’: ‘O Allaah, indeed I have submitted my self to You, and directed my face towards You, and entrusted my matters to You.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So you will never find a believer except that he is one who has hope and fear.  Hope and fear are not established except on the stalk of patience, so fear encourages him to be patience and hope steers him towards being thankful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Sixth Consideration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That everything that a slave is exposed to in this world, does not exclude that which will benefit him in this world and in the Hereafter, or that which will harm him in this world and in the Hereafter, or that which will benefit him in one of these two places, and harm him in the other.  The noblest types of action that a person does are those that benefit him in the Hereafter, and he leaves the other world and leaves that which will harm him in it, and this is the reality of <em>Imaan</em>.  Hence the action that benefits him is<em>Shukr</em> (thankfulness), and leaving that which harms him is patience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Seventh Consideration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That a slave cannot separate himself from an action that he does, nor a prohibition that he leaves, and destiny overtakes him.  He has an obligation of three things, patience and thankfulness.  So fulfilling that which you have been commanded to do is <em>Shukr</em> (thankfulness) and leaving prohibitions and being patient with your destiny, is patience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Eighth Consideration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the slave consists of two aspects which call him: an invitation that calls him to the <em>Duniya</em> and its worldly desires and delights.  And an invitation that calls him to Allaah and the Hereafter, and that which has been prepared in it for the <em>‘Aawliyah</em>of Allaah from amongst its everlasting blessings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the rebel of worldly passions and desires is <em>Sabr</em>, and that which responds to Allaah and the Hereafter is <em>Shukr</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Ninth Consideration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Deen</em> revolves around two fundamental principles: determination and perseverance. These are two principles which are mentioned in the hadeeth which has been narrated by Ahmad and an-Nisaee on the authority of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> ‘O Allaah verily I ask of You perseverance in my affairs, and determination in conduct.[7]<br />
The foundation of <em>Shukr</em> is the correctness of resolve, and the foundation of <em>Sabr</em> is the force of perseverance, so when a slave is supported with determination and perseverance, then he has indeed been supported with assistance and capability.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Tenth Consideration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the <em>Deen</em> is built upon two foundations: Truth and patience, and both are mentioned in the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<em>And they advise one another to the truth, and recommend one another with patience</em><em>.</em>&gt;&gt;[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what it is required of the slave is to do actions truthfully with in himself, and implementing them amongst the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is the reality of <em>Shukr</em>, which is not possible for the slave unless he is patient upon it, and in doing that <em>Sabr</em> becomes half of<em>Imaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah &#8211;<em>Subhanahu Ta’ala-</em> knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p><strong>About the Book:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a short yet highly beneficial treatise from Imam Ibn Baaz called <strong>Al Aqeedat-us-Saheehah wa maa Yudaaduhaa</strong> (<strong>The Correct Belief and what Opposes It</strong>). The Arabic source for this translation can be found on Imaam Ibn Baaz&#8217;s web site at <a href="http://www.binbaz.org.sa" rel="nofollow">http://www.binbaz.org.sa</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">In this treatise, Imaam Ibn Baaz. may Allaah have mercy on him, outlines the Creed of Ahlus-Sunnah with regard to Eemaan (Faith), Tawheed, Worship, and Allaah&#8217;s Names and Attributes in a concise and informative manner. He divides his discussion into six sections basing iron the six pillars of Eemaan (Faith), which are: Belief in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, and Divine Pre-Decree. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">At the end of the treatise, the Imaam presents ten of the most significant things that nullify and invalidate a person&#8217;s Islaam, basing that on the famous treatise of Imaam Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdul-Wahhaab known as The Nullifiers of Islaam.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This treatise is an excellent resource for new and beginning Muslims to learn about the fundamentals of their Religion in a brief and simple manner. It is for this reason that we chose this essay, hoping that it may be of benefit to those whom it reaches.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/the-correct-belief-and-what-opposes-it-the-nullifies-of-islaam-bin-baaz-al-ibaanah-com.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Download the PDF eBook</strong></a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Full content of the Book below :</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">INTRODUCTION</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy. All praise is for Allaah alone, and may the peace and blessings be upon the one after whom there is no messenger, as well as his family and Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">To Proceed:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since having the correct belief is the foundation and basis of the Religion of Islaam, I felt that it should be the topic of this lecture.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is well known from the religious texts of the Qur’aan and the Sunnah that a person’s statements and actions are only considered valid and acceptable (by Allaah) if they are produced as a result of having the correct belief. So if one’s beliefs are not correct, he invalidates whatever statements and actions branch out from it, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And whoever rejects Faith (Eemaan), then he has nullified his good deeds, and in the Hereafter, he will be from among the losers.”</strong> [Surah Al-Maa’idah: 5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And it has been revealed to you (O Muhammad) and to those before you that: If you mix partners in worship with Allaah, your good deeds will surely be cancelled out, and you will indeed be from the losers.”</strong> [Surah Az-Zumar: 65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The verses (from the Qur’aan) bearing this same meaning are many. The clear Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His trustworthy messenger, may the best of his Lord’s peace and blessings be on him, indicate that the Correct Belief can be summed up in:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Faith in Allaah, His Angels, His (revealed) Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, and the Divine Pre-Decree, the good and the bad of it. So these six things form the foundations of the Correct Belief, with which Allaah sent down His mighty Book, and with which Allaah sent His messenger, Muhammad, peace and blessings be on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everything that one is obligated to have faith in from the matters of the Unseen, as well as everything that Allaah and His Messenger have informed of branch out from these six foundations. The proofs for these six foundations in the Qur’aan and the Sunnah are many.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among them is the saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Righteousness (Birr) is not that you turn your faces towards the east and the west (in prayer), but rather righteousness is (for) the one who believes in Allaah, the Last Day, the Angels, the Books and the Prophets.”</strong> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 177]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The Messenger believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and so do the believers – all of them believe in Allaah, His Angels. His Books and His Messengers. (And they say): We make no distinctions between any of His Messengers.”</strong> [Surah AlBaqarah: 285]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O you who believe! Believe in Allaah and His Messenger and the Book that was revealed to His Prophet and the Scripture that was revealed in the past (before him). And whoever disbelieves in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers and the Last Day has gone far astray.”</strong> [Surah An-Nisaa: 136]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Don’t you know that Allaah knows all that is in the heaven and on the earth? Verily, it is all (written) in the Book (Preserved Tablet). Verily, that is easy for Allaah.”</strong> [Surah AlHajj: 70]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the authentic ahaadeeth that indicate these foundations, then they are many. Amongst them is the famous authentic hadeeth reported by Muslim in his Saheeh in which ‘Umar bin AlKhattaab (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) narrated that (the angel) Jibreel asked the Prophet about Eemaan (Faith). So he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) replied to him: <strong>“Eemaan (Faith) is to believe in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, and to believe in Divine pre-Decree, the good of it and the bad of it.”</strong> This hadeeth was transmitted by AlBukhaaree and Muslim from Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the six foundations from which everything a Muslim is obligated to believe in originates, whether it be with respect to Allaah, the Day of Judgement, and anything else from the Unseen (Ghaib).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>FIRST: FAITH IN ALLAAH</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Faith in Allaah entails: Believing that He is the only true God that has the right to be worshipped apart from everyone else, due to His being the Creator of the servants (i.e. humans/jinn), the One who is kind to them, the Grantor of their sustenance, the All-Knower of their inner and outer actions, the One who is All-Able to reward those who obey Him and punish those who disobey Him. Allaah created these two species (the Jinn and mankind) for the purpose of this worship, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And I did not create the Jinn and mankind except to worship Me. I do not seek any provision from them nor that they should feed Me. Verily, Allaah is the All-Provider, Owner of Power, Most Strong.”</strong> [Surah Adh-Dhaariyaat: 56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O you who believe! Worship your Lord who created you and those before you in order that you may gain Taqwaa (fear and dutifulness to Allaah). He is the One who made the earth a resting place for you and the sky as a canopy, and sent down water (i.e. rain) from the sky and brought forth therewith fruits as a provision for you. So do not set up rivals with Allaah while you know (that only He is to be worshipped).”</strong> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah sent Messengers and revealed Scriptures to clarify this truth and call to it and to warn from what opposes it, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And we have indeed sent to every nation a Messenger (saying): Worship Allaah alone and avoid the false deities.”</strong> [Surah An-Nahl: 36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And We did not send any messenger before you except that We revealed to Him: No one has the right to be worshipped but I, so worship Me.”</strong> [Surah Al-Anbiyaa: 25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“(This is) a Book, the Verses whereof are perfected and then explained in detail from One (Allaah) who is All-Wise and Well-Acquainted (with all things): (Saying) worship none but Allaah. Verily, I (Muhammad) am unto you from Him a warner and a bringer of glad tidings.”</strong> [Surah Hood: 1-2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reality (meaning) of this worship is to: Single Allaah out in everything that the servants worship Him with, such as supplication, fear, hope, prayer, fasting, sacrificing, making oaths and all the other types of worship with full submission, whilst fearing (His Punishment) and hoping (for His reward), having complete love for Him, and humbling oneself to His Grandness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A large part of the noble Qur’aan was revealed concerning this great principle (i.e. worship), such as Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;So worship Allaah, making the worship sincerely for Him alone. Verily, to Allaah belongs the pure (sincere) religion (i.e. worship).”</strong> [Surah Az-Zumar: 2-3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Israa: 23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“So call upon Allaah, making your worship purely for Him alone, even though the disbelievers may hate it.”</strong> (Surah Ghaafir: 14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the two Saheeh collections, Mu’aadh reported that the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>“The right Allaah has over His servants is that they worship Him alone and not ascribe any partners to Him.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having Faith in Allaah also entails believing in everything that He has ordered and made obligatory upon His servants, such as the five outer pillars of Islaam, which are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Testifying that there is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah<br />
2. Establishing the Prayer<br />
3. Giving the Zakaat<br />
4. Fasting in Ramadaan, and<br />
5. Making the pilgrimage (Hajj) to the Sacred House of Allaah, for those who are able to perform it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This goes as well for the other obligations that have come with the pure legislation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most important and greatest of these (five) pillars is: Testifying that there is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Testifying that there is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah requires that worship be performed purely for Allaah alone, and negates it from everyone else besides Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what is intended by the statement Laa Ilaaha IllaaAllaah, for it’s meaning is: There is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah. So everything that is worshipped besides Allaah, such as a human being or an angel or a Jinn or anything else, then they are worshipped wrongfully. The One who is worshipped truthfully is Allaah alone, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;That is because Allaah, He is the Truth (only true God), and what they invoke on besides Him is falsehood.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Hajj: 62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have explained previously that Allaah created the two species (Jinn and mankind) for the purpose of this great principle, and that He commanded them with it, sent His messengers because of it and revealed His Books for it. So think about this and reflect on it much so that it could become clear to you what a majority of the Muslims have fallen into from manifest ignorance of this fundamental principle such that they worship others along with Allaah and direct His sole rights to other than Him, may Allaah aid us!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Faith in Allaah also entails: Believing that Allaah created all that exists and manages and administers all of their affairs, through His Knowledge and Ability, as He wills. And it entails believing that He is the Owner of this world and the Hereafter, and the Lord of all of the worlds, there being no Creator besides Him or Lord like Him. He sent Messengers and revealed Scriptures to rectify the servants and to call them to that which contains their salvation and success in the current life as well as the Hereafter. And it entails believing that He has no partner in all of that, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Allaah is the Creator of everything, and He is the Guardian of all affairs.&#8221;</strong> [Surah AzZumar: 62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Indeed your Lord is Allaah, Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then rose over the Throne (in a manner that befits His Majesty). He covers the night with the day, seeking it rapidly, and (He created) the sun, the moon, and the stars, (all) are subjected to His Command. Surely, to Him belongs the Creation and the Command. Blessed be Allaah, Lord of all that exists.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-A’raaf: 54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Faith in Allaah also entails: Believing in Allaah’s Perfect Names and Attributes, which have been mentioned in His mighty Book and authentically reported on His trustworthy Messenger, without distorting their meanings (tahreef), denying them (ta’teel), describing their manner (takyeef) or making similarities to them (tamtheel). Rather, they must be left in the manner they were reported without describing how they are, whilst believing in the great meanings they carry, which are descriptions of Allaah. It is obligatory to describe Him with them (i.e. these Names and Attributes) in a manner that befits Him without allowing for His creation to resemble Him in any of His Attributes, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“There is nothing like Him in comparison and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.”</strong> [Surah Ash-Shooraa: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“So do not put forth similarities to Allaah. Verily, Allaah knows and you know not.&#8221;</strong> [Surah An-Nahl: 74]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Creed and Belief of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, from the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger and those who succeeded them upon goodness. And this is what Imaam AbulHasan Al-Ash’aree, may Allaah have mercy on him, reported in his book “Al-Maqaalaat ‘an As’haab-il-Hadeeth wa Ahlis-Sunnah”, as did other scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Awzaa’ee, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “Az-Zuhree and Mak’hool were asked about the verses regarding Allaah’s Attributes, so they replied: ‘Leave them as they have been reported.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Waleed bin Muslim, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “Maalik, Al-Awzaa’ee, Al-Layth bin Sa’ad, and Sufyaan Ath-Thawree were asked about the texts that were reported concerning Allaah’s Attributes, so they all said: ‘Leave them as they have been reported without describing how (they are).’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Awzaa’ee, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “We used to say, while the Taabi’oon (Successors of the Companions) were present and abundant, that Allaah is above His Throne and that we believe in what has been stated in the Sunnah regarding His Attributes.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Rabee’ah bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan, the teacher of Maalik, was asked about Allaah’s rising over His Throne, he replied: “The Rising is not (something) unknown and how it is done is incomprehensible. From Allaah is the Message and upon the Messenger is to openly convey it, and upon us is to believe in it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when Imaam Maalik was asked about it, he said: “The Rising is well known, how it is done is unknown, believing in it is an obligation and asking concerning it is an innovation.” Then he said to the questioner: “I do not consider you to be anything but an evil man.” And he put someone in charge of him and he was cast out, Something with the same meaning was also reported on the Mother of the Believers, Umm Salamah (radyAllaahu ‘anhaa).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Abu ‘Abdir-Rahmaan ‘Abdullaah bin Al-Mubaarak, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “We know our Lord as being above His heavens and over His Throne, apart from His creation.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The statements of the Imaams regarding this subject are many and cannot all be quoted in this small treatise. Whoever wants to come across many of these narrations should refer to what the scholars of the Sunnah wrote regarding this topic, such as the book “As-Sunnah” of Imaam ‘Abdullaah, son of Imaam Ahmad, the book “At-Tawheed” of the noble Imaam, Muhammad bin Khuzaimah, the book “As-Sunnah” of Abul-Qaasim Al-Laalikaa’ee At-Tabaree, the book “AsSunnah” of Abu Bakr Ibn Abee ‘Aasim, as well as the response that Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah wrote to the people of Hamaa (i.e. ‘Aqeedah Hamawiyyah), which is a tremendous response containing many benefits. In this treatise, he, may Allaah have mercy on him, explains the Creed of Ahlus-Sunnah and quotes many of their statements, as well as religious and intellectual evidences for the authenticity of what Ahlus-Sunnah believes and the falseness of what their opponents believe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same goes for his distinguished treatise “At-Tadmuriyyah”, for in it he goes into depth clarifying the Creed of Ahlus-Sunnah based on their textual and logical proofs, and refuting the opponents with arguments that manifest the truth and invalidate the falsehood for anyone amongst the people of knowledge who examines it with a pure intention and a genuine desire for learning the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone that opposes Ahlus-Sunnah in what they believe regarding the subject of Allaah’s Names and Attributes no doubt will fall into opposing the textual and logical evidences while having clear contradictions in everything that he affirms and negates.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, then they affirm for Allaah what He has affirmed for Himself (from Names and Attributes) in His noble Book or what His Messenger Muhammad has affirmed for Him in his authentic Sunnah without tamtheel (i.e. resembling them to someone else’s names and attributes). And they negate and remove Him from resembling His creation in any way, in such a manner that is free from ta’teel (i.e. denying the Names and Attributes). So they have been saved from contradictions, while acting upon all of the proofs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the way of Allaah with regard to he who accepts the truth that the Messengers were sent with, expends all of his efforts in that, and sincerely asks Allaah to grant him the truth and make the correct view apparent to him, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Nay, We fling the truth against falsehood, so it destroys it, and behold, it is vanished.”</strong> [Surah Al-Anbiyaa: 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And no example or similitude do they bring to you (in order to find fault in you or the Qur’aan), except that We reveal to you the truth (against that similitude) and the best explanation (thereof).&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Furqaan: 33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his famous Tafseer, while speaking about the statement of Allaah: <strong>“Indeed your Lord is Allaah, who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then rose over the Throne”</strong> [Surah Al-A’raaf: 54], Al-Haafidh Ibn Katheer, may Allaah have mercy on him, stated some excellent words on this subject, which we would like to quote here due to their great benefit:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, may Allaah have mercy on him, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“People have many views with regard to this subject and this is not the place to go into that. But rather, with regard to this topic, (I say that) we traverse the way of the pious predecessors: Maalik, Al-Awzaa’ee, Ath-Thawree, Al-Layth bin Sa’ad, Ash-Shaafi’ee, Ahmad, Ishaaq bin Raahawayh, and other Muslim Imaams from the past and present…” – which is to leave them as they have been reported without describing their manner (takyeef), making resemblances to them (tashbeeh), and denying them completely (ta’teel).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the thoughts that present themselves to the minds of those who give Allaah’s Attributes similitudes is negated from Allaah, for indeed nothing can resemble Allaah from His creation. There is nothing like Him in comparison and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer. Rather, the matter is as the Imaams have stated, amongst whom was Na’eem bin Hamaad Al-Khuzaa’ee, the teacher of Al-Bukhaaree, who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Whoever likens Allaah to His creation has committed disbelief. And whoever denies what Allaah has described Himself with has committed disbelief. There is no tashbeeh (likening to the creation’s attributes) in what Allaah and His Messenger have described Him with. So whoever affirms for Allaah what has been stated in the clear verses and authentic reports, in the manner that befits Allaah’s majesty, while negating all deficiencies from Him, has embarked on the path of guidance.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">SECOND: FAITH IN THE ANGELS</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This entails believing in them generally and specifically. Therefore, the Muslim must believe that Allaah has angels, which He created to obey Him. And He described them as being honorable servants who do not precede Him in speech and act on His Command.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“He knows what is before them and what is after them, and they cannot intercede except for him with whom He is pleased. And they stand in awe for fear of Him.”</strong> [Surah Al-Anbiyaa: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are of many types, amongst them are those who are entrusted to hold the Throne, and amongst them are those who guard Paradise and Hell. And amongst them are those who are entrusted to record the deeds of people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Specifically, we must believe in those angels that Allaah and His Messenger have mentioned by name, such as Jibreel, Mikaa’eel, Maalik, the gatekeeper of Hell, and Israafeel, the angel in charge of blowing the Trumpet. He (Israafeel) has been mentioned in several authentic ahaadeeth. It is authentically reported in the Saheeh that ‘Aa’ishah (radyAllaahu ‘anhaa) narrated that the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “<strong>The angels were created from light, and the Jinn were created from a smokeless flame of fire. And Aadam was created from what has already been described to you</strong>.” [1] Reported by Muslim in his Saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">THIRD: FAITH IN THE REVEALED BOOKS</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We must believe generally that Allaah revealed books to His prophets and messengers in order to explain His right and to call to it, as Allaah states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Indeed, We have sent Our messengers with clear proofs, and revealed with them the Book and the Balance in order that mankind may establish justice.”</strong> [Surah Al-Hadeed: 25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Mankind was once one nation (upon polytheism) so Allaah sent prophets bearing good news and warning, and with them He sent down the Book in truth to judge between people in matters wherein they differed.”</strong> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 213]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we must believe, in specific and detailed terms, those books that Allaah has mentioned by name, such as the Torah (Tawraat), the Gospel (Injeel), the Psalms (Zaboor) and the Qur’aan. The noble Qur’aan is the best amongst them and the final revelation. And it is that which supercedes all of them and confirms them. And it is the Book that all of the (Muslim) nation is obligated to follow and to judge by, along with what is authentically reported in the Sunnah from Allaah’s Messenger. This is since Allaah sent His Messenger, Muhammad, as a messenger to everyone from the two species (i.e. Jinn and mankind), and He revealed this Book to him so that he could judge them by it. He also made it a cure for the hearts, a source of explanation for everything, and a guide and a mercy to the believers. This is as Allaah states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And this (Qur’aan) is a blessed Book, which We have revealed, so follow it and be dutiful (to Allaah) so that you can receive (His) mercy.”</strong> [Surah Al-An’aam: 155]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And We revealed to you (O Muhammad) the Book (i.e. the Qur’aan) as an explanation for everything, a guide and a mercy and glad tidings for the Muslims.”</strong> [Surah An-Nahl: 89]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Say (Muhammad): O mankind! Verily, I am the Messenger of Allaah sent to all of you (by) the One to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. No one has the right to be worshipped except Him. It is He who gives life and causes death. So believe in Allaah and His Messenger, the unlettered prophet (i.e. cannot read or write), who believes in Allaah and His revelations, and follow him so that you may be guided.”</strong> [Surah Al-A’raaf: 158]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The verses bearing this meaning are many.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">FOURTH: FAITH IN THE MESSENGERS</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One must believe in the messengers both in general and in detail. This means, he must believe that Allaah sent to His servants messengers from among them, bringing glad tidings (of Paradise) and warning (of the Hellfire) and calling them to the truth. So whoever answered their call, achieved success and whoever opposed them, failed and will regret.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The last and most virtuous of them is our prophet, Muhammad the son of ‘Abdullaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And We have indeed sent a messenger to every nation, (saying to them): ‘Worship Allaah and stay away from the false deities.’”</strong> [Surah An-Nahl: 36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Messengers as bearers of good news and warners – In order that mankind should have no excuse (i.e. proof) against Allaah after the (coming of) Messengers.”</strong> [Surah AnNisaa: 165]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but rather he is the Messenger of Allaah and the Seal (last) of the Prophets.”</strong> [Surah Al-Ahzaab: 40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All the prophets whom Allaah named or for whom it is authentically reported that Allaah’s Messenger mentioned by name, we must believe in him according to the detailed and specific manner, such as Nooh (Noah), Hood, Saalih, Ibraaheem (Abraham) and so on, may Allaah bestow the best and purest of His peace and blessings on them and on our Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>FIFTH: FAITH IN THE LAST DAY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for having faith in the Last Day, then it entails believing in everything that Allaah and His Messenger have informed of concerning what will occur after death, such as the trial of the grave, and the punishment or pleasure that will occur in it. It also includes what will happen on the Day of Judgement such as grief and severities, the placing of the Bridge and the Balance, the accounting (of deeds) and their recompense, and the distribution of the records of deeds to the people. There will be those who will receive their book of deeds on their right hands and those who will receive their book of deeds on their left hands or from behind their backs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also entails believing in the Fountain, which will be given to our Prophet Muhammad (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), and believing in Paradise and Hell, and (believing) that the believers will see their Lord and that He will talk to them, as well as whatever else has been mentioned in the noble Qur’aan and the authentic Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So one is obligated to believe and have faith in all of this, in the manner in which Allaah and His Messenger have explained to us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>SIXTH: FAITH IN THE DIVINE PRE-DECREE</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for having faith in Allaah’s Divine Pre-Decree, then this entails believing in four things: First: That Allaah already knows what has occurred and what will occur. And He knows the conditions of His servants, and He knows their provisions, their life spans, their deeds and other affairs of their lives. Nothing of this remains hidden to Him, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily Allaah is knowledgeable of everything.”</strong> [Surah Al-Mujaadilah: 7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;That you may know that Allaah has power over all things, and that Allaah encompasses everything with His Knowledge.&#8221;</strong> [Surah At-Talaaq: 12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second: That Allaah has recorded everything that He has pre-decreed and ordained to occur, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“We know that which the earth takes of them (i.e. their dead bodies), and with Us is a Book preserved.”</strong> [Surah Qaaf: 4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And all things We have recorded in a Clear Book.&#8221;</strong> [Surah YaaSeen: 12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Know you not that Allaah knows all that is in the heaven and on the earth? Verily, it is all in a Book (Preserved Tablet). Surely that is easy for Allaah.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Hajj: 70]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: Believing that what He wills is put into effect and carried out. So whatever He wills comes to be and whatever He doesn’t will, will not come to pass. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily, Allaah does what He wills.”</strong> [Surah Al-Hajj: 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily His Command is that when He desires something, He says to it: ‘Be&#8217;, and it is.”</strong> [Surah YaaSeen: 82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And you cannot will unless it be that Allaah Wills, Lord of all that exists.”</strong> [Surah AtTakweer: 29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth</strong>: Believing that He created everything that exists, there being no Creator besides Him and no Lord other than Him, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Allaah is the Creator of everything, and He is the Guardian of all affairs.&#8221;</strong> [Surah AzZumar: 62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“O mankind! Remember Allaah’s Favor upon you! Is there a creator besides Allaah that provides for you from the heaven and the earth? There is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Him, so how can you turn away (from Him)?” [Surah Faatir: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So having Faith in the Divine Pre-Decree entails believing in these four things, according to Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, contrary to those amongst the innovators who reject some of the above.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What also falls under Faith in Allaah is: Believing that Faith (Eemaan) is speech and action, which increases with obedience (i.e. good deeds) and decreases with disobedience (i.e. sins), and that it is not permissible to declare anyone among the Muslims a disbeliever due to any sin, besides Shirk and disbelief, whether it be fornication, stealing, dealing in interest, drinking intoxicants, disobeying the parents or any of the other major sins, so long as one does not deem these sins to be permissible. This is based on Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Verily, Allaah does not forgive that partners be ascribed to Him (Shirk), but He forgives what is less than that to whom He wills.” [Surah An-Nisaa: 116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is also based on what has been authentically reported in the numerous ahaadeeth from the Prophet that: “Allaah will extract from the Hellfire whoever has in his heart an atom’s weight of Faith.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Faith in Allaah also entails loving for the sake of Allaah and hating for the sake of Allaah, as well as making allegiance for the sake of Allaah and making enmity for the sake of Allaah. So the believer loves and befriends the believers, and he hates and has enmity towards the disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At the head of the believers of this ummah are: the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam). So Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah love and befriend them and believe that they are the best of people after the prophets, due to the Prophet’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The best of generations is my generation, then those that come after them, then those that come after them.” [Its authenticity is agreed upon]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they hold that the best among the Companions was Abu Bakr As-Siddeeq, then ‘Umar AlFaarooq, then ‘Uthmaan Dhun-Noorain, then ‘Alee Al-Murtadaa, may Allaah be pleased with all of them. And after them (in excellence) comes the remaining ten Companions who were given the glad tidings of Paradise, then the rest of the Companions, may Allaah be pleased with all of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they refrain from whatever disputes occurred between the Companions, believing that they were Mujtahideen in that regard, therefore whoever amongst them was correct got two rewards whereas whoever was wrong got one reward. And they love the members of the household of Allaah’s Messenger who believed in him, thus showing allegiance to them. And they show allegiance to the wives of Allaah’s Messenger, the Mothers of the Believers, and are pleased with all of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they free themselves from the way of the Rawaafid (Raafidees), who hate and revile the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger and who go to extremes with regard to the members of the Prophet’s Household, raising them above the status Allaah gave them. And likewise they free themselves from the way of the Nawaasib (Naasibees) who disparage the members of the Prophet’s Household with words and actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everything that we mentioned in this brief treatise regarding the Correct Belief, that Allaah sent His Messenger Muhammad with, is the Creed of the Saved Sect, Ahlus-Sunnah walJamaa’ah, which the Prophet spoke about when he said: “There will not cease to be a group from my ummah victorious upon the truth. Those who break away from them will not be able to harm them, until the Order of Allaah comes.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “The Jews split into seventy-one sects and the Christians split into seventy-two sects. And this ummah will split into seventy-three sects – all of them will be in the Hellfire except one.” So the Companions said: “Which one is it O Messenger of Allaah?” He (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Those who are upon the likes of that which I and my Companions are upon.” This refers to the Creed that one is obligated to abide by, remain steadfast upon, and be cautious of what opposes it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who deviate from this Creed and those who follow its opposite, then they are of several types: Amongst them are those who worship idols, statues, angels, awliyaa (pious worshippers), Jinn, trees, stones, etc. These people have not answered the call of the messengers. On the contrary they have opposed and rejected them, as Quraish and other Arab tribes did with our prophet Muhammad. They would ask their deities to grant their needs, cure their ill and defeat their enemies, and they would offer sacrifices and make vows to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) forbade them from this and ordered them to sincerely worship Allaah alone, they found this strange and rejected it, saying: “Has he made (all) the gods into one God? This is truly a strange thing!” [Surah Saad: 5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he did not stop from calling them to Allaah and warning them from Shirk, and from explaining to them the reality of what he was calling to, to the point that Allaah guided those among them whom He guided. Afterward, scores of people entered into the Religion of Allaah and so the religion of Allaah become triumphant over all the other religions after an extensive call and long Jihaad from Allaah’s Messenger, his Companions and those who followed them in goodness. Then the conditions changed and ignorance prevailed over a majority of the creation to the point that a large portion of them turned back to the Religion of the Days of Ignorance, by going to extremes with regard to the prophets and pious worshippers, by supplicating to them, seeking assistance from them and performing other forms of Shirk. And they didn’t know the meaning of Laa Ilaaha IlaaAllaah, the way the disbelieving Arabs (during the time of the Prophet) used to understand it, and we seek Allaah’s aid!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Shirk has not stopped spreading amongst the people even to this time of ours due to the overwhelming magnitude of ignorance and the long distance of time that has passed since prophethood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The argument that these contemporary people use as proof is the same argument that those in the past used, which is their saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“These (idols) are our intercessors before Allaah” [Surah Yoonus: 18] and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“We only worship them so that they can bring us closer to Allaah.” [Surah Az-Zumar: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has invalidated this argument and clarified that whoever worships other than Him, whoever it may be, has ascribed partners to Him and disbelieved, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And they worship besides Allaah (false deities) that can neither harm them nor benefit them, and they say: ‘These (idols) are our intercessors before Allaah.’” [Surah Yoonus: 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah refuted them saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Say: &#8216;Are you informing Allaah of something He doesn’t know in the heavens and the earth? Far removed and High above is He from the partners they ascribe to Him!’” [Surah Yoonus: 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah explains in these verses that worshipping others besides Him, such as prophets, pious worshippers or anyone else, is considered major Shirk, even if those who commit it may call it by another name. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Those who take others as supporters besides Allaah say: ‘We only worship them so that they can bring us closer to Allaah.’” [Surah Az-Zumar: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah refuted them by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Verily Allaah will judge between them concerning that which they differed on. Verily, Allaah does not guide he who is a liar, a disbeliever.” [Surah Az-Zumar: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He clarified by this that their worship of others besides Him, be it through supplication, fear, hope and so on is in fact disbelieving in Him. And He denied their statement that their gods would bring them closer to Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the ideologies of disbelief that contradict the authentic Creed and oppose what the messengers came with is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What the atheists of this era believe in, such as the followers of Marx, Lenin and others who call to atheism and disbelief, regardless of whether they call that socialism, communism, ba’athism or any other name, for indeed from the base principles of these atheists is the belief that there is no god and that life is only (based on) matter. And from their principles is to reject the Day of Final Return, Paradise, Hellfire, and to disbelieve in all of the religions. Whoever examines their books and studies what beliefs they were upon will come to know that with full certainty. No doubt this belief is in contradiction to all of the heavenly revealed religions and leads its followers to the worst of fates in this world and the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the beliefs that are in opposition to the truth is that which some of the Baatinees and Sufis believe in that some of those whom they call awliyaa (saints) share with Allaah in His administration, and that they manage the affairs of the world. They call them Aqtaab, Awtaad, Aghwaath and other names that they have devised for their (false) gods. This is from the vilest forms of Shirk committed with regard to Allaah’s Lordship, and it is worse than the Shirk (polytheism) that was performed during the Days of Ignorance of the Arabs. This is since the disbelievers among the (first) Arabs did not commit Shirk with regard to Allaah’s Lordship, but rather they would only ascribe partners to Allaah in His worship. And their Shirk would occur during times of ease only. But as for times of distress and dire need, they would worship</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah sincerely, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And when they embark on a ship, they invoke Allaah, making their Faith pure for Him alone. But when He brings them safely to land, behold, they give a share of their worship to others.” [Surah Al-‘Ankaboot: 65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Allaah’s Lordship, they used to acknowledge that it belonged solely to Allaah alone, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And if you were to ask them who created them, they would surely say &#8216;Allaah.’&#8221; [Surah Az-Zukhruf: 87]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Say: &#8216;Who provides for you from the heaven and from the earth?’ Or ‘Who has power over hearing and sight?’ And ‘Who brings out the living from the dead and the dead from the living?’ And ‘Who administers all of the affairs?&#8217; They would surely say: &#8216;Allaah.&#8217; Say: &#8216;Will you not then fear and be dutiful to Him?’” [Surah Yoonus: 31] The verses bearing this same meaning are many.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the contemporary polytheists, they have surpassed the first polytheists in two things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: Some of them ascribe partners to Allaah in His Lordship</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second: They commit Shirk (polytheism) in times of comfort and in times of distress, as can be understood by the one who mixes with them, examines their conditions and looks at what they do at the gravesites of Al-Husayn, Al-Badawee and others in Egypt, and at the gravesite of Al-‘Eidroos in ‘Aden, Al-Haadee in Yemen, Ibn ‘Arabee in Syria, Shaikh ‘Abdul-Qaadir AlJilaanee in Iraq, and all the other gravesites that the common folk have gone to extremes about and to which they have transferred many of Allaah’s sole rights. How few are those who forbid them from this and explain to them the reality of Tawheed, which Allaah sent our prophet Muhammad and the messengers before him with. So verily to Allaah we belong and verily to Him we will return!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah to return them to what is correct and to place many callers of guidance amongst them and that He grant the Muslim leaders and scholars the ability to wage war against this Shirk (polytheism), verily He is the All-Hearer, the All-Encompassing. And from the beliefs that oppose the Correct Creed with regard to Allaah’s Names and Attributes are the beliefs of the innovators from the Jahmiyyah and the Mu’atazliah, as well as those who follow their way, which is that of negating Allaah’s Attributes, denying His Attributes of perfection, and describing Him with attributes of non-existence and inanimateness. Far removed is Allaah from their views!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What falls under this category are those who negate some of Allaah’s Attributes while affirming others, such as the Ash’arees, for indeed those Attributes that they do affirm necessitates the same thing that they are fleeing from with regard to the Attributes that they negate and whose evidences they misinterpret. So because of this, they have opposed the textual and logical proofs and fallen into clear contradiction. But as for Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, they affirm all the Names and Attributes that Allaah has affirmed for Himself or that His Messenger Muhammad has affirmed for Him, in a perfect manner. And they make Him free from resembling His creation in any way, without resorting to complete denial (of His Attributes). So they act upon all of the textual evidences, not distorting them or rejecting them. Thus they saved themselves from the contradictions that others fell into, as we have explained previously. This is the path of salvation and prosperity in this world and in the Hereafter. And it is the Straight Path, which the predecessors and Imaams of this ummah treaded upon. And (know) that the last part of this (Muslim) nation will not be rectified except with that which rectified its first part, and that is: Following the Qur’aan and the Sunnah and abandoning what opposes them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>THE NULLIFIERS OF ISLAAM</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know O Muslim brother that Allaah has obligated all of His servants to enter the fold of Islaam, to hold tightly onto it and to beware of those things that oppose it. And He sent His Prophet, Muhammad (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), to call the people to that, informing us that whoever follows him is guided, whereas whoever turns away from him is astray. In many ayaat (verses) of the Qur’aan, He has warned us about the things that cause one to apostate as well as all the rest of the types of Shirk (polytheism) and Kufr (disbelief).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars, may Allaah have mercy on them, have mentioned in their chapters on the “Ruling of the Apostate”, that a Muslim may apostate from his Religion through various types of Nullifiers (of Faith), which cause his life and wealth to become permissible (for taking) and which causes him to leave from the fold of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the most dangerous amongst them and those that occur most often are ten nullifiers [2] that we will mention to you in the following lines, in a summarized manner, so that you may beware of them and warn others about them, hoping that Allaah will protect and safeguard us from them. We will also mention a few short clarifications after them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: Shirk (associating partners) in the worship of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Verily, Allaah does not forgive that partners be associated with Him in worship (Shirk), but He forgives what is less than that to whom He wills.” [Surah An-Nisaa: 116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Verily, the one who mixes partners in worship with Allaah (Shirk), then Paradise has been made forbidden for him and his final abode will be the Hellfire. And the wrongdoers will not have any helpers (in Hell).” [Surah Al-Maa’idah: 72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What falls into this is supplicating and invoking the deceased, seeking assistance from them, as well as making oaths to them and offering sacrificial animals to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: Whoever places intermediaries between himself and Allaah, asking them to intercede on his behalf, and relying on them, has committed disbelief according to the unanimous agreement of the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: Whoever does not hold the polytheists to be disbelievers, or has doubts about their disbelief or considers their ways and beliefs to be correct, has committed disbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth</strong>: Whoever believes that some guidance other than that of the Prophet’s (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) is more complete than his guidance and that someone else’s judgement is better than his judgement, such as those who prefer the judgement of the Tawaagheet (pl. of Taaghoot; false deities/religions) over his judgement, then he is a disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifth</strong>: Whoever hates something that the Messenger came with, even though he may act on it, has disbelieved, based on Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“That is because they disliked what Allaah sent down, so He nullified their (good) deeds.” [Surah Muhammad: 9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sixth</strong>: Whoever mocks or ridicules any part of the Messenger’s Religion or its rewards or punishments has committed an act of disbelief. The proof for this is Allaah’s statement: “Say: ‘Was it Allaah and His verses and His Messenger that you were mocking? Make no excuses, you have disbelieved after having had faith.” [Surah At-Tawbah: 65-66]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Seventh</strong>: Sorcery, which includes magic spells that causes a person to hate (sarf)[3] or love (‘atf)[4] someone/something. So whoever performs it or is pleased with it being done, has committed disbelief. The proof for this is Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And neither of these two (angels) would teach anyone until they had first said to them: ‘We are only a trial (for the people), so do not commit disbelief.’” [Surah Al-Baqarah: 102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Eighth</strong>: Supporting and assisting the polytheists against the Muslims. The proof for this is Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And whoever amongst you takes them (i.e. the disbelievers) as allies and protectors then he is indeed from among them. Verily, Allaah does not guide a wrong-doing [5] people.” [Surah Al-Maa’idah: 51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ninth</strong>: Whoever believes that it is permitted for some people to be free of (implementing) the Sharee’ah (revealed laws) of Muhammad (i.e. Islaam), then he is a disbeliever, according to Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And whoever seeks a Religion other than Islaam, it will never be accepted from him and in the Hereafter, he will be from among the losers.” [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 85]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tenth</strong>: Turning away from Allaah’s Religion, not learning it or implementing it (is an act of disbelief). The proof for this is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And who does more wrong6 than he who is reminded7 of the ayaat (signs/verses) of his Lord, then turns away [8] from them. Verily, We shall extract retribution [9] from the criminals.” [Surah As-Sajdah: 22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no difference, with regard to (committing any of) these nullifiers, between the one who jokes, the one who is serious or the one who does so out of fear. However, the one who commits them due to being coerced (is excused). All of these (ten) matters are from the gravest in danger and from those that most often occur. So the Muslim must beware of them and fear from these acts befalling him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What falls into the Fourth Nullifier are those who believe that the man-made laws and constitutions that the people have legislated are better than the Sharee’ah (laws) of Islaam. Or those who believe that it is not correct to implement the Laws of Islaam in the twentieth century.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or that this is a cause for the backwardness of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or that it is limited to only playing a part in the relationship between the servant and his Lord and that it should not interfere in the other affairs of life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What also falls under this fourth category are those who hold that carrying out Allaah laws, such as cutting off the hand of a thief or stoning a guilty adulterer is not befitting for this modern era.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What also falls under this category are those who believe that it is permissible to rule by other than the Laws of Allaah (Sharee’ah) in matters of interactions, penal laws and so on, even if he doesn’t believe that it is better than ruling by the Sharee’ah. This is since by doing this, he will be making lawful that which Allaah has made forbidden, according to the unanimous consensus (Ijmaa’).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone that makes lawful that which Allaah has prohibited from the matters that one is required to know by necessity, such as fornication, alcohol, interest and ruling by other than Allaah’s Laws, then he is a disbeliever according to the Ijmaa’ (unanimous consensus) of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We seek refuge in Allaah from those things that bring about His Anger and painful Punishment. May the peace and blessings be on the best of His creatures, Muhammad (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">Is there any difference between a Messenger and a Prophet?</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yes, the scholars say that a Prophet is one who receives Revelation from Allaah of a law, but he is not commanded to propagate it, only to practice it himself, without being called upon to disseminate it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Messenger is one who receives Revelation from Allaah of a law and he is called upon to propagate it and to act upon it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every Messenger is a Prophet, but not every Prophet is a Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophets are more in number than the Messengers, and Allaah has related the stories of some of the Messengers in the Quran and others He has not related. Allaah, the Most High says: <span style="color:#008000;">And indeed We have sent Messengers before you (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam)): Of some of them We have related to you their story, and some of them we have not related to you their story. And it was not given to any Messenger that he should bring a Sign except by the leave of Allaah.</span> [1] Based upon this Verse, it is plain that every Prophet mentioned in the Quran is a Messenger.</p>
<p>[1] Ghafir 40:78</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Shaikh Saalih bin Fawzaan Al-Fawzaan<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a complete translation of a short treatise called <b>“<i>Al-Eemaan bil-Malaa’ikah wa Atharuhu fee Hayaat-il-Ummah</i>”</b> [Belief in the Angels and its Effect in the Life of the Ummah] written by Shaikh Saalih bin Fawzaan Al-Fawzaan, a member of the Council of Senior Scholars in Saudi Arabia. The source used for this translation was the Arabic version found on the Shaikh’s web site: alfuzan.net.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Although this treatise is short in size, it provides many proofs and evidences for the descriptions, duties and general characteristics of the angels, and gives many splendid points of benefit concerning the angels and our place with respect to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As the author mentions in this treatise, our purpose for learning about the angels is not just for the sake of knowing about them for our general understanding, but rather, it is so that we can become conscious of their constant presence around us and their effect in our daily lives. Also, if we become conscious of the fact that there are two angels with us at all times recording our statements and actions, we would become cautious of what we say and do lest our guardian angels record something about us for which we will be held accountable before Allaah. In addition to this, we must also bear in mind that Belief in the Angels is one of the six pillars of Eemaan, which every Muslim is obligated to have knowledge of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“These are the three angels that are responsible for life. Jibreel is responsible for bringing the revelation, which brings life into the hearts. Mikaa’eel is responsible for the raindrops, which bring life to the earth after its death. Israafeel is responsible for blowing on the trumpet, which will bring life to the bodies (on the Day of Resurrection). This is why when the Prophet  would get up for prayer at night, after saying the opening Takbeer, he sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam would say in his opening supplication: <b>‘O Allaah! Lord of Jibreel, Mikaa’eel and Israafeel, Originator of the heavens and the earth…’</b>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Death is ascribed to Allaah here because He is the One who orders it to occur. It is also ascribed to the angels because they are the ones who physically carry that out by gathering the soul and leading it out of the human’s body until it reaches his throat. And it is also ascribed to the Angel of Death –<b>‘Say: ‘The Angel of Death, who is set over you, will take your souls’’</b> – because he is the one in charge of seizing the souls after they have been rounded up in the last stage (of death).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There are also angels that are responsible for protecting humans from perils. A human being is prone to walk into dangers everyday. However, Allaah entrusts angels that guard and protect him from these dangers during his lifetime, which Allaah has ordained for him. This earth, which a human being walks upon everyday, contains many dangers. There are wild beasts, snakes, scorpions, not to mention transgressors from among humans – enemies and oppressors. However, Allaah has placed these angels around the human being. Allaah says: <b>‘He (a person) has those (angels) who constantly surround him – from before him and behind him, protecting him by the Command of Allaah.’</b> [Surah Ar-Ra’ad: 11] Therefore, so long as Allaah has decreed that this individual will be safe from harms, these angels will protect and guard him, and no human will be able to harm him. But if Allaah desires to bring an end to his appointed time, He removes them from him – one from before him and one from behind him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Belief in the Angels has a tremendous effect on the life of humans, since if a person is aware of them, he will indeed be cautious and mindful. If a person realizes that there are angels entrusted to him who constantly surround him day and night, he will surely be cautious of what he says and does, lest something is recorded about him that is not befitting. So if he knew that there were investigators following him, wouldn’t he be cautious out of fear that they might take hold of some speech or action of his which will cause him a harmful end? So how can he not then be cautious and mindful of the angels when he doesn’t see them? But as for humans, you can see them. So the one who is watching you and you can see him, you are wary about him. However, the angels see you but you cannot see them. It is possible that you might be able to protect yourself from humans – you can go inside your home or lock yourself up in some secluded area and they would not be able to gain any information about you. But as for the angels, they enter with you everywhere. Allaah has given them the ability to reach and access any place that He commands them to reach.”</p>

Accidentally we came across Abdullah ibn Umar ibn al-Khattab, while he was entering the mosque. My companion and I surrounded him. One of us (stood) on his right and the other stood on his left. I expected that my companion would authorize me to speak. I therefore said: Abu Abdur Rahman! there have appeared some people in our land who recite the Holy Qur&#8217;an and pursue knowledge. And then after talking about their affairs, added: They (such people) claim that there is no such thing as Divine Decree and events are not predestined. He (Abdullah ibn Umar) said: When you happen to meet such people tell them that I have nothing to do with them and they have nothing to do with me. And verily they are in no way responsible for my (belief). Abdullah ibn Umar swore by Him (the Lord) (and said): If any one of them (who does not believe in the Divine Decree) had with him gold equal to the bulk of (the mountain) Uhud and then, it (in the way of Allah), Allah would not accept it unless he affirmed his faith in Divine Decree. He further said: My father, Umar ibn al-Khattab, told me: One day we were sitting in the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (peace be upon him) when there appeared before us a man dressed in pure white clothes, his hair extraordinarily black. There were no signs of travel on him. None amongst us recognized him. At last he sat with the Apostle (peace be upon him) He knelt before him placed his palms on his thighs and said: Muhammad, inform me about al-Islam. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: Al-Islam implies that you testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah, and you establish prayer, pay Zakat, observe the fast of Ramadan, and perform pilgrimage to the (House) if you are solvent enough (to bear the expense of) the journey. He (the inquirer) said: You have told the truth. He (Umar ibn al-Khattab) said: It amazed us that he would put the question and then he would himself verify the truth. He (the inquirer) said: Inform me about Iman (faith). He (the Holy Prophet) replied: That you affirm your faith in Allah, in His angels, in His Books, in His Apostles, in the Day of Judgment, and you affirm your faith in the Divine Decree about good and evil. He (the inquirer) said: You have told the truth. He (the inquirer) again said: Inform me about al-Ihsan (performance of good deeds). He (the Holy Prophet) said: That you worship Allah as if you are seeing Him, for though you don&#8217;t see Him, He, verily, sees you. He (the enquirer) again said: Inform me about the hour (of the Doom). He (the Holy Prophet) remarked: One who is asked knows no more than the one who is inquiring (about it). He (the inquirer) said: Tell me some of its indications. He (the Holy Prophet) said: That the slave-girl will give birth to her mistress and master, that you will find barefooted, destitute goat-herds vying with one another in the construction of magnificent buildings. He (the narrator, Umar ibn al-Khattab) said: Then he (the inquirer) went on his way but I stayed with him (the Holy Prophet) for a long while. He then, said to me: Umar, do you know who this inquirer was? I replied: Allah and His Apostle knows best. He (the Holy Prophet) remarked: He was Gabriel (the angel). He came to you in order to instruct you in matters of religion.</p>

Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) replied: That you affirm your faith in Allah, His angels, His Books, His meeting, His Messengers and that you affirm your faith in the Resurrection hereafter. He (again) said: Messenger of Allah, (tell me) what does al-Islam signify. He (the Holy Prophet) replied: Al-Islam signifies that you worship Allah and do not associate anything with Him and you establish obligatory prayer and you pay the obligatory poor-rate (Zakat) and you observe the fast of Ramadan. He (the inquirer) again said: Messenger of Allah, what does al-Ihsan imply? He (the Holy Prophet) replied: That you worship Allah as if you are seeing Him, and in case you fail to see Him, then observe prayer (with this idea in your mind) that (at least) He is seeing you. He (the inquirer ) again said: Messenger of Allah, when would there be the hour (of Doom)? He (the Holy Prophet) replied: The one who is asked about it is no better informed than the inquirer. I, however, narrate some of its signs (and these are): when the slave-girl will give birth to he master, when the naked, barefooted would become the chiefs of the people &#8211; these are some of the signs of (Doom). (Moreover) when the shepherds of the black (camels) would exult themselves in buildings, this is one of the signs of (Doom). (Doom) is one of the five (happenings wrapped in the unseen) which no one knows but Allah. Then he (the Messenger of Allah) recited (the verse):&#8221; Verily Allah! with Him alone is the knowledge of the hour and He it is Who sends (down the rain) and knows that which is in the wombs and no person knows whatsoever he shall earn tomorrow, and a person knows not in whatsoever land he shall die. Verily Allah is Knowing, Aware. He (the narrator, Abu Huraira) said: Then the person turned back and went away. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Bring that man back to me. They (the Companions of the Holy Prophet present there) went to bring him back, but they saw nothing there. Upon this the Messenger of Allah remarked: he was Gabriel, who came to teach the people their religion.</p>

And when you see the shepherds of black camels exult in buildings &#8211; that is one of the signs of Doom. The (Doom) is one of the five things (wrapped) in the unseen. No one knows them except Allah. Then (the Holy Prophet) recited (the folowing verse):&#8221; Verily Allah! with Him alone is the knowledge of the hour and He it is Who sends down the rain and knows that which is in the wombs and no person knows whatsoever he shall earn on morrow and a person knows not in whatsoever land he shall die.

They (the members of the delegation) said: Messenger of Allah, we come to you from a far-off distance and there lives between you and us a tribe of the unbelievers of Mudar and, therefore, it is not possible for us to come to you except in the sacred months. Thus direct us to a clear command, about which we should inform people beside us and by which we may enter heaven. He (the Holy Prophet) replied: I command you to do four deeds and forbid you to do four (acts), and added: I direct you to affirm belief in Allah alone, and then asked them: Do you know what belief in Allah really implies? They said: Allah and His Messenger know best. The Prophet said: It implies testimony to the fact that there is no god but Allah, and that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah, establishment of prayer, payment of Zakat, fast of Ramadan, that you pay one-fifth of the booty (fallen to your lot) and I forbid you to use gourd, wine jar, or a receptacle for wine.

And I prohibit you from four (things): dry gourds, green-coloured jars, hollowed stumps of palm-trees, and receptacles. They (the members of the delegation) said: Do you know what al-naqir is? He replied: Yes, it is a stump which you hollow out and in which you throw small dates. Sa&#8217;id said: He (the Holy Prophet) used the word tamar (dates). (The Holy Prophet then added): Then you sprinkle water over it and when its ebullition subsides, you drink it (and you are so intoxicated) that one amongst you, or one amongst them (the other members of your tribe, who were not present there) strikes his cousin with the sword. He (the narrator) said: There was a man amongst us who had sustained injury on this very account due to (intoxication), and he told that he tried to conceal it out of shame from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). I, however, inquired from the Messenger of Allah (it we discard those utensils which you have forbidden us to use), then what type of vessels should be used for drink? He (the Holy Prophet) replied: In the waterskin the mouths of which are tied (with a string). They (again) said: Prophet of Allah, our land abounds in rats and water-skins cannot remain preserved. The holy Prophet of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: (Drink in water-skins) even if these arenibbled by rats. And then (addressing) al-Ashajj of &#8216;Abdul-Qais he said: Verily, you possess two such qualities which Allah loves: insight and deliberateness.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated either on the authority of Abu Huraira or that of Abu Sa&#8217;id Khudri. The narrator A&#8217;mash has narrated this hadith with a little bit of doubt (about the name of the very first narrator who was in direct contact with the Holy Prophet. He was either Abu Huraira or Abu Sa&#8217;id Khudri. Both are equally reliable transmitters of the traditions). He (the narrator) said: During the time of Tabuk expedition, the (provisions) ran short and the men (of the army) suffered starvation; they said: Messenger of Allah, would you permit us to slay our camels? We would eat them and use their fat. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Do as you please. He (the narrator) said: Then &#8216;Umar came there and said: Messenger of Allah, if you do that (if you give your consent and the men begin to slay their camels), the riding animals would become short. But (I would suggest you to) summon them along with the provisions left with them Then invoke Allah&#8217;s blessings on them (different items of the provisions) It is hoped Allah shall bless them. The Messenger of Allah replied in the affirmative. (the narrator) said: He called for a leather mat to be used as a table cloth and spread it out. Then he called people along with the remaining portions of their provisions. He (the narrator) said: Someone was coming with handful of mote, another was coming with a handful of dates, still another was coming with a portion of bread, till small quantities of these things were collected on the table cloth. He (the narrator said): Then the messenger of Allah invoked blessing (on them) and said: Fill your utensils with these provisions. He (the narrator) said: They filled their vessel to the brim with them, and no one amongst the army (which comprised of 30,000 persons) was left even with a single empty vessel. He (the narrator) aid: They ate to their fill, and there was still a surplus. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) remarked: I bear testimony that there is no god but Allah and I am the messenger of Allah. The man who meets his Lord without harboring any doubt about these two (truths) would never be kept away from Paradise.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported on the authority of Abu Huraira: We were sitting around the Messenger of Allah (may peace and blessings be upon him). Abu Bakr and Umar were also there among the audience. In the meanwhile the Messenger of Allah got up and left us, He delayed in coming back to us, which caused anxiety that he might be attacked by some enemy when we were not with him; so being alarmed we got up. I was the first to be alarmed. I, therefore, went out to look for the Messenger of Allah (may peace and blessings be upon him) and came to a garden belonging to the Banu an-Najjar, a section of the Ansar went round it looking for a gate but failed to find one. Seeing a rabi&#8217; (i. e. streamlet) flowing into the garden from a well outside, drew myself together, like a fox, and slinked into (the place) where God&#8217;s Messenger was. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Is it Abu Huraira? I (Abu Huraira) replied: Yes, Messenger of Allah. He (the Holy Prophet) said: What is the matter with you? replied: You were amongst us but got up and went away and delayed for a time, so fearing that you might be attacked by some enemy when we were not with you, we became alarmed. I was the first to be alarmed. So when I came to this garden, I drew myself together as a fox does, and these people are following me. He addressed me as Abu Huraira and gave me his sandals and said: Take away these sandals of mine, and when you meet anyone outside this garden who testifies that there is no god but Allah, being assured of it in his heart, gladden him by announcing that he shall go to Paradise. Now the first one I met was Umar. He asked: What are these sandals, Abu Huraira? I replied: These are the sandals of the Messenger of Allah with which he has sent me to gladden anyone I meet who testifies that there is no god but Allah, being assured of it in his heart, with the announcement that he would go to Paradise. Thereupon &#8216;Umar struck me on the breast and I fell on my back. He then said: Go back, Abu Huraira, So I returned to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), and was about to break into tears. &#8216;Umar followed me closely and there he was behind me. The Messenger of Allah (may peace and blessings be on him) said: What is the matter with you, Abu Huraira? I said: I happened to meet &#8216;Umar and conveyed to him the message with which you sent me. He struck me on my breast which made me fall down upon my back and ordered me to go back. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: What prompted you to do this, &#8216;Umar? He said: Messenger of Allah, my mother and father be sacrificed to thee, did you send Abu Huraira with your sandals to gladden anyone he met and who testified that there is no god but Allah, and being assured of it in his heart, with the tidings that he would go to Paradise? He said: Yes. Umar said: Please do it not, for I am afraid that people will trust in it alone; let them go on doing (good) deeds.

Did the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) not give you tidings of this? He (the narrator) said: He turned his face (towards the audience) and said: The best thing which we can count upon is the testimony that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah. Verily I have passed through three phases. (The first one) in which I found myself averse to none else more than I was averse to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and there was no other desire stronger in me than the one that I should overpower him and kill him. Had I died in this state, I would have been definitely one of the denizens of Fire. When Allah instilled the love of Islam in my heart, I came to the Apostle (may peace be upon him) and said: Stretch out your right hand so that may pledge my allegiance to you. He stretched out his right hand, I withdrew my hand, He (the Holy Prophet) said: What has happened to you, O &#8216;Amr? replied: I intend to lay down some condition. He asked: What condition do you intend to put forward? I said: should be granted pardon. He (the Holy Prophet) observed: Are you not aware of the fact that Islam wipes out all the previous (misdeeds)? Verily migration wipes out all the previous (misdeeds), and verily the pilgrimage wipes out all the (previous) misdeeds. And then no one as or dear to me than the Messenger of Allah and none was more sublime in my eyes than he, Never could I, pluck courage to catch a full glimpse of his face due to its splendour. So if I am asked to describe his features, I cannot do that for I have not eyed him fully. Had I died in this state had every reason to hope that I would have bee among the dwellers of Paradise. Then we were responsible for certain things (in the light of which) I am unable to know what is in store for me. When I die, let neither female mourner nor fire accompany me. When you bury me, fill my grave well with earth, then stand around it for the time within which a camel is slaughtered and its meat is distributed so that I may enjoy your intimacy and (in your company) ascertain what answer I can give to the messengers (angels) of Allah.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Huraira reported that Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), said: When it occurs to my bondsman that he should do a good deed but he actually does not do it, record one good to him, but if he puts it into practice, I make an entry of ten good acts in his favour. When it occurs to him to do evil, but he does not commit it, I forgive that. But if he commits it, I record one evil against his name. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) observed. The angels said: That bondsman of Yours intends to commit evil. though His Lord is more Vigilant than he. Upon this He (the Lord) said: Watch him; if he commits (evil), write it against his name but if he refrains from doing it, write one good deed or him, for he desisted from doing it for My sake. The Messenger of Allah said: He who amongst you is good of faith, all his good acts are multiplied from ten to seven hundred times (and are recorded in his name) and all the evils that he commits are recorded as such (i, e. without increase) till he meets Allah.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Hudhaifa reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) narrated to us two ahadith. I have seen one (crystallized into reality), and I am waiting for the other. He told us: Trustworthiness descended in the innermost (root) of the hearts of people. Then the Qur&#8217;an was revealed and they learnt from the Qur&#8217;an and they learnt from the Sunnah. Then he (the Holy Prophet) told us about the removal of trustworthiness. He said: The man would have a wink of sleep and trustworthiness would be taken away from his heart leaving the impression of a faint mark. He would again sleep and trustworthiness would be taken away from his heart leaving an impression of a blister, as if you rolled down an ember on your foot and it was vesicled. He would see a swelling having nothing in it. He (the Holy Prophet) then took up a pebble and rolled it down over his foot and (said): The people would enter into transactions amongst one another and hardly a person would be left who would return (things) entrusted to him. (And there would be so much paucity of honest persons) till it would be said: There in such a such tribe is a trustworthy man. And they would also say about a person: How prudent he is, how broad-minded he is and how intelligent he is, whereas in his heart there would not be faith even to the weight of a mustard seed. I have passed through a time in which I did not care with whom amongst you I entered into a transaction, for if he were a Muslim his faith would compel him to discharge his obligations to me and it he were a Christian or a Jew, the ruler would compel him to discharge his obligations to me. But today I would not enter into a transaction with you except so and so.</p>

But who amongst you has heard from the Apostle (may peace be upon him) describing that turmoil which would come like the wave of the ocean. Hudhaifa said: The people hushed into silence, I replied: It is I. He (&#8216;Umar) said: Ye, well, your father was also very pious. Hudhaifa said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (may peace be, upon him ) observing: Temptations will be presented to men&#8217;s hearts as reed mat is woven stick by stick and any heart which is impregnated by them will have a black mark put into it, but any heart which rejects them will have a white mark put in it. The result is that there will become two types of hearts: one white like a white stone which will not be harmed by any turmoil or temptation, so long as the heavens and the earth endure; and the other black and dust-coloured like a vessel which is upset, not recognizing what is good or rejecting what is abominable, but being impregnated with passion. Hudhaifa said: I narrated to him (&#8216;Umar): There is between you and that (turmoil) a closed door, but there is every likelihood of its being broken. &#8216;Umar said: Would it be broken? You have, been rendered fatherless. Had it been opened, it would have been perhaps closed also. I said: No, it would be broken, and I narrated to him: Verily that door implies a person who would be killed or die. There is no mistake in this hadith. Abu Khalid narrated: I said to Sa&#8217;d, O Abu Malik, what do you mean by the term&#8221; Aswad Murbadda&#8221;? He replied: High degree of whiteness in blackness.

Spite, mutual hatred and jealousy against one another will certainly disappear and when he summons people to accept wealth, not even one would do so.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A&#8217;isha, the wife of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him), reported: The first (form) with which was started the revelation to the Messenger of Allah was the true vision in sleep. And he did not see any vision but it came like the bright gleam of dawn. Thenceforth solitude became dear to him and he used to seclude himself in the cave of Hira&#8217;, where he would engage in tahannuth (and that is a worship for a number of nights) before returning to his family and getting provisions again for this purpose. He would then return to Khadija and take provisions for a like period, till Truth came upon him while he was in the cave of Hira&#8217;. There came to him the angel and said: Recite, to which he replied: I am not lettered. He took hold of me [the Apostle said] and pressed me, till I was hard pressed; thereafter he let me off and said: Recite. I said: I am not lettered. He then again took hold of me and pressed me for the second time till I was hard pressed and then let me off and said: Recite, to which I replied: I am not lettered. He took hold of me and pressed me for the third time, till I was hard pressed and then let me go and said: Recite in the name of your Lord Who created, created man from a clot of blood. Recite. And your most bountiful Lord is He Who taught the use of pen, taught man what he knew not (al-Qur&#8217;an, xcvi. 1-4). Then the Prophet returned therewith, his heart was trembling, and he went to Khadija and said: Wrap me up, wrap me up! So they wrapped him till the fear had left him. He then said to Khadija: O Khadija! what has happened to me? and he informed her of the happening, saying: I fear for myself. She replied: It can&#8217;t be. Be happy. I swear by Allah that He shall never humiliate you. By Allah, you join ties of relationship, you speak the truth, you bear people&#8217;s burden, you help the destitute, you entertain guests, and you help against the vicissitudes which affect people. Khadija then took him to Waraqa b. Naufal b. Asad b. &#8216;Abd al-&#8216;Uzza, and he was the son of Khadija&#8217;s uncle, i. e., the brother of her father. And he was the man who had embraced Christianity in the Days of Ignorance (i. e. before Islam) and he used to write books in Arabic and, therefore, wrote Injil in Arabic as God willed that he should write. He was very old and had become blind Khadija said to him: O uncle! listen to the son of your brother. Waraqa b. Naufal said: O my nephew! what did you see? The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), then, informed him what he had seen, and Waraqa said to him: It is namus that God sent down to Musa. Would that I were then (during your prophetic career) a young man. Would that I might be alive when your people would expel you! The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Will they drive me out? Waraqa said: Yes. Never came a man with a like of what you have brought but met hostilities. If I see your day I shall help you wholeheartedly.</p>

Then I went down to Moses (peace be upon him) and he said: What has your Lord enjoined upon your Ummah? I said: Fifty prayers. He said: Return to thy Lord and beg for reduction (in the number of prayers), for your community shallnot be able to bear this burden. as I have put to test the children of Isra&#8217;il and tried them (and found them too weak to bear such a heavy burden). He (the Holy Prophet) said: I went back to my Lord and said: My Lord, make things lighter for my Ummah. (The Lord) reduced five prayers for me. I went down to Moses and said. (The Lord) reduced five (prayers) for me, He said: Verily thy Ummah shall not be able to bear this burden; return to thy Lord and ask Him to make things lighter. I then kept going back and forth between my Lord Blessed and Exalted and Moses, till He said: There are five prayers every day and night. O Muhammad, each being credited as ten, so that makes fifty prayers. He who intends to do a good deed and does not do it will have a good deed recorded for him; and if he does it, it will be recorded for him as ten; whereas he who intends to do an evil deed and does not do, it will not be recorded for him; and if he does it, only one evil deed will be recorded. I then came down and when I came to Moses and informed him, he said: Go back to thy Lord and ask Him to make things lighter. Upon this the Messenger of Allah remarked: I returned to my Lord until I felt ashamed before Him.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas b. Malik reported: Abu Dharr used to relate that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: The roof of my house was cleft when I was in Mecca and Gabriel descended and opened my heart and then washed it with the water of Zamzam. He then brought a gold basin full of wisdom and faith and after emptying it into my breast, he closed it up. Then taking me by he hand, he ascended with me to th heaven, and when we came to the lowest heaven, Gabriel said to the guardian of the lowest heaven: Open. He asked who was there? He replied. It is Gabriel. He again asked whe he there was someone with him. He replied: Yes, it is Muhammad with me. He was asked if he had been sent for, He (Gabriel) said: Yes. Then he opened (the gate). When we ascended the lowest heaven (I saw) a man seated with parties on his right side and parties on his left side. When he looked up to his right, he laughed and when he looked to his left, he wept. He said: Welcome to the righteous apostle and the righteous son. I asked Gabriel who he was and he replied: He is Adam (peace be upon him) and these parties on his right and on his left are the souls of his descendants. Those of them on his right are the inmates of Paradise and the parties which are on his left side are the inmates of Hell; so when he looked towards his right side, he laughed, and when he looked towards his left side, he wept. Then Gabriel ascended with me to the second heaven. He asked its guardian to open (its gate), and its guardian replied in the same way as the guardian of the lowest heaven had said. He (opened it). Anas b. Malik said: He (the Holy Prophet) mentioned that he found in the heavens Adam, Idris, Jesus, Moses and Abraham (may peace be on all of them), but he did not ascertain as to the nature of their abodes except that he had found Adam in the lowest heaven and Abraham in the sixth heaven. When Gabriel and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) passed by Idris (peace be upon him) he said: Welcome to the righteous apostle and righteous brother. He (the narrator) said: He then proceeded and said: Who is he? Gabriel replied: It is Idris. Then I passed by Moses (peace be upon him) and he said: Welcome tothe righteous apostle and righteous brother. I said to (Gabriel): Who is he? He replied: It is Moses. Then I passed by Jesus and he said: Welcome to the righteous apostle and righteous brother. I said (to Gabriel): Who is he? He replied: Jesus, son of Mary. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Then I went to Ibrahim (peace be upon him). He said: Welcome to the righteous apostle and righteous son. I asked: Who is he? He (Gabriel) replied: It is Abraham. Ibn Shihab said: Ibn Hazm told me that Ibn &#8216;Abbas and Abd Habba al-Ansari used to say that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Thereafter he ascended with me till I was taken to such a height where I heard the scraping of the pens. Ibn Hazm and Anas told that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Allah then made fifty prayers obligatory for my Ummah and I returned with that and passed by Moses. Moses, (peace be upon him) said: What has thy Lord enjoined on thy people? I said: Fifty prayers have been made obligatory on them. Moses (peace be upon him) said: Return to thy Lord, for thy Ummah would not be able to bear this burden. Then I came back to my Lord and He remitted a portion out of thut. I then again went to Moses (peace be upon him) and informed him about it He said: Return to thy Lord, for thy Ummah shall not be able to bear this burden. I then went back to my Lord and He said: They are five and at the same time fifty, and what has been said will not be changed. I then returned to Moses and he said: Go back to thy Lord. whereupon I said: I feel ashamed of my Lord. Gabriel then travelled with me till we came to the farthest lote-tree Many a colour had covered it which I do not know. Then I was admitted to Paradise and saw in it domes of pearls, and its soil of musk.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas b. Malik reported on the authority of Malik b. Sa sa&#8217;, perhaps a person of his tribe, that the Prophet of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: I was near the House (i. e. Ka&#8217;bah) in a state between sleep and wakefulness when I heard someone say: He is the third among the two persons. Then he came to me and took me with him. Then a golden basin containing the water of Zamzam was brought to me and my heart was opened up to such and such (part). Qatada said: I asked him who was with me (i e. the narrator) and what he meant by such and such (part). He replied: (It means that it was opened) up to the lower part of his abdomen (Then the hadith continues): My heart was extracted and it was washed with the water of Zamzam and then it was restored in its original position, after which it was filled with faith and wisdom. I was then brought a white beast which is called al-Buraq, bigger than a donkey and smaller than a mule. Its stride was as long as the eye could reach. I was mounted on it, and then we went forth till we reached the lowest heaven. Gabriel asked for the (gate) to be opened, and it was said: Who is he? He replied: Gabriel. It was again said: Who is with thee? He replied: Muhammad (may peace be upon him). It was said: Has he been sent for? He (Gabriel) said: Yes. He (the Prophet) said: Then (the gate) was opened for us (and it was said): Welcome unto him! His is a blessed arrival. Then we came to Adam (peace be upon him). And he (the narrator) narrated the whole account of the hadith. (The Holy Prophet) observed that he met Jesus in the second heaven, Yahya (peace be on both of them) in the third heaven, Yusuf in the third, Idris in the fourth, Harun in the fifth (peace and blessings of Allah be upon them). Then we travelled on till we reached the sixth heaven and came to Moses (peace be upon him) and I greeted him and he said: Welcome unto righteous brother and righteous prophet. And when I passed (by him) he wept, and a voice was heard saying: What makes thee weep? He said: My Lord, he is a young man whom Thou hast sent after me (as a prophet) and his followers will enter Paradise in greater numbers than my followers. Then we travelled on till we reached the seventh heaven and I came to Ibrahim. He (the narrator) narrat- ed in this hadith that the Prophet of Allah (may peace be upon him) told that he saw four rivers which flowed from (the root of the lote-tree of the farthest limits): two manifest rivers and two hidden rivers. I said: &#8216; Gabriel! what are these rivers? He replied: The two hidden rivers are the rivers of Paradise, and as regards the two manifest ones, they are the Nile and the Euphrates. Then the Bait-ul-Ma&#8217;mur was raised up to me. I said: O Gabriel! what is this? He replied: It is the Bait-ul-Ma&#8217;mur. Seventy thousand angels enter into it daily and, after they come out, they never return again. Two vessels were then brought to me. The first one contained wine and the second one contained milk, and both of them were placed before me. I chose milk. It was said: You did right. Allah will guide rightly through you your Ummah on the natural course. Then fifty prayers daily were made obligatory for me. And then he narrated the rest of the hadith to the end.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: I found myself in Hijr and the Quraish were asking me about my might journey. I was asked about things pertaining to Bait-ul-Maqdis which I could not preserve (in my mind). I was very much vexed, so vexed as I had never been before. Then Allah raised it (Bait-ul-Maqdis) before my eyes. I looked towards it, and I gave them the information about whatever they questioned me I also saw myself among the group of apostles. I saw Moses saying prayer and found him to be a well-built man as if he was a man of the tribe of Shanu&#8217;a. I saw Jesus son of Mary (peace be upon him) offering prayer, of all of men he had the closest resemblance with &#8216;Urwa b. Masu&#8217;d al-Thaqafi. I saw Ibrahim (peace be upon him) offering prayer; he had the closest resemblance with your companion (the Prophet himself) amongst people. When the time of prayer came I led them. When I completed the prayer, someone said: Here is Malik, the keeper of the Hell; pay him salutations. I turned to him, but he preceded me in salutation.</p>

The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Do you feel any trouble in seeing the moon on the night when it is full? They said: Messenger of Allah, no. He (the Messenger) further said: Do you feel any trouble in seeing the sun, when there is no cloud over it? They said: Messenger of Allah. no. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Verily you would see Him like this (as you see the sun and the moon). God will gather people on the Day of Resurrection and say: Let every people follow what they worshipped. Those who worshipped the sun would follow the sun, and those who worshipped the moon would follow the moon, and those who worshipped the devils would follow the devils. This Ummah (of Islam) alone would be left behind and there would be hypocrites too amongst it. Allah would then come to them in a form other than His own Form, recognisable to them, and would say: I am your Lord. They would say: We take refuge with Allah from thee. We will stay here till our Lord comes to us. and when our Lord would come we would recognise Him. Subsequently Allah would come to them in His own Form, recognisable to them, and say: I am your Lord. They would say: Thou art our Lord. And they would follow Him, and a bridge would be set over the Hell; and I (the Holy Prophet) and my Ummah would be the first to pass over it; and none but the messengers would speak on that day, and the prayer of the messengers on that day would be: O Allah! grant safety, grant safety. In Hell, there would be long spits like the thorns of Sa&#8217;dan He (the Holy Prophet) said: Have you seen Sa&#8217;dan? They replied: Yes, Messenger of Allah. He said: Verily those (hooks) would be like the thorns of Sa&#8217;dan, but no one knows their size except Allah. These would seize people for their misdeeds. Some of them would escape for their (good) deeds, and some would be rewarded for their deeds till they get salvation. When Allah would finish judging His bondsmen and because of His mercy decide to take out of Hell such people as He pleases. He would command the angels to bring out those who had not associated anything with Allah; to whom Allah decided to show mercy. those who would say: There is no god but Allah. They (the angels) would recognise them in the Fire by the marks of prostration, for Hell-fire will devour everything (limb) of the sons of Adam except the marks of prostration. Allah has forbidden the fire to consume the marks of prostration. They will be taken out of the Fire having been burnt, and the water of life would be poured over them, and they will sprout as seed does In the silt carried by flood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah would finish judging amongst His bondsmen; but a man who will be the last to enter Paradise will remain facing Hell and will say: O my Lord I turn my face away from Hell, for its air has poisoned me ard its blaze has burnt me. He will then call to Allah as long as Allah would wish that he should call to Him. Then Allah, Blessed and Exalted, would say: If I did that, perhaps you would ask for more than that. He would say: I would not ask You more than this, and he would give his Lord covenants and agreements as Allah wished, and so He would turn his face away from the Fire When he turns towards the Paradise and sees it, he will remain silent as long as Allah wishes him to remain so. He will then say: O my Lord I bring me forward to the gate of the Paradise. Allah would say to him: Did you not give covenants and agreements that you would not ask for anything besides what I had given you. Woe to thee! O son of Adam, how treacherous you are! He would say: O my Lord! and would continue calling to Allah till He would say to him: If I grant you that, perhaps you will ask for more. He will reply: No, by Thy greatness, and he will give His Lord promises and covenants as Allah had wished. He would then bring him to the gate of the Paradise, and when he would stand at the gate of the Paradise, it would lay open before him. and he would see the bounty and the joy that there is in it. He would remain quiet as long as Allah would desire him to remain silent. He would then say: O my Lord, admit me to Paradise. Allah. Blessed and Exalted, would say: Did you not give covenants and agreements that you would not ask for anything more than what I had granted you? Woe to you! son of Adam, how treacherous you are! And he would say: O my Lord, I do not wish to be the most miserable of Thy creatures. He would continue calling upon Allah till Allah, Blessed and Exalted, would laugh. When Allah would laugh at him, He would say: Enter the Paradise. When he would enter, Allah would say: State your wish. He would express his wishes till Allah would remind him (the desire of) such and such (things). When his desires would be exhausted Allah would say: That is for thee and, besides it, the like of it also. &#8216;Ata&#8217; b.

And he would express his desire and again and again express a desire. tHe would be asked: Have you expressed your desire? He would say: Yes. Then He (Allah) would say: For thee is (granted) what thou desirest, and the like of it along with it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sa&#8217;id al-Khudri reported: Some people during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Messenger of Allah! shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection? The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Yes, and added: Do you feel any trouble in seeing the sun at noon with no cloud over it, and do you feel trouble in seeing the moon (open) in the full moonlit night with no cloud over it? They said: No, Messenger of Allah! He (the Holy Prophet) said: You will not feel any trouble in seeing Allah on the Day of Resurrection any more than you do in seeing any one of them. When the Day of Resurrection comes a Mu&#8217;adhdhin (a proclaimer) would proclaim: Let every people follow what they used to worship. Then all who worshipped idols and stones besides Allah would fall into the Fire, till only the righteous and the vicious and some of the people of the Book who worshipped Allah are left. Then the Jews would be summoned, and it would be said to them: What did you worship? They will say: We worshipped &#8216;Uzair, son of Allah. It would be said to them: You tell a lie; Allah had never had a spouse or a son. What do you want now? They would say: We feel thirsty, O our Lord! Quench our thirst. They would be directed (to a certain direction) and asked: Why don&#8217;t you go there to drink water? Then they would be pushed towards the Fire (and they would find to their great dismay that) it was but a mirage (and the raging flames of fire) would be consuming one another, and they would fall into the Fire. Then the Christians would be summoned and it would be said to them: What did you worship? They would say: We worshipped Jesus, son of Allah. It would be said to them: You tell a lie; Allah did not take for Himself either a spouse or a son. Then it would be said to them: What do you want? They would say: Thirsty we are, O our Lord! Quench our thirst. They would be directed (to a certain direction) and asked: Why don&#8217;t you go there to get water? But they would be pushed and gathered together towards the Hell, which was like a mirage to them, and the flames would consume one another. They would fall Into the Fire, till no one is left except he who worshipped Allah, be he pious or sinful. The Lord of the Universe, Glorified and Exalted, would come to them in a form recognisable to them and say; What are you looking for? Every people follow that which they worshipped. They would say: Our Lord, we kept ourselves separate from the people in the world, though we felt great need of them; we, however, did not associate ourselves with them. He would say: I am your Lord. They would say: We take refuge with Allah from thee and do not associate anything with Allah. They would repeat it twice or thrice, till some of them would be about to return. It would be said: Is there any sign between you and Him by which you will recognise Him? They would say: Yes. and the things would be laid bare. Those who used to prostrate themselves before God of their own accord would be permitted by God to prostrate themselves. But there would remain none who used to prostrate out of fear (of people) and ostentation but Allah would make his back as one piece, and whenever he would attempt to prostrate he would fall on his back. Then they would raise their heads and He would assume the Form in which they had seen Him the first time and would say: I am your Lord. They would say: Thou art our Lord. Then the bridge would be set up over the Hell and intercession would be allowed and they will say: O God, keep safe, keep safe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was asked: Messenger of Allah, what is this bridge? He said: The void in which one Is likely to slip. There would be hooks, tongs, spits like the thorn that is found in Najd and is known as Sa&#8217;dan. The believers would then pass over within the twinkling of an eye, like lightning, like wind, like a bird, like the finest horses and camels. Some will escape and be safe, some will be lacerated and let go, and some will be pushed into the fire of Hell till the believers will find rescue from the Fire. By One in Whose hand is my life, there will be none among you more eager to claim a right than the believers on the Day of Resurrection for (saying their) brethren in the Fire who would say: O our Lord, they were fasting along with us, and praying and performing pilgrimage. It will be said to them: Take out those whom you recognise. Then their persons would be forbidden to the Fire; and they would take out a large number of people who had been overtaken by Fire up to the middle of the shank or up to the knees. They would then say: O our Lord I not one of those about whom Thou didst give us command remains in it. He will then say: Go back and bring out those in whose hearts you find good of the weight of a dinar Then they will take out a large number of people. Then they would say: O our Lord! we have not left anyone about whom You commanded us. He will then say: Go back and bring out those in whose hearts you find as much as half a dinar of good. Then they will take out a large number of people, and would say: O our Lord! not one of those about whom Thou commanded us we have left in it. Then He would say: Go back and in whose heart you find good to the weight of a particle bring him out. They would bring out a large number of people, and would then say: O our Lord, now we have not left anyone in it (Hell) having any good in him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sa&#8217;id Khudri said: If you don&#8217;t testify me in this hadith, then recite if you like:&#8221; Surely Allah wrongs not the weight of an atom; and if it is a good deed. He multiplies it and gives from Himself a great reward&#8221; (al-Qur&#8217;an, iv. 40). Then Allah, Exalted and Great, would say: The angels have interceded, the apostles have interceded and the believers have interceded, and no one remains (to grant pardon) but the Most Merciful of the mercifuls. He will then take a handful from Fire and bring out from it people who never did any good and who had been turned into charcoal, and will cast them into a river called the river of life, on the outskirts of Paradise. They will come out as a seed comes cut from the silt carried by flood. You see it near the stone or near the tree. That which is exposed to the sun is yellowish or greenish and which is under the shade is white. They said: Messenger of Allah! it seems as if you had been tending a flock in the jungle. He (the Holy Prophet) said: They will come forth like pearls with seals on their necks. The inhabitants of Paradise would recognise them (and say): Those are who have been set free by the Compassionate One. Who has admitted them into Paradise without any (good) deed that they did or any good that they sent in advance Then He would say: Enter the Paradise; whatever you see in it is yours. They would say: O Lord, Thou hast bestowed upon us (favours) which Thou didst not bestow upon anyone else in the world. He would say: There is with Me (a favour) for you better than this. They would say: O our Lord! which thing is better than this? He would say: It is My pleasure. I will never be angry with you after this</p>

He (the narrator) said: Then the people would be summoned along with their idols whom they worshipped, one after another. Then our Lord would come to us and say: Whom are you waiting for? They would say: We are waiting for our Lord. He would say: I am your Lord. They would say: (We are not sure) till we gaze at Thee, and He would manifest Himself to them smilingly, and would go along with them and they would follow Him; and every person, whether a hypocrite or a believer, would be endowed with a light, and there would be spikes and hooks on the bridge of the Hell, which would catch hold of those whom Allah willed. Then the light of the hypocrites would be extinguished, and the believers would secure salvation. and the first group to achieve it would comprise seventy thousand men who would have the brightness of full moon on their faces, and they would not be called to account. Then the people immediately following them would have their faces as the brightest stars in the heaven. This is how (the groups would follow one after another). Then the stage of intercession would come, and they (who are permitted to intercede) would intercede, till he who had declared:&#8221; There is no god but Allah&#8221; and had in his heart virtue of the weight of a barley grain would come out of the Fire. They would be then brought in the courtyard of Paradise and the inhabitants of Paradise would begin to sprinkle water over them till they would sprout like the sprouting of a thing in flood water, and their burns would disappear. They would ask their Lord till they would be granted (the bounties) of the world and with it ten more besides it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Yazid al-Faqir said: This view of the Khwarij (i. e. those who commit major sins and would be eternally doomed to Hell) had obsessed me, and we set out in a large group intending to perform the hajj and then going to the people (for the propagation of the views of the Khwarij). He (the narrator) said: We happened to past by Medina and found there Jabir b. &#8216;Abdullah sitting near a column narrating to the people (the ahadith of) the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him). When he mentioned the inhabitants of Hell, I said: O companion of the Messenger of Allah what is this that thou narrateth, whereas Allah sayeth:&#8221; Verily whomsoever Thou shall commit to the Fire, Thou indeed humillateth him&#8221; (al-Qur&#8217;an, iii. 192) ; and All those who endeavoured to get out of that would be thrown back into it&#8221; (al-Qur&#8217;an, xxxi i. 20)? So what is it that you say? He said: Have you read the Qur&#8217;an? I said: Yes. He said: Have you heard about&#8217; the (exalted) position of Muhammad (may peace be upon him), i. e. to which Allah would raise, him? I said: Yes. He said: Verily the position of Muhammad (may peace be upon him) is that of great glory and that is by which Allah would bring out whornsoever He would wish to bring out. He then described the Path (the Bridge) and the passing of the people over it, and said: I am afraid I may not have remembered (other things) but this much is still in my memory that people would come out of the Hell after having gone into it, and he said: They would come out of it as if they were the wood of the ebony tree. He (the narrator said: They would enter a river, one or the rivers of Paradise, and would bathe in it, and then come out as if they were (white like) paper. We then turned back and said: Woe be upon you! How can this old man tell a lie against the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)? We turned back (from the views of the Khwarij), and by God every one of us abandoned this (band of Khwarij) except one man. A similar statement has been made by Abu Nu&#8217;aim.</p>

They would get a Divine inspiration about it, and would say: If we could seek intercession with our Lord, we may be relieved from this predicament of ours. He (the Holy Prophet) said: They would come to Adam andsay, Thou art Adam, the father of mankind. Allah created thee with His own hand and breathed unto thee of His Spirit and commanded the angels and they prostrated before thee. So intercede for us with thy Lords, that He may relieve us from this position of ours. He would say: I am not in a position to do this, and would recall his error, and would fight shy of his Lord on account of that; go to Noah the first messenger (after me) sent by Allah. He (the Holy Prophet) said: So they would come to Noah (peace be upon him). He would say: I am not in a position to do that for you, and recall his fault which he had committed, and would fight shy of his Lord on account of that, (and would say): You better go to Ibrahim (peace be upon him) whom Allah took for a friend. They would come to Ibrahim (peace be upon him) and he would say: I am not in a position to do that for you, and would recall his fault that he had committed and would, therefore, fight shy of his Lord on that account (and would say): You better go to Moses (peace be upon him) with whom Allah conversed and con- ferred Torah upon him.

He (the narrator) said: The Messenger or Allah (may peace be upon him) observed: So they would come to me and I would ask the permission of my Lord and it would be granted to me, and when I would see Him, I would fall down in prostration, and He (Allah) would leave me thus as long as He would wish, and then it would be said: O Muhammad, raise your head, say and you would be heard; ask and it would be granted; intercede and intercession would be accepted. Then I would raise my head and extrol my Lord with the praise which my Lord would teach me. I shall then inter- cede, but a limit would be set for me I would bring them out from the Fire and make them enter Paradise (according to the limit). I shall return then ard fall down in pros- tration and Allah would leave me (in that position) as long as He would wish to leave me it would be said: Rise, O Muhammad, say and you would be heard; ask and it would be conferred; intercede and intercession would be granted. I would raise my head and extrol my Lord with praise that He would teach me. I would theft intercede and a limit would be set for me. I would bring them out of the Fire (of Hell) and make them enter Paradise. He (the narrator) said: I do not remember whether he (the Holy Prophet) said at tLe third time or at the fourth time: O my Lord, none has been left in the Fire, but thise restrained by the Holy Qur&#8217;an, i e. those who were eternally doomed. Ibn Ubaid said in a narration: Qatada observed: whose everlasting stay was imperative&#8221;.</p>

He said: Muhammad (may peace be upon him) narrated to us: When it would be the Day of Resurrection, some of the people would rush to one another in bewilderment.

<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the hadith which Anas narrated to us. We went out of his (house) and when we reached the upper part of Jabban (graveyard) we said: Would that we meet Hasan and salute him and he was hiding in the house of Abu Khalifa. He (Ma&#8217;bad b. Hilal, the narrator) said: We went to him and greeted him and we said: O Abu Sa&#8217;id, we come from your brother Abu Hamza (kunya of Anas), and we have never heard a hadith like this relating to intercession, which he has narrated to us. He said: Narrate it, we narrated the hadith. He said: Narrate it (still further). We said: He did not (narrate it) before us more than this. He said: He (Anas) had narrated it to us twenty years back, when he was strong and healthy. He has in fact missed something. I cannot make out whether the old man has forgotten or he has (intentionally) avoided to narrate it to you lest you should rely (absolutely) upon it (and abandon doing good deeds). We said to him: Relate that to us, and he laughed and said: There is haste in the nature of man. I did not make mention of it to you but for the fact that I wanted to narrate that to you (and added that the Holy Prophet said): I would then return to my Lord for the fourth time and extol Him with these praises. I would then fall in prostration. It would be said to me: O Muhammad, raise your head: say and it will be listened to; ask and it will be granted; intercede and intercession would be accepted. I would say: O my Lord, permit me regarding him who professed: There is no god but Allah. He (the Lord) would say: That is not for thee or that is not what lies with thee, but by My Honour, Glory, Greatness and Might, I would certainly take him out who professed it: There is no god but Allah. He (the narrator, Ma&#8217;bad) said: I hear testimony to the fact that the hadith transmitted to us-by Hasan was heard by him from Anas b.

He sliced with his teeth a piece out of it and said: I shall be the leader of mankind on the Day of Resurrection. Do you know why? Allah would gather in one plain the earlier and the later (of the human race) on the Day of Resurrection. Then the voice of the proclaimer would be heard by all of them and the eyesight would penetrate through all of them and the sun would come near. People would then experience a degree of anguish, anxiety and agony which they shall not be able to bear and they shall not be able to stand. Some people would say to the others: Don you see in which trouble you are? Don&#8217;t you see what (misfortune) has overtaken you? Why don&#8217;t you find one who should intercede for you with your Lord? Some would say to the others: Go to Adam. And they would go to Adam and say: O Adam, thou art the father of mankind.

Don&#8217;t you see what (misfortune) has overtaken us? Adam would say: Verily, my Lord is angry, to an extent to which He had never been angry before nor would He be angry afterward. Verily, He forbade me (to go near) that tree and I disobeyed Him. I am concerned with my own self. Go to someone else; go to Noah. They would come to Noah and would say: O Noah, thou art the first of the Messengers (sent) on the earth (after Adam), and Allah named thee as a&#8221; Grateful Servant,&#8221; intercede for us with thy Lord. Don&#8217;t you see in what (trouble) we are? Don&#8217;t you see what (misfortune) has overtaken us? He would say: Verily, my Lord is angry today as He had never been angry before, and would never be angry afterwards. There had emanated a curse from me with which I cursed my people. I am concerned with only myself, I am concerned only with myself; you better go to Ibrahim (peace be upon him). They would go to Ibrahim and say: Thou art the apostle of Allah and His Friend amongst the inhabitants of the earth; intercede for us with thy Lord. Don&#8217;t you see in which (trouble) we are? Don&#8217;t you see what (misfortune) has overtaken us?

You better go to someone else: go to Moses. They would come to Moses (peace be upon him) and say: O Moses, thou art Allah&#8217;s messenger, Allah blessed thee with His messengership and His conversation amongst people. Intercede for us with thy Lord. Don&#8217;t you see in what (trouble) we are? Don&#8217;t you see what (misfortune) has overtaken us? Moses (peace be upon him) would say to them: Verily. my Lord is angry as He had never been angry before and would never be angry afterwards. I, in fact, killed a person whom I had not been ordered to kill. I am concerned with myself, I am concerned with myself. You better go to Jesus (peace be upon him). They would come to Jesus and would say: O Jesus, thou art the messenger of Allah and thou conversed with people in the cradle, (thou art) His Word which I-Ie sent down upon Mary. and (thou art) the Spirit from Him; so intercede for us with thy Lord. Don&#8217;t you see (the trouble) in which we are? Don&#8217;t you see (the misfortune) that has overtaken us? Jesus (peace be upon him) would say: Verily, my Lord is angry today as He had never been angry before or would ever be angry afterwards. He mentioned no sin of his. (He simply said: ) I am concerned with myself, I am concerned with myself; you go to someone else: better go to Muhammad (may peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They would come to me and say: O Mahammad, thou art the messenger of Allah and the last of the apostles. Allah has pardoned thee all thy previous and later sins. Intercede for us with thy Lord; don&#8217;t you see in which (trouble) we are? Don&#8217;t you see what (misfortune) has overtaken us? I shall then set off and come below the Throne and fall down prostrate before my Lord; then Allah would reveal to me and inspire me with some of His Praises and Glorifications which He had not revealed to anyone before me. He would then say: Muhammad, raise thy head; ask and it would be granted; intercede and intercession would be accepted I would then raise my head and say: O my Lord, my people, my people. It would be said: O Muhammad, bring in by the right gate of Paradise those of your people who would have no account to render. They would share with the people some other door besides this door. The Holy Prophet then said: By Him in Whose Hand is the life of Muhammad, verify the distance between two door leaves of the Paradise is as great as between Mecca and Hajar, or as between Mecca and Busra.</p>

Trust worthiness and kinship would be despatched, and these would stand on the right and left of the Path and the first of you would pass with (the swiftness) of lightning. He (the narrator) said: I said, O thou who art far dearer to me than my father and my mother I which thing is like the passing of lightning? He said: Have you not seen lightning, how it passes and then comes back within the twinkling of an eye? Then (they would pass) like the passing of the wind, then like the passing of a bird, and the hastening of persons would be according to their deeds, and your Apostle would be standing on the Path saying: Save, O my Lord, save. (The people would go on passing) till the deeds of the servants would be failing in strength, till a man would come who would find it hard to go along (that Path) but crawlingly.

He said: Then what did you do? I said: I practised charm. He said: What urged you to do this? I said: (I did this according to the implied suggestion) of the hadith which al-Shu&#8217;ba narrated. He said: What did al-Shu&#8217;ba narrate to you? I said: Buraida b. Husaib al-Aslami narrated to us. The charm is of no avail except in case of the (evil influence) of an eye or the sting of a scorpion. He said: He who acted according to what he had heard (from the Holy Prophet) acted rightly, but Ibn &#8216;Abbas narrated to us from the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) that he said: There were brought before me the peoples and I saw an apostle and a small group (of his followers) along with him, another (apostle) and one or two persons (along with him) and (still another) apostle having no one with him. When a very large group was brought to me I conceived as if it were my Ummah. Then it was said to me: It is Moses and his people. You should look at the horizon, and I saw a very huge group. It was again said to me: See the other side of the horizon, and there was (also) a very huge group. It was said to me: This is your Ummah, and amongst them there were seventy thousand persons who would be made to enter Paradise without rendering any account and without (suffering) any torment. He then stood up and went to his house. Then the people began to talk about the people who would be admitted to Paradise without rendering any account and without (suffering) any torment. Some of them said: They may be those who (have had the good fortune of living) in the company of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and some of them said: They be those who were born in Islam and did not associate anything with Allah. Some people mentioned other things. Thereupon came forth the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) before them and he said: What was that which you were talking about? They informed him. He said: They are those persons who neither practise charm, nor ask others to practise it, nor do they take omens, and repose their trust in their Lord. Upon this &#8216;Ukkasha b. Mihsan stood up and said: Supplicate for me that He should make me one among them. Upon this he (Messenger of Allah) said: Thou are one among them.

<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>EPILOGUE </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Before we close the&#8221; Kitab-ul-Iman,&#8221; it seems necessary to bring a few facts before our readers. This book deals with the beliefs, i. e. those unseen realities which we have a strong yearning to comprehend, but which elude the grasp of our senses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every person, who is endowed with consciousness, is instinctively impelled to know whence he came and where he would return. What would become of him after crossing the bar of life? Is the short span of this wordly life the culmination of all his hopes and desires and nothing remains after it? These are the questions which agitate the mind of every man, whether he is a believer or a non-believer, whether he is a monotheist or a polytheist or an atheist. We cannot silence the echoes of our souls by simply saying that nothing can be said with certainty about them. The mind yearns for definite and satisfactory answers to all of them. That is what is embedded in our very nature and so long as we are human beings we cannot afford to ignore them. We approach scientists for the solution of these spiritual problems of ours which have a direct bearing on our social life, but scientists have no definite answers to give since they are concerned only with observable facts, that is to say, the optically present source of sensation, which forms only a fraction of man&#8217;s life and the vast sea of&#8221; unseen world&#8221; lies hidden before them. That is the reason why even a scientist has to fall back upon chance-a very imortant admission as to the limits of the so-called scientific knowledge and the possibility of another knowledge unknown to science and altogether different from that with the help of which we observe physical phenomena and their laws.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, the scientific method cannot help us solve the problem of&#8221; whence&#8221; and&#8221; whither&#8221;. There is always an urge in our hearts to peep across this life hemmed in by space and time and find out our ultimate destiny. Since science deals with&#8221; actual,&#8221; with what is here and now, particularly what can be comprehended with the helpof senses, there is inherent in science a natural tendency to assure that man, too, like inanimate matter, is a bubble that bursts and a vision that fades. If we take this view of man, which is the inevitable conclusion of the so-called&#8221; scientific inquiry,&#8221; the whole of human life in which man plays such a prominent role becomes a meaningless riddle, for he is denied the existence of spiritual yearning in him which is nothing but a sort of cruel joke with man.&#8221; Life,&#8221; says Dr Muhammad Iqbal (Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam, pp 50-1),&#8221; with its intense feeling of spontaneity constitutes a centre of indetermination, and thus falls outside, the domain of necessity&#8230; The biologist who seeks a mechanical explanation of life is led to do so because he confines his study to the lower forms of life whose behaviour discloses resemblances to mechanical action. If he studies life as manifested in himself, i. e., his own mind freely choosing, rejecting, reflecting, surveying the past and the present, and dynarnically imagining the future. he is sure to be convinced of the inadequacy of his mechancal concepts.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The observable facts or, in other words, the physical entities form only a part of the Reality. On how to know and comprehend the other parts which concern us more intimately than the physical entities. science has nothing definite to say except a meaningful silence which betrays its natural limitation in solving these vital problems of life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Psychology, too, is inherently incompetent to comprehend the unseen Realities of the universe. Life, as we all know. is a great mystery everrin its biological aspects; how mysterious it is in its spiritual and moral aspects, we cannot imagine. Psychology has been-able to grope in the darkness of unconscious and, ub-conscious chambers and has not been able to bring into light the secrets of the human soul.&#8221; Psychology,&#8221; says Waiter Leibrecht (Religion and Culture, p. 33),&#8221; can show us what man is not. It cannot tell us what man, each one of us, is. The legitimate aim of psychology is the negative, the removal of distortions and illusions, but not the positive, the full and complete knowledge of human being.&#8221; The fact is that human knowledge and intellect, in spite of their boastful claims, are by nature so much handicapped that they, unaided by revelation, cannot in any way comprehend the unseen Realities. What the intellect at the most can do is to transform the sense-data into conceptual forms, but it has to depend ultimately upon experience and is, therefore, subjected to the same limitations to which the knowledge of pysical sciences is subjected.&#8221; The intellect,&#8221; say Ibn Khaldun, is a correct scale. Its indications are completely certain and in no way wrong. However, the intellect should not be used to weigh such matters as the oneness of God, the Hereafter, the truth of prophecy, the real character of Divine Attributes, or anything else that lies beyond the level of the intellect. That would mean to aspire for the impossible. One might compare it with a man who sees a scale in which gold is being weighed, and wants to weigh mountains in it. This (the fact that it is impossible) does not prove that the indications of the scale are not true (when it is used for its proper purpose). However, there is a limit at which intellect must stop. It cannot go beyond its own level&#8221; (The Muqaddimah, translated by Franz Rosenthal, Vol. III. p. 38). What a man in the cold regions of an arid intellectualism can, at his best, infer is only the existence of a Prime Cause, but to far as His Attributes, His will, His behaviour with humanity and His Creation, and our relation with Him are concerned. Intellect has nothing positive to say. It is at this stage that man instinctively feels the need of an agency which shoure provide him authentic information about unseen rmuties of life. This agencv is known as Prophethoud. The Great Lord, Who has provided man with materiaf resources for the satisfaction of his macerial needs, has also made suitable arrangements to acquaint us fully with the Unseen Realities which our souls yearn to know. This knowledge of the Unseen is vouchsafed to us through His trusted Messengers (prophets). This is an immense savour from our Lord, immeasurably more valuable then the material resources for, without it, human souls would have suffered the pangs of privation and would have ultimately died. The Qur&#8217;an says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is due to Allah. Who guided us to this. And we would not have found the way if Allah had not guided us. Certainly the Messengers of our Lord brought the Truth (vii. 43).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as the information of the Holy Prophet pertaining to our worldly life is perfectly correct judged by any standard, in the same way his revelations concerning the Unseen. e. g. the Day of Resurrection, Paradise and Hell, will also be perfectly true. because he As Amin. the Truthful. We should, however, bear in mind that since we are living in a world of senses it is, therefore, through sensory experiences that we comprehend it. A man&#8217;s mind is so much hemmed in by space and time and his vision is so much limited by the material aspects of his life that it is only through material concepts that his mind is led to the knowledge of the Unseen. That is the reason why one can easily find frequent use of metaphors and similes in the language of the Holy Prophet as be explained the Unseen Realities of existence. These are not myths, but the Great undeniable Truths which our souls yearn to know, affirm and believe. but which our own intelligence fails to comprehend.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Not to join anything in worship along with Allah.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet added: &#8220;Whoever among you fulfills his pledge will be rewarded by Allah. And whoever indulges in any one of them (except the ascription of partners to Allah) and gets the punishment in this world, that punishment will be an expiation for that sin. And if one indulges in any of them, and Allah conceals his sin, it is up to Him to forgive or punish him (in the Hereafter).&#8221; &#8216;Ubada bin As-Samit added: &#8220;So we swore allegiance for these.&#8221; (points to Allah&#8217;s Apostle)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered the Muslims to do something, he used to order them deeds which were easy for them to do, (according to their strength endurance). They said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We are not like you. Allah has forgiven your past and future sins.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle became angry and it was apparent on his face. He said, &#8220;I am the most Allah fearing, and know Allah better than all of you do.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Who loves a person and he loves him only for Allah&#8217;s sake.</p>

So they will be taken out but (by then) they will be blackened (charred). Then they will be put in the river of Haya&#8217; (rain) or Hayat (life) (the Narrator is in doubt as to which is the right term), and they will revive like a grain that grows near the bank of a flood channel. Don&#8217;t you see that it comes out yellow and twisted&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle was asked, &#8220;What is the best deed?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;To believe in Allah and His Apostle (Muhammad).

He replied, &#8220;To participate in Jihad (religious fighting) in Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221; The questioner again asked, &#8220;What is the next (in goodness)?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;To perform Hajj (Pilgrim age to Mecca) &#8216;Mubrur, (which is accepted by Allah and is performed with the intention of seeking Allah&#8217;s pleasure only and not to show off and without committing a sin and in accordance with the traditions of the Prophet).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 2, Number 26:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle distributed (Zakat) amongst (a group of) people while I was sitting there but Allah&#8217;s Apostle left a man whom I thought the best of the lot. I asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Why have you left that person? By Allah I regard him as a faithful believer.&#8221; The Prophet commented: &#8220;Or merely a Muslim.&#8221; I remained quiet for a while, but could not help repeating my question because of what I knew about him. And then asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle, &#8220;Why have you left so and so? By Allah! He is a faithful believer.&#8221; The Prophet again said, &#8220;Or merely a Muslim.&#8221; And I could not help repeating my question because of what I knew about him. Then the Prophet said, &#8220;O Sa&#8217;d! I give to a person while another is dearer to me, for fear that he might be thrown on his face in the Fire by Allah.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 2, Number 27:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A person asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle . &#8220;What (sort of) deeds in or (what qualities of) Islam are good?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;To feed (the poor) and greet those whom you know and those whom you don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 2, Number 28:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said: &#8220;I was shown the Hell-fire and that the majority of its dwellers were women who were ungrateful.&#8221; It was asked, &#8220;Do they disbelieve in Allah?&#8221; (or are they ungrateful to Allah?) He replied, &#8220;They are ungrateful to their husbands and are ungrateful for the favors and the good (charitable deeds) done to them. If you have always been good (benevolent) to one of them and then she sees something in you (not of her liking), she will say, &#8216;I have never received any good from you.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 2, Number 29:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Ma&#8217;rur:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At Ar-Rabadha I met Abu Dhar who was wearing a cloak, and his slave, too, was wearing a similar one. I asked about the reason for it. He replied, &#8220;I abused a person by calling his mother with bad names.&#8221; The Prophet said to me, &#8216;O Abu Dhar! Did you abuse him by calling his mother with bad names You still have some characteristics of ignorance. Your slaves are your brothers and Allah has put them under your command. So whoever has a brother under his command should feed him of what he eats and dress him of what he wears. Do not ask them (slaves) to do things beyond their capacity (power) and if you do so, then help them.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 2, Number 30:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Ahnaf bin Qais:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While I was going to help this man (&#8216;Ali Ibn Abi Talib), Abu Bakra met me and asked, &#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I am going to help that person.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Go back for I have heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;When two Muslims fight (meet) each other with their swords, both the murderer as well as the murdered will go to the Hell-fire.&#8217; I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! It is all right for the murderer but what about the murdered one?&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8220;He surely had the intention to kill his companion.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 2, Number 31:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the following Verse was revealed: &#8220;It is those who believe and confuse not their belief with wrong (worshipping others besides Allah.)&#8221; (6:83), the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked, &#8220;Who is amongst us who had not done injustice (wrong)?&#8221; Allah revealed: &#8220;No doubt, joining others in worship with Allah is a great injustice (wrong) indeed.&#8221; (31.13)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 2, Number 32:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The signs of a hypocrite are three:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Whenever he speaks, he tells a lie.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Whenever he promises, he always breaks it (his promise ).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. If you trust him, he proves to be dishonest. (If you keep something as a trust with him, he will not return it.)&#8221;</p>
<hr />

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever has the following four (characteristics) will be a pure hypocrite and whoever has one of the following four characteristics will have one characteristic of hypocrisy unless and until he gives it up.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Whenever he is entrusted, he betrays.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Whenever he speaks, he tells a lie.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Whenever he makes a covenant, he proves treacherous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Whenever he quarrels, he behaves in a very imprudent, evil and insulting manner.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 2, Number 34:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whoever establishes the prayers on the night of Qadr out of sincere faith and hoping to attain Allah&#8217;s rewards (not to show off) then all his past sins will be forgiven.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 2, Number 35:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The person who participates in (Holy battles) in Allah&#8217;s cause and nothing compels him to do so except belief in Allah and His Apostles, will be recompensed by Allah either with a reward, or booty (if he survives) or will be admitted to Paradise (if he is killed in the battle as a martyr). Had I not found it difficult for my followers, then I would not remain behind any sariya going for Jihad and I would have loved to be martyred in Allah&#8217;s cause and then made alive, and then martyred and then made alive, and then again martyred in His cause.&#8221;</p>
<hr />

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said: &#8220;Whoever establishes prayers during the nights of Ramadan faithfully out of sincere faith and hoping to attain Allah&#8217;s rewards (not for showing off), all his past sins will be forgiven.&#8221;</p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 2, Number 38:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Religion is very easy and whoever overburdens himself in his religion will not be able to continue in that way. So you should not be extremists, but try to be near to perfection and receive the good tidings that you will be rewarded; and gain strength by worshipping in the mornings, the nights.&#8221; (See Fath-ul-Bari, Page 102, Vol 1).</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 2, Number 39:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara&#8217; (bin &#8216;Azib):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet came to Medina, he stayed first with his grandfathers or maternal uncles from Ansar. He offered his prayers facing Baitul-Maqdis (Jerusalem) for sixteen or seventeen months, but he wished that he could pray facing the Ka&#8217;ba (at Mecca). The first prayer which he offered facing the Ka&#8217;ba was the &#8216;Asr prayer in the company of some people. Then one of those who had offered that prayer with him came out and passed by some people in a mosque who were bowing during their prayers (facing Jerusalem). He said addressing them, &#8220;By Allah, I testify that I have prayed with Allah&#8217;s Apostle facing Mecca (Ka&#8217;ba).&#8217; Hearing that, those people changed their direction towards the Ka&#8217;ba immediately. Jews and the people of the scriptures used to be pleased to see the Prophet facing Jerusalem in prayers but when he changed his direction towards the Ka&#8217;ba, during the prayers, they disapproved of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bara&#8217; added, &#8220;Before we changed our direction towards the Ka&#8217;ba (Mecca) in prayers, some Muslims had died or had been killed and we did not know what to say about them (regarding their prayers.) Allah then revealed: And Allah would never make your faith (prayers) to be lost (i.e. the prayers of those Muslims were valid).&#8217; &#8221; (2:143).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 2, Number 40:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;If any one of you improve (follows strictly) his Islamic religion then his good deeds will be rewarded ten times to seven hundred times for each good deed and a bad deed will be recorded as it is.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 2, Number 41:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once the Prophet came while a woman was sitting with me. He said, &#8220;Who is she?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;She is so and so,&#8221; and told him about her (excessive) praying. He said disapprovingly, &#8220;Do (good) deeds which is within your capacity (without being overtaxed) as Allah does not get tired (of giving rewards) but (surely) you will get tired and the best deed (act of Worship) in the sight of Allah is that which is done regularly.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 2, Number 42:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever said &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and has in his heart good (faith) equal to the weight of a barley grain will be taken out of Hell. And whoever said: &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and has in his heart good (faith) equal to the weight of a wheat grain will be taken out of Hell. And whoever said, &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and has in his heart good (faith) equal to the weight of an atom will be taken out of Hell.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 2, Number 43:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once a Jew said to me, &#8220;O the chief of believers! There is a verse in your Holy Book Which is read by all of you (Muslims), and had it been revealed to us, we would have taken that day (on which it was revealed as a day of celebration.&#8221; &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab asked, &#8220;Which is that verse?&#8221; The Jew replied, &#8220;This day I have perfected your religion For you, completed My favor upon you, And have chosen for you Islam as your religion.&#8221; (5:3) &#8216;Umar replied,&#8221;No doubt, we know when and where this verse was revealed to the Prophet. It was Friday and the Prophet was standing at &#8216;Arafat (i.e. the Day of Hajj)&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 2, Number 44:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Talha bin &#8216;Ubaidullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man from Najd with unkempt hair came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and we heard his loud voice but could not understand what he was saying, till he came near and then we came to know that he was asking about Islam. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;You have to offer prayers perfectly five times in a day and night (24 hours).&#8221; The man asked, &#8220;Is there any more (praying)?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8220;No, but if you want to offer the Nawafil prayers (you can).&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle further said to him: &#8220;You have to observe fasts during the month of Ramad, an.&#8221; The man asked, &#8220;Is there any more fasting?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8220;No, but if you want to observe the Nawafil fasts (you can.)&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle further said to him, &#8220;You have to pay the Zakat (obligatory charity).&#8221; The man asked, &#8220;Is there any thing other than the Zakat for me to pay?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8220;No, unless you want to give alms of your own.&#8221; And then that man retreated saying, &#8220;By Allah! I will neither do less nor more than this.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;If what he said is true, then he will be successful (i.e. he will be granted Paradise).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 2, Number 45:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;(A believer) who accompanies the funeral procession of a Muslim out of sincere faith and hoping to attain Allah&#8217;s reward and remains with it till the funeral prayer is offered and the burial ceremonies are over, he will return with a reward of two Qirats. Each Qirat is like the size of the (Mount) Uhud. He who offers the funeral prayer only and returns before the burial, will return with the reward of one Qirat only.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 2, Number 46:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Abusing a Muslim is Fusuq (an evil doing) and killing him is Kufr (disbelief).&#8221; Narrated &#8216;Ubada bin As-Samit: &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle went out to inform the people about the (date of the) night of decree (Al-Qadr) but there happened a quarrel between two Muslim men. The Prophet said, &#8220;I came out to inform you about (the date of) the night of Al-Qadr, but as so and so and so and so quarrelled, its knowledge was taken away (I forgot it) and maybe it was better for you. Now look for it in the 7th, the 9th and the 5th (of the last 10 nights of the month of Ramadan).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 2, Number 47:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One day while the Prophet was sitting in the company of some people, (The angel) Gabriel came and asked, &#8220;What is faith?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8216;Faith is to believe in Allah, His angels, (the) meeting with Him, His Apostles, and to believe in Resurrection.&#8221; Then he further asked, &#8220;What is Islam?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8220;To worship Allah Alone and none else, to offer prayers perfectly to pay the compulsory charity (Zakat) and to observe fasts during the month of Ramadan.&#8221; Then he further asked, &#8220;What is Ihsan (perfection)?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8220;To worship Allah as if you see Him, and if you cannot achieve this state of devotion then you must consider that He is looking at you.&#8221; Then he further asked, &#8220;When will the Hour be established?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8220;The answerer has no better knowledge than the questioner. But I will inform you about its portents.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. When a slave (lady) gives birth to her master.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. When the shepherds of black camels start boasting and competing with others in the construction of higher buildings. And the Hour is one of five things which nobody knows except Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet then recited: &#8220;Verily, with Allah (Alone) is the knowledge of the Hour&#8211;.&#8221; (31. 34) Then that man (Gabriel) left and the Prophet asked his companions to call him back, but they could not see him. Then the Prophet said, &#8220;That was Gabriel who came to teach the people their religion.&#8221; Abu &#8216;Abdullah said: He (the Prophet) considered all that as a part of faith.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 2, Number 48:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was informed by Abu Sufyan that Heraclius said to him, &#8220;I asked you whether they (followers of Muhammad) were increasing or decreasing. You replied that they were increasing. And in fact, this is the way of true Faith till it is complete in all respects. I further asked you whether there was anybody, who, after embracing his (the Prophets) religion (Islam) became displeased and discarded it. You replied in the negative, and in fact, this is (a sign of) true faith. When its delight enters the heart and mixes with them completely, nobody can be displeased with it.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 2, Number 49:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated An-Nu&#8217;man bin Bashir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;Both legal and illegal things are evident but in between them there are doubtful (suspicious) things and most of the people have no knowledge about them. So whoever saves himself from these suspicious things saves his religion and his honor. And whoever indulges in these suspicious things is like a shepherd who grazes (his animals) near the Hima (private pasture) of someone else and at any moment he is liable to get in it. (O people!) Beware! Every king has a Hima and the Hima of Allah on the earth is His illegal (forbidden) things. Beware! There is a piece of flesh in the body if it becomes good (reformed) the whole body becomes good but if it gets spoilt the whole body gets spoilt and that is the heart.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 2, Number 50:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Jamra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I used to sit with Ibn &#8216;Abbas and he made me sit on his sitting place. He requested me to stay with him in order that he might give me a share from his property. So I stayed with him for two months. Once he told (me) that when the delegation of the tribe of &#8216;Abdul Qais came to the Prophet, the Prophet asked them, &#8220;Who are the people (i.e. you)? (Or) who are the delegate?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;We are from the tribe of Rabi&#8217;a.&#8221; Then the Prophet said to them, &#8220;Welcome! O people (or O delegation of &#8216;Abdul Qais)! Neither will you have disgrace nor will you regret.&#8221; They said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We cannot come to you except in the sacred month and there is the infidel tribe of Mudar intervening between you and us. So please order us to do something good (religious deeds) so that we may inform our people whom we have left behind (at home), and that we may enter Paradise (by acting on them).&#8221; Then they asked about drinks (what is legal and what is illegal). The Prophet ordered them to do four things and forbade them from four things. He ordered them to believe in Allah Alone and asked them, &#8220;Do you know what is meant by believing in Allah Alone?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; Thereupon the Prophet said, &#8220;It means:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. To testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is Allah&#8217;s Apostle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. To offer prayers perfectly</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. To pay the Zakat (obligatory charity)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. To observe fast during the month of Ramadan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. And to pay Al-Khumus (one fifth of the booty to be given in Allah&#8217;s Cause).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he forbade them four things, namely, Hantam, Dubba,&#8217; Naqir Ann Muzaffat or Muqaiyar; (These were the names of pots in which Alcoholic drinks were prepared) (The Prophet mentioned the container of wine and he meant the wine itself). The Prophet further said (to them): &#8220;Memorize them (these instructions) and convey them to the people whom you have left behind.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 2, Number 51:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The reward of deeds depends upon the intention and every person will get the reward according to what he has intended. So whoever emigrated for Allah and His Apostle, then his emigration was for Allah and His Apostle. And whoever emigrated for worldly benefits or for a woman to marry, his emigration was for what he emigrated for.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 2, Number 52:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Mas&#8217;ud:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;If a man spends on his family (with the intention of having a reward from Allah) sincerely for Allah&#8217;s sake then it is a (kind of) alms-giving in reward for him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 2, Number 53:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sa&#8217;d bin Abi Waqqas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;You will be rewarded for whatever you spend for Allah&#8217;s sake even if it were a morsel which you put in your wife&#8217;s mouth.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 2, Number 54:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jarir bin Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I gave the pledge of allegiance to Allah&#8217;s Apostle for the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. offer prayers perfectly</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. pay the Zakat (obligatory charity)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. and be sincere and true to every Muslim.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 2, Number 55:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ziyad bin&#8217;Ilaqa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Jarir bin &#8216;Abdullah (Praising Allah). On the day when Al-Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba died, he (Jarir) got up (on the pulpit) and thanked and praised Allah and said, &#8220;Be afraid of Allah alone Who has none along with Him to be worshipped.(You should) be calm and quiet till the (new) chief comes to you and he will come to you soon. Ask Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for your (late) chief because he himself loved to forgive others.&#8221; Jarir added, &#8220;Amma badu (now then), I went to the Prophet and said, &#8216;I give my pledge of allegiance to you for Islam.&#8221; The Prophet conditioned (my pledge) for me to be sincere and true to every Muslim so I gave my pledge to him for this. By the Lord of this mosque! I am sincere and true to you (Muslims). Then Jarir asked for Allah&#8217;s forgiveness and came down (from the pulpit).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">By Shaykhul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah as-Salafi <em>-Rahimullaah-<br />
</em>Translated &amp; Compiled  by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;The Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wasallam –</em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">ذَاقَ طَعْمَ الإيمانِ : مَنْ رَضِيَ بالله ربًّا، وبالإسلام دينًا، وبمحمَّدٍ رَسُولاً</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">‘The <strong>sweetness of <em>Eemaan</em></strong> has been tasted by he, whomever is pleased with Allaah as a Lord, Islaam as a religion and Muhammad as a Messenger.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[Collected by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">مَنْ قَالَ حِيْنَ يَسْمَعُ النِّدَاءَ رَضِيتُ بِاللَّهِ رَبًّا، وَبِمُحَمَّدٍ رَسُولاً، وَبِالإِسْلاَمِ دِينًا. غُفِرَ لَهُ ذَنْبُهُ</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;Whoever says, when he hears the call to prayer, I am pleased with Allaah as a Lord, Muhammad as a Messenger and Islaam as a religion, then his sin will be forgiven.&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[Collected by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The levels of the religion revolve around these two <em>Ahadeeth</em> and they end with these.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed these two <em>Ahadeeth</em> include being pleased with the <strong><em>Ruboobeeyah</em> </strong>(Lordship) of Allaah <em>Subhanahu</em>, and His <strong><em>Ulooheeyah</em> </strong>(worshipping Him), being <strong>pleased</strong> with His Messenger and having <strong>obedience</strong> to him, and being <strong>pleased</strong> with Allaah&#8217;s religion and having <strong>submission</strong> to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever has these <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>four aspects</strong></span> combined, then he truly is a <strong><em>Siddeeq</em> </strong>(truthful) person. It is an easy claim and statement to say, but it is from the most difficult matters in reality and in being tested, especially if what occurs opposes the desires of the soul and the intent of that becomes clear that being pleased was stated with just the tongue, so it was upon the tongue and not with ones actions.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Therefore, being pleased with Allaah&#8217;s <strong><em>Ieelaheeya</em> </strong>(meaning the One who is worshipped):</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">includes being pleased with loving Him alone, being fearful of Him, having hope in Him, and turning repentantly to Him, and having devotion for Him,  andstrength of intention and having all love for Him,  the person being pleased does everything to please his beloved, and this includes His worship and having sincerity for Allaah.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Being pleased with His Ruboobeeyah (Lordship):</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This includes being pleased with what Allaah has planned and disposed for His slave. Being pleased with Allaah&#8217;s <em>Ruboobeeyah</em> also includes singling Allaah out alone for having trust and reliance upon Him, and seeking assistance with Him, trusting Him, having reliance upon Him, and that a person is pleased with everything that Allaah does to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first: includes being pleased with what He commands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second: includes being pleased with what He destined for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many people who are pleased with Allaah as a Lord and they do not desire any other Lord except Him, however, they are not pleased with Him with being the only <em>Wali</em> (Guardian) and being the only Helper. But they have loyalty to <em>Awaliyah</em> other than Allaah, thinking that they are bringing you closer to Allaah, and that being loyal to them is like being loyal to those who are close to the king, and this is specific Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Tawheed is that a person does not take any one other than Allaah as an <em>Awaliyah</em>, and the Qur&#8217;aan is full of the description of the <em>Mushrikeen</em> that they took <em>Awaliyah</em> other than Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is not the loyalty that one has for Allaah&#8217;s Prophets, His Messengers and His believing slaves, since this is from the completion of <em>Eemaan</em> to have loyalty to His Prophets, and this is in fact complete loyalty for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, having loyalty for His <em>Awaliyah</em> is one colour and taking a <em>Wali</em> other than Allaah is a different colour. Whoever has not understood the distinction and criterion between them, then he must study Tawheed from its foundation, since this issue is a foundation of Tawheed and its base principle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many people who desire to take someone other than Allaah as a judge to whom they can take their judgements to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With whom they could debate, and be pleased with his judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These three levels are the pillars of Tawheed; that none other than Allah is taken as a Lord, or as a deity and none other than Him has a command.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Being pleased with His Prophet:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for being pleased with His Prophet as a Messenger: then this includes having prefect obedience to him, and complete submission to him, whereby the Prophet &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>&#8211; is foremost to a person than his own self.  So he does not take guidance except from the places of the Messenger&#8217;s speech,  he does not turn for a judgement except to him, and no one gives a judgement above his,  and he totally is not pleased with someone else&#8217;s judgement, not in anything from the <em>Asmaa</em> (Names) of Allaah and His characteristics and His actions, nor in anything from the perception and sense of the reality of <em>al</em> <em>Eemaan</em> and its different  levels,  nor in anything from the <em>Ahkam</em> (rulings) apparent and hidden, and a person is not pleased with a ruling regarding these things from someone other than the Messenger, and he is not pleased except with his ruling.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If however a person is incapable of following the Messenger&#8217;s judgement, then him having someone else&#8217;s judgement then this is from the view of forceful nourishment for a person who cannot find that which would sustain himself with except from dead flesh and blood.  The best that can be said about this situation is that it is like using dust, which is used for <em>Tayummum</em> (dry ablution) when a person is incapable of using water for purification.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Being pleased with His Deen (Religion):</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for being pleased with the <em>Deen</em>, so if the <em>Deen</em> says something or gives a ruling or commands or prohibits then a person should be completely pleased with it. There does not remain any opposition and resistance in his heart from its ruling, and he submits to it with total submission.  Even if it opposes what his own self intends, or his desires, or the statement of the one whom he blindly follows, or his Shaykh or his sect, this is where all the people desert you except the <em>Ghuraba</em> (those who adhere to the <em>Sunnah</em>) in this world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Beware of feeling distressed and lonely of being isolated and alone [i.e. Since the people abandon you for holding on to the Sunnah, being from the <em>Ghuraba</em>.]  since indeed it is -and I swear by Allaah- the distinction of honour and companionship with Allaah and His Messenger and it is the soul of being close to Allaah.  And being pleased with Allaah as a Lord, Muhammad as a Messenger and Islaam as a religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From: ‘Madarij as-Salikeen’ 2/170-172]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">The Different Wordings of the Hadeeth</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 &#8211; From Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri saying that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahualayhiwasallam–</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(مَنْ قَالَ: رَضِيتُ بِاللَّهِ رَبًّا وَبِالْإِسْلَامِ دِينًا وَبِمُحَمَّدٍ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ نَبِيًّا وَجَبَتْ لَهُ الْجَنَّةُ)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever says: ‘I am pleased with Allaah as the Lord, Islaam as the Religion and with Muhammad as the Prophet, then Paradise becomes obligatory for him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected in SilsilahSaheehah 334 &amp;Saheeh Abu Dawood 1368]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 &#8211; From Aamir bin Sa’ad bin Abee Waqas from his father from the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahualayhiwasallam –</em>that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(مَنْ قَالَ حِينَ يَسْمَعُ الْمُؤَذِّنَ: وَأَنَا أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ رَضِيتُ بِاللَّهِ رَبًّا وَبِالْإِسْلَامِ دِينًا وَبِمُحَمَّدٍ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ رَسُولًا غُفِرَ لَهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِنْ ذَنْبِهِ)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever says when he hears the <em>Mu’adhin</em> (the caller to the prayer): <em>Wa Ana Ashhaduanala  </em><em>ilaha ‘illa Allaah wahdahu la shareekalahu wa Ashhaduanna Muhammadan Abduhu wa Rasooluhu Radeetu Billaahi Rabban wa BilIslaami Deenan wa Bi Muhammad </em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam Rasoolan.’</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(I testify that there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah Alone and He has no partners and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger, I am pleased with Allaah as the Lord, with Islaam as the Religion and with Muhammad as the Messenger’) Then his previous sins are forgiven.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected in Saheeh Abu Dawood 537]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 &#8211; From al-Munaydhir a Companion of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> and he used to be in Africa who said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – </em>say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">من قال إذا أصبح :&#8221; رضيت بالله ربا و بالإسلام دينا و بمحمد نبيا &#8220;،فأناالزعيم لآخذن بيده حتى أدخله الجنة</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever says in the morning: ‘I am pleased with Allaah as the Lord, Islaam as the Religion and with Muhammad as the Prophet,’ then I am a guarantor that I will indeed definitely take him by his hand until I can enter him in to Paradise.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected in At-Targheeb by al-Mundhari, Tabarani &amp; Albaani in Silsilah Saheehah 2686 and he said the Hadeeth is <em>Thaabit</em> (Established)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Ayni said in his explanation of Abu Dawood:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the Messenger’s saying: ‘I am pleased with Allaah as the Lord’ means: I am convinced by Him, He is sufficient for me, and I do not require anyone along with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the Messenger’s saying:  ‘and with Muhammad as the Prophet,’ means: that I am content with Muhammad as a Messenger to me and to all the other Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the Messenger’s saying:  ‘Islaam as the Religion’ means: I am content with Islaam as a religion, meaning I do not desire another way other than Islaam, and I do not follow except that which is in agreement with the <em>Sharia’</em> of Muhammad <em>– alayhi as-Salaam-</em> or that I do not desire other than Islaam as a <em>Deen</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[SharhAbeeDawood by al-Ayani 2/484]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Ayni continues in his explanation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it is said what is the intent of the saying: ‘as a <em>Deen’</em>, I say: the meaning of <em>Deen</em> here is Tawheed; … . . as in the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ومَنيَبتَغ غَيرَ الإِسلاَم دينا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And whoever seeks a religion other than Islaam&gt;&gt;[Ala-Imran: 85]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Means: Tawheed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the authentic <em>hadeeth</em> from Umar who said: ‘While we were with the Messenger of Allaah that day, all of a sudden a man came to visit whose clothing was exceedingly white…..’ to the end of the <em>hadeeth</em>. So here the Messenger of Allaah generalized the ‘<em>Deen’</em> upon ‘Islaam, <em>Eemaan</em> (faith) and <em>Ihsaan</em> (perfection of worship)’  due to his saying: Indeed that was Jibraeel who came to you to teach you your <em>Deen</em>.’ He taught them these three things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, sometimes the <em>Deen</em> is stated for the three things which Jibraeel <em>– Alayhi as-Salaam –</em> inquired about, and sometimes it is stated for Islaam as is in the saying of Allaah Tala’a:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">اليَومَ أكمَلتُ لَكُم دينَكُم وَأتمَمتُ عَلَيكم نعمَتيوَرَضيتُ لَكُمُ الإسلاَمَ دينا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islaam as your religion.&gt;&gt;[al-Maidah: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From: ‘SharhAbeeDawood’ by al-Ayani 2/486-7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Saying it three times is not Authentic</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Da’eef</em></strong><strong> &#8211; </strong>From Abee Salaam the servant of the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> from the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is no Muslim or human or slave who says when the morning comes and when the evening approaches, <strong>three times</strong>: ‘I am pleased with Allaah as the Lord, Islaam as the Religion and with Muhammad as the Prophet, except that it is a right upon Allaah that he will please him on the Day of Judgement.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ibn Abee Shaybah in ‘al-Musannaf’ and in ‘al-Musnad’ &amp; Albaani declared it <strong><em>Da’eef</em></strong> in Silsilah Ahadeeth ad-Da’eefah no. 5020]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Da’eef</em></strong><strong> &#8211; </strong>‘who says when the morning comes and when the evening approaches, <strong>three times</strong>: ‘I am pleased with Allaah as the Lord, Islaam as the Religion and with Muhammad as the Prophet.’ except that it is a right upon Allaah that he will please him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Albaani declared it <strong><em>Da’eef</em></strong> in ‘Da’eef al-Jamia’ as-Sagheer’ No. 5734]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Answered by the Noble Scholar and Muftee<br />
Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez bin &#8216;Abdullaah bin Baaz [1]<br />
Al-Istiqaamah Issue Issue No.2 &#8211; Safar 1417H / July 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>INCREASING EEMAAN (FAITH)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[Q]</i></b>: <span style="color:#ff0000;"><i>Firstly</i></span>: I begin my question by seeking your advice that I may benefit from you with regards to how I may increase my <i> eemaan</i> (faith)?<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000;"><i>Secondly</i></span>: I wish to learn about the religion, however Islaamic books are very rare in my country (Algeria), except some books which are with some brothers &#8211; may Allaah reward them with goodness.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000;"><i>Thirdly</i></span>: I work as a builder and the people that I work with do not really have sound faith and their speech is nothing more than gossip and obscenities.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000;"><i>Fourthly</i></span>: I keep company with a brother whose beliefs are corrupt and who constantly speaks ill of the righteous and believing brothers and I feel very distraught about this. So I hope that you will direct me to a cure for this disease.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[A]</i></b>: <span style="color:#993300;"><strong><i>Firstly</i></strong></span>: We advise you to recite the Qur&#8217;aan frequently and that you increase in your hearing of it and in your recitation of it. Reflect and consider its meaning to the best of your ability and what you do not understand of it, then ask the people of knowledge of your country about it, or write to those outside of your country from the Scholars of Sunnah (Prophetic guidance).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also advise you to increase in the <i> dhikr</i> (remembrance) of Allaah with such remembrances and supplications that are authentically related, such as saying <i>laa ilahaa ilallaah</i> (that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah), or saying <i>subhaanallaah</i> <i>wal-hamdulillaah wa laa ilaha ilallaahu wallaahu akbar</i> (declaring Allaah free from all imperfections, praising Him and declaring that none has the right to be worshipped except Him and that He is greater), and their like. For this purpose, we urge you to refer to books such as al <i>Kalimut-Tayyib</i> of Ibn Taymiyyah, al <i>Waabilus-Sayyib</i> of Ibn al-Qayyim, <i>Riyaadhus-Saaliheen</i> and <i> al-Adhkaar</i> both by Imaam an-Nawawee, and their like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because the remembrance of Allaah increases <i> eemaan</i> (faith) and causes hearts to attain tranquility, as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;Indeed in the remembrance of Allaah do hearts find tranquility.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ar-Ra&#8217;dd 13:28].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also preserve your five daily Prayers, your Fasting and the rest of your obligations &#8211; along with hoping in Allaah&#8217;s mercy and forgiveness and relying upon Him in all your affairs. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;The Believers ate only those who, when Allaah is mentioned, feel a fear in the hearts, and when His Verses are recited to them, it increases their <i>eemaan</i> (faith), and they put their trust and rely upon Allaah alone. They are those who perform the Prayer and spend out of that which We have given them, they are Believers in truth. For them ate grades of dignity and nobility with their Lord, and also forgiveness and generous provisions.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Anfaal 8:2-4].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><i>Secondly</i></strong></span>: Islaamic books are easily found in every Muslim country, especially in public libraries and bookshops. So the one who seeks after them will find them. We advise you to refer to the people of knowledge of the <i> Sharee&#8217;ah</i> (Prescribed Law of Allaah) so that they may direct you to suitable books for you to read, borrow or buy. If there are any problems regarding this, then it is not fitting for us to stop answering your questions from the Pure Revelation &#8211; and We ask Allaah that He makes us firm in that, and only His help is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;"><i>Thirdly</i>, <i>Fourthly</i>:</span> </strong>It is upon you to keep good company and to sit in righteous gatherings in order to benefit from them and their manners and their knowledge and that they may assist you in cultivating obedience to Allaah. So be careful and beware of bad companionship, and evil gathering. Beware, so that they may not influence you, adversely affecting your morals and manners, such that you fall into ill-repute, or that they weaken your resolve and determination in fulfilling your religious obligations and the obligations to your family. Indeed, the Prophet <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> advised the Ummah to sit in good gatherings, and he warned them from the evil and foul gatherings, and he gave a noble example about this, when he said: <i>&#8220;The example of a good companion and a bad companion is like that of a seller of musk, and the one who blows the blacksmith&#8217;s bellows. As for the seller of musk then either he will grant you some, or you buy some from him, or at the very least you enjoy a pleasant smell from him. As for the one who blows the blacksmith&#8217;s bellows, then either he will burn your clothes, or you will get an offensive smell from him.&#8221;</i> This was related by al-Bukhaaree (4/323), from Abu Moosaa al-Ash&#8217;aree <i> radiallaahu &#8216;anhu.</i> 1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>CONCERNING A WOMAN&#8217;S <i>MAHR</i> (DOWRY)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[Q]</i></b>: I and many others have observed that many people are very excessive when it comes to the matter of the <i> mahr</i> (wedding dowry that is paid to the bride), and that they seek great amounts of <i> mahr</i> when it comes to the marriage of their daughters, and they stipulate as a condition the giving of other gifts to them, along with the <i> mahr</i>. This wealth that people demand in such cases, is it <i> halaal</i> (lawful) or <i> haraam</i> (unlawful)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: What is prescribed in the <i> Sharee&#8217;ah</i> is that the <i> mahr</i> should be a small amount and that people should not compete with each other in this regard, acting in accordance with the many <i> ahaadeeth</i> which are related about this. They should also help facilitate marriages and be keen in preserving the modesty and decency of the young Muslim men and women. And it is not permissible for the <i>awliyaa</i> (guardians of the brides-to-be) to demand and stipulate gifts for themselves, since they have no right at all in this matter. Rather the right belongs to the woman, and in some particular cases to the father. He may stipulate a condition as long as it does not harm the daughter, nor lead to the delaying of the marriage. However, if the father forgoes such a right then this is better and more preferable. Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects &#8211; says:<b> &#8220;And marry those amongst you who are single and also marry the pious of your male and female slaves. If they be poor, Allaah will enrich them out of His Bounty.&#8221; </b>[Soorah an-Noor 24:32].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the <i> hadeeth</i> of &#8216;Uqbah ibn &#8216;Aamir <i> radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i>, the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> &#8220;The best dowry is that which is easy.&#8221;</i> This was narrated by Abu Daawood and al-Haakim who authenticated it. And once a woman offered herself to the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> for marriage. However, one of his Companions desired to marry her, so the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said [regarding the <i>mahr</i>]: <i>&#8220;Bring something, even if it be an iron ring.&#8221;</i> So when he could not find even this, the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> married them for the dowry that the man would teach whatever of the Qur&#8217;aan he knew to her. 2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the dowry of the Prophet <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s</i> wives was five-hundred dirhams, which is equivalent to one-hundred and thirty riyaals today. And his daughters were married for the <i> mahr</i> of four-hundred dinaars, which is equivalent to one-hundred riyaals today. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a most beautiful example to follow.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:21].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whenever the difficulties relating to marriage are lightened, then preserving the modesty and decency of young men and women becomes easier, shameful and evil deeds decrease, and the Ummah &#8211; as a result &#8211; will increase in number. However if this matter is made difficult, and people continue competing with each other with regards to the <i> mahr</i> (dowry), then the number of marriages will decrease, fornication will become more widespread and more young men and women will remain unmarried &#8211; except those whom Allaah saves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So my sincere advice to all the Muslims, wherever they may be, is to facilitate the marriage process and to cooperate in this and make it easy. They should turn away from demanding excessive <i> mahr</i> and avoid unnecessary hardships and difficulties in the <i>waleemah</i> (wedding-feast). Rather, they should content themselves with a <i> waleemah</i> that is according to the <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i>, in which the burdens and difficulties for the husband and wife are minimal. May Allaah improve and rectify all the affairs of the Muslims and may He give them the guidance and ability to cling to the <i> Sunnah</i> (Prophetic guidance) in all matters. 3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>IMPURITIES UPON ONE&#8217;S CLOTHING WHILST PRAYING</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[Q]</i></b>: If a person finds some impurity upon his clothes after he has finished praying in it, does the Prayer have to be prayed again?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[A]</i></b>: Whosoever prays, and is unaware that there are impurities upon his body or his clothes during the Prayer, but only realises after he has completed it, then his Prayer will be deemed as correct, according to the most correct position of the Scholars. Similarly, if he was aware of such impurities before the Prayer, but then forgot about this at the time of praying and did not remember except after the Prayer, then his Prayer likewise will be correct. Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic said: <b> &#8220;Our Lord! Do not take us to task if we forget or fall into error.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:286]. It has been authentically related about Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, that one day he <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> led the people in Prayer, wearing his shoes. Then the angel Jibreel came to him during the Prayer and informed him that there was some dirt on his shoes. So the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> removed them and continued with his Prayer and he did not repeat the Prayer.4 This is part of the ease which Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects &#8211; has given to His servants out of His Mercy for them. However, if a person forgets that he had passed wind, then prays in that state, he must &#8211; by <i> ijmaa&#8217;</i> (consensus) of the Scholars &#8211; repeat his prayer again, when he remembers. This is due to the saying of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>: <i> &#8220;The Prayer will not be accepted without purification nor will charity be accepted from wealth that is unlawful.&#8221;</i> This has been related by Muslim in his <i> Saheeh</i> (1/140) and the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s</i> saying: <i> &#8220;The Prayer of any one of you who has released wind will not be accepted, until he makes wudhoo (ablution).&#8221;</i> Related by al-Bukhaaree and Muslim. 5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>SLAUGHTERING FOR OTHER THAN ALLAAH</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[Q]</i></b>: The slaughtering of sheep and other such animals at the graves of the pious people, for their sake and in order to please and draw closer to them, is a custom amongst my family. I have tried to prevent them from doing so, but it has only made them more resolute in doing so. I have said to them that this is shirk (associating partners in the worship) of Allaah. But they respond by saying: We only worship Allaah the way He deserves to be worshipped. However, we visit the graves of the <i>awliyaa</i> (the pious friends of Allaah) and supplicate to Allaah, through the right of the pious people, so that harm and difficulties may be averted from us. I have said to them that this is not from the religion, but they just tell me to leave them alone upon what they are doing. So what do you suggest should be the cure for such people, and what do you suggest I do to counter act this <i> bid&#8217;ah</i> (innovation)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i></i></b><b><i>[A]</i></b>: It is known from the evidences related in the Qur&#8217;aan and the <i> Sunnah</i> that sacrificing for other than Allaah, in order to draw close to other than Allaah &#8211; whether sacrificing for the <i>jinns</i>, <i>awliyaa</i>, idols or other than that from the creation &#8211; is an act of shirk and is an act of <i>jaahiliyyah</i> (pre-Islaamic ignorance) that was practiced by the <i>mushriks</i> (those who worshipped the pious men, <i>jinns</i>, angels, stones, statues, etc, along with worshipping Allaah). Allaah- the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;Say: Indeed my Prayer, my sacrifce, my living and my dying are all for Allaah Lord of the worlds. No partner do I setup with Him in this, and this is what I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:162]. So Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; clearly explains in this verse that sacrificing to other than Allaah is like praying to other than Him. And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;Indeed We have granted to the Prophet sallallaabu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam the Kawthar (a river in Paradise whose banks are lined with tents made from hollow pearls). Therefore turn in Prayer to your Lord and sacrifice to Him alone.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Kawthar 108:1-2]. So Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects &#8211; commanded His Prophet in these noble verses that he should pray only to His Lord and that he should sacrifice to only Him, which was opposite of what the <i>mushriks</i> did, in that they used to prostrate to other than Allaah and to sacrifice to other than Him. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And your Lord has commanded that you worship none but Him.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Israa 17:23]. And He &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;And they have not been commanded except to worship Allaah alone making the religion purely and sincerely for Him.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Bayyinah 98:5]. And there are many other verses with the same meaning. So, since sacrificing is one of the acts of <i> &#8216;ibaadah</i> (worship), then it is obligatory to make this action purely and sincerely for Allaah alone, without directing it to other than Him. Also &#8216;Alee ibn Abee Taalib <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> said that the Prophet <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said:<i> &#8220;May Allaah curse the one who sacrifices to other than Allaah.&#8221;</i> This has been related by Muslim in his Saheeh (no.765).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for supplicating to Allaah and asking Him by the right of the <i> awliyaa</i> or by the right of His Messenger, or by the status of His Messenger &#8211; then this does not constitute shirk, but rather it is a <i> bid&#8217;ah</i> (innovation) which leads to shirk, in the opinion of the majority of Scholars. This is because <i>du&#8217;aa</i> (supplication) is an act of worship, and how it is to be done can only be known from the Revelation. And there is nothing authentically established from our Prophet <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> to show the permissibility or validity of this type of <i> tawassul</i> (seeking the means of nearness to Allaah by invoking an intermediary) in which Allaah is asked through the right of His Prophet or the right of the <i> awliyaa</i> or any of His creation. So it is not permissible for any Muslim to innovate new forms of <i> tawassul</i> which has not been prescribed by Allaah, as He &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:<b> &#8220;Or do they have partners with Allaah who prescribe for them a religion which Allaah has not prescribed.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ash-Shooraa 42:21]. And the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> &#8220;Whosoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it, will be rejected&#8221;</i>, and in another authentic narration: <i> &#8220;Whosoever does an action that I have not commanded, it will be rejected.&#8221;</i> 7 And the meaning of this is that such innovated actions will be rejected and not accepted from its doer. Thus it is obligatory for the Muslims to restrict themselves to only what Allaah has prescribed and to beware of what people have innovated into the religion. As regards the prescribed forms of <i>tawassul</i> then they are: <i>tawassul</i> (seeking the means of nearness to Allaah) through His Names and His Attributes and by righteous actions, and by one&#8217;s <i>eemaan</i> (faith) in Allaah and His Messenger, and other righteous and prescribed actions similar to this. 9</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from his book &#8220;The Pillars of Islam and Iman &#8211; and what every muslim must know about the religion</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There are things which nullify Imân (Faith) i.e. Belief, just as there are things which nullify Wudhû&#8217;. If a person does any single one of them, he loses his state of ritual purity. The same is true with Belief. The nullifiers of Belief can be classified into four categories:<i>First category</i>: Denial of Rabb&#8217;s existence or reviling and speaking ill of Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Second category</i>: Denial of Allâh&#8217;s right to be worshipped or worshipping anything or anyone along with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Third category</i>: Denial of any of Allâh&#8217;s Names or Attributes established in the Qur&#8217;ân and Sunnah or reviling them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Fourth category</i>: Denial of the role of Muhammed (pbuh) as the messenger of Allâh, or reviling His Message.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1. Denial of the existence of Rabb nullifies Imân</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This first category encompasses several types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Pure atheism; such as the belief of communists who deny that the universe has a creator and say: &#8220;There is no god, and life is a purely material phenomenon.&#8221; They attribute the creation and all actions to pure chance, or &#8220;nature&#8221; but forget the One Who created even the &#8220;chance&#8221; and the &#8220;nature&#8221;, as Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allâh is the Creator of all things, and He is the Wakîl (Trustee, Disposer of affaires, Guardian, etc.) over all things.&#8221; (39:62)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This category of disbeliever is more hardened in their apostasy than the polytheist Arabs of post-islamic period, and even Satan himself, as those polytheist Arabs did admit the existence of their creator as the Qur&#8217;ân states about them saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: &#8216;Allâh&#8230;'&#8221; (43:87)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and the Qur&#8217;ân mentions the statement of Satan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;(Iblîs) said: I am better then he, You (Allâh) created me from fire, and You created him from clay.&#8221; (38:76)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is an act of disbelief for a Muslim to say, &#8220;Nature created something or that it came into being by chance.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Or if a person claims to be the Rabb; as Pharaoh claimed saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;I am your lord, most high.&#8221; (79:24)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Or to claim that there are great saints [called &#8220;Qutb&#8221; in Sufi terminology, which literally means axes (of creation)] who have control over what happens in the universe, even if this claim is accompanied with the admissions that Allâh, the Soverign Lord exists. People who have this belief are in a worse condition than the idol worshippers before Islâm, who used to admit that Allâh is the Sole Controller of the affairs of the universe, as is indicated by Allâh&#8217;s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Say: &#8216;Who provides for you from the sky and from the earth? Or who owns hearing and sight? And who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living? And who disposes the affairs? They will say: &#8216;Allâh.&#8217; Say: &#8216;Will you not then be afraid of Allâh&#8217;s punishment (for setting up rivals in worship with Allâh?'&#8221; (10:31)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Or the statements of some Sufis that Allâh pervades in His creation, or became incarnate in it. The Sufi, Ibn Arabi, who is buried in Damascus, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Lord is a slave, and the slave is my Lord. I only wish I knew, which one is the Mukallaf.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Mukallaf is a basic Sharî&#8217;ah terminology, that refers to the essential role of the adult, sane human being: That he or she is charged by Allâh with a series of duties and responsibilities, orders and prohibitions, and he will be questioned on the basis of how well he discharged his responsibilities.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this transgressor of the Sufis has stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And the dog and the pig is nothing other then our deity, nor is Allâh other then a monk in a church.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Hallâj (a Sufi of Baghdad) stated: &#8220;I am He (i.e. the Rabb) and He is I.&#8221; Due to this statement of his, which he would not retract; the scholars agreed that he should be executed as an apostate. High Exalted is Allâh above what such people say. <b>2. Shirk (polytheism) in Worship nullifies Imân</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This second category includes the denail of Allâh as the object of worship or ascribing a partner along with Allâh. It too has various manifestations:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Those who worship the sun, the moon, the stars, the trees, Satan or any other created being, and abandon the worship of Allâh, Who created all these things which have no power to benefit nor to harm. Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And from among His Signs are the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. Prostrate not to the sun nor to the moon, but prostrate to Allâh Who created them, if you (really) worship Him.&#8221; (41:37)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Those who worship Allâh, and worship along with Him some of His creations, such as saints, as embodied in idols, grave-worship, etc. The Arab idol worshippers before Islâm were of this category, as they used to call upon Allâh only in times of hardship and pressing need, and would worship others in times of ease. As the Qur&#8217;ân described them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And when they embark on a ship, they invoke Allâh, making their Faith pure for Him only, but when He brings them safely to land, behold, they give a share of their worships to others.&#8221; (29:65)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are characterized as Al-Mushrikûn, (i.e. those who associate and attribute partners with Allâh), even though they made supplication to Allâh Alone when they were afraid of drowning at sea, because they didn&#8217;t stay like that. Instead they called upon others after He saved them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Since Allâh was displeased with the idol worshipping Arabs before Islam, He branded them as Kâfiroon (i.e. the disbelievers), and ordered His Prophet to fight them, because they called upon others besides Allâh at the time of ease. He didn&#8217;t accept their whole-heartedness when they called upon Him alone in hardship, and He labelled them Mushrikîn. Therefor, what can we say about certain Muslims today, who resort to dead saints at the time of ease as well as at the time of hardship? And they ask of them only Allâh has the power to bestow, like curing the sick, and granting sustance and guidance, etc., and they forget the Creator of those saints, whereas He is the only One Who cures, the Substainer, and the Guide. And those dead people have no power at all and cannot even hear those who are calling upon them, as Allâh stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;And those, whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmîr (the thin membrane over the datestone). If you invoke (or call upon) them, they hear not your call, and if (in case) they were to hear, they could not grant it (your request) to you. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will disown your worshipping them. And none can inform you (O Muhammed pbuh) like Him Who is the All-Knower (of each and every thing).&#8221; (35:13,14)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse is explicit to the effect that the dead cannot hear those who call upon them, and explicit in stating that their supplication is major Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of them might say: &#8220;We don&#8217;t believe that these saints and righteous people have the power to benefit or harm. We only take them as intermediaries who will intercede with Allâh on our behalf, and through them we get closer to Allâh.&#8221; Our reply to them is that the idolaters before Islâm used to hold a similar belief, as is mentioned in the Qur&#8217;ân:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And they worship besides Allâh things that hurt them not, nor profit them, and they say: &#8216;These are our intercessors with Allâh.&#8217; Say: &#8216;Do you inform Allâh of that which He knows not in the heavens and on the earth?&#8217; Glorified and Exalted is He above all that which they associate as partners with Him!&#8221; (10:18)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse is explicit in proving that whoever worships and supplicates other then Allâh, he is a Mushrik even if he believes that those other beings cannot benefit nor harm, but only sees them as intercessors.<br />
Allâh said about the idolaters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;And those who take Awliya&#8217; (protectors and helpers) besides Him (say): &#8216;We worship them only that they may bring us near to Allâh.&#8217; Verily, Allâh will judge between them concerning that wherein they differ. Truly, Allâh guides not him who is a liar, and a disbeliever.&#8221; (39:3)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse is explicit in proving the disbelief of those who call upon other than Allâh with the intention of getting thereby closer to Allâh.<br />
The Prophet (pbuh) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Because supplication is worship&#8221; (Tirmidhi)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Among the nullifiers of Belief is to rule by other than what Allâh has revealed; if it is accompanied by the belief that Allâh&#8217;s Laws are inappropriate or less appropriate, or that man made laws which contradict them are equally appropriate; Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;The command (or the judgement) is for none but Allâh. He has commanded that you worship non but Him (i.e. His Monotheism), that is the (true) straight religion, but most men know not.&#8221; (12:40)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;And whosoever does not judge by what Allâh has revealed, such are the Kâfîrun (i.e. disbelievers &#8211; of a lesser degree as they do not act upon Allâh&#8217;s Laws).&#8221; (5:44)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the ruler is applying a law other than what Allah has revealed, while believing that the revealed Law is the only Legitimate Law, but he is contradicting it on the basis of personal whims and inclinations or because of what he considers to be external pressure beyond his control, then he is injust and tyrannical or corrupt, but he did not cross the line of disbelief. This is according to the statement of Ibn Abbas who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever repudiates what Allâh has revealed, the he surely disbelieved, while one who accepted it (while acting in contradiction to it), he is unjust and corrupt.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the interpretation of the verse chosen by the great exegete Ibn Jarîr At-Tabari, and &#8216;Atâ said with regard to the second state:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;A level of disbelief below the level which takes one out of Islâm.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who suspended the Laws of Allâh and replaced them with man-made laws which oppose them, believing in the validity of their man-made laws, they have disbelieved and gone out of Islâm by the consensus of the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Among the nullifiers of Belief is displeasure with Allâh&#8217;s Legislation, or the opinion that it is too confining and strict or that it imposes undue hardship. Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (Muhammed pbuh) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.&#8221; (4:65)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or to dislike the orded which is revealed, as Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;But those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allâh &#8211; Islamic Monotheism), for them is destruction, and (Allâh) will make their deeds vain. That is because they hate that which Allâh has sent down (this Qur&#8217;ân and Islâmic laws, etc.), so He has made their deeds fruitless.&#8221; (47:8,9)</b> 3. Shirk in Allâh&#8217;s Attributes nullifies Imân</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This third category includes denail of some of all of Allâh&#8217;s Attributes or His Names or speaking ill of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. It nullifies Belief when a believer denies the Names of Allâh or His Attributes which are established by the texts of the Qur&#8217;ân and the authentic Sunnah; for example, to deny that Allâh&#8217;s Knowledge is total, or His Power, or His Life or His Hearing or Sight or Speech or Mercy, or His Establishment over His Throne or His Transcendence above it, or His Descent to the lowest heaven or that He has a Hand or an Eye, or other than that of the Attributes which befit His Splendour and which do not resemble the attributes of anything in creation. Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.&#8221; (42:11)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this verse Allâh denied His Resemblance to His creatures, and attributed to Himself the faculties of hearing and sight; and all His other Attributes must be understood in the same way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. It is an error and misguidance to interpret something some of His affirmed Attributes, and to change the meanings of the words used to describe them from their primary meaning in the Arabic language to obscure meanings, like the interpretation of the word Istawâ which means ascension and establishment above something, to mean Istilâ which means to take power. Imam Al-Bukhâri in his Sahîh transmitted the authentic interpretation of Istawâ from Mujâhid and Abul-&#8216;Âliyah, two of the prominent scholars among the Tabi&#8217;în, the successors of the Sahâbah. The diversionary interpretation of Allâh&#8217;s Attributes leads to their denial. As the interpretation of Istawâ meaning to take power is, in fact, a denial of one of Allâh&#8217;s Attributes, which is Allâh&#8217;s Elevation above His Throne, which is established in numerous places in the Qur&#8217;ân and Sunnah. Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;The Most Beneficent (Allâh) Istawâ (rose over) the (mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty).&#8221; (20:5)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven (Allâh), will not cause the earth to sink with you&#8230;&#8221; (67:16)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (pbuh) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allâh recorded a Book which is with Him above the Throne.&#8221; (Agreed upon)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This type of interpretation of the Divine Attributes is a form of distortion as Shaikh Muhammed Amîn Shinqeeti states in his book &#8220;Manhaj wa Darâsât feel-Asmâ&#8217;i was-Sifât &#8211; Studies in the (Divine) Names and Attributes&#8221; on page 26:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;To sum up the issue, I would like to make two points. First the interpreter should consider Allâh&#8217;s Statement to the Jews:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;say Hittatun&#8230;&#8221; (2:58)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hittatun means repentance, they added a letter &#8220;N&#8221; in it and said &#8220;Hintatun&#8221;, Allâh called this addition a change. Allâh said in Surah Al-Baqarah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;But those who did wrong changed the word from that which had been told to them for another, so We sent upon the wrong-doers Rijzan (a punishment) from the heaven because of their rebelling against Allâh&#8217;s obedience.&#8221; (2:59)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise are those who interpret Allâh&#8217;s Attributes with diversionary interpretation. It was said to them Istawâ so they added an &#8220;L&#8221; and said Istawlâ. Consider the resemblance between the &#8220;L&#8221; they added and the &#8220;N&#8221; the Jews added (this point was originally mentioned by Ibn Al-Qayyim).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. There are certain Attributes which are exclusive to Allâh, like Knowledge of the unseen, which no one in creation possesses. Allâh said in his book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And with Him are the keys of the Ghaib (all that is hidden), non knows them but He&#8230;&#8221; (6:59)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh might reveal certain aspects of the unseen to His Messengers through Revelation when He wants, Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;(He Alone) the All-Knower of the Ghaib (unseen), and He reveals to non His Ghaib (unseen) except to a Messenger (from mankind) whom He has chosen (He informs him of the unseen as much as He likes)&#8230;&#8221; (72:26,27)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among the statements of disbelief and error is the statement of the poet Al-Busairy in Qasîdah Burdah describing the Prophet (pbuh)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily, from your generosity is the world and its rival (that is the Hereafter) and a part of your knowledge is the knowledge of the Tablet and the Pen.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This world and the Hereafter are certainly part of the creation of Allâh and from His Generosity, not from the generosity or creation of the Messenger, as the poet claimed.<br />
Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And truly, unto Us (belong) the last (Hereafter) and the first (this world).&#8221; (92:13)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh&#8217;s Messenger (pbuh) does not know what is in the Preserved Tablet, nor what the Pen wrote, as the poet claimed, since this is part of the absolute unseen, which no one knows exept Allâh. As the Qur&#8217;ân mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Say: None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghaib (unseen) except Allâh.&#8221; (27:65)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the saints, it is only logical that they have less access to knowledge of the absolute unseen as they do not even have access to direct Revelation by which Allâh informed His Prophets and Messengers of certain aspects of the unseen, because Revelation does not descend on saints; it is reserved for Prophets and Messengers, so whoever else claims knowledge of the unseen, and whoever believes their claims, has nullified his belief in Islâm. The Prophet (pbuh) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever goes to a fortuneteller or astrologer and believes what he says, has disbelieved in what was revealed to Muhammad.&#8221; (Ahmad)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Occasionally the predictions of these fortuntellers do turn out true, but part of that is due to chance, because they are guessing and trying to extrapolate on what they already know. If they were really truthful in their claim to knowledge of the unseen, they would be right all the time, and they would have informed us the secrets of the Jews, and they could have uncovered all the buried treasures of the earth, and they would not be dependent on the people for money, taking their wealth from them under false pretenses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Defamation of Prophets nullifies Imân</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This fourth category is the rejection of any of the messengers of Allâh or defaming their characters. These are the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. To deny the Message of Muhammed (pbuh) because the testimony that &#8216;Muhammed is the Messenger of Allâh&#8217; is one of the pillars of Belief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. To disparage the Messenger of Allâh (pbuh) or his truthfulness, or his faithfulness in discharge of what he was entrusted with, or his chasteness or to revile him or make fun of him, or make light of him, or find fault with any of his documented behaviour.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. To attack his authentic Ahâdîth (transmitted sayings) and disbelieve them, or to reject the true news which he has described for us including his documented prophecies. Examples are the appearance of the Dajjâl (the Antichrist) or the descent of Jesus who will rule by the Sharî&#8217;ah of Muhammed (pbuh) and other prophecies documented in the Qur&#8217;ân and Sunnah. It is a nullification of Imân to reject these matters after accepting the attribution of the Ahâdîth to the Prophet (pbuh) as being authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. To deny any of the Messengers sent by Allâh before Muhammed (pbuh) or to deny the stories and sayings in regards to them and their nations, as reported in the Qur&#8217;ân or by the Messenger of Allâh (pbuh) in authentic Ahâdîth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. To claim Prophethood after Muhammed (pbuh) for example Ghulam Ahmed, the Qâdiyâni (i.e. from Qadiyan, India), who claimed Prophethood, while the Qur&#8217;ân says in this verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Muhammed (pbuh) is not the father of any man among you, but he is the Messenger of Allâh, and the Last (end) of the Prophets&#8230;&#8221; (33:40)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Messenger of Allâh (pbuh) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I am the last one, after whom there will be no Prophet.&#8221; (Agreed upon)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And anyone who believes that there is a Prophet after Muhammed (pbuh) whether he is a Qâdiyâni (follower of the deviant heretic, Ghulâm Ahmad) or from any other group, he has disbelieved and nullified his Belief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. To describe the Prophet (pbuh) with attributes which belong to Allâh only, such as unlimited knowledge of the unseen, as some Sufis claim. One of their poets said:<br />
&#8220;Oh (total) knower of the unseen, we resorted to you; Oh curer of the hearts, blessing upon you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. To supplicate to the Prophet (pbuh) for what only Allâh has the power to bestow, such as supplicating for victory and help, cure of illness, etc., as is happening today among the Muslims, especially among the Sufis as their poet, Al-Busairy said:<br />
&#8220;Whoever asks by the Messenger of Allâh gets victory, even if a lion meets him in the forest;<br />
Never did time impose on me a hardship and I sought his protection except that I got his protection and no harm came to me.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This conception of the station of the Prophet (pbuh) is Shirk, contradicting the unequivocal announcement of the Qur&#8217;ân:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;And there is no victory except by the help of Allâh&#8230;&#8221; (8:10)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and contradicting the order of the Prophet (pbuh):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When you ask, ask from Allâh, and when you seek help, seek the help from Allâh.&#8221; (Tirmidhi)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what should we think about those who attribute to &#8220;saints&#8221; knowledge of the unseen, or make a Nadhr (a vow to give charity or perform some other optional good deed) for their sake, or dedicate animal sacrifices to them or ask of them what may only be requested of Allâh, such as sustenance or cure of illness, or victory, etc.? No doubt, these are Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. We do not deny the miracles that appeared from the Messengers of Allâh nor those miraculous feets that came from the saints, but what we deny is making them partners with Allâh, supplicating them as we supplicate Allâh, and dedicating sacrifies to them, and undertaking a regime of optional worship for their sake. It has gotten to the point that the graves of some notable &#8220;saints&#8221; are showered with donations which are appropriated by the custodians and servants of these shrines, who then divide them among themselves, consuming people&#8217;s money under false pretenses. At the same time they are surrounded by multitudes of poor people who don&#8217;t get enough to eat for a day.<br />
One poet said: &#8220;Our living don&#8217;t even get a Dhirham (a coin of silver), while thousands and thousands go to the dead.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Not all of these shrines and graves even contain the body of a saint. But swindlers erect some of them as a means of taking the money of the gullible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, one of my fellow teachers related to me that a certain Sufi Shaikh came to his mother&#8217;s house requesting a donation in order to erect a green flag to indicate the presence of a saint on a certain street, so she gave him some money. He bought some green cloth and fixed it to a wall and started telling people, &#8220;There is a Wali (saint) here, one of the friends of Allâh. I saw him in my dream.&#8221; And thus he started collecting money. One day the government decided to widen that street, which would require removing the grave. The man who had started the whole story started telling people that they had tried to remove it, but the equipment used had broken, and some people believed him, and this rumor started circulating, which caused the government to proceed with caution. The Mufti of that country himself told me that the government called him in the middle of the night to the site of that saint&#8217;s grave. He found it surrounded by soldiers. Then the excavator was brought and the grave was dug up. The Mufti looked inside and found nothing there, and knew the whole thing was a lie and fabrication.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example, which I heard from a teacher in the Haram in Makkah: One poor man met another and they complained to each other of their poverty. Then they saw a saint&#8217;s grave which was filled with welth. One said to the other: &#8220;Come on, let&#8217;s dig up a grave and put a saint in it, and the money will start rolling in.&#8221; His friend agreed, so they set out until they came to a braying donkey. They killed it and laid it to rest in a pit, they raised a mausoleum with a dome over it. And then both of them proceeded to roll around in the dust of the grave to get the Barakat (blessing) from it. When people passing by asked them what they were doing they said: &#8220;This is the grave of the saint Hubaish bin Tubaish, who worked miracles which defy description.&#8221; People were taking in by their spell and they began laying donations before the grave as charity and to fulfill vows, until they had gathered great wealth. When they started dividing it, they got into argument and started shouting at each other, which attracted a crowd of spectators. One of the two said: &#8220;I swear to you by this saint I didn&#8217;t take anything from you.&#8221; His friend said: &#8220;You swear to me by this saint while the both of us know there is a donkey in this grave that we buried together?&#8221; The people were astonished and felt foolish due to the donations they had made as vows, and took them back after beating the two men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">from &#8220;The Pillars of Islam and Iman &#8211; and what every muslim must know about the religion&#8221;<br />

</b>Fataawaa Lajnatud-Daa&#8217;imah lil-Buhoothul `Ilmiyyah wal-Iftaa, 3/185-187<br />
Al-Istiqaamah Newsletter, Issue No. 2, Safar 1417</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">I begin my question by seeking your advice that I may benefit from you with regards to how I may increase my <em>eemaan</em> (faith?)…</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We advise you to <strong>recite the Qur&#8217;aan frequently</strong> and that you <strong>increase in your hearing</strong> of it and in your recitation of it. Reflect and consider its meaning to the best of your ability and what you do not understand of it, then ask the people of knowledge of your country about it, or write to those outside of your country from the Scholars of <em>Sunnah</em> (Prophetic guidance).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also advise you to <strong>increase in the <em>dhikr</em></strong> (remembrance) of Allaah with such remembrances and supplications that are authentically related, such as saying <em>laa ilaaha illallaah</em> (that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah), or saying <em>subhaanallaah wal-hamdulillaah wa laa ilaha illallaahu wallaahu akbar</em> (declaring Allaah free from all imperfections, praising Him and declaring that none has the right to be worshipped except Him and that He is greater), and their like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For this purpose, we urge you to refer to books such as <em>al-Kalimut-Tayyib</em> of Ibn Taymiyyah, <em>al-Waabilus-Sayyib</em> of Ibn al-Qayyim, <em>Riyaadhus-Saaliheen</em> and <em>al-Adhkaar</em> both by Imaam an-Nawawee, and their like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because the remembrance of Allaah increases <em>eemaan</em> (faith) and causes hearts to attain tranquility, as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed in the remembrance of Allaah do hearts find tranquility</span><b>.&#8221;</b><br />
[Soorah ar-Ra`d 13:28].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also <strong>preserve your five daily Prayers, your Fasting and the rest of your obligations</strong> &#8211; along with hoping in Allaah&#8217;s mercy and forgiveness and relying upon Him in all your affairs. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;The Believers are only those who, when Allaah is mentioned, feel a fear in the hearts, and when His Verses are recited to them, it increases their eemaan (faith), and they put their trust and rely upon Allaah alone. They are those who perform the Prayer and spend out of that which We have given them, they are Believers in truth. For them are grades of dignity and nobility with their Lord, and also forgiveness and generous provisions.&#8221; </span>[Soorah al-Anfaal 8:2-4]</p>

<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 1: The Religion of Islam</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam is the religion that Allah sent to Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) and made it the final and most complete religion for His slaves. Allah perfected, in this religion, the bounties that He bestowed on His salves, and accepts only Islam from them. He said, what translated means: <b>“Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) is not the father of any man among you, but he is the Messenger of Allah, and the Last (end) of the Prophets.” </b>[33:40], <b>“This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favor upon you, and have chosen Islam for you as your religion.”</b> [5:3], <b>“Truly, the religion with Allah is Islam.” </b>[3:19] and,<b> “And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers” </b>[3:85]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Allah obligated all mankind to follow Islam:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> “Say (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam): “O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allah, to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. There is none who has the right to be worshipped but He; It is He Who gives life and causes death. So believe in Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam), the Prophet who can neither read nor write, who believes in Allah and His Words (this Qur’aan, the Torah and the Gospel), and follow him so that you may be guided”</b> [7:158]. Abu Hurayrah (radhi allahu anhu) reported that the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) said, what translated means, <b>“By Whom the soul of Muhammad is in His Hand! No member of this nation, no Jew or Christian, hears of me and does not believe in what I was sent with, but he will be of the people of the Fire.”</b> [Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Believing in the Messenger means </b> believing in what was revealed to him, coupled with acceptance and submission; without them the belief is not sufficient. This is why Abu Talib, the Prophet’s (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) uncle, was not a believer in the Messenger, although he believed in what he was sent with and confirmed that Islam was the best religion, (but without acceptance or adherence to Islam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Islam contains all of what brings benefit</b>, which was also contained, in previous religions. Islam, however, is suitable for implementation anytime, anywhere and by any nation. Allah said to His Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam), what translated means, <b>“And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam)) the Book (this Qur’aan) in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it and dominant over it”</b> [5:48]. The meaning of “suitable for implementation at anytime, anywhere and by any nation,” is that Islam brings only benefit to mankind, whenever and wherever it is implemented. Islam is not under the control, and thus is not to be altered by, any nation living at any given time at any given place, as some people would want it to be.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Islam is the religion of truth.</b> It is the religion that Allah guaranteed aid and dominance for whoever firmly adheres by it. He said, what translated means, <b>“It is He who has sent His Messenger (Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) with guidance and the Religion of Truth (Islam), to make it superior over all religions even though the disbelievers hate it.” [9:33] </b>and,<b> “Allah has promised those among you who believe, and do righteous, good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers) in the earth, as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practice their religion, which He has chosen for them (Islam). And He will surely give them in exchange a safe security after their fear (provided) they (the believers) worship Me and do not associate anything (in worship) with Me. But whoever disbelieved after this, they are the rebellious (disobedient to Allah).”</b> [24:55].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Islam contains belief and Law: </b> It is a complete religion, both in its belief and in its Law. It demands from its followers the following:<br />
1 Believing in Taw’hid (Oneness) of Allah and disbelieving in Shirk (polytheism).<br />
2. Being truthful and not lying.<br />
3. Being just, that is to deal comparable things with equality, and abandoning injustice.<br />
4. Being honest and abandoning treachery.<br />
5. Preserving one’s promises and contracts and not breaking them.<br />
6. Being dutifully good to one’s parents and not cutting ties of kinship.<br />
7. Keeping relations with relatives and not cutting them.<br />
8. Being good with neighbors and not harming them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In general, Islam orders Muslims to have the best possible conduct and forbids all bad behavior. It requires Muslims to enjoin every righteous deed and avoid every evil deed. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“Verily, Allah enjoins justice, Al-I&#8217;hsan (excellence in religion), giving (help) to kith and kin, and forbids all evil (deeds), Al-Munkar (all that is prohibited) and injustice. He admonishes you, that you may take head)’</b> [16:90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a name="2"></a></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a>Chapter 2: The Pillars of Islam and Eeman</a></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The Pillars of Islam are the cornerstones on which Islam is built.</b> There are five pillars of Islam. They are mentioned in the Hadeeth of ibn Omar (radiyallaahu anhuma), that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) said, what translated means, ‘Islam is built around five (pillars):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1. </b>The testimony that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) is His slave and Messenger,<br />
<b>2.</b> To establish prayer,<br />
<b>3.</b> To give Zakaat (obligatory charity),<br />
<b>4.</b> To fast in Ramadhan, and,<br />
<b>5.</b> To perform Hajj (pilgrimage).” [Saheeh Muslim and Saheeh al-Bukharee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 1. The Shahadah (the testimony) </b> that there is none worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) is His slave and Messenger, requires solid belief, in the heart, in it. This belief must also be confirmed by the tongue. It is called Shahadah (testimony) to show that when a believer believes in it, his belief is as solid as if he is an eyewitness. This Shahadah is one cornerstone, although it contains many aspects that must be taken as belief. This testimony (comprised of two testimonies as is apparent), is considered one cornerstone, either because it contains testifying that Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) is only a conveyer of the Message from Allah and His slave and Messenger, thus completing the testimony that Allah is One or because these two testimonies together are the reason behind the acceptance of deeds by Allah. Deeds are neither valid nor accepted unless they are done with sincerity for the sake of Allah alone, and this is called “Ikhlas,” and through following the way of the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Realizing the essence of this testimony, that there is no god except Allah, is a result of Ikhlas (sincerity) to Allah. Realizing the essence of testifying that Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) is His slave and Messenger, comes as a result of following the Messenger of Allah. This magnificent testimony leads to many sweet results. It frees the hearts and souls from being enslaved to the creation and from following other than the Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2. Establishing the prayers </b> means to worship Allah by praying to Him. One must preserve the prayers by establishing them on time and in the best manner, as taught by the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam). Rewards for establishing the prayers include tranquility and happiness that are felt in the heart. Prayer also leads one to abandoning evil deeds and behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 3. Paying Zakat </b> is worshipping Allah by paying the amount of charity obligated on the ones who have enough money or possessions that require paying Zakat. Paying the required Zakat leads to cleansing the heart from the evil of misery. It also fulfills the needs of Islam and Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 4. Fasting Ramadhan</b> contains worshipping Allah by fasting during the days of this month, by not eating or drinking from dawn to sunset. Fasting trains the souls to abandon what is preferred and desired, seeking the pleasure of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 5. Performing Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah)</b> is worshipping Allah by visiting the Holy House to perform the rituals of Hajj. Hajj trains the souls to spend time and physical effort, seeking to obey Allah. This is why Hajj is considered a type of Jihad (struggle).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> These fruits of performing the pillars of Islam</b>, along with many others we did not mention, make the Muslim nation pure and clean. They lead the nation to preserving the religion of Truth and dealing with the creation in the best manners of justice and truthfulness. All other acts of the religion depend on how well these pillars are preserved. The Ummah (Muslim nation) can reach success as long as its members preserve the religion. This Ummah will not reach the desired success as long as the religion is not fully respected and preserved.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Whoever wants to be certain of the above-mentioned facts</b>, let him read the following Ayat (verses), “And if the people of the towns had believed and had piety, certainly, We should have opened for them blessings form the heaven and the earth, but they belied (the Messengers). So We took them (with punishment) for what they used to earn (of evil deeds). Did the people of the towns then feel secure against the coming of Our punishment by night while they were asleep? Or, did the people of the towns then feel secure against the coming of Our punishment in the forenoon while they play? Did they then feel secure against the plot of Allah? None feels secure form the plot of Allah except the people who are lost” [7:96-99]. Let him also read the history of previous nations, which gives valuable lessons for whoever is in possession of a mind that comprehends and is rightly guided. This history is a light for those whose hearts are not blocked from the truth. All our dependence is on Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Pillars of Islamic Belief<br />
</b> Islam, as we explained before, is belief and Laws. We mentioned some pillars of the Laws. These pillars are the basis of Islamic Law. As for the Islamic ‘Aqeedah (creed), its pillars are: Believing in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day and the good or bad that Qadar (predestination) brings. These pillars are mentioned in the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said, what translated means, <b>“Righteousness is not that you (only) turn your faces towards the East and (or) the West (in prayers); but righteousness is (the quality) of the one who believes in Allah, the Last Day, the Angels, the Book and the Prophets” </b>[2:177], and with regards to Qadar, <b>“Verily, We have created all things with Qadar. And Our Commandment is but one, as the twinkling of an eye.” </b>[54:49].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Sunnah, the Messenger of Allah said, in answer to Gibreel when he asked him about Iman (belief), <b>“Iman is to believe in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, and to believe in the Qadar and what it brings of good or bad.” </b>[ Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a name="3"></a></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a>Chapter 3: The Belief in Allah</a></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 1 &#8211; Belief In Allah’s Existence Allah’s existence is affirmed through Fitrah </b>(the innate purity that Allah creates in every human being), the Mind, the Shari’ah (Islamic Law) and the senses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> a) As for the Fitrah,</b> we say the following: Allah created the belief in Him in every human being. Mankind needs not to be taught this belief or think about how to possess it. However, the ones who have this Fitrah corrupted will not benefit from it. The Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) said, what translated means, <b>“Every newly born will be born having Fitrah. However, his parents will either convert him to Judaism, Christianity or Majocism (fire worshipping).” </b>[Saheeh al-Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> b) The Human Mind </b> must be used to prove the existence of Allah. All this creation, of old and new, must have a Creator who invented and started it. This creation could not have come to existence on its own or by chance. It could not have created itself, because it did not exist beforehand. Therefore, how can it create? Also, the creation could not have been started by accident or chance. Everything that exists must have a Creator who brought it into existence. Creation is magnificent in organization, coherent and correlated in its existence. There is a reason and originator behind every act. All this nullifies the saying that this entire universe was started by chance. What was started by chance cannot be organized in its form because it did not have any organization before it was formed. What makes what was created by chance to be this organized? If all this creation neither could have created itself nor was it created by chance, then it must have an Originator, Allah, the Lord of the worlds. Allah mentioned this reasoning in the Quran, <b>“Were they created by nothing, or were they themselves the creators?”</b> [52:35].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah means that men were neither created without a Creator nor did they create themselves. Therefore, Allah is the One who created them. This is why when Jubair ibn Mut’im (radiyallaahu anhu) heard the Messenger (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) recite this Surah until he reached, <b>“Were they created by nothing, or were they themselves the creators? Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Nay, but they have no firm belief. Or are with them the Treasures of your Lord? Or are they the tyrants with authority to do as they like?”</b> [52:35-37],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jubair, a disbeliever then, said, <b>“My heart almost flew (from the power of this reasoning mentioned in the Surah). This was the first time that Iman entered my heart.”</b> [Saheeh al-Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> c) &#8211; As for the Shari’ah</b>, all divine religions testify to the fact that Allah created the world. All Laws that were sent with these divine and revealed religions contain what benefits mankind. This is evidence to the existence of a Wise and All-Knowing Lord Who knows what brings benefit to His creation, All divinely-revealed religions describe a universe that is self evident to the existence and ability of Allah, Who Creates what He Will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> d) &#8211; Also, the senses must be used</b> to prove the existence of Allah. We know that Allah accepts the supplication from whoever seek His aid and help, and that He brings them the benefits that they desire. This is clear evidence to the existence of Allah, who said, what translated means, <b>“And (remember) Noah, when he cried (to Us) aforetime We listened to his invocation.” </b>[21:76] and, <b>“(Remember) when you sought help from your Lord and He answered you?”</b> [8:9].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas ibn Malik (radhi allahu anhu) said, “An Arabian (Bedouin) man entered (the Masjid) on Friday while the Prophet was delivering the speech. He said: ‘O Messenger of Allah! (Our) possessions are destroyed, (our) children are hungry. Ask Allah for us.’ He (the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) raised his hands in supplication (to Allah). All of a sudden, mountain-like clouds were formed. He did not descend from his Minbar (the podium) until I saw rain falling through his beard. On the second Friday, this Arabian man, or someone else, stood up and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam), Buildings have collapsed and possessions are flooded. Ask Allah for us.’ He (the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) raised his hands and said: <b>‘O my Lord! Around us and not on us.’</b> Wherever he pointed to an area (of the sky), they (the clouds) dispersed.” [Saheeh al-Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah’s acceptance of supplication has been and still is a known matter until today. It is given to those who are true in their seeking refuge in Allah and perform supplication in the correct manner to ensure its acceptance. Also, there are the signs that Allah gave His Prophets, which are called miracles. People witnessed or heard these miracles. They are clear evidence that the One who sent the Messengers exists, and He is Allah the All Mighty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These miracles are activities that are beyond the capability of mankind. Allah gave them to His Messengers as a way of aiding them and giving them victory. An example of these miracles is the sign given of Moses. Allah ordered him to strike the sea with his stick, and the sea parted into twelve separate pads between mountains of water on each side of these parts, <b>“Then We inspired Moses (saying): “Strike the sea with your stick. And it parted, and each separated part (of that sea water) became like the huge, firm mass of a mountain.” [26:63]. Another example is the miracle of Jesus. He was given the power by Allah to raise the dead from their graves and back into life. Allah said about him, what translated means, “And I bring the dead to life by Allah’s leave.”</b> [3:49] and, <b>“And when you (O Jesus) brought forth the dead by My Permission.”</b> [5:110]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A third example is the miracle Muhammad (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) performed. His tribe, Quraysh, asked him to perform a miracle. He pointed to the moon and it separated into two parts while his people were witnessing the incident. Allah said about this miracle, what translated means, <b>“The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder. And if they see a sign, they turn away, and say: “This is continuous magic.”</b> [54:1-2].[4] All these miracles, that Allah gave to His Messengers as an aid and victory and that were witnessed by their nations, are proof that Allah exists.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2 &#8211; Belief In Allah’s Lordship</b> This means to believe that Allah is the Lord, alone, and that He has no partners or helpers. The Rabb (Lord) is the One who Creates and Commands. There is no creator except Allah and there is no owner of the universe except Him. The Commandment and the Control is His. He said, what translated means, <b>“Surely, His is the Creation and commandment.”</b> [7:54] and, <b>“Such is Allah your Lord; His is the Kingdom. And those whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmir (the membrane over the date-stone).&#8221;</b> [35:13]. Only a few people rejected Allah’s Lordship. These are the arrogant ones who deny what they believe deep in their hearts. This happened from Pharaoh, when he said to his people, as was mentioned in the Qur’aan, <b>“I am your lord, most high.”</b> [79:24] and, <b>“O chiefs! I know not that you have a god other than me!”</b> [28:38].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, what he said was not his true belief. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“And they belied them (Our Signs) wrongfully and arrogantly, though their own selves were convinced thereof” </b>[27:14].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Moses said to Pharaoh, as was mentioned in the Quran, <b>”Verily, you know that these Signs have been sent down by none but the Lord of the heavens and the earth as clear (evidences of His Oneness and Might). And I think you are, indeed, O Pharaoh, doomed to destruction.”</b> [17:102]. The Arab disbelievers of old used to confirm Allah’s Lordship, although they associated others with Him in worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said, what translated means, <b>“Say: “Whose is the earth and whosoever is therein? If you know!” They will say: “It is Allah’s!” Say: “Will you not then remember?” Say: “Who is the Lord of the seven heavens and the Lord of the Great Throne?” They will say: “Allah.” Say: “Will you not then fear Allah?” Say: “In Whose Hands is the sovereignty of everything? And He protects (all), while against Whom there is no protector, if you know?” They will say: “(All this belongs) to Allah.” Say: “How then are you deceived and turn away from the truth?)&#8221;</b> [23:84-89],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed if you ask them: <b>“Who has created the heavens and the earth?” They will surely say: “The All-Mighty, the All-Knower created them.” </b>[43:9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and, <b> “And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: “Allah.” How then are they turned away (from His worship)”</b> [43:87].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Allah’s order comprises of both, His running of the universe and the Commandment.</b> He is the One who controls the creation and the One who does what He will, according to His Wisdom. He is also the One who gives the Commandment organizing aspects of worship and dealings, according to His Wisdom. Whoever takes anyone, besides Allah, to be the one who commands acts of worship or types of dealings, will have committed Shirk (disbelief, association in worship) with Allah. This act negates Iman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 3 &#8211; The Belief That He Is the ILAH: </b> Allah is the Ilah, meaning He is the Worshipped One Who has no partners. This Ilah is worshipped with love and reverence. He said, what translated means, <b>“And your Lord is One Lord, there is none who has the right to be worshipped but He, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.”</b> [2:163]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and, <b> “Allah bears witness that none has the right to be worshipped but He, and the Angels, and those having knowledge (also give this witness); (He is always) maintaining His creation in Justice, none has the right to be worshipped but He, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.” </b>[3:18].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All things that are taken as gods, besides Allah, are false gods, <b>“That is because Allah is the Truth (the Only True God), and what they (the disbelievers) invoke besides Him, it is falsehood. And verily, Allah is the Most High, the Most Great.”</b> [22:62].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To call these things “gods,” does not make them gods. Allah said about some idols, Al-Lat, Al-’Uzzaa and Manat, <b>“They are but names which you have named, you and your fathers, for which Allah has sent down no authority&#8221; </b>[53:23].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yousef (Joseph) said to his two companions in jail, as was mentioned in the Quran, <b> “Are many different lords (gods) better or Allah the One, the Irresistible? You do not worship beside Him but only names, which you have forged, you and your fathers, for which Allah has sent down no authority.”</b> [12:39-40].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Messengers used to say to their nations, <b>“Worship Allah! You have no other God but Him.” </b>[23:23]. However, the disbelievers refused to accept this call. They took others as gods besides Allah. They worshipped them besides Allah, calling them when aid and help were needed. Allah refuted the disbelievers in their taking these idols as gods besides Him, using two logical arguments:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The first argument:</b> These idols, that were taken by the disbelievers as gods, do not have any attributes that qualify them to be gods. These false gods were created and do not create. They can neither bring about benefit for whoever worships them, nor can they fend harm off. They cannot give life or take it away. They neither own nor are they partners in the kingdom of the heavens and earth. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“Yet, they have taken besides Him other gods that created nothing but are themselves created, and possess neither hurt nor benefit for themselves, and possess no power (of causing) death, nor (of giving) life, nor of raising the dead)&#8221;</b> [25:3],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> “Say (O Muhammad): ‘Call upon those whom you asset (to be associate gods) besides Allah, they possess not even the weight of an atom, either in the heavens or on the earth, nor they have any share in either, nor is there for Him any supporter from among them.” </b> [34:22-23] and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> “Do they attribute as partners to Allah those who created nothing but they themselves are created? No help can they give them, nor can they help themselves.”</b> [7:191-192].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this is the case with false gods, then taking them as gods is a true misguidance and the lowest of all acts. The second argument: The Mushrikeen (polytheists) are among those who confirmed that Allah, alone, is the Lord, the Creator, the One Who Has the ownership of everything and the One Who gives protection and no one can give protection to anyone from His Might. This confirmation requires from these disbelievers to worship Allah alone. He said, what translated means, <b>“O Mankind! Worship your Lord (Allah), Who created you and those who were before you so that you may become among the pious. Who has made the earth a resting place for you, and the sky as a canopy, and sent down rain from the sky and brought forth therewith fruits as a provision for you. Then do not set up rivals unto Allah (in worship) while you know (that He Alone has the right to be worshipped).”</b> [2:21-22],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> “And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: “Allah&#8221;.</b> <b>How then are they turned away (from His worship)?” </b>[43:87]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and, <b> “Say (O Muhammad): “Who provides for you from the sky and from the earth? Or who owns hearing and sight? And who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living? And who disposes the affairs?” They will say: ‘Allah.” “Say: “Will you not then be afraid of Allah’s punishment?” Such is Allah, your Lord in truth. So after the Truth, what else can there be, save error? How then are you mined away?</b> [10:31-32].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 4 &#8211; The Belief In Allah’s Names and Attributes. </b> This belief requires accepting whatever Allah described of Himself in His Book or in the Sunnah of His Messenger (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam). The Names and Attributes must be accepted without alteration <b> [1]</b>, rejection <b> [2]</b>, and precise description of their true nature or equating them with attributes of the creation. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allah, so call on Him by them, and leave the company of those who deny His Names. They will be requited for what they used to do.”</b> [7:180],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> “His is the highest description in the heavens and in the earth. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.” </b> [30:27] and, <b>“There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All Seer.”</b> [42:11].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Two groups have fallen into misguidance concerning this matter:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> One of them is Al-Mu’attilah (the refuters). </b> This group rejected the Names and Attributes, or some of them, claiming that to accept them is to equate Allah with His creation. This claim is false for many reasons following are two of them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 1. </b> This claim leads to false conclusions that Allah’s Words are in Opposition to each other. Allah is the One who confirmed these Names and Attributes and denied that there is anything that resembles Him. If confirming these Names and Attributes leads to equating Allah with the creation, then this will lead to the conclusion that Allah’s Words are full of discrepancies and refute each other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2.</b> For two things to have an attribute of some kind, does not mean that they are equal or look-likes. One can witness two persons who are both called “a human who hears, sees and speaks.” However, this description of both does not mean that they are of equal capabilities in their hearing, sight or speech. One can also see that animals have hands, legs and eyes. However, this does not mean that animals are equal in every respect with regards to their hands, legs and eyes. If disparity is this wide between that which creation possess of attributes or names, then the disparity between the Creator and creation is even greater and more evident.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The second misguided group is called “Al- Mushabbihah.”</b> They confirmed the Names and the Attributes. Yet, they equated them with the names and attributes of the creation. They claimed that this is what the Texts mean. They claimed that Allah reveals to His slaves what they can comprehend. This claim is false for many reasons, some of them are: Allah’s resemblance with His creation is false and is refuted with the mind and the Laws of Shari’ah. Texts of the Qur’aan and Sunnah cannot lead to falsehood in their meanings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah revealed what His slaves can understand of the general meaning. However, the true nature of what these meanings are like is a knowledge that only Allah possesses, especially with regards to the true nature of His Names and Attributes. Allah confirmed that He is the All-Hearer. Hearing means to comprehend sounds. However, the true nature of Allah’s Hearing is unknown. Creation vary in their hearing capability. The difference between Allah’s Hearing and the hearing of creation is even greater and more evident. Also, Allah confirmed that He Istawa (Mounted or Settled) on His Throne. To mount and settle on a throne is known in the general meaning of the word “mounted,” or “settled.” The true nature of Allah’s mounting on His Throne is unknown. Mounting on something varies with regards to different creation. To mount on a chair is unlike mounting on a wild camel. If Istiwaa’ is this different between creation, then how can the Istiwaa’ of Allah be compared to the Istiwaa’ of creation? The difference between them is greater and more evident. Benefits of Believing in Allah, in the way described above, leads to many benefits for the believers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 1. </b>To truly realize the Taw’hid of Allah, by depending only on Him and hoping in, fearing and worshipping Him alone.<br />
<b>2.</b> To prefect one’s love and reverence of Allah, and according to His Might as described by His Most-Beautiful Names and Most-High Attributes.<br />
<b>3.</b> To truly give one’s worship to Allah, by adhering to His Commandments and abandoning His Prohibitions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> FOOTNOTES</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> [1]</b> TAAWEEL &#8211; Introducing change in a statement, leaving out the meaning understood by it, expressing and accepting such a meaning which the words may indicate in a doubtful sense. In the present context (i.e. Attributes of Allaah) it means rejecting the true meaning of Attributes of Allaah, as understood by the companions (radiyallaahu anhum), and giving preferences to one own understanding.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> [2]</b> TA’TEEL (Rejecting,Leaving or Vacating). It means negating the Attributes of Allaah and denying them with His Self. The difference between Taqweel and Ta’teel is that in the latter case the real meaning is denied which is proved by the Qur&#8217;aan and the Hadith. While in Tahreef the explanation of the text is done with such meanings that are false and the word does not prove them. So Ta’teel includes Tahreef. Wherever there is Tahreef, Ta’teel is certainly there, but the reverse is not true. If someone tries to prove the false meaning and denies the real meaning, he is committing both Ta’teel and Tahreef</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a name="4"></a></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a>Chapter 4: Belief In The Angels</a></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The Angels are a matter of the unseen. </b> They are created by Allah and they worship Him. They have no attributes that qualify them to be gods or lords. Allah created them from light, and He bestowed on them the bounty of obeying Him at all times. He gave them the power to carry and implement His orders, <b>“And those who are near Him (the angels) are not too proud to worship Him, nor are they weary (of His worship). They glorify His praises night and day, (and) they never slacken (to do so).”</b> [21:19-20]. They are so numerous that only Allah can count their numbers. Anas (radiyallaahu anhu) said, while narrating the story of the Prophet’s (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) ascension to heaven, that Al-Bait Al-Ma’amoor (the House in heaven that is always inhabited. It is, for the inhabitants of heaven, like the Kaa’bah for the people of earth) was raised for the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) in heaven so he can see it. Each day, seventy thousand Angels pray in this House, and when they exit from it, they will never get back into it (this shows how numerous the angels are).[Saheeh al-Bukharee and Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Belief In The Angels Has three Parts</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Belief in their existence.<br />
Belief in what we were told of their names, such as Jibreel, and also belief in other angels whom we were not informed of their names.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2. Belief in what we were told of their attributes.</b> The example to this is the description of Jibreel. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) told us that he saw Jibreel in the shape that Allah created him, having six hundred wings and larger than the horizon. The angels may change their shapes, by the order of Allah. They may take the shape of men. Allah sent Jibreel to Maryam (Mary) and he came to her in the shape of a man. He was also sent to Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam), while he was sitting down with his companions, in the shape of a man, wearing very white clothes with very dark hair, a stranger to the companions, yet no evidence of traveling was apparent on him. He sat next to the Prophet and laid his knees next to the Prophet’s knees and put his hands on the Prophet’s thighs. He asked the Prophet about Islam, Iman, Ih’san (excellence in the religion) and the Last Hour and its signs. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) answered him. Then, Jibreel left. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) said to his companions, <b> “This was Jibreel, He came to you to teach you your religion.” </b>[Saheeh Muslim popularly known as the HADEETH of JIBREEL]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Allah sent the angels to Ibrahim (Abraham) and Lut in the shape of men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Belief in the tasks that they perform, by the order of Allah.</b> They praise Allah and worship him at all times without the slightest boredom or fatigue. Some angels may have special tasks to fulfill, a few have been mentioned below;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jibreel is the honorable angel, whom Allah sends down with revelation to the Prophets and Messengers. Mikaeel is the angel who is controlling rain and Vegetation by the order of Allah. Israfeel is the angel who must blow in the Horn when the Hour (Last Day) has started and when it is time to resurrect the dead. An angel is the keeper and supervisor of Hell. The Angel of death captures the souls at death. There are angels who supervise fetuses in the wombs. When a fetus is four months old, Allah sends down an angel and orders him to record the fetus’s sustenance, maximum age, deeds and if miserable (destined to Hell) or happy (destined to Paradise). There are angels who record deeds of mankind. They have a record of everyone’s deeds. There are two angels for each person, one to the right and the other to the left. There are other angels who question the dead when they are in their graves. Two angels come to all dead persons and ask each one of them about the Lord he worshipped, the religion he followed and the Messenger he obeyed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Benefits of Believing In The Angels<br />
1.</b> Knowing Allah’s Might, Strength and Power. All the strength of creation is a sign of the Strength of the Creator.<br />
<b>2.</b> Thanking Allah because He takes care of mankind. He appointed angels to protect them, record their deeds and other beneficial tasks.<br />
<b>3.</b> Loving the angels because they are true worshippers of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Some misguided people reject that the angels exist in a physical form. </b>They claim that the angels are the potential for good that creation possesses. This is a direct rejection to the Book of Allah, the Sunnah of His Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) and the Ijmaa’ (consensus) of Muslims. Allah said, what translated means: <b>“All the praises and thanks be to Allah, the (Only) Originator of the heavens and the earth, Who made the Angels messengers with wings, two or three or four).&#8221; </b>[35:1], <b>“And if you could see when the angels take away the souls of those who disbelieve (at death), they smite their faces and their backs.”</b> [8:50], <b>“And if you could but see when the unjust (disbelievers) are in the agonies of death, while the angels are stretching forth their hands (saying): “Deliver your souls.”</b> [6:93], <b>“Until when fear is banished from their (the angels’) hearts, they (the angels) say: “What is that your Lord has said?” They say: “The Truth. “And He is the Most High, the Most Great” [34:23] and, “And angels shall enter unto them from every gate (saying): ‘Peace be upon you for that you preserved in patience! Excellent indeed is the final Home (</b><b>Paradise).”</b> [13:23-24].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) said, what translated means, <b>“When Allah likes a slave, He calls on Jibreel, saying: ‘Allah loves so and so (person), therefore, love him.’ Then, Gibreal loves him. Afterwards, Jibreel calls on the inhabitants of heaven, saying: ‘Allah loves so and so (person), therefore, love him.’ Then, the people of heaven love him. Afterwards acceptance (among the community of believers) will be granted for him in earth.”[3] and, “When the day of Friday comes, there stand angels at each of the Masjid’s doors. They record the first then the next (one to come to the Masjid). When the Imam sits down (waiting for the call to prayer to end so he can start the speech), they close the books and they come to listen to the Thikr (the remembrance of Allah contained in the Friday speech).”</b> [Saheeh al-Bukharee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above texts are clear in their meaning that the angels have physical forms and are not a state of the mind, as the misguided claim. The true meaning of these texts, which states that the angels exist in a physical form, is accepted by the entire Ummah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a name="5"></a></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a>Chapter 5: Belief In The Books</a></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kutub (books) is plural for Kitab (a book). They are called Kutub because they are written (maktoob). Books, here means the Books that Allah sent down to His Messengers as a mercy and guidance for mankind. These Books are designed to lead mankind to what brings them happiness in this life and in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> There are four aspects of believing in the Books<br />
1.</b> To believe that they are truly sent down by Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>2.</b> To believe in the Books that mankind were informed of, like the Qur’aan, sent down to Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam), the Torah, sent down to Moses, the Injeel (the Gospel), sent down to Jesus and the Zaboor (the Psalms), sent down to David. We also believe in the other Books, sent down by Allah, even though we do not know their names.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>3.</b> To believe in whatever the Books contained, like whatever is contained in the Qur’aan and sections of previous Books that have not been corrupted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>4.</b> To implement the Commandments contained in these Books, unless Allah commanded to the contrary through Naskh (over ruling). We must accept whatever these Books contained of Commandments, even if we do not know the wisdom behind them. All previous Books were over-ruled by the Qur’aan. Allah said, what translated means, “And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad) the Book (this Qur’aan) in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it and dominant over it.” [5:48]. This means that the Qur’aan is dominant over all other Books. Therefore, no Commandment contained in other than the Qur’aan can be implemented unless it is in agreement with the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Benefits Of Believing In The Books<br />
1.</b> Knowing that Allah takes care of His slaves by sending down Books for their guidance.<br />
<b>2.</b> Knowing Allah’s Wisdom in whatever He commands. He commanded each nation with what is suitable for them, <b>“To each among you, We have prescribed a Law and a </b><b> Clear Way.” </b> [5:48].<br />
<b>3.</b> Thanking Allah for His bounties, because He sent down these Books to lead mankind to guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a name="6"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a>Chapter 6: Belief In the Messengers</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The Messengers are sent to deliver a Message. </b> They are the ones to whom Allah has sent down revelation and who conveys His Law to mankind. Allah ordered them to deliver these Messages.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The first Messenger to be sent was Noah and the last one was Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam). </b> Allah said, what translated means, <b>“Verily, We have inspired you (O Muhammad) as We inspired Noah and the Prophets after him.”</b> [4:163]. Anas ibn Malik (radiyallaahu anhu) narrated that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) said, during his Hadeeth about Shafa’ah (the right of intercession on mankind’s behalf that Allah grants to His Messenger on the Last Day), “Mankind come to Adam to intercede on their behalf but he declines, saying: <b>‘Go to Noah, the First Messenger that Allah sent&#8230;” </b>[Saheeh al-Bukharee] Also, Allah said, what translated means, <b>“Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) is not the father of any man among you, but he is the Messenger of Allah, and the Last (end) of Prophets.”</b> [33:40].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Allah sent Messengers to every nation and provided them with Laws that their nations must follow. </b> Some Messengers were sent to revive a Message of a previous Messenger. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“And verily, We have sent among every nation a Messenger (proclaiming): “Worship Allah (alone), and avoid all Taghut (false deities).”</b> [16:36], <b>“And there never was a nation but a warner had passed among them).&#8221;</b> [35:24] and, <b>“Verily, We did send down the Torah (to Moses), therein was guidance and light, by which the Prophets, who submitted themselves to Allah’s will, judged the Jews.”</b> [5:44].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The Messengers are only humans and they do not possess any attributes that qualify them to be gods. </b> Allah described His Messenger, Muhammad (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam), the master of all Messengers and the best of mankind, saying, what translated means, <b>“Say (O Muhammad (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam): “I possess no power of benefit or harm to myself except as Allah will. If I had the knowledge of the Unseen, I should have secured for myself an abundance of wealth, and no evil should have touched me. I am but a warner, and a bringer of glad tidings unto people who believe.”</b> [7:188] and, <b>“Say (O Muhammad):</b> <b>“It is not in my power to cause you harm, or to bring you to the Right Path.” Say: (O Muhammad): “None can protect me from Allah ‘s punishment (if I were to disobey Him), nor should I find refuge except in Him.”</b> [72:21].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messengers are only humans. They get sick and they die, they need to eat and drink and they have other human needs. Abraham described his Lord, saying, as was mentioned in the Qur’aan, <b>“And it is He Who feeds me and gives me to drink And when I am ill, it is He Who cures me; And Who will cause me to die, and then will bring me to life (again).”</b> [26: 79-81]. Also, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) said, what translated means, <b>“I am only human, just like you, I forget as you forget, therefore, when I forget, remind me.”</b> [Saheeh al-Bukharee and Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Allah described the Messengers, while praising them, that they reached the highest attainable degrees in worshipping Him.</b> He said about Noah, what translated means, <b>“Verily, he was a grateful slave.”</b> [17:3], and about Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam), <b>“Blessed be He Who sent down the Criterion (of right and wrong, this Qur’aan) to His slave (Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) that he may be a Warner to the ‘Alamin (Mankind and the Jinn).”</b> [25:1], and about Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, <b>“And remember Our slaves, Abraham Isaac and Jacob, (all) owners of strength (in worshipping Us) and (also) of religious understanding. Verily, We did choose them by granting them the Remembrance of the home (in the Hereafter). And they are in Our Sight, verily, of the </b><b> Chosen and the Best.”</b> [38:45-47], and about Jesus, <b>“He was not more than a slave. We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example to the Children of </b><b> Israel.”</b> [43:59].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Belief In The Messengers Has Four Parts</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1.</b> To believe that the Messages are truly from Allah. Whoever disbelieves in one Messenger, will have disbelieved in all Messengers. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“The people of Noah belied the Messengers.”</b> [26:105]. Allah considered the people of Noah disbelievers in all Messengers, although they only disbelieved in one Messenger. Therefore, the Christians, who disbelieve in Muhammad (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) and do not follow him, are disbelievers in Jesus, the Son of Mary. Jesus gave the glad tidings of the coming of Muhammad (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) to the Christians. This glad tidings will be of no benefit to the Christians if they do not follow Muhammad (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) to guidance and the Straight Path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2.</b> To believe in the Messengers whom we were told about, like Muhammad (sallallaau alaihi wa-sallam), Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Noah (alaihum as-salam). These are the five strongest Messengers. Allah mentioned them in two verses of the Qur’aan, <b>“And (remember) when We took from the Prophets their Covenant, and form you (O Muhammad (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam)), and from Noah, Abraham, Moses and Jesus, son of Mary.”</b> [33:7] and, <b>“He (Allah) has ordained for you the same Religion (Islam) which He ordained for Noah, and that which We have inspired in you (O Muhammad (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam)), and that which We ordained for Abraham, Moses and Jesus, saying you should establish Religion (by implementing the Commandments) and make no divisions in it.”</b> [42:13]. We must also believe in all other Messengers and Prophets whom their names were not mentioned to us, <b>“And, indeed We have sent Messengers before you (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam)), of them some We have related to you their story and some We have not related to you their story.” </b>[40:78].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 3.</b> To believe in all what the Messengers have conveyed to us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 4. </b>To implement the Laws of the Messenger who was sent to us, Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam), the final Messenger. Allah sent Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) to all mankind, <b>“But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam)) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.”</b> [4:65].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Benefits Of Believing In The Messengers</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1.</b> Knowing how Allah takes care of His slaves by sending them Messengers to guide them to His Path. The Messengers teach their nations how to worship Allah, because the human mind cannot know how Allah should be worshipped without guidance from Him.<br />
<b>2.</b> Thanking Allah for this great bounty.<br />
<b>3.</b> Dutifully loving, respecting and praising the Messengers of Allah. They are Allah’s Messengers; they worshipped Him, conveyed His Message and gave the best advice to His slaves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Many rebellious people rejected their Messengers, claiming that Allah’s Messengers cannot be human.</b> Allah mentioned this claim and refuted it, <b>“And nothing prevented men from believing when the Guidance came to them, except that they said: “Has Allah sent a man as (His) Messenger?” Say: “If there were on the earth, angels walking about, in peace and security, We should certainly have sent down for them from the heaven an angel as a Messenger.””</b> [17:94- 95]. Allah refuted this claim, saying that the Messengers must be sent from among humans, because they are sent to the people of earth, who are humans. If the inhabitants of earth were angels, then Allah would have sent Messengers from among the angels to them. Allah mentioned what the disbelievers in the Messengers said, <b>“You are no more than, human beings like us! You wish to turn us away from what our fathers used to worship. Then bring us a clear authority (a clear sign that supports what you say).” Their Messengers said to them: “We are no more than human beings like you, but Allah bestows His grace to whom He will of His salves. it is not ours to bring you an authority (proof) except by the permission of Allah.”</b> [14:10-11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a name="7"></a></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a>Chapter 7: Belief In the Last Day</a></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Last Day is the Day when mankind will be resurrected to be asked about their deeds and receive reward or punishment for them. It is called “the Last Day,” because it is the last day, no day after that. Afterwards, people of Paradise will permanently reside and take their places in it, and people of Hell will permanently reside and take their places in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Belief In The Last Day Has Three Parts</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. To believe in the Resurrection. &#8211; The Resurrection happens when the Horn will be blown for the second time. Afterwards, mankind will be resurrected to face the questioning by the Lord of the worlds. They will neither be wearing shoes nor circumcised, and they will be naked and visible to others on this state, (however, everyone will be absolutely preoccupied with what they are going to face and the hardship of the Day of Resurrection). Allah said, what translated means, <b>“As We began the first creation, We shall repeat it, (it is) a promise binding upon Us. Truly, We shall do it.&#8221; </b>[21:104].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Resurrection is a true event that the Qur’aan, the Sunnah and the consensus of Muslims have confirmed. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“After that, surely you will die. Then (again), surely, you will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection.”</b> [23:15-16]. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) said, what translated means, <b>“On the Day of Resurrection, Mankind wilt be resurrected while they are bear-footed and naked.”</b> [Saheeh al-Bukharee and Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslims are unanimous on confirming the Day of Resurrection. This is the wisdom of Allah, for He decreed that creation will have a day of reckoning for their deeds after He sent them Messengers to inform them of His Commandments. He said, what translated means, <b>“Did you think that We had created you in play (without any purpose), and that you would not be brought back to Us?”</b> [23:115] and, <b>“Verily, He Who has given you (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam)) the Qur’aan will surely bring you back to the Ma’ad (place of return).”</b> [28:85].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2. To believe in the Reckoning</b> &#8211; In the Last Day, the slave will be rewarded or punished for his deeds. This fact was also confirmed by the Qur’aan, the Sunnah and the consensus of Muslims. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“Verily, to Us will be their return. Then verily, for Us will be their Reckoning.” </b>[88:25-26], <b>“Whoever brings a good deed shall have ten times the like thereof to his credit, and whoever brings an evil deed shall have only the recompense of the like thereof and they will not be wronged.” [6:160] and, “And We shall set up balances of justice on the Day of Resurrection, then none will be dealt with unjustly in anything. And if there be the weight of a mustard seed, We will bring it And Sufficient are We as Reckoners.”</b> [21:47].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) said, what translated means, <b>“Allah will bring the believer closer to Him, and will shield him form being exposed (for his evil deeds in front of everyone). He will say: ‘Do you remember such and such (evil) deed? Do you remember such and such (evil) deed?’ He will say: ‘Yes, O my Lord!’ When He gets his confessions for his evil deeds, and he (the salve) thinks that he is close to destruction, he will say: ‘I have preserved you (from being exposed in front of others for these evil deeds) during your lifetime. Today, I forgive them for you.’ Then, he will be given his record of deeds. As for the disbelievers and the hypocrites, they will be called in public: ‘These are the ones who lied on their Lord (did not follow His Guidance sent down with their Prophets). Therefore, Allah’s curse will befall the unjust ones.&#8221; </b>[Saheeh al-Bukharee and Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And,“<b>Whoever intends to perform a good deed, and performs it, Allah will record it for him as ten deeds, to seven hundredfold, to many more folds. Whoever intends to commit and evil deed, and commits it, Allah will record it as one evil deed.” </b>[Saheeh al-Bukharee and Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Muslims are unanimous that the Day of Reckoning will come.</b> This is the Wisdom of Allah. He revealed the Books, sent down the Messengers and commanded that they be accepted, followed and obeyed. He commanded that whoever oppose them (the Books and the Messengers) are to be fought. He permitted shedding their blood, and the seizure of their children, women and possessions. If there will not be a Day of Reckoning, then this Commandment will be time wasted. Allah is immune form such joyful play. <b>“Then surely, We shall question those (people) to who it (the Book) was sent and verily, We shall question the Messengers. Then surely, We shall narrate unto them (their whole story) with knowledge, and indeed We were not absent.’</b> [7:6.7].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 3. To believe in Paradise and Hell. </b> They are the final destination for whoever deserves either one of them, and for eternity. Paradise is the destination of the ultimate happiness and joy that Allah prepared for the believers who feared Him, believed in what He required from them to believe and obeyed Him and His Messenger. They are the ones who were sincere to Allah and followers of His Messenger. Paradise contains, of Allah’s bounties, <b>“What no eye has ever violated, what no ear has ever heard of and what no mind has ever imagined (of joys that Allah hid for the believers).” </b>[4] Allah said, what translated means, <b>“Verily, those who believe (in Allah) and do righteous, good deeds, they are the best of creatures. Their reward with their Lord is Gardens of Eternity, underneath which rivers flow, they will abide therein forever, Allah Well-Pleased with them, and they with Him. That is for him who fears his Lord.” </b>[98:7-8] and, <b>“No person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do.)’</b> [32:17].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Hell, it is the destination of torment and punishment that Allah prepared for the unjust disbelievers. They are the ones who disbelieved in Him and disobeyed His Messengers. Hell contains kinds of punishment and torment that no one could ever imagine. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“And fear the Fire, which is prepared for the disbelievers.”</b> [3: 131] “We have prepared for the wrongdoers, a Fire whose walls will be surrounding them. And if they ask for help (relief, water etc.) they will be granted water like boiling oil that will scald their faces. Terrible the drink, and an evil dwelling.” [18: 29] and,<b> “Verily, Allah has cursed the disbelievers, and has prepared for them a flaming Fire (Hell). Wherein, they will abide forever, and they will find neither a protector nor a helper. On the Day when their faces will be turned and rolled form all sides in the Fire, they will say: “Oh, would that we had obeyed Allah and obeyed the Messenger (Muhammad).”</b> [33:64-66]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Belief in Life After Death</b>: Believing in the Last Day requires Muslims to also believe in life after death and in the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 1. The questioning in the grave. </b> The dead will be asked, in their graves, about the lord, the religion and the Prophet they followed during their lifetime. <b>Allah will lead the believer to say what is necessary, saying, “Allah is my Lord. My religion is Islam. My Prophet is Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam).” As for the unjust, Allah will lead him to misguidance saying, in answer to the above questions “What! What! I do not know.” Also! the hypocrites and the ones who always had doubts about Allah, the religion and the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam), will say, “I do not know. I heard people say something and I followed them.” </b>[Saheeh al-Bukharee and Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2. The torment or joy in the grave.</b> The unjust, the disbelievers and the hypocrites will be tormented in their graves. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“And if you but see when the wrongdoers are in the agonies of death, while the angels are stretching forth their hands (saying): “Deliver your souls; this day you shall be recompensed with the torment of degradation because of what you used to utter against Allah other than the truth. And you used to reject his Ayat (proofs, signs, evidences, etc.) with disrespect”</b> [6: 93] and about Pharaoh’s people, “The Fire; they are exposed to it, morning and afternoon, and on the Day when the Hour will be established (it will be said to the angels):<b> “Cause Pharaoh ‘s people to enter the severest Torment” </b>[40:46].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zaid ibn Thabit (radiyallaahu anhu) narrated that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) said to his companions what translated means, <b>“I would have asked Allah to let you hear what I am hearing from the punishment in the grave, but for the fear that you would not bury each other after that”</b> Then the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) turned his face towards them, saying, <b>“Seek refuge in Allah from the torment of the Fire.”</b> They said, “We seek refuge in Allah from the torment of the Fire.” He said, <b>“Seek refuge in Allah from the torment of the grave.”</b> They said, “We seek refuge in Allah from the torment of the grave.” He said, <b>“Seek refuge in Allah from all calamities, apparent or hidden.”</b> They said, “We seek refuge in Allah from all calamities, apparent or hidden.” He said, <b>“Seek refuge in Allah from the calamity of Al-A‘war Ad-Dajjal (the False Messiah).” They said, “We seek refuge lit Allah from the calamity of Al-A‘war Ad-Da.jjal.”</b> [Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for joys of the grave, they are given to the believers. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“Verily, those who say: “Our Lord is Allah (alone),” and then they stood fast on them (these words that they say), on them the angels will descend (at the time of their death) (saying): “Fear you not, nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of </b><b> Paradise which you have been promised?” </b> [41:30] and, <b>“Then why do you not (intervene) when (the soul of a dying person) reaches the throat? And you at the moment are looking on? But We (our angels who take the soul) are nearer to him than you, but you see not. Then why do you not, if you are exempt from the reckoning and recompense (punishment). Bring back the soul (to its body), if you are truthful? Then if he (the dying person) be of those near ones (close to Allah), (there is for him) rest and provisions, and a </b><b> Garden of Delights (Paradise).&#8221;</b> [56: 83-89].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Baraa’ ibn ‘Azib narrated that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) said about the believer, that <b>after he is asked by the angels (about the lord, the religion and the Messenger he followed) and after he replies (saying that his Lord is Allah, his religion is Islam and his Messenger is Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam), “A caller from heaven will say: ‘My slave has said the truth. Therefore, furnish him (his grave) from </b><b> Paradise, dress him from Paradise and open a door for him to Paradise.” Then he said, “He will receive from its tranquility and perfume. His grave will be enlarged for him the distance that his sight reaches.” </b> [Musnad Ahmad &amp; Aboo Dawood]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Benefits of Believing in the Last Day<br />
1.</b> The desire to do righteous, good deeds, seeking the good results in the Last Day.<br />
<b>2.</b> The fear from committing and approving of evil deeds, fearing the torment of the Day of Reckoning.<br />
<b>3.</b> The believer feels that this belief makes him forget the hardships he faces in this life. He is preoccupied with working righteousness trying to reach the joys and good rewards of the Last Day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Some disbelievers reject the idea of life after death saying</b> that this is not possible. This claim is false. Religion, the senses and the mind are used to refute this claim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Religion, Allah said, what translated means: <b>“The disbelievers pretend that they will never be resurrected (for the account). Say (O Muhammad): “Yes! By my Lord, you will certainly be resurrected, then you will be informed (and recompensed for) what you did, and that is easy for Allah.”</b> [64:7] All Scriptures are unanimous on this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Senses, Allah demonstrated to his slaves how He raised the dead in this life. In Surat Al-Baqarah. Allah mentioned five examples:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 1.</b> The People of Moses said to him, <b>“We will no believe in you unless we see Allah without a barrier.” They were seized by death and then Allah resurrected them. To remind the Children of </b><b> Israel with this story, Allah said, what translated means, “And (remember) when you said: “O Moses: We shall never believe in you till we see Allah Plainly.” But you were seized with a thunder-bolt (lightening) while you were looking. Then We raised you up after your death, so that you might be grateful.” [</b>2:55-56].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2.</b> The story of the murdered man whom the Children of Israel differed as to who killed him. Allah ordered them to sacrifice a cow and strike him with some of its parts. so he can tell them who killed him, <b>“And (remember) when you killed a man and fell into dispute among yourselves as to the crime. But Allah brought forth that which you were hiding. So We said: “Strike him (the dead man) with a piece of it (the cow).” Thus Allah brings the dead to life and shows you His signs so that you may understand.”</b> [2:72-73].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 3.</b> The story of the nation that escaped from its land for fear of death by the hands of their enemies, although their number was in the thousands. Allah made death seize them and then raised them back to life, <b>“Did you (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam)) not think of those who went forth from their homes in thousands, fearing death? Allah said to them: “Die.” And then He restored them to life. Truly, Allah is full of Bounty to mankind, but most men thank not.” </b> [2:243].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 4.</b> The story of the person who passed by a village that all its inhabitants had died. He could not imagine that Allah can resurrect them. Allah made death seize him for a hundred years and then raised him from the dead, Or (think you of) such as he who passed by a town all in utter ruins. He said:<b> “Oh! How will Allah ever bring it to life after it’s death?” So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him up (again). He said: “How long did you remain (dead)?” He (the man) said: “(Perhaps) I remained (dead) a day or a part of a day.” He said: “Nay, you have remained (dead) for a hundred years, look at your food and at your drink, they show no change; and look at your donkey! And thus We have made of you a Sign for the people. Look at the bones, how We bring them together and clothe them with flesh.” When this was clearly shown to him, he said: “I Know (now) that Allah is Able to do all things.”</b> [2:259].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 5.</b> The story of Abraham who asked Allah to show him how He raises the dead. Allah ordered him to kill four birds, cut them in parts and spread the parts over the surrounding mountains. He told him to call the dead birds, and that he did. These parts were collected (by Allah’s Power) and the birds came back to life and they came to Abraham. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“And (remember) when Abraham said: “My Lord! Show me how You give life to the dead. “ He (Allah) said: “Do you not believe?” He (Abraham) said: “Yes (I believe), but to be stronger in faith.” He said: “Take four bird, then cause them to incline towards you (slaughter them, Cut them into pieces), and then put a portion of them on every hill, and call them, they will come to you in haste. And know that Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.”</b> [2:260].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are five examples of incidents that happened. They prove that raising the dead can happen by the will of Allah. We mentioned before that Jesus raised the dead from their graves, by the will of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> As for the Mind, there are two ways to correctly use it to confirm raising the dead:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Allah is the One who started the creation of heavens and earth. The One who is Capable of starting the creation is also Capable of restarting it. Allah said, what translated means, “And He is Who originates the creation, then will repeat it (after it has been perished), and this is easier for Him.” [30:27] and, “As We began the first creation, We shall repeat it, (it is) a promise binding upon Us. Truly, We shall do it.” [21:104] and to the one who denied that Allah will give life to the bones when they have rotted away, “Say (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam)): “‘He will give life to them Who created them for the first time! And He is the All-Knower of every creation.” [36:79].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2.</b> It is noticed that the soil can become dry and that trees and plants die. When Allah sends the rain, the soil comes back to life and plants of all kinds grow and become green. The One who brings life back to the dead soil is Capable of raising the dead. Allah said, what translated means, “And among His Signs (in this), that you see the earth barren, but when We send down water (rain) to it, it is stirred to life and growth (of vegetation). Verily, He Who gives it life, surely. (He) is Able to give life to the dead (on the Day of Resurrection). Indeed! He is Able to do all things.” [41: 39] “And We send down blessed water (rain) from the sky then We produce therewith gardens and grain (all harvests that are reaped). And tall date-palms, with ranged clusters; A provisions for (Allah’s) slaves. And We give life therewith to dead land. Thus will be the Resurrection (of the dead).” (50:9-11].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Some misguided people reject punishment or joy in the grave claiming </b> that this cannot happen. They claim that if one exhumes the dead, he will find the grave as it was left and that it did not change in size. This claim is rejected by the Shari’ah, the senses and the mind:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Shari’ah, we mentioned some texts before. These texts confirm the punishment or joy in the grave. Ibn Abbas (radiyallaahu anhuma) said, “The Prophet passed by some walls in Madinah. He heard the screams of two persons who were being punished in their graves.” The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) mentioned the reasons behind this punishment, <b>“One of them did not protect himself (his clothes) form urine. The other one was spreading (sawing) differences (between people).”</b> [Saheeh ab-Bukharee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Senses, we know that, while dreaming, the one who is asleep sees that he is enjoying a huge space or that he is feeling pain because he is squeezed in a small area. Sometimes, one’s sleep is interrupted because of such nightmares, although he is still in his bed. Sleeping is similar to dying. Allah said, what translated means, “<b>It is Allah Who takes away the souls at the time of their death, and those that die not during their sleep. He keep those (souls) for which He had ordained death and sends the rest for a term appointed. Verily, in this are signs for a people who think deeply.”</b> [39:42]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Mind, sometimes one sees dreams that may later happen in real life. Some Muslims may see the Prophet in their dreams. Whoever sees the Prophet, on the shape that he was described in books of Hadith, is saying the truth in that he saw him. This happens while one is still in his bed. If this is the case in this material life, what about matters of the other life?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for their claim that when one exhumes a dead body, that no signs of abnormal change, either in the body or the grave itself, are detected, we say the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 1.</b> The Shari’ah cannot be rejected by depending on these doubts. These doubts can easily be refuted, providing one uses his mind. There is a popular saying: “There are many who refute a truth, while the problem lies with their limited comprehension.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2.</b> Life in the grave is a matter of the unseen. The senses cannot unveil the unseen. If matters of the unseen are unveiled by the senses, then belief in the unseen will not have any useful meaning, in which case believing or disbelieving is irrelevant, since there would be no matters of the unseen to believe in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 3.</b> Only the dead feel the punishment or joy in the grave. Also, the one who is dreaming is the only one who is experiencing the pain of being squeezed in a small space or the joy of being in an open area. Others do not feel the same as the one who is experiencing these dreams, although he is still in his bed. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) used to receive revelation while he was among his companions and the companions did not hear the revelation. Sometimes, the angel came in the shape of an invisible man. The companions did not see the angel while he was delivering revelation to the Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 4.</b> Humans have limited comprehension and understanding of the universe. They only understand what Allah gave them the capability to understand. They do not understand all of the existence. The seven heavens, the earth and all that which is therein praise Allah. Allah, sometimes, gives the power to some of His creation to hear such praise. Humans cannot hear such praise. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein, glorify Him and there is not a thing but glorifies His praise. But you understand not their glorification. Truly, He is Ever Forbearing, Oft-Forgiving.” </b>[17:44]. Also, devils and the Jinn go about in the earth. The Jinn came to the Messenger and listened to his recitation of the Qur’aan. When he finished, they went back to their nation to convey the Message to them. However, this creation is out of the reach of human’s Comprehension, <b>“O Children of Adam! Let not Satan deceive you, as he got your parents (Adam and Eve) out of Paradise, stripping them of their raiment, to show them their private parts. Verily, he and his soldiers see you from where you will not see them. Verily, We made the devils protectors (and helpers) for those who believe not.”</b> [7:27]. Creation can neither reach what is beyond their comprehension nor understand all the existence. Therefore, one cannot dispute ‘flatters of the unseen that he cannot comprehend.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a name="8"></a></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a>Chapter 8: Belief In Al-Qadar</a></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Qadar is Allah’s predestination of measurements and sustenance of everything and everyone, according to His Knowledge and Wisdom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Aspects Of Belief In Al-Qadar</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 1. Knowledge</b> &#8211; The belief that Allah’s Knowledge encompasses everything, every matter, major or minor, and time frames of everything that happens in this universe. Allah’s Knowledge encompasses all of His Actions and actions taken by His slaves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2. Writing &#8211;</b> The belief that Allah recorded everything in a Book that He kept with Him, called “A1-Lawh’ Al-Mah’foodh” (The Preserved Book). He said, what translated means,<b> “Know you not that Allah knows all that is in heaven and on earth? Verily, it is (all) in the Book (Al-Lawh’ Al-Mah’footh). Verily, that is easy for Allah.” </b>[22:70].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullah-ibn-Amr-ibn-al-Aas (radiyallaahu anhuma) said that he heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) say, what translated means, <b>“Allah recorded the measurement of all matters pertaining to Creation fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and earth.”</b> [Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 3. The belief that nothing, whether related to Allah’s Actions or actions taken by His slaves, can happen without His Permission. </b> He said, what translated means, <b>“And your Lord Creates whatsoever He wills and chooses.” </b>[28: 68], <b>“ And Allah does what He will.” [14: 27] and, “He it is Who shapes you in the wombs as He pleases.”</b> [3: 6]. As for actions taken by His creation, Allah said, <b>“Had Allah willed, indeed He would have given them power over you, and they would have fought you.”</b> [4:90] and, <b>“And if Allah had willed, they would not have done so. So leave them alone with their fabrications.”</b> [6:137].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 4. The belief that Allah created all creation, all what they possess of attributes and all their actions</b>, “Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is the Guardian over all things.” [39:62] and, “He has created everything, and has measured it exactly according to its due measurements.” [25: 2]. Also, Abraham said to his people, as was mentioned in the Qur’aan, “While Allah has created you and what you make.” [37:96].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Believing in the Al-Qadar, as described above, does not mean that people have no power over the actions they chose to take. I</b>slamic Shari’ah and Reality confirm that the person has a will of his own:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Shari’ah, Allah said about one’s own will, what translated means, <b>“So, whosoever wills, let him take a Return to his Lord (by obeying His Commandments).” [78:39] and, “So go to your tilt (have sexual relations with your wives) when and how you will (not in the anus).” </b>[2:223]. As for one’s own power over his actions, <b>“So keep your duty to Allah as much as you can; listen and obey.”</b> [64:16] and, <b>“Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope. He gets reward for that (good) which he has earned, and he is punished for that (evil) which he has earned.” </b>[2:286].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Reality of things, every human knows that he has a power and a will of his own. He uses his power and will to indulge in or avoid actions of his choice. Mankind distinguish between what they do by their own power and between what they have no power over, like shivering due to illness or extreme cool. However, the power and will of mankind is under the control of Allah’s Will and Power, <b>“To whomsoever among you who wills to walk straight. And you will not, unless (it be) that Allah wills, the Lord of the worlds.” </b>[8 1:28-29]. The universe is Allah’s property and nothing happens in His Kingdom without His Knowledge and Permission.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Belief in Al-Qadar, as explained above, does not provide an excuse for mankind to sin or abandon what they are obligated to do.</b> This excuse can be rejected using the following arguments:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 1.</b> Allah said, what translated means, “Those who took partners (in worship) with Allah will say: <b>“If Allah had Willed, we would not have taken partners (in worship) with Him, nor would our fathers, and we would not have forbidden anything (against His Will).</b> <b>“Likewise bellied those who were before them, till they tasted of Our Wrath. Say: “Have you any knowledge (proof) that you can produce before us? Verily, you follow nothing but guess and you do nothing but lie” </b>[6:148]. The disbelievers did not have a valid excuse when they said that what they did was according to A1-Qadar. If this excuse was valid, then why will Allah punish them for their sins?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2.</b> Allah said, what translated means, <b>“Messengers as bearers of good news as well as of warning in order that mankind should have no plea against Allah after the Messengers And Allah is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise.”</b> [4:165]. Sending down the Messengers took place according to A1-Qadar, also. This is why the disbelievers cannot use Al-­Qadar as an excuse for not believing, because Al-Qadar provided them with the means to escape Allah’s punishment by following His Messengers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 3. </b> Ali-ibn-Abi Talib (radiyallaahu anhu) said that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) said, what translated means, <b>“One’s final destination, in Hell or Paradise, is already determined for each one of you.” A man said, “Should we depend (on this fact), O Messenger of Allah (meaning to abandon working deeds)?” He said, “No. Perform deeds, because everyone will be helped (to go on the path that he chooses and reach his destiny).” Then he read the Ayah. “As for him who gives (in charity) and keeps his duty to Allah and fears Him&#8230;”</b> [92:5].” <b> [1]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 4.</b> Allah conveyed His Commandments to His slaves and did not require them to do what is beyond their capacity. “So keep your duty to Allah (and fear Him) as much as you can.” [64:16], and “Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope.” [2:286]. If the slave is forced to do whatever deeds he performs, then Allah would have required from him what is beyond his capacity, and this is a false belief. For this reason, Allah forgives sins that take place because of ignorance or forgetfulness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 5. </b> Al-Qadar is a matter of Allah’s Knowledge. No one can uncover his own Qadar but after it happens. One’s intention to perform a deed precedes the action itself. He does not know what Al-Qadar holds for him. Therefore, Al-Qadar is not a valid excuse for sinning and abandoning the Commandments.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 6.</b> One always seeks what is convenient for him. No one of sane mind would abandon what brings material benefit to him, saying that Al-Qadar forced him to take this course of action. Therefore, why would one use Al-Qadar as an excuse for abandoning what brings benefit to him in matters of religion and not do the same for matters of life?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a man has to choose between two countries to move to, one of them is chaotic, full of incidents of murder, looting, rape, insecurity and hunger. Would he choose to go to this country or would he go to another country, which is safe for him and secure, with abundance in material joys, where one’s honor, possessions and human rights are preserved? There is no doubt that this man would choose the second country, where he will be safe and secure. No one of sane mind would choose to go to the first country, claiming that this is his Qadar. Therefore, why would one choose what ends him up in Hell, rather than Paradise, in the Last Life, claiming that this is his Qadar?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When one is sick and is given a medicine to take, he will take the medicine even though he does not like its taste. When one is told to go on a diet, he would not eat the food that he likes, in order to satisfy this diet and to stay fit. No one of sane mind would refuse to take medicines or go on medical diets, claiming that this is his Qadar. Therefore, why would one abandon implementing Allah’s and His Messenger’s Commandments, thus bringing Allah’s Wrath on him, claiming that this is his Qadar?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 7. </b>If one of those, who abandon the Commandments and indulge in sinning, comes under attack on his honor or possessions, would he accept the excuse of the attacker, if he says that he attacked him because it was his Qadar to attack him, and therefore he is not to be blamed? Indeed No! Therefore, why does this person refuse Al-Qadar as an excuse for whoever attacked him, while he depends on Al-Qadar as an excuse for abandoning Allah’s rights on him?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was reported that Omar ibn Al-Khattab (radiyallaahu anhu) was brought a man who was caught stealing. Omar ordered that this man’s hand be cut off. The man said, “Wait, O leader of the believers. I only stole because this was in the Qadar of Allah.” Omar said, “And we are cutting your hand because it is in the Qadar of Allah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Benefits Of Belief In Al-Qadar<br />
1.</b> Depending on Allah alone when one indulges in any action. Taking the necessary precautions is not the cause of one’s success in the intended actions. All matters are under the full control of the Qadar of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>2.</b> When one succeeds in performing an action, he must not be proud of himself. All good deeds are successfully performed because of Allah’s bounty, because He ordained that this matter to be successful. To be proud will make one forget to thank Allah for permitting him to successfully perform this deed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>3.</b> Believing in Al-Qadar leads one to feel satisfied, safe and secure. All incidents that happen to a person are a result of Allah’s Qadar. One should not feel miserable for losing or not gaining what he likes. All this happens according to the Qadar of Allah. Allah is the King and Lord of the heavens and earth and His Qadar will happen exactly as He Will, <b>“No calamity befalls on the earth or in yourselves but is inscribed in the Book of Decrees (Al-Lawh’ Al-Mah’footh), before We bring it into existence. Verily, that is easy for Allah. In order that you may not be sad over matters that you fail to get, nor rejoice because of that which has been given to you. And Allah likes not prideful boasters.”</b> [57:22-23]. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) said, what translated means, <b>“Pleasing is the attitude of the believer. All of his matters are righteous. This is only for the believer. If a joy is brought to him, he thanks (Allah for it). This is better for him. If a calamity befalls him, he is patient. This is also good for him.”</b> [Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Two groups fell into misguidance with regard to Al­-Qadar:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Al-Jabriyyah &#8211; This group claimed that the person is forced to do whatever he does and that he has no power or will of his own.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>2. Al-Qadariyyah</b> &#8211; They claimed that the person has a will and power independent of Allah’s Will and Power.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The Shari’ah and Real Life are used to refute the first group, Al-Jabriyyah.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Shari’ah, Allah confirmed that humans have a will and power of their own,<b> ‘Among you are some that desire this world and some that desire the Hereafter.</b> [3:152], “And say: “The Truth is from your Lord.<b>” Then whosoever wills, let him believe, and whosoever wills, let him disbelieve. Verily, We have prepared for the unjust, a Fire whose walls will be surrounding them.” </b>[18:29] and. <b>“Whosoever does righteous, good deeds, it is for (the benefit of) his own-self and whosoever does evil, it is against his own-self, and your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) slaves.”</b> [41:46].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Real Life, everyone knows the difference between his actions, like eating, drinking, selling and buying, and between what is beyond his power, like shivering and accidentally falling off a roof, for example. The first type of actions are his. He chooses them on his own will using his own power. The second type of actions are beyond his control.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The Shari’ah and The Mind are also used to refute the second group, Al-Qadariyyah.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Shari’ah, Allah created everything and nothing happens without His permission. He said that all actions taken by His slave happen by His Will, <b>“Allah had willed, succeeding generations would not have fought against each other, after clear Verses of Allah had come to them, but they differed, some of them believed and others disbelieved, If Allah had willed, they would not have fought against one another, but Allah does what He likes.”</b> [2:253] and, <b>“And if We had willed, surely! We would have given every person his guidance, but the Word from Me took effect (about evil­doers), that I will fill Hell with Jinn and mankind together.”</b> [32:13].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for The Mind, the universe is Allah’s Kingdom and mankind are a part of this Kingdom. Therefore, all mankind are owned by Allah. The slave cannot do anything in this Kingdom unless its Lord, Allah, gives him permission.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> FOOTNOTES</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Saheeh aL-Bukhari &amp; Saheeh Muslim (the wordings are by Al-Bukhari)]. Muslim’s narration of this Hadith reads, “All will be helped to satisfy what they were created for.” The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) ordered the companions to perform righteous, good deeds and not to depend on Al-Qadar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a name="9"></a></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a>Chapter 9 : The Goals Of Islamic Belief –(Aqeedah)</a></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A person’s goals are the destination that he wishes to reach by taking certain actions. The Islamic ‘Aqeedah (belief) has goals and values that are the destination of whoever preserves it:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 1 &#8211; Seeking the Pleasure of Allah and worshipping Him alone. </b> Allah is the Creator who has no partners. Therefore, He alone must be worshipped and His Pleasure must be intended by every action one takes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2 &#8211; Freeing the mind from the confusion caused by not following this ‘Aqeedah.</b> Whoever does not believe in this ‘Aqeedah is either an atheist who is worshipping material means or is a follower of misguidance and darkness caused by false beliefs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 3 &#8211; Gaining psychological and intellectual satisfaction.</b> The ones who believe in this ‘Aqeedah do not fall victim to psychological complexes or confusion. This ‘Aqeedah builds a direct and strong relationship between the Lord and His salve. The believer accepts Allah as the Lord, the Legislator and The King. He is satisfied with this belief. His heart is pleased with the following of Islam and he would not exchange this pleasure for anything else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 4 &#8211; Purifying one’s intentions and deeds. </b> This ‘Aqeedah protects one from falling into misguidance in acts of Worship or in dealings with others. It requires its followers to follow the path set by the Messengers. This path leads to Safety and Purity in the hearts and actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 5 &#8211; Being serious with regards to all matters.</b> One does not pass the chance to do righteous, good deeds, but he takes any chance to gain Allah’s rewards. One is always on his guard against any path that leads to sin, fearing Allah’s punishment. This ‘Aqeedah requires its followers to believe in the Resurrection and the Day of Reckoning,<b> “(For all there will be degrees (or ranks) according to what they did. And your Lord is not unaware of what they do &#8221; </b>[6:132].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet also encouraged this attitude, <b>“The strong believer is better and more liked by Allah than the weak believer. However, each one of them has (a certain degree of ) goodness. Seek what brings benefit to you and depend on Allah. Do not be weak if any calamity befalls you, do not say: ‘Had I done that, then this would not have happened.’ Only say: ‘Allah has ordained (this matter) and whatever He will He does.’ “Had I,” opens the door wide for the Devil to do his work” </b>[Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 6 &#8211; Establishing a strong nation</b> that strives to preserve its religion and solidify its gains. This nation disregards the losses it concurs while striving to preserve the religion. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“Only those are the believers who have believed in Allah and His Messenger, and afterwards doubt not but strive with their wealth and their lives for the cause of Allah. Those! They are the truthful”</b> [49:15].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 7 &#8211; Reaching happiness in this life and in the Last Life, </b> by leading individuals and groups to guidance and gaining their Lord’s bounties and good rewards, <b>“Whoever works righteousness, whether male or female, while he (or she) is a true believer (in Allah) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (Paradise in the Hereafter).&#8221;</b> [16:97].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are some of the goals that Islam seeks for its followers to reach. We pray that Allah helps us and the rest of Muslims to reach them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">La ilaha ill Allaah, Muhammad-ur- Rasul-Allaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah, and Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam = May the peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is the Messenger of Allaah ].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have noticed that most of the Europeans and others, who embrace Islam, do not understand the reality of the meaning of the first fundamental principle of Islam, i.e. &#8220;La ilaha ill Allaah (None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah &#8211; and Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) is the Messenger of Allaah.&#8221; So I consider it essential to explain something of the meanings of this Great Sentence (i.e. Principle) in some detail:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">La ilaha ill Allaah, Muhammad-ur-: Rasulullah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah &#8230;.. and Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) is the Messenger of Allaah&#8221; It has <strong>three aspects</strong> : A, B and C.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aspect A: It is that, you have. to pledge a covenant with (Allaah), the Creator of the Heavens and Earth, the Ruler of all that exists, the Lord of Majesty and Highness, on four points (or conditions):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Point 1</strong>: A confession with your heart that the-Creator (of everything) is Allaah, it is that you have to say: &#8220;I testify that the Creator of all the universe including the stars, the planets, the sun, the moon, the heavens, the earth with all its known and unknown forms of life, is Allaah.. He is the Organizer and Planner of all its affairs. It is He Who gives life and death, and He (i.e. .Allaah -Alone) is the Sustainer, and the Giver of Security, etc. &#8220;And this is called your confession for the Oneness of the Lordship of Allaah,&#8221; &#8212; &#8220;TAUHID Ar-Rububiyya&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Point 2</strong>: A confession with your heart that you have to say: &#8220;I testify that: None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah Alone. The word &#8220;Worship&#8221; (i.e. &#8216;Ibadah) carries a great number of meanings in the Arabic language: It conveys that all kinds of worship are meant for Allaah (and none .else, whether it be an angel, Messenger, Prophet, Jesus-son of Mary, Ezra, Muhammad, saint, idol, the sun, the moon and all other kinds of false deities). So pray to none but Allaah, invoke none but Allaah, ask for help from none (unseen) but Allaah, swear by none but Allaah, offer an animal as sacrifice to none but Allaah,&#8230;etc., and that means &#8211; all what Allaah and His Messenger (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) order you to do, (in His Book. The Qur&#8217;an and in the As-Sunna (Legal ways of Prophet Muhammad , sallalahu alayhi wa sallam ) you must do, and all that Allaah and His Messenger (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) forbid you, you must not do.&#8221; And this is called (your confession for the) &#8220;Oneness of the Worship of Allaah.&#8221;&#8211; &#8220;Tauhid Al-Uluhiyya&#8221;. And that you (mankind) worship none but Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Point 3</strong>: A confession with your heart that you have to say: &#8220;O Allaah! I testify that all the best of names and the most perfect qualities with which You have named or qualified Yourself in Your Book (i.e. the Qur&#8217;an) or as Your Prophet Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) has named or qualified You, with his statement,&#8221; &#8230;&#8230; I confirm that all those (names and qualifications) are for You without changing their meanings or neglecting them completely or giving resemblance to others.&#8221; As Allaah said: &#8220;There is nothing like unto Him and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.&#8221; (Qur&#8217;an 42:11). This Holy Verse confirms the quality of hearing and the quality of sight for Allaah without resemblance to others (the creation), and likewise. He also said: &#8220;To one whom I have created with Both My Hands,&#8221; ( Qur&#8217;an 38:75).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and He also said: &#8220;The Hand of Allaah is over their hands.&#8221; (Qur&#8217;an 48: 10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This confirms two Hands for Allaah, but there is no similarity (i.e. they are NOT like human hands) for them. Similarly Allaah said: &#8220;The Most Beneficent (Allaah) &#8220;Istawa&#8221; (rose over) the (Mighty) Throne.&#8221; (Qur&#8217;an 20:5).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He rose over the Throne really in a manner that suits His Majesty. And Allaah is over His Throne over the seventh Heaven, as the slave-girl pointed towards the Heavens, when Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Muhammad sallalahu alayhi wa sallam ) asked her as to where Allaah is? He only comes down over the first (nearest) Heaven to us on the Day of &#8216;Arafat (Hajj, i.e. the 9th of Dhul-Hijja), and also during the last third part of the night as mentioned by the Prophet (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam), but He is with us by His Knowledge only, not by His Personal-Self (bidhatihi). It is not like that, as some people say that Allaah is present everywhere, here. there, and even inside the breasts of men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He sees and hears all that we do or utter, etc. And this is called (your confession for the) &#8220;Oneness of the Names and Qualities of Allaah&#8221; &#8220;Tauhid Al-Asma was-Sifat&#8221; and this is the Right Faith, the faith which was followed by the Messengers of Allaah (from Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, Solomon, Jesus to Muhammad ( peace of Allaah be upon them all) and the companions of the Prophet Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) and the righteous followers of these Messengers (peace of Allaah be upon them all).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Point IV</strong>:A confession with your heart that you have to say: &#8220;O Allaah! I testify that Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) is Your Messenger.&#8221; That means that none has the right to be followed after Allaah. but the Prophet Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam), as he is the Last of His Messengers. As Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) is not the father of any man among you but he is the Messenger of Allaah and the last (end) of the Prophets and Allaah is Ever All-Aware of everything&#8221; ( Qur&#8217;an 33:40).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad, sallalahu alayhi wa sallam ) gives you, take it and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain from it,&#8221;(Qur&#8217;an 59:7).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah said: &#8220;Say (O Muhammad, sallalahu alayhi wa sallam, to mankind): If you (really) love Allaah, then follow me.&#8221; (Qur&#8217;an 3:31).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for others than Muhammad ( sallalahu alayhi wa sallam ), their statements are to be taken or rejected as to whether these are in accordance with Allaah&#8217;s Book (i.e. the Qur&#8217;an) or with the Sunna (legal ways, orders, acts of worship, statements, etc.) of the Prophet (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) or not. As the Divine Inspiration has stopped after the death of the Prophet Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) and it will not resume except at the time of the Descent of Jesus, son of Mary and he (i.e. Jesus) will rule with justice according to the Islamic Laws. during the last days of the world as it has been mentioned in the authentic Hadith (i.e. Narration of the Prophet Muhammad, sallalahu alayhi wa sallam ) (sahih-Al-Bukhari Vol. 3, Hadith No. 425)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aspect B:. It is essential to utter, &#8220;La ilaha ill Allaah, Muhammad-ur-Rasul Allaah&#8221; (&#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah, and Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) is the Messenger of Allaah &#8220;. As it has come in the statement of the Prophet Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) to his uncle Abu Talib at the time of the latter&#8217;s death: &#8220;O uncle, if you utter it (&#8216;None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah, and Muhammad, sallalahu alayhi wa sallam, is the Messenger of Allaah&#8217;), then I shall be able to argue on your behalf before Allaah, on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221; Similarly, when Abu Dhar Al-Ghifari embraced Islam, he went to Al-Masjid-al-Haram and he proclaimed it loudly in front of the Quraish infidels Until he was beaten severely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aspect C: . It is essential that the limbs and all other parts and organs of one&#8217;s body testify to it, and this is very important as regards its meaning (i.e., the meaning of &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah. and Muhammad, sallalahu alayhi wa sallam, is the Messenger of Allaah&#8221;). So whoever has confessed this (with his Lord), he shall not Commit sins like robbing. killing, stealing, illegal sexual intercourse, eating pig meat. drinking alcoholic beverages, taking undue advantage of orphan&#8217;s property. cheating in trade. bribery and earning money through illegal means. etc&#8230; or otherwise the limbs, all other parts and organs of his body will testify against him that he was a liar in his words which he pledged to Allaah. In case he commits the above sins, he should know that it is a sin that obliges him to repent to Allaah, and ask His Forgiveness, as (his) body parts (i.e. skin, private parts, hands, tongue ears. etc.) will testify to the above mentioned crimes (i.e. actions) against his self on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And with the confession of this Great Sentence (i.e. Principle) a person enters in the fold of (i.e. embraces) the Islamic Religion accordingly, it is essential for him to believe in all the Messengers of Allaah and not to differentiate between them. As it is mentioned in His Book, Allaah said: &#8220;Do then those who disbelieve think that they can take My Slaves (i.e. the angels; Allaah&#8217;s Messengers; Jesus, son of Mary, etc.) as Auliya&#8221; (Lords, Gods, Protectors etc.) besides Me? Verily, We have prepared Hell as an entertainment for the disbelievers (in the Oneness of Allaah&#8211;Islamic Monotheism). Say (O Muhammad, sallalahu alayhi wa sallam): Shall We tell you the greatest losers in respect of (their) deeds?&#8221; Those whose efforts have been wasted in this life, while they thought they were acquiring good by their deeds&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Those are they who deny the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of their Lord and in the meeting with Him (in the Hereafter). So their works are in vain, and on the Day of Resurrection, We shall not give them any weight.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;That shall be their recompense, Hell, because they disbelieved and took My Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, revelations, etc.) and My Messengers by way of jest and mockery. &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily! Those who believe (in the Oneness of Allaah Islamic&#8211;Monotheism), and do righteous deeds, they shall have the gardens of Al-Firdaus (Paradise) for their entertainment.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Wherein they shall dwell (for ever). No desire will they have to be removed there from.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Say ( O Muhammad, sallalahu alayhi wa sallam ! to Mankind): If the sea were ink ( with which to write) the Words of my Lord, surely the sea would be exhausted, before the Words of my Lord would be finished even if We brought (another sea) like it for its aid.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Say (O Muhammad, sallalahu alayhi wa sallam ), I am only a man like you, it has been inspired to me that your Ilah (God) is One Ilah (God &#8212; i.e. Allaah). So whoever hopes for the meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord.&#8221; (The Qur&#8217;an 18: 102-1 10).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This introduction is necessary for anyone who wishes to embrace Islam. After this confession he (or she ) should take a bath (i.e. Ghusl) and then offer a two Rak&#8217;at prayer, and act upon the five Principles of Islam, as narrated by Ibn &#8216;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) in the Book, Sahih Al-Bukhari. Vol. I Hadith No.7 : Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him), Allaah&#8217;s Messenger , sallalahu alayhi wa sallam, said: Islam is based on (the following five (principles):</p>
<p>1. To testify La ilaha ill Allaah wa anna Muhammad-ar-Rasul Allaah (None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah and that Muhammad, sallalahu alayhi wa sallam, is Allaah&#8217;s Messenger).</p>
<p>2. To offer the (compulsory congregational) prayers dutifully and perfectly (Iqamat-as -Salat).</p>
<p>3. To pay Zakat (i.e. obligatory charity).</p>
<p>4. To perform Hajj (i.e. Pilgrimage to Makka).</p>
<p>5. To observe fast during the month of Ramadan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and must believe in the six Articles of Faith, i.e. to believe in:</p>
<p>(I) Allaah,<br />
(2) His Angels,<br />
(3) His Messengers,<br />
(4) His Revealed Books,<br />
(5) the Day of Resurrection, and<br />
(6) Al-Qadar (Divine Preordainments i.e. whatever Allaah has ordained must come to pass).]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Khutubul-Haajah …..</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Today, <em>bi iznillaahi ta&#8217;ala</em> and to describing the cure or the remedy for the illness which is &#8220;decrease after increase&#8221;, the changing of  the condition of a person from <em>eemaan</em> to <em>Kufr</em> or from <em>taqwa</em> and righteousness to evil-doing and misbehaving regarding the orders of Allaah; or from guidance to going astray. This is upon levels. So if an individual was upon <em>Istiqaama</em> and was upon righteousness and then they go back upon their heels, then one fears for that individual &#8216;<em>soo al khaatimah</em>&#8216; (evil or bad ending). This was from the characteristics of the <em>salaf </em> that they would fear a bad ending so therefore they would watch their actions and their behavior. What are some of the reasons behind this matter of backing up after having been steadfast? Or getting misguidance after having guidance? or going astray after one was upon the straight way? or becoming someone who is easy for the individual to commit sins when prior to this it was a hard and  very rare or at least a difficult issue for that individual to fall into sin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Some of the reasons we will mention <em>inshaa&#8217; Allaah ta&#8217;ala</em> are:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The first reason</span></strong> – &#8220;<strong>The weakness of an individual&#8217;s eemaan</strong>&#8220;. And this weakness of eemaan carries with it all types of diseases and all types of other illnesses from the hardness of the heart, and the easiness of falling into sin and laziness when it comes to doing or establishing obediences and worships directed towards Allaah. All obedience and worship is for the purpose of Allaah, done for the pleasure of Allaah. But here laziness regarding those matters and the absence of being affected by the Qur&#8217;aan or by <em>Salah</em> (Prayer) and the small amount of fear from Allaah. These are some of the signs of what? Weakness of eemaan. Which is one of the causes for &#8220;the decrease after the increase&#8221;. And a lot of arguing and debate and dissension, this is another reason and another illness. And the absence of feeling that one is responsible in front of Allaah for what one does and that one would be asked, questioned in front of Allaah for everything that one does and and other forms of this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many other reasons that this take place is &#8211;  staying away or being faraway from the righteous companions and from the sittings of knowledge;  and being busy with the <em>dunya</em> (the material world), a long or wide and expensive hope; falling into that and embarking upon that which is <em>haraam</em>. So if eemaan because of that becomes weak, you find that the condition of that individual who has that weak eemaan would change &#8211; from being someone upright, from being someone righteous to being someone astray, and being someone corrupt, and being someone who is going in the incorrect way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">So first and foremost, there must be a treatment for this weakness of eemaan. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that is by being sincere, having &#8216;a<em>l-Ikhlaas</em>&#8216;- some of the greatest benefits of &#8216;<em>Ikhlaas</em>&#8216;- it is of paramount importance that the individual be sincere &#8211; that the actions be done for Allaah <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em> and for Allaah alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another remedy for weakness of eemaan is to reflect upon the Qura&#8217;an, reflect upon the meaning of the Qura&#8217;an, contemplate the meaning of the Qura&#8217;an and to fear Allaah <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em>. Fearing Allaah <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em> which is &#8211; those who know Allaah fear him the most.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to recall the greatness of Allaah<em> tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em></strong></span>, the power of Allaah <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em>; that Allaah <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em> if He wanted to destroy the heavens and the earth and all that is between them (its inhabitants or whatever, all creatures), none could stand in His way. When Allaah <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em> sent destruction to the people of Lut and other  narrations or <em>ayaahs</em> or verses that deal with the punishment of other nations, there it is narrated that it did not take Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala to send an army but rather He sent one of His angels. And knowing the greatness and the majesty of the creation, one can appreciate the greatness of Allaah<em> tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em>. And the fact that one of these angels, it was narrated that it would take 700 years of flight for the bird to go from the earlobe of this angel to his shoulder. So it did not require when Allaah  <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em> wanted to punish those of the past and in particular the people of Lut ,He did not send an army but one angel who it is stated that he lifted the whole valley up on the tip of one of his wings and the inhabitants of the heavens could hear the barking of their dogs, turned it around and smashed them and crushed them. This is the might of Allaah <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em> and that to other nations He just sent some angel to shout (<em>Saihah</em> &#8211; a shouting). One shouting left them in their places in a position of prostration from death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When one reflects upon the greatness of Allaah <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em>, we realize that if He willed and He wanted, He could make the air that we breathe unbreathable, so impossible for us to breathe, or the water that we drink undrinkable so that we cannot benefit from it and so on and so forth. Thinking about the greatness of Allaah <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em> and the sheer strength and power of Allaah <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em> brings about <em>al-khawf</em> (fear of Allaah <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;Wat-Tawbah min al-Dunoob&#8221; (Repenting from the Sins)</span></strong> &#8211; another means of getting away from the illness of weakness of eemaan is making <em>tawbah</em> &#8211; returning back to Allaah <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em>, repenting to Allaah <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em>, asking Allaah <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em> for forgiveness, asking Allaah <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em> to forgive, &#8216;<em>tawbah</em>&#8216; from <em>dhunoob</em> <em>wal ma&#8217;aasi</em> &#8211; from sins and ill behaviour and disobedience to Allaah <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;al</em>a.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And &#8216;<em>wal khawf min sooil khaathima</em>&#8221; (the fearing of an evil end)</span></strong> <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>and to think about death:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yes, to think about death and the Hereafter. Reflection of death changes one&#8217;s whole world. Reflection of death takes  something that seems difficult and makes it easy. Reflection of death makes one watch one&#8217;s talk, watch one&#8217;s hands, watch one&#8217;s step and watch one&#8217;s movement and behavior when one reflects upon death. That death would come to each and every one of us, there is no doubt about that &#8212; that one day the soul is going to reach the throat and the blood is going to run cold and the heart is going to stop beating and the light that is in the eyes that gives us the ability to have sight is going to be removed and that there is nothing that we can do and when that time approaches and when it happens there is no delay in it, we can&#8217;t say, <em>&#8216;wait a minute, give me time to say something to my family, give me a moment to straighten up  my affairs</em>.&#8217; Know that once the process starts it ends with us, the soul being removed from our body and the occurrence therefore of that is death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Thinking about the <em>aakhira</em> (the Hereafter) is a means of dealing with weakness of faith:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Death, thinking about death and thinking about the <em>aakhira</em>, the Last Day and all that will happen in the Last Day &#8212; from the punishment of the grave and before the punishment of the grave, the tightness of the grave and the darkness of the grave and the answer or questioning test of the two angels and coming out of the grave and being barefooted, naked and uncircumcised and being on the Day of Judgment where all the multitudes will be gathered until there is no room to move. You can&#8217;t go forward, you can&#8217;t go backwards, you can&#8217;t go to the left and you can&#8217;t go to the right and some people will be upon their faces and the punishment of Allaah  <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em> will be severe. You will see the children&#8217;s hair turning grey and the women who will have their load dropping their load, you will think that people are drunk but it is not drunkenness but rather the punishment of Allaah <em>tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala</em>. Thinking about the Akhira the Hereafter is a means of dealing with weakness of faith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Being far removed from the atmosphere of eeman &#8211; One of the Reasons for the weakness of Faith:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another reason why people fall into unrighteousness after they were righteous, weak eemaan after having strong eemaan, misguidance after having being guided is &#8216;al Ittiaad&#8217; &#8211; being far removed from the atmosphere of eeman. One has to make oneself in &#8216;al-ajwa&#8217;ah&#8217; or &#8216;al jawil al eemaani&#8217; &#8211; the atmosphere, the environment of eemaan. One has to make oneself be in an environment of eemaan. Those who are faraway from the environment of eemaan, from &#8216;Majaaris al ilm&#8217; &#8211; sitting to get knowledge, &#8216;wal masjid&#8217;- coming to the Masjid, &#8216;wal Qura&#8217;an&#8217; &#8211; reciting Qura&#8217;an, sitting and reciting Qura&#8217;an and good companionship or righteous companionship, were good example; &#8216;Al-Qudwa&#8217; &#8211; righteous examples for individuals, that one can see who are striving for the Hereafter and striving to be righteous; &#8216;Wa Qiyaamul layl&#8217; &#8211; making Salaah at night, &#8216;Wal Adhkaar&#8217; &#8211; remembrance of Allaah and other than that when people remove themselves from the environment of eemaan it leads to backing up, it leads to going upon one&#8217;s heels, falling back upon one&#8217;s heels, it leads to an individual going in the wrong direction and turning away from what is right. So when a person, Muslim Man, woman or child is removed from righteous brothers or righteous companions or righteous sisters for sisters for a very long period of time for instance traveling or because of their job or something of this nature, they lose the environment of eemaan. And when they lose the environment of eemaan it weakens them. It weakens them and when they are weakened they turn away from that in which they were on or they become weak in their sticking – to what they used to stick to of Deen and if this is not caught by the person it can be a matter or a means of destruction for that individual.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great Imaam of the Sunnah Al-Hasan al Basree (Rahimahullah) used to say &#8216;Ikhwaanina&#8217;- Our Brothers, Aghlaa indanaa min ahlinaa &#8211; are more precious and expensive to us than our families, and the wife and the children. Our brothers are &#8216;aghlaa&#8217; more precious, more expensive, more dear to us than our family because our family remind us of Dunya – &#8216;We want this, we need this, let&#8217;s go here, lets go there, well what about this, well what about that&#8217; reminding us of Dunya. But our brothers remind us of the Akhira. As we find brothers who are upon the Qura&#8217;an &amp; Sunnah, the way of the salafus saalih, who fear Allah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala and the Last Day, hope with the meeting of Allah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala, they remind you of what? Al-Akhira &#8211; the Last Day.  So upon the Muslim is to guard himself and to make sure that he or she strives against the desires of his self, to make sure that they place themselves in atmospheres of eemaan and this is something that we have the opportunity to do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First, we have to  make the house &#8211; a  house of eemaan. Make the Baith – Baith Muslim, make the house, the house of a Muslim. This is a very important factor that I heard over 50 years ago, (from Sheik Abu Bakr Jaabir al Jazairi hafidahullah), the man who had been teaching tawhid and tafseer in the Masjid of the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) for well over 40 years or more in a series of lectures he did upon the corruption of the society, where he dealt with this issue that the house of a Muslim MUST be the house of a Muslim. The house of a Muslim is not a &#8216;mal ab&#8217;- not a playground.  The house of a Muslim is not a disco, the house of a Muslim is not a cinema. The house of a Muslim is where you find Qura&#8217;an and he used to say Haafidhahullah that what is this zero want by others to hear the voices of those who sing and so on so forth, music and all of this when you have some of the greatest reciters of Qura&#8217;an, the likes of, we are talking about their recitation not necessarily their Aqeedah or their Manhaj. When an individual he wants to listen to something, was concerned about the Manhaj he wouldn&#8217;t listen to anything that had any connection with music &#8211; which is the Qura&#8217;an of Shaitan. He said we have the best reciters (the likes of Tablaawi, the likes of Abdul Baasit, the likes of  Husri). We can go further to those whom we know in the present day other than al-Mishaawi, but al-Hudhaifi and the ai&#8217;imma of the various masaajid and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The house of the Muslim should have that playing, listening to the recitation of Qura&#8217;an. In this Qura&#8217;an, the house of the Muslim has in it the Qura&#8217;an, has in it the remembrance of Allaah, has in it Sajdah and Rukou, has in it serenity and peace, has in it talking of good. The Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) said that the one who Allaah wants good for, this is from the families &#8212; the husband, wife and children, whom Allaah wants good for, he places between them Rahma. He places between them Mercy &#8211; that if there is good in them, they have between them Rahma or Mercy, so that the house becomes after the Masjid a refuge from Fitnah, a refuge from confusion, a refuge from the call to desires, a refuge from that. The house of a Muslim becomes the house of a Muslim. So who is it that comes in our house and say: bring in a television so that you can witness the Kuffar and learn how to act from the Kuffar and learn how to dress from the Kuffar and learn the ill, sick diseases of the Kuffar? Who is it that puts a gun to our head and said bring to your houses those magazines that impress you about the Kuffar.? Who is it that brings any of this and forces us to look down upon the Qura&#8217;an and let it collect dust on the shelf, and forces us not to teach our children or take 15 minutes or half an hour of the day to teach them the book of Allaah or the Sunnah of the messenger Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam, or some wisdom of the salafus saalih? I don&#8217;t think any one is forced. And if you go further who is it that has us hooked up to our houses with these issues such as Satellite dishes and cable and so on and so forth and to witness things that may be even Shaitan would be ashamed of! Who is it?. No one!! So upon the believer is to make, to build, to construct environments of eemaan. This is a very important matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third cause for those who had righteousness then becoming unrighteous, who had a difficulty falling into sins and sins with the exception and then therefore after that their sins become a rule and becomes a habit. And those who had strong eemaan and now they have weak eemaan what is referred to as &#8220;al-khawr ba&#8217;dil kawr&#8221; &#8211; another reason is the oppressiveness of the society that we live in. This is not just the societies in the countries of the Kuffar but even in the societies of Muslim countries. Even though the oppression is less, no doubt, but what he refers to here is, he means in general.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First and Foremost he is referring to the Muslims. When I read these words you will understand that. So, if that is the case with Muslims in Muslim circles, then what about the one who is surrounded by the oppressive society? What is meant by &#8216;oppressive&#8217;, is the push of the society upon an individual who is sticking to his Deen. What about that? The influence of the Kuffar, the influence of those who are evil upon this type of individual. These are the type of societies that we live in; the Muslim who is trying to stick his Deen is that he mixes with individuals who are not concerned whether or not they disobey Allah. In our case, we mix with people who are around people who are not concerned by whether or not they commit Shirk and Kufr, so what about disobedience? In the sense after Kufr and Shirk everything else is light. So you can see that he is referring to the Muslim countries first, but we have to focus also and know that if this is the case there then our condition here is even worse and so we should pay attention to that. So we mix with individuals who are not concerned with the commission of sins :</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Singing the songs;</li>
<li>listening and calling to music;</li>
<li>Smoking cigarettes or whatever;</li>
<li>Reading dirty magazines or magazines that have no benefit;</li>
<li>One whose tongue is not safe from Gheebah &#8211; backbiting, cursing, swearing and making fun and mockery of the believers.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this Muslim who sticks to Deen when he comes to one of these settings or is invited to a Walimah or Aqeeqah or whatever he finds all types of Munkaraat- all types of evil matters and he finds conversation taking place about matters of Dunya. Either  about trading or &#8216;Thijaarah&#8221;, buying and selling or about a person&#8217;s &#8216;wadiwa&#8217; &#8211; particular business or position that they have in the business world or about wealth or about the acquiring of properties or money or whatever. And the problems of the Dunya and others in that until it is a matter of placing into the heart based upon the conversations, based upon what people are talking about &#8212; a deep love of Dunya in the heart. A deep love of Dunya in the heart !! So therefore the heart becomes hard, and a person backs up on their sticking to the Deen of Allaah. They back up from being righteous. If this person like this has been oppressed by his environment to this degree, mixing, just mere mixing in this way affects him, if you add to that, that he&#8217;s also been tested with some wealth, he has got some money to spend, and if you add to that he may be also tested with a wife, or if it is a sister or a brother who has weak eemaan, or children that are like their father, if his weak in his eemaan, or like their mother if she is weak in eemaan, then he will not be able to be fixed and firm upon his Deen and he will leave those matters and leave being righteous and leave being upright. Then if you find that if he mixes with his kith and kin, (he is referring to the Muslim families) then what about the Kuffar, if his family members are Kuffar? And if he mixes with his kith and kin, his neighbours and his peers, he finds words that are distasteful and mockery, open mockery or hidden mockery. And he finds people who try to advise him to be balanced, that you&#8217;re going to the extreme, your thobe is too far above your ankle, why do u have to let your beard grow that much? See, the type of naseehah  he is given. Yes, the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) said adDeen anNaseehah &#8211; but not  this type of naseehah. This is the type of naseehah he is given to backup from what he is on. Many of them, or many  individuals are tested like this &#8212; backup, fall short and in the end it is possible for that person to lose the Dunya and the Akhira &#8212; to lose this world and the Hereafter. So this is a cause also. And that is why the first issue of being around people who are &#8216;Saalih&#8217; – who are righteous and environments that are righteous is of utmost importance because we begin to mix with those who don&#8217;t mind smoking cigarettes even though it is Haraam, they like to say Makrouh. It is what you hear all the time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As one student of knowledge told one of these individuals, who was smoking, he was looking at him and he said &#8220;Don&#8217;t smoke&#8221;.  The smoking individual, then inhaled a big amounts into his mouth and brought it out of his nose and said, &#8220;its makrouh yaani.&#8221; Is it Makhrou?  This is the type of mentality that you are dealing with. It is not makrouh it is Haraam. So when you mix with these type of individuals it can be dangerous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another issue or reason that people go from being correct or upright to corruption, from being righteous to becoming unrighteous or from being strong in their belief to becoming weak in their belief is Daahf al tarbiyyah Azzaatiyyah&#8217; &#8212; their personal tarbiyyah is weak. Their personal education islamically of themselves and cultivation of themselves is weak. Because the Muslims doesn&#8217;t make sure to watch himself and guard himself and make sure that he cultivates himself and strives against himself, he will fall back upon his heels. There must be times throughout the hours of the day where it is just him and Allaah  tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala. There must be times where he takes a &#8220;Time out&#8221; to be by himself focused on Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala, making Dua, making Ibadah, making Tasbih, Tahmeem, wa tahleel, reflecting upon the names and qualities of Allaah and calling upon Allaah. He must have those times throughout the day, where in those times he judges himself, calls himself to account as Umar Ibn Al Khattab (Amirul Mu&#8217;mineen), the Farouq of this ummah used to say &#8220;call yourself to account before you are called  to account&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the believer takes some time out of the day to look at what he has done of benefit to himself of good deeds and righteousness and whatever and what has he done that is harmful to himself. And therefore make Istighfar &#8211; ask Allaah for forgiveness and make Tawbah – repent to Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala. He must also have some time throughout the day, and this something that one of the students of knowledge Sheikh Abu Abdurrahman Hisham Arif Hafidahullah who teaches Tawhid, Sunnah and the Manhaj of the Salaf-us-Saalih at Masjid Baithul Maqdis &#8211; Masjidul Aqsa  asked the brothers at the last convention of the Qura&#8217;an and Sunnah Society :  &#8220;How many hours do you read a day, some book of knowledge?&#8221; and he said &#8216;you must also in your reading also take notes, you must get into the habit of writing. For this is keeping in accordance with the Sunnah that the Prophet Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam established when he said &#8220;Keep knowledge through writing &#8211; Qayyid ul Ilm fil Kitaab.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So actually physically writing down, and you find that the scholars of the past had books that they called Fawaid &#8211; benefits, a daftar if you will (a notebook) for benefit. When you hear something that is beneficial, it does not have to be under any specific title or anything else you write down the benefit. Who said this, who did this, what was this statement, what was that Umar Ibn Al Khattab said what? Wa kaza, wa kaza wa kaza &#8212; you write it down. So there must be that type of Shirh saalih al ilm and even if it was for a small period of time (half an hour of the day) what is done continuously you will see benefit. You will see benefit, you will see yourself grow and reach a level that you didn&#8217;t think that you were going to reach.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because as they say &#8216;a journey of a thousand, million miles begins with a footstep&#8217;. And little tiny footsteps, you look up and you say how did I get way down here or how did I get way up here? And this is the case with knowledge. So there must be times where an individual uses lil tahseelil ilm wash-shar &#8216;ee to achieve Islaamic knowledge and to teach it and to review it and to present before himself issues that he my not have learnt or knew before &#8212;  to learn something new. It is incorrect to be upon the same level of Deen and knowledge that one was 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12 years ago. That you find that the brother has not made one move or the sister has not made one move, not learnt one ayah more of Qura&#8217;an, not learnt one more hadith, not learnt one more story of the Sahabah. Still can&#8217;t tell you about the Seerah – the life of the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) from his birth to his death, they cant tell you that. They don&#8217;t know the battles that the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) took part in, don&#8217;t know who his wife and children, sons and daughters were, don&#8217;t know who his uncles, aunts and wet-nurses were. What is this? Yet this is Muhammed (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) who is the person we say that we follow and we don&#8217;t know, (these basic things about him). As a matter of fact it gets worse than that since many individuals may know more about an athletic individual who is into athletics, football and basketball, or maybe even worse than that, who is an entertainer, a singer, an actress or an actor. They many know what these guys like from A-Z, know where they were born, where they went to school, what their achievements up on a football field, or a basketball court, but they wouldn&#8217;t know anything about Muhammed ibn Abdullah (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam)? And if you asked them about the Prophet&#8217;s Kunya, they wouldn&#8217;t know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was surprised, I was amazed and we live in a time of amazement. I was amazed, we went to the Masjid and I gave a Khutbah called &#8220;Be like Mustafa&#8221; (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam). Be like Mustafa, walk like Mustafa, talk like Mustafa, dress like Mustafa, act like Mustafa. After the Khutbah, after salah, there were a young group of children saying &#8220;Who is Mustafa&#8221;. Not knowing who is Mustafa? It is one of the names of the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) and that was about whom I was referring to. But if you ask them about Michael Jordan, or you ask them about Pokemon, or you ask them about any of the filth that has come out of the minds of the Kuffar that they have constructed and placed, they know about them.<br />
Where is the Tarbiyyah? There is no Tarbiyyah at all in the majority of cases. Let&#8217;s not fool ourselves. If your child wants to be more like that Mushrik, like that Kafir, dress like him, talk like him, walk like him, be like him and does not know anything about those that you say are the best generations and you make intisaad or connect yourself to the salaf-us saalih, there is no Tarbiyyah   whatsoever.  You can&#8217;t claim to say Tarbiyyah. He should want to wear his thobe to the calf because Ibn Umar wore it that way, to the shin of the leg, because Abdul Masood was like that; he should want to die on a battlefield and be killed because Sa&#8217;ad Ibn Abi Waqas was like that; Abu Bar Ibn Jarar was like that, because most of the salafs were like that. He should want to leave home and seek knowledge because Imaam Shafi was like that, Imaam Ahmed was like that. If this is not happening, if there is not a connection, an emotional tie on the level of the Salaf, and want to follow the salaf, &#8212; there is no Tarbiyah. It is not a matter that we need more Tarbiyyah but we need to establish some Tarbiyyah .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When it becomes a situation where in the hearts there is a love for the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) and his companions, and you know when someone loves someone. For when someone loves someone they want to follow him, especially among the youth, when they like someone they want to dress like him. Look at the Fitnah that took place when that Kafir, May Allah guide him to Islam, that feminine individual called Michael Jackson his effect, the ideas on those who are living in Saudia.  I&#8217;ve seen it myself, can you imagine someone in the city of Muhammed (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) Medina, can you imagine someone who is living in Haramain, wants to move his hands, and wear his hair and have a jacket on like Michael Jackson. This is the absence of Tarbiyyah and we don&#8217;t have to go that far. We can come to our own neighbourhoods, we can look in our own Masjids &#8212; to the right, to the left and look to how individuals act and we can see whether or not if there is any importance placed on following the way of the Salafus Saalih &#8212; in reality not just in talk. So it is important that there be this matter of obtaining knowledge and a reflection and of learning new matters and of review and there should be a times where we  use the Tabliqi bidhi term &#8216;sacrifice  for dawah.&#8217; But the True Dawah not the innovative Dawah, the Dawah tul Kitab us-Sunnah, the Dawahtud Tawhid, there must be times where we have an individual effort of trying to give somebody Dawah &#8212; of the good that Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala has given us. Knowing the hadith of the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) when he said : &#8216;if Allaah guides upon your hands one individual, it is better for you than the red camels.&#8217; – which was the most expensive property amongst the Arabs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There should be dawah and there should be times for the remembrance of Allaah. Yes, times for the remembrance of Allaah, like recitation of Quraan. All of these for what? So that one can guide oneself and preserve oneself, and make sure one is sticking to the Deen of Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another reason for &#8220;al-khawr ba&#8217;dil kawr&#8221; &#8211; misguidance after having guidance, decrease after having increase, unrighteousness after having being righteous, belittling the sins – they look at sins as light, istihaadat az zunoob &#8212; (they try to figure out if it is a Major sin &#8216;Kabair&#8217; or a minor sin &#8216;as-Saghaair&#8217;)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The salafs used to say : &#8216;don&#8217;t look whether the sins are major or minor but look at the greatness of the one who you are  disobeying.&#8217; Don&#8217;t look at whether the sin is major or minor when they split that into that Major or Minor it wasn&#8217;t for the purpose for an individual to take it lightly, just like when they slit Bid&#8217;ah up into Mukaffarah – (Bi&#8217;dah that makes you a Disbeliever) or Bid&#8217;ah Mufasikah – (Bi&#8217;dah that makes you a Faasiq); it wasn&#8217;t for the point that it is easy. Qullu Bid&#8217;ahthin Dalaalah &#8211; every Bid&#8217;ah is going astray. Similarly, all Haraam actions must be avoided. As a matter of fact it is understood that many fires are lit by the smallest pieces of wood and that pebble after pebble after pebble you have a mountain there, and the believer sees sin as related by Mujaahid in Bukhari : &#8220;As if a mountain was ready to fall upon him and a Hypocrite sees this sin as a fly all he has to do is use his hand to shoosh it away&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Looking at matters as seemingly light is another reason why people backup after they were going forward becoming unrighteousness after having being righteous. Abdallah Ibn Mubarak (the great Imam from the Aimma of the Salaf) used to say in a piece of poetry &#8220;I saw that sins kill the heart&#8221; and the person who commits sins inherits humiliation if he continues upon those sins. And that leaving sins gives life to the heart. And the best thing that you can do for yourself is to disobey it. The best thing that you can do for yourself is to disobey yourself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The self wants many things, the self wants temporary satisfaction at the cost of destruction and punishment that it can&#8217;t bear. The self wants ease and relaxation and a fulfillment of desires on the spot, &#8216;ASAP&#8217;, as they say, want it now, instantly &#8212; (as soon as possible). This is how the self is, that&#8217;s why he says Khairun linafsika &#8211; it is better for yourself to disobey it. And you&#8217;ll find every time  you disobey yourself you come out better. Every time you disobey your desires you come out  better. I was planning, I started to do it but I disobeyed, You come out better. And the best thing you can do for yourself is to disobey it. So the sins, and belittling them, &#8216;al-israaru&#8217; continuing upon the sin, it is of the most important reasons or causes why a person goes bad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look into it clearly, look with some clarity, be meticulous in your analysis of it and you find that many individuals who have backed up, they have no problem sinning, it&#8217;s a light thing. They listen to some music and they say : &#8216;I am listening to some music is it a Kabirah? Is it a major sin? I thought that it was okay among scholars.&#8217;… and all this foolishness. It is a matter that is disobedience to Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala  and major or minor one should avoid it. Out of respect for Allaah, like in Suratun Nuh, &#8220;Would you not  have respect for Allaah?&#8221; So this is an important matter, some of us respect the creation, and can see and understand that, I won&#8217;t step on Islaam, I respect it, I won&#8217;t do this, I respect him. But this is Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala&#8217;s sanctuary, those things that he has forbidden. So where is the respect from not falling into that?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qayyim, Sheikhul Islaam (Rahimahullah) said &#8220;From the punishment of the sin is that it weakens ones strength or the heart in its connection in its journey to Allaah.&#8221; We explained before that we are in this world journeying to Allaah. This is a journey and it is just as the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) described Maali wad Dunya, what is meant by the Dunya? Except like a traveller who slept under a tree, just a relaxation, got up and moved on.&#8221; It&#8217;s a journey to Allaah, and it&#8217;s a journey back to our country, and our country is the Jannah, because our father Adam (alai wa sallam) came from there. No matter how many generations or how many people go somewhere else, you come from the country of your father. So you return to that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as Ibn Qayyim Rahimahullah says : we have been oppressed and imprisoned by our enemy, taken prisoners of war by Iblis, now if we break from that and break from disobedience to Allaah and come  to obedience to Allaah in our journey to Allaah  tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala and having Ikhlas, khawf,  having Taqwa having hope, having trust, and having submission and so on and so forth of the levels of the journey, then we will eventually get back to our country, no doubt about that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala has explained the Siraat, the path. We&#8217;ve got the map, we&#8217;ve got the directions, we know the Zaad al Maad &#8211; the provision for the Hereafter, we got the provisions, it is just a matter of staying upon the path and continuing our journey. The sins are blocks and obstacles and they cause weakness in this journey, weakness in the journey of the heart to the Hereafter and obstacles and they may even cut one off from the path. The sin would be similar to a highway robber coming to you and taking your provision and kicking you off the road and leaving you in the middle of the desert. The sin would be similar to a mountain  being in your way, and you cant move it and you can&#8217;t get a around it. So it weakens it. He says this obstacle cuts off ones path of sin or weakens one, that it doesn&#8217;t do worse than that, which is to turn a person all the way around and send him travelling in a totally different direction. So the sin is a veil, and veils of darkness that stop an individual from achieving or continuing on his journey and they can turn around his search. The heart travels to Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala upon this journey with the strength that Allaah  blesses it with. So if the heart becomes sick from sins and it becomes weak, this strength is gone and therefore what is the situation with its ability to continue the journey? Its ability to continue the journey is very weak. So this is Ibn Qayyim&#8217;s point, even though I said in a very articulate way, you can see that that&#8217;s the case. Belittling sins have results, disastrous, dangerous results upon individuals who belittles or looks down or thinks sins are light.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The First or one of the results rather is that it makes a person increase in sin. It is like a call that says, &#8216;what is this is light, let me do some more  let me fall into it some more, let me acquire some more&#8217;, and it is that which takes a person far away from the path of Tawbah. Tawbah was something close when the sin was first committed or when it was the matter of understanding the greatness of sin or how harmful it is but when it is made lighter, tawbah is something far away from the mind of the individual. And it calls an individual to have absence of avoiding the people of sin. It means to say, because the individual is involved in sin, has no problem with other individuals involved in sin. I am involved in sin, he&#8217;s involved in sin, so therefore they start to hang out with other sinners, the bad crowd, the bad guys, the bad people, the type of fellows you don&#8217;t want to be around. Talk to them, sit with them , mix with them. Sins could also cause an individual many times, of course based upon this, to stay away from the people who are righteous. I don&#8217;t want to be around the brothers who are righteous, I don&#8217;t want to see right now the brothers who have Taqwa. This alone is one of the biggest or greatest means of a person going astray after once before they were upon the straight path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another issue of the issues or reasons of &#8220;al-khawr ba&#8217;dil kawr&#8221; &#8211; unrighteousness after being righteous, being corrupt after having being one who was upright is al-ghuroor – being delusioned or having Self delusion, self delusion &#8216;wal ijaab&#8217; &#8211; astonishment or amazement with oneself. This you find among many of those who believe that they are sticking to the Kitab as-Sunnah, who believe that they are righteous, they have this ghuroor, and they have this ijaab and everyone can understand the difference between illusion and a delusion.  Illusion is when you see something and you know its not real, delusion is that you believe that something be real when it&#8217;s not. So they believe that they have this righteousness, this greatness sometimes they call this &#8216;the holier than thou attitude, and this ujoo – this astonishment with oneself, is that you find this a lot, he said no doubt that&#8217;s in the cities of knowledge, being around righteous people, show that a person has some good within him. But if this self delusion and astonishment enters upon a person, it has the effect of making this person feel they are perfect or that they are more complete than others. Therefore he doesn&#8217;t feel the need to  increase his effort. I&#8217;m doing well, I&#8217;m doing fine, I&#8217;m righteous, no need to do anymore, I attend circles of knowledge, those are the people who don&#8217;t. I&#8217;m in the Masjid other people aren&#8217;t.  So this type of ghuroor or amazement, so therefore this individual doesn&#8217;t try to do more khair, doesn&#8217;t try to do more righteous actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a person becomes astonished with oneself there comes away from his heart the fear of a bad ending. And he feels safe from being lead astray after having guidance, and this is a sign from the weakness of his self and it is one of the means of a person turning away and going the wrong direction, and getting misguided after having guidance. And when one becomes amazed and astonished with oneself he begins to become busy with the faults of others and he doesn&#8217;t try to deal with the faults of himself. And because the self needs to be dealt with so therefore this ghuroor must be dealt with, this ghuroor &#8212; this self delusion, this amazement, I&#8217;m more righteous, I&#8217;m more good, I&#8217;m on Istiqaamah, I have  more Ilm and safety from Dalalah. How can one feel safe from Dalaalah &#8212; being lead astray? There are two matters and both of them are kufr :<br />
1)    One of them is  to lose hope in the Mercy of Allaah – to give up</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2)     The other, is to feel safe from the plotting of Allaah. To feel safe from Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala punishing one for ones misdeeds. Safe !!! That is also Kufr. It is Kufr, so this has to be understood also. This has to be dealt with. How do you deal with?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many righteous matters or morals that one must obtain is by doing the opposite of it. If one finds himself selfish, it is for him to become generous; If one finds Himself arrogant it is for him to be humble. Similarly, in this way he has to have humility, he has to have fear, and he has to work on the correction of his faults before starting with anyone else. Work on his faults before starting on his wife; work upon his faults before starting on his children; work upon his faults before starting on this brother and that brother, this community and that community. &#8220;Islaah&#8221; &#8211; start with oneself first and Tawbah – repenting to Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I&#8217;ll try to wrap it up. Another reason why people go astray after having been upon guidance, going from Sunnah to Bi&#8217;dah or from righteousness to sins is their companions &#8216;as-Sadeeq wa saahib&#8217; &#8212; their companions. The people you sit with has this effect, has an affect upon the person&#8217;s path and behaviour. There is no doubt about that. If the friend that one is with looks at bad films or looks at bad magazines or listens to music and that will have an effect upon the one who is a companion with him. These type of mukhalafaat &#8211; or matters that are disobedient comes in between two companions and the companion doesn&#8217;t forbid it but rather he lets that slide, lets this one slide and pretty soon it has an effect upon him. Has an effect upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore you could have a companion also, but of course this is lesser of an evil than that, one who is short in his Ibadah &#8212; he is short in his worship so he stops doing Sunnan &#8211; he doesn&#8217;t do Sunnah Raatiba, he stops doing Sunnah raatiba. This is the effect of what? Companionship !! And it can go to such a level that if your friend backs up and if your companion backs up, you back up. So therefore, you must choose a righteous companion. The one who will help one be upon obedience to Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala. Like it says in the Hadith &#8216;Ar Rajlu ala deeni khaleeli&#8217; the man is upon the Deen of his friend, so look to who you befriend&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many other reasons that lead to this misguidance after having being guidance, weak eemaan after having strong eemaan, and sometimes as we say Bid&#8217;ah after having being on Sunnah, Kufr and shirk after having being on eemaan and Tawhid. One of it is having weakness in ones strength or sticking and not having the patience to deal with the difficulty. The one upon the Deen of Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala will be tested and there will be storms of fitnah, the fitnah of desires and the Fitnah of doubt. There will be good days, there will be happy days, there will be nicest situations, there will be circumstances that are difficult. This requires a person with strength and steadfastness and sticking and patience to deal with those type of matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another matter is &#8216;Taw al amal&#8221; &#8212; having this view point that your going to live along time, when death is closer than the shoe laces!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Wal-Ghuloo&#8221; &#8212; being extreme is another reason with some people. You find them extreme over night. Overnight his thobe&#8217;s to his ankle, over night he is on Sunnah, over night he has books of Aqeedah, over night, over night, over night he is so hard upon the people and extreme and the next day or two days later or a year later he doesn&#8217;t have a beard, he doesn&#8217;t even come to Masjid. &#8216;Ghuloo&#8217; &#8211; extreme. And be shadeed upon himself, placing upon ones shoulder what one cannot bear, more than one cannot bear, forgetting the fact that Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala does not place a burden upon a soul more than he can bear.  Some of us make the Deen hard, some of us that make it extreme. The prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) would not have the choice between two matters both of them being Halaal except he would chose the what? the easier. We act as if we can better than Mustafa (alaihi wa sallam). &#8220;I want the hardest.&#8221; This is not the way and this leads to a person backing up because the self can only take so much, so therefore after a year of this extremism one comes to a point of saying, &#8216;what am I doing?&#8217; &#8212; and backs up from everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also &#8216;am-Muraad al Quloob&#8217; &#8211; the illnesses of the heart , &#8216;wa afaatul Lisaan&#8217; &#8211; and the mistakes of the tongue. And illnesses of the heart are many &#8216;Riya&#8217;—to be seen, &#8216;Kibr&#8217; &#8211; pride so on and so forth, or sicknesses of the tongue like &#8216;Gheebah&#8217; &#8212; backbiting, &#8216;Nameemah&#8217; &#8211; slander so on and so forth, lying and cursing and all of this. These are also means that lead to what? a person being unrighteous after they were righteous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another reason he says is &#8216;Da&#8217;fash sha&#8217;khsiyyah&#8217; &#8212; that the person within himself has a weak personality. And therefore finds himself always following other personalities. So if he has a weakness in personalities, and his Islamic  personality is weak, he finds himself following other personalities. This will also eventually lead a person turning away after they were straight, or being misguided after they had guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many reasons. We must mention some of the remedies to make it balanced Insha&#8217;allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most important issue he says is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Al-Ikhlas&#8217; &#8211; sincerity and &#8216;was-Sidq&#8217; &#8211; truthfulness with Allaah. This is the best means of achieving &#8216;Istiqaamah&#8217; &#8211; uprightness and Salah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qayyim (Rahimullah) says, &#8220;One finds difficulty to leave that which one is used to and what is ones habit &#8211; what one leaves for other than Allaah. But the one who leaves matters of disobedience and sins and those things that are wrong for Allaah and leave them truthfully, sincerely for Allaah, he only finds difficulty in the beginning of leaving it , and this is how Allaah tests him to see if he is truthful or not or he is lying. He wants to leave his sin that he&#8217;s being doing, saying that I am sincere to Allaah, Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala may give him the opportunity and test him. He&#8217;ll find some difficulty at first, and this is to see if he is truthful. If he is truthful he will fight himself, he&#8217;ll fight his desires, he&#8217;ll strive to go against it and if he is lying that won&#8217;t be the case. He says he will find difficulty, but the one who is patient upon this difficulty &#8216;kaleelan&#8217; – a little, Allaah  tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala will place, in place of that desire or for that sin, a sweetness and a love, and a deliciousness for that which is right, that which is good&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An this has been narrated in many Ahadith that he who leaves looking at that which is Haraam, Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala will give him (some of the Hadith says) courage and Allaah  tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala will give him strength and that&#8217;s what you find, those who have the most courage and the most strength is those who turn their eyes, keep their eyes away from that which Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala has forbidden. He who leaves something for Allaah, Allaah will give him better than that.<br />
&#8216;Man taraka shai&#8217;in lillaah&#8217; &#8212;  Allaah gives him better than that all the time. Leave this sin, Allaah will give a righteous deed better than that &#8212; of course it&#8217;s not the sin itself, (righteousness is better) &#8212; but what he means is that Allaah will replace it with something that you could not have imagined, something that you could not have imagined, but he has to be what Sabr &#8211; Patience, it has to be a willing to go through the examination and the test.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second matter as mentioned before is &#8216;al-khawf min sural khaatimah&#8217; &#8211; fear of a bad ending. The Mumin-as- Sadiq the true believer must fear a bad ending and stay away from anything that will lead to that. Did you not hear what Yusuf (alai salaam) said, &#8220;Oh Alaah, cause me to die as a Muslim and place me with the righteous,&#8221; and all the Prophets of Allaah were making dua like that. They were making dua for what? for a good ending, that they die upon Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Sufyaan athawri (Rahimullaah), that great Imam, that great Sheikh of Islam, cried one night, cried one night all the way till morning, (you think our crying is something?)  He did not cry for 15 minutes or half hour, cried all the way from night till morning. When he was asked, &#8220;Why are you crying or why did you cry?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I cried from having an evil end from the fear from having an evil end.&#8221; This is why he cried and called Imaam Barbahaari, the one who is the Sheikh-al-Sunnah (radiallaahu anhu)   who said &#8220;You must know that it is a must upon the servant that he has with him &#8216;as-Shafaqah abadan&#8217; &#8211; a mercy and a fear connected at all times because he doesn&#8217;t know upon what he would die, he doesn&#8217;t know how his life would end and he doesn&#8217;t know in what condition he would meet Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala. Therefore, he should be doing what? Every deed of good he can, every deed of good he can.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another help in this regard is to continuously do the righteous action, don&#8217;t start one action, a righteous action and then stop, i.e. start Qiyamul Layl or Tahajjud and then stop, start memorizing the Quraan and then stop, verily the deeds most loved by Allaah are those which are done regularly, (continuously) even if they are a small amount. Also taking certain times to hear admonition &#8216;Maw&#8217;idah&#8217;, the Hereafter, the grave, &#8212; not everyday &#8212; that&#8217;s not the way of the Salafus Saalih, but every so often. As Ibn Masud said, that the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) used to choose times to give us &#8216;Maw&#8217;idah&#8217; because if you do it everyday fearing that we become bored with it. And there are other means of making sure, or hoping, because no one can make sure except Allaah, but hoping that one will be upon Istiqaamah.  This is just some that we were able to mention in this sitting. We hope that it benefits us and it benefits all who listen, we ask Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala to make it sincerely for His face not having in it any Riya or summ&#8217;ah, verily Allaah is able to do all that. Wassallaahu ala nabi ina Muhammad wa&#8217;ala as-haabihee ajma een.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Ibaanah Magazine , Issue No.1<br />
By Shaykh ’Abdur-Rahman ibn Hasan Alush-Shaykh [1] , (d.1285H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullâh<br />
</i>Source: Fathul-Majîd Sharh Kitâbit-Tawhîd (pp.470-473).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Love for Allâh</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ’Abdur-Rahmân ibn Hasan said: [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allâh – <i>the Most High</i> &#8211; says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“</b><b>Say: If you truly love Allâh, then follow me, and Allâh will love you.</b>” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <i>âyah</i> is also known as <i>Ayatul-Muhabbah</i> (the <i>âyah</i> about love). Some of the <i>Salaf</i> have said, “The people claimed that they loved Allâh, so Allâh the Most High revealed the <i>âyah</i> about <i>muhabbah</i> (love), <b>“</b><b>Say: If you truly love Allâh, then follow me, and Allâh will love you.</b>” [3] So this <i>âyah</i> indicates the proofs and evidences for <i>muhabbah</i> and its fruits and benefits. So from the proofs of <i>muhabbah</i> and its clear signs is: to follow the Messenger <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>; and from its fruits and its benefits is: that Allâh will love you. So whosoever does not seek to follow the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>, then such a person will not attain the love of Allâh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Characteristics of True Love</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh – the Most High – also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“</b><b>O you who believe! If any of you turns back from his religion</b> (then wait)<b> Allâh will create a people who will love Him and He will love them, who will be soft and gentle with the Believers and harsh with the disbelievers, who will fight in the path of Allâh, and will not be afraid of the blame from the blamers.</b>” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here, Allâh has mentioned four characteristics of those who love Him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Firstly and Secondly</i>: they are gentle and soft towards the Believers. It is said that this means: to be merciful, compassionate and kind. ’Atâ‘ (d.114H) – <i>rahimahullâh</i> – said, “A Believer’s gentleness for another Believer is like that of a child towards his father, or a slave towards his beloved master; and against the disbeliever, it is like that of a lion towards its prey: <b>“</b><b>Strong against the disbelievers, and merciful towards each other.</b>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b></b> [5] ”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thirdly, <i>Jihâd</i> in the Path of Allâh with the soul, the hand, the tongue, and with wealth and property. This is the characteristic by which the true <i>muhabbah</i> is ascertained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fourthly, they are not afraid of the blame and reproach of the blamers. This being the truest characteristic of <i>muhabbah</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the one claiming <i>muhabbah</i>, whilst loving his beloved, fears the blames and reproaches or others, then this is in reality, not considered to be true <i>muhabbah</i>. Allâh the Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“</b><b>Those whom they call upon, themselves desire the wasîlah</b> (means of approach)<b> to their Lord to which of them should be nearest. They hope for His mercy and fear His punishment.</b>” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here, three levels which are linked to <i>muhabbah</i> have been mentioned, [i] Love, which is desiring to seek nearness to Him; [ii] <i>at-Tawassul</i> (seeking the means of approach) to Him, through righteous and correct actions; [iii] Hope and fear, a proof of desiring the means of approach to Him through righteous and correct actions is that such actions are done hoping in His mercy and also fearing His punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is known with necessity that seeking nearness (to Allâh) can only be achieved when there is a desire and love for this, and the desire and love for seeking nearness (to Him) stems from love of Him. Indeed, true love for Him necessitates desiring to draw near to Him. However, the <i>Jahmiyyah</i> and the <i>Mu’attilah</i>, none of this has any value. Since, in their (false) view, Allâh does not draw near to anyone, nor does anyone draw near to Him, nor does He love anyone. So they deny life for the hearts, bliss for the souls, coolness for the eyes and highlights the delights of this world and the Hereafter. And due to this denial, their hearts became hardened, and between them and Allâh there came barriers and obstacles from knowing Him and loving Him. They do not know Him, nor do they seek to love Him, nor do they mention Him, except by negating and denying His Names and Attributes. They criticize and condemn those who make mention of the perfect and majestic Names and the Attributes of Allâh, accusing them of that which is more befitting to be attributed to themselves! And sufficient is it for one possessing knowledge and possessing a heart with life, that they view the sayings of such people with harshness, contempt and hatred; knowing that such people have disassociated themselves from the love of Allâh the Most High and from knowing and understanding His Uniqueness and Oneness (with respect to His Names, Attributes and Actions).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>A Comprehensive Definition</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullâh</i> &#8211; says:<br />
“There cannot be clearer recognition of <i>mahabbah</i> than this, and this recognition in itself increases love for Allâh. And people have discussed (at lengths) about <i>mahabbah</i> &#8211; its causes, its signs, its fruits, its supports and its rulings. The most comprehensive of what has been said about this is what Abû Bakr al-Katânî relates from al-Junayd (d.297H):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abû Bakr al-Katânî said:<br />
A discussion about mahabbah took place in Makkah, during pilgrimage season. The Shaykhs who were present spoke about this topic, and al-Junayd being the youngest of them. They said to him: What do you say, O ’Irâqî? So al-Junayd lowered his head and tears were gushing from his eyes, then he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i> “A servant should overcome his soul,<br />
And be continuous in the remembrance of his Lord,<br />
Establishing the rights of his Lord,<br />
Focusing upon Him with his heart,<br />
The light of fear setting ablaze his heart,<br />
Whilst drinking from the vessel of pure love,<br />
And certain hidden realities being unveiled for him.<br />
So when he talks, it is due to Allâh,<br />
When he speaks, it is from Allâh,<br />
When he moves, it is by the Command of Allâh,<br />
And when he is serene, then it is from Allâh,<br />
He belongs to Allâh, is for Allâh and is with Allâh.</i><i>”</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Upon hearing, the Shaykhs all started weeping, and they said: There is nothing left to add to that, may Allâh reward you O Crown of the Knowledgeable Ones.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Developing Love for Allâh</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim &#8211; <i>rahimahullâh</i> &#8211; says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The reasons which cause mahabbah of Allâh to develop, are ten:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Firstly</i>: Reciting the Qur‘ân, reflecting and understanding its meaning and its intent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Secondly</i>: Drawing closer to Allâh &#8211; the Most High &#8211; through optional deeds, after fulfilling the obligatory duties.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Thirdly</i>: Being continuous in the <i>dhikr</i> (remembrance) of Allâh, with the tongue, the heart and the limbs &#8211; under all circumstances. The more constant the <i>dhikr</i>, the more <i>mahabbah</i> develops and intensifies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Fourthly</i>: Giving precedence to what Allâh loves over personal loves, when being overcome by desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Fifthly</i>: Contemplating and deliberating over the Names and Attributes of Allâh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Sixthly</i>: Recognising and remembering the favours and bounties of Allâh &#8211; both the manifest and hidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Seventhly</i>: To be humble and submissive before Allâh &#8211; and this is the greatest matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Eightly</i>: To be in seclusion reciting the Qur‘ân, during that time in which Allâh descends to the lowest heaven (which is the last third of every night), finishing this recitation with seeking Allâh’s forgiveness and repenting to Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Ninthly</i>: To sit in the gatherings of true and sincere lovers of Allâh, reaping the fruits of their speech, and not to speak except if there is benefit in it and that you know that such talk will increase you in goodness and that it will benefits others as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tenthly: To stay clear of all those causes which distances the heart from Allâh &#8211; <i>the Mighty and Majestic</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are the ten reasons which cause the person to develop true love for Allâh and to reach the rank of <i>al-muhabbah</i>, by which he reaches his Beloved.” [7]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;" align="center"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Indeed <em>Eemaan</em> is worn out inside one of you just like a <em>thawb</em> (garment) is worn out, so ask Allaah to revive <em>Eemaan</em> in your hearts.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The lofty rank and high station <em>eemaan</em> possesses is not something obscure, as it is unquestionably the most important duty as well as being the most imperative of all obligations. It is also the greatest and most glorious of them. All the good in the world and the Hereafter is dependent upon the presence of eemaan and on its soundness and integrity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Eemaan</em> holds such a multitude of benefits, ripe fruits, delicious produce, constant food and continual goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is within this context that those certain folk embarked upon and competed with each other in directing their attention to trying to actualize and fulfill eemaan. For the <em>Muslim</em> who is granted the <em>tawfeeq</em>, his concern for his <em>eemaan</em> is greater than any other concern he may have &#8211; and this must be so. When this became evident to the <em>Salaf</em> of this <em>Ummah</em>, the first and best of this <em>Ummah</em>, their concern for their <em>eemaan</em> was very eminent and the attention they gave to it was enormous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They, may <em>Allaah</em> be pleased and have mercy upon them, used to tend to their <em>eemaan</em>, inspect their actions, and give each other advice. Reports of this nature from the <em>Salaf</em> are numerous. Some of their statements include:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8216;Umar Ibn al-Khattaab (radhiyAllaahu ‘anhu)</em> used to say to his companions: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Come on, so that we may increase our <em>eemaan</em>”.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Aboo Dardaa’(radhiyAllaahu ‘anhu)</em> used to say: “It is from the intelligence of the servant to know whether he is increasing or decreasing, and indeed, it is from the intelligence of the servant to know how, where and when the whispers of shaytaan appear to him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>‘Abdur-Rahmaan Ibn ‘Amr al-Awzaa’ee (rahimahullaah)</em> was asked about eemaan: “Does it increase?” He replied, “Yes, until it becomes like mountains. He was then asked, “Does it decrease?” He answered, “Yes, up until there is nothing left of it.” <strong>[Causes Behind the Increase and Decrease of Eemaan by Shaykh &#8216;Abdur-Razzaak al-&#8216;Abbaad from AbdurRahman. org]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, it can be seen that the matter of <em>eemaan</em> is a tremendous affair, which each one of us must pay close attention to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our <em>Shaykh Khalid &#8216;Uthmaan (hafidhahullaah)</em> will admonish us concerning this crucial topic and explain to us the ways in which we can increase our <em>eemaan</em> and by the Permission of <strong>Allaah</strong> we will all act upon the advices offered and thus have our <em>eemaan</em> renewed and increased.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask <strong>Allaah</strong> to grant us all lasting <em>eemaan</em>, true certainty and beneficial knowledge.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Muwahhideen</em> Publications organized a LIVE Tele-Lecture with the Noble<em> Shaykh Muhammad ibn Rabee&#8217; ibn Hadi&#8217; al-Madkhalee</em> (May <strong>Allaah </strong>Preserve Him), son of <em>Ash-Shaykh al-Allaamah Rabee&#8217; ibn Hadi al-Madkhalee</em> (May <strong>Allaah</strong> Preserve Him) and a professor of <em>Aqeedah</em> in The<em>Islaamic</em> University of <em>Madeenah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Shaykh</em> delivered a heart felt reminder of some very important issues of eeman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>This lecture event was translated LIVE by our brother Abu Suhailah Umar Quinn</strong><em>.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Listen / <a href="http://salafiaudio.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/let_us_sit_down_and_believe_for_a_while_-_shaykh_muhammad_ibn_rabee_al-madkhalee.mp3" target="_blank">Download Mp3 Here</a></strong> (<strong>Time 1:18:52</strong> )<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">Our noble <em>Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Rabee’ (hafidhahullaah)</em> commenced this beautiful heart felt admonition by stating, <span style="color:#008000;">“How great is the need of the heart that we nurture it and provide it with the nutrition that it needs to supply its eemaan. Just as vegetation needs water, the heart needs that which will give it life; so we are in dire need of the likes of this subject matter.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continued his introduction by saying that we live in an era that is worlds apart from the peaceful time of the Messenger <em>(sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em> and these times are very difficult upon the hearts of the people. Over the course of the last century the situation of mankind have become quite complicated and this over complication has led to the death of the hearts of the people so we need to do what it takes in order to resuscitate their hearts. He proceeded to say that the hearts of the <em>Muslims</em> need to be reminded of <strong>Allaah</strong> and we must reflect over the creation of <strong>Allaah</strong>, reflect on the miracles He sent His Messengers with and we need to deeply contemplate and imagine as though we were present when these miracles occurred. We need to imagine what it would have been like to witness these miracles and how it would have affected our <strong>eemaan</strong> had we been there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our <em>Shaykh</em> then went on to mention the stories of different Prophets and implored us to reflect upon them and imagine ourselves as being present with the Prophets of <strong>Allaah</strong> and the believers in those times. He continued by stating that many have abandoned the Qur’aan and when we do read the <em>Qur’aan</em>, it is without contemplation. Some read the <em>Qur’aan</em> only in Ramadhaan solely to finish it, again with no contemplation.  We have neglected reflecting over the <em>Qur’aan</em> which is the greatest of miracles and will remain as such until the Day of Judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh Muhammad</em> highlighted specific stories from the Book of <strong>Allaah</strong>, urging us to reflect upon them and imagine ourselves with the Prophets <em>Nuh</em>,<em>Ibraheem</em>, <em>Musaa</em> and <em>Muhammad (alayhum as-salaam)</em>; the effect it would have on our <em>eemaan</em> and certainty in <strong>Allaah</strong> and how we would increase in our understanding that <strong>Allaah</strong> has the power to do everything, is in charge of everything and there is no limit to His power and Knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another benefit as mentioned by the <em>Shaykh</em> after referring to <em>Soorah At-Takaathur</em> is the three types of <em>yaqeen</em> mentioned in the <em>Qur’aan</em>. They are:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><em>‘ilmul-yaqeen</em> which is certainty that comes with having knowledge of something,</li>
<li><em>‘aynul-yaqeen</em> that comes on account of witnessing something and</li>
<li><em>haqqul-yaqeen</em> which is when someone experiences something and knows it is a reality without doubt.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In closing the <em>Shaykh</em> explained that <em>eemaan</em> is of different levels so there is room to increase it; we are in need of increasing our <em>eemaan</em> and<em>yaqeen</em>. He then went on to say that in <em>Saudi Arabia</em> they have been continuously making <em>du’a</em> and performing <em>Salaatul Istisqaa</em> beseeching <strong>Allaah</strong>for rain but the rain has not come. He said nothing is impossible for <strong>Allaah</strong> to do but due to the weakness of the people’s eemaan and them engaging in deception, trickery, lying and all sorts of disobedience in addition to consuming unlawful wealth and food, our <em>du’a</em> is not being answered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our beloved <em>Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Rabee’</em> ended this truly inspiring admonition by making <em>du’a</em> to <strong>Allaah</strong>, asking Him to strengthen our <em>eemaan</em>, make us from those who contemplate on the <em>Qur’aan</em> and benefit from it; that He strengthens the <em>Muslims</em>, give them victory and return them back to their religion and that He destroys and humiliates the enemies of the religion from the <em>kuffaar</em>, <em>munaafiqoon</em>, the <em>raafidhah</em> and the like; and that<strong>Allaah</strong> restores honour to <em>Islaam</em> and the <em>Muslims</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We encourage our brothers and sisters to listen to and benefit from this tremendous reminder</p>
<p><em>Wa Billaahi Tawfeeq</em></p>
<p><em>Wa SallAllaahu wa Sallaama wa Barak &#8216;alaa Nabiyanna Muhammad wa &#8216;alaa &#8216;Alyhi wa Sahbyhi wa Sallam</em></p>

It bears fruit all the time by its Lord&#8217;s permission. Allah sets forth metaphors for people so that hopefully they will pay heed.&#8221; </span></strong>[Ibrahim (14): 24-25]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah has likened the statement of faith, which is the best of statements, with a tree that is the best of trees bearing these noble characteristics. Its roots are firm, it is always growing and maturing and it bears fruit all the time, directing its numerous benefits and delectable fruits to its owner and others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This tree varies greatly in the hearts of the believers, changing in accordance to the variation of the qualities that Allah has described it with. Therefore it is upon the servant to hasten towards acquiring knowledge about it, its descriptions, that which leads to its existence and potency, its roots and its branches. It is upon him to expend his efforts in actualizing this tree in terms of knowledge and action for indeed his portion of goodness and success, happiness in this life and the Hereafter, is dependant upon the extent to which this tree [is implanted in his heart].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#888888;"><em>{Taken from the al-&#8216;Allaamah &#8216;Abdur-Rahmaan Ibn Naasir as-Sa&#8217;dee&#8217;s Introduction of the Book &#8221; The Tree of Faith&#8221;}</em></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bismillaah Al-Hamdulillaah wa salatu wa salaamu &#8216;ala rasulullaah<br />
Amma-ba&#8217;d</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following are some of the tremendous benefits [not verbatim] that Shaikh Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdul-Wahhab al-&#8216;Aqeel (hafidhahullaah Ta&#8217;aala) shared in a <em>Dars</em> (lesson) concerning the topic of the Angels and their relationship to mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#c00000;">Loving each other &#8211; only for Allaah&#8217;s sake, not for wordly purposes</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the greatest blessings of Allaah is the blessing of brotherhood for Allaah, which the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said is a foundation of Eeman: <strong><em>Awthaq &#8216;Ural Eeman Al-Hubu fillaah wal-bughdu fillaah</em> (The strongest handhold of Eeman is love for Allaah and hatred for Allaah).</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>There are three characteristics that if a person has them, he will taste the sweetness of Eeman: that Allaah and His Messenger are more beloved to him than anything; that he loves an individual, and does not love him except for Allaah; and that he hates to return to disbelief (after believing) just as he hates to be thrown into the fire.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the Day of Judgement, Allaah will raise the level of the believers who have loved each other for Allaah&#8217;s Pleasure, and shade those who have loved each other for His pleasure, as comes in the hadeeth of the seven whom Allaah will shade.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#c00000;"><strong>Allaah raises &#8211; by degrees &#8211; those who believe in a detailed manner above those who believe in a general manner</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After mentioning the well-known <span style="color:#1274a7;font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif;">Hadeeth of Jibreel</span><span style="font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif;"> &#8211; which includes the statement of the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) (what means): &#8220;<strong>Eeman is to believe in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, and to believe in The Last Day, and the Qadr &#8211; its good and its bad</strong>&#8221; &#8211; Shaikh Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdul-Wahhab al-&#8216;Aqeel (hafidhahullaah) then said:</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;These six matters are the matters that Eeman is built upon. The (Muslims) are of two different types as it relates to these six articles. The first type of people believe in them, but they believe in them in a general manner. And this belief is beneficial for them,<em> in-sha` Allaah</em>. The second type of (Muslims) believe in these six articles in a detailed manner. And this (detailed) Eeman has raised the second type by degrees over the first type.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said (what means): &#8230;<strong>Allaah will exalt in degree those of you who believe, and those who have been granted knowledge. And Allaah is Well-Acquainted with what you do.</strong> (Al-Mujadilah, ayah 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and Allaah informs us (what means): <strong>&#8230;It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves who fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is All-­Mighty, Oft­-Forgiving. </strong>(Fatir, ayah 28)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#c00000;">The Angels and their <em>&#8216;Alaaqa</em> (relationship) to Mankind</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-&#8216;Aqeel (hafidhahullaah) brought to attention that angels attend these gatherings and they fill the space between the gathering and the heavens, and afterward they rise toward Allaah, Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;aala, and Allaah asks the angels where they came from (although He knows). [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The relationship that the angels have with mankind is even stronger than the <em>&#8216;alaaqa</em> (relationship) that mankind&#8217;s own souls have with them. What is the angels&#8217; relationship with mankind?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah told the angels that He would create mankind before He created mankind. Before Allaah created the shape of Adam, they knew that Allaah was making the shape of Adam. When Allaah shaped Adam, the angels saw the creation of Adam. The angels saw Adam when he was clay, before the soul was blown into him. The angels saw Adam when the soul was blown into him. The angels prostrated to Adam after the soul was blown into him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Adam and the angels were in heaven, then together on earth. And the angel is with the life from the instant that a man enters his wife, and the sperm enters her. So the angels are with us even before we are created! The angels [who saw Adam &#8211; the father of all of mankind &#8211; when he was clay] are with the offspring of Adam when he is just a <em>nutfah</em> (sperm), and then a clot, and then a little lump of flesh, then bones, and then flesh. [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the angels are with us during all five stages.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If Allaah wants to give life to this being, and He has created for that being a soul, then the angel receives that soul from Allaah and he breathes it into the body that is inside the stomach of a woman. And there maybe two or three or four or more souls in the stomach.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The angels do not make any mistake!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If that soul is supposed to be in that body, then that&#8217;s where it&#8217;s going to be. Then the angels write the being&#8217;s actions, provisions, wretched or blessed, and his destiny. If the being is born, he is accompanied by an angel and also a devil. The angel commands him with good, and encourages him to do that. And the devil commands him with evil, and encourages him to do that. And this is established in the Saheeh of Imam Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>There is none amongst you except that he has been assigned a partner from the angels and a partner from the jinn.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if you know this hadeeth, then you&#8217;ll know the answer to a very important question. Some people go to the doctor, and ask him: I hear three different things in my head. Number one says, &#8220;Go to the salat.&#8221; Number two says, &#8220;No, no. Sleep now.&#8221; Number three says, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So anything the individual wants to do, he will find three voices. So if it is good, such as the salat and being kind to parents and keeping relations with kin, he will find a voice encouraging him upon it, a voice commanding him away from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who commands with good, he is your companion from the angels. As for the one who commands you with evil, it is your companion from the jinn. And you are in the middle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-&#8216;Aqeel (hafidhahullaah) also mentioned that Allaah assigns angels to protect us until the command of Allaah comes, and they (the angels) one after the other &#8211; as in shifts &#8211; protect, by Allaah&#8217;s Command.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said (what means): <strong>For each (person), there are angels in succession, before and behind him. They guard him by the command of Allaah.</strong> (Ra&#8217;d, ayah 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And for example, the one who recites ayat al-kursee [ayah 255 of Sooratul-Baqarah] before he sleeps, then an angel is sent from the heaven to guard him until he awakes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Muslim who believes in the angels will not be someone who is scared, because he knows that he will be protected, by the command of Allaah, until the command of Allaah comes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has assigned the angels to mankind from before his birth til after his death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#c00000;">From those actions of the angels that relate to the human being:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1</strong>&#8211; Used to protect him while he was just a fetus in the stomach of his mother.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2</strong>&#8211; Breathed the soul into his body.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3</strong>&#8211; After the birth, they encouraged him/her to do good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4</strong>&#8211; Write down his good deeds and bad deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>5</strong>&#8211; It comes in the hadeeth that the angel who writes the good deeds is on the right-hand side, and the angel who writes the evil deeds is on the left-hand side. And the angel who writes the good deeds is <em>ameer</em> (in charge) over the angel who writes the evil deeds. If a Muslim does a good deed, the angel on the right-hand side writes the good deed immediately. If he does an evil deed, the angel on the right-hand side (the one in charge) tells the angel on the left, &#8220;Don&#8217;t write it down. Wait; he may repent.&#8221; And it comes in another hadeeth that he is given [six (Islaamic) hours (six periods of time)] to make tawbah. <strong>And if he does [repent in those six hours], the sin is not even written down! </strong>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>6</strong>&#8211; The angels write down <strong>four</strong> different things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#4040ff;">a</span></strong>&#8211; your speech,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#4040ff;">b</span></strong>&#8211; your actions,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#4040ff;">c</span></strong>&#8211; what is in your heart (your sincerity, love, tawakkul, hope, intending to do good [4]), and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#4040ff;">d</span></strong>&#8211; any good or evil that you were the cause of (even though you may not have done it), either during your life or after your death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For that reason, the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>If the son of Adam dies, his deeds are cut off except for three: ongoing charity, knowledge that people benefit from, and a righteous child who makes du&#8217;aa [to Allaah] for him.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>Whoever calls to guidance will have a reward for each person who follows him in that, without their rewards decreasing at all. And whoever calls to misguidance will be have a sinful burden to bear for all those who followed him in that, without lessening their burdens at all.</strong> (Muslim, no. 2674)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the one who directs others to good &#8211; our beloved brothers &#8211; then the angels will write for him all those who follow him in that. So the Muslim should be diligent in calling/guiding to good, because his reward for that will not be cut off.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>7</strong>&#8211; Also, the angels take the soul out of that individual.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>8</strong>&#8211; And then, in the grave, two angels ask him: Who is your Lord? What is your Religion? Who is your Prophet?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the barzakh &#8211; after the person dies and before Yawm al-Qiyammah (Day of Judgement) &#8211; there is no relationship between us and mankind except via the angels. For example, the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) mentioned that Allaah has <em>malaa`ika</em> (angels) who inform the Prophet of the salutations of peace and blessings that we ask Allaah to send upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>9</strong>&#8211; And the angels are the ones who blow into the trumpet, and this is of three different types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#4040ff;">a</span></strong>&#8211; blow of silence<br />
<strong><span style="color:#4040ff;">b</span></strong>&#8211; blow of death<br />
<strong><span style="color:#4040ff;">c</span></strong>&#8211; blow of resurrection</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>10</strong>&#8211; On the Day of Judgement, the angels will meet mankind according to their actions. The righteous will be met by the angels with glad tidings. The evil will be met by the angels with disgrace and destruction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said (what means): <strong>Verily, those who say: &#8220;Our Lord is Allaah (Alone),&#8221; and then they are upright, on them the angels will descend (at the time of their death) (saying): &#8220;Fear not, nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of Paradise which you have been promised! We have been your friends in the life of this world and are (so) in the Hereafter. Therein you shall have (all) that your inner-selves desire, and therein you shall have (all) for which you ask for. An entertainment from (Allaah), the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221;</strong> (Fussilat, ayat 30-32)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And those who kept their duty to their Lord will be led to Paradise in groups, till, when they reach it, and its gates will be opened (before their arrival for their reception) and its keepers will say: <em>Salaamun &#8216;Alaikum</em> (peace be upon you)! You have done well, so enter here to abide therein.&#8221;</strong> (Az-Zumar, ayah 73)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the disbelievers &#8211; aoodhubillaah! &#8211; they will be met by the angels with all types of blame and evilness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said (what means): <strong>And those who disbelieved will be driven to Hell in groups, till, when they reach it, the gates thereof will be opened (suddenly like a prison at the arrival of the prisoners). And its keepers will say, &#8220;Did not the Messengers come to you from yourselves, reciting to you the Verses of your Lord, and warning you of the Meeting of this Day of yours?&#8221; They will say: &#8220;Yes, but the Word of torment has been justified against the disbelievers!&#8221; It will be said (to them): &#8220;Enter you the gates of Hell, to abide therein. And (indeed) what an evil abode of the arrogant!&#8221;</strong> (Az-Zumar, ayat 71-72)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To speak about the angels and their connection to mankind is something that would take a long time. Right now, they [the angels] are with us and they hear what we are saying, and they&#8217;re looking at us with their eyes and they are writing that which we say and that which we believe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, I want to finish this talk with a question: who from mankind loves you the most? As for the one who loves you, that is the one who makes du&#8217;aa for you. Do you believe that the greatest of the angels is right now making du&#8217;aa for you? They are making du&#8217;aa for you [du&#8217;aa] that the person most beloved to you is not making for you. Not [even] your mother! Nor your father! Nor your wife! Nor your children!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is an amazing du&#8217;aa!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said (what means): <strong>Those (angels) who bear the Throne (of Allaah) and those around it glorify the praises of their Lord, and believe in Him, and ask forgiveness for those who believe (in the Oneness of Allaah) (saying): &#8220;<span style="color:#4040ff;">Our Lord! You comprehend all things in mercy and knowledge, so forgive those who repent and follow Your Way, and save them from the torment of the blazing Fire! Our Lord! And make them enter the &#8216;Adn (Eden) Paradise (everlasting Gardens) which you have promised them, and to the righteous among their fathers, their wives, and their offspring! Verily, You are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise. And save them from (the punishment, because of what they did of) the sins, and whomsoever You save from (the punishment, because of what they did of) the sins (i.e. excuse them) that Day, him verily, You have taken into mercy.</span>&#8221; And that is the supreme success.</strong> (Ghafir, ayat 7-9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I want you to memorize these ayat, and think about them at all times. [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This praise of Allaah the angels make [before their du&#8217;aa] is tawaasul (seeking nearness) to Allaah &#8212;-&gt; <strong>Our Lord! You comprehend all things in mercy and knowledge. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>The distance between the earlobe and the shoulder of one of the </strong><strong>angels who carry the Throne of Allaahu, Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala, is a distance of 700 years.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] In a hadeeth Qudsee found in the two Saheehs, the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said: <strong>To Allaah belong mobile (squads) of angels who have no other work (to attend to but) to search for the assemblies of Dhikr and, when they find such assemblies in which there is Dhikr (remembrance of Allaah), they sit in them and some of them surround the others with their wings till the space between them and the sky of the world is fully covered. And when they disperse (after the assembly of Dhikr is adjourned), they go upward to the heaven, and Allaah, the Exalted and Glorious, asks them although He is best informed about them: Where have you come from? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And they say: We have come from some slaves of Yours on Earth: they were glorifying You (saying &#8220;Subhanallaah&#8221;), exalting you (saying &#8220;Allaahu akbar&#8221;), declaring that there is none deserving of worship except You (saying &#8220;La ilaaha ill Allaah&#8221;), praising You (saying &#8220;Al-Hamdulillah&#8221;), and asking [favors] of You. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>He [Allaah] says: And what do they ask of Me? They say: They ask of You Your Paradise. He says: And have they seen My Paradise? They say: No, O Lord. He says: And how would it be were they to have seen My Paradise! They say: And they seek refuge in You. He says: From what do they seek refuge in Me? They say: From Your Hellfire, O Lord. He says: And have they seen My Hell-fire? They say: No. He says: And how would it be were they to have seen My Hellfire: They say: And they ask for Your forgiveness. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Then He [Allaah] says: I have forgiven them and I have bestowed upon them what they have asked for, and I have granted them safety from that which they seek safety from. </strong><strong>They (angels) say: O Lord, among then is so-and-so, a much-sinning servant, who was merely passing by and sat down with them. And He [Allaah] says: And to him [too] I have given forgiveness: he who sits with such people shall not suffer. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Allaah said (what means): <strong>And indeed We created man (Adam) out of an extract of clay (water and earth).</strong> (Al-Mu`minoon, ayah 12)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thereafter We made him (<span style="color:#4040ff;">the offspring of Adam</span>) as a <span style="color:#c00000;">Nutfah</span> (mixed drops of the male and female sexual discharge) (and lodged it) in a safe lodging (womb of the woman). Then We made the Nutfah into a <span style="color:#c00000;">clot</span> (a piece of thick coagulated blood), then We made the clot into a <span style="color:#c00000;">little lump of flesh</span>, then We made out of that little lump of flesh <span style="color:#c00000;">bones</span>, then We clothed the bones with <span style="color:#c00000;">flesh</span>, and then We brought it forth as another creation. So blessed be Allaah, the Best of creators.</strong> (Al-Mu`minoon, ayah 13-14)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] In the Question-and-Answer session that followed, details of this hadeeth were mentioned in the narration recorded by Imam At-Tabaraani, on the authority of Abi Umaamah (radiallaahu &#8216;anhu) that the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa salam) mentioned: <strong>Six hours</strong>. Ibn Hajar al-Ascalanee (rahimahullaah) explained &#8220;<strong>six hours</strong>&#8221; by using a word (audio not clear), the meaning of which the questioner asked Shaikh al-&#8216;Aqeel about. And Shaikh al-&#8216;Aqeel said it means &#8220;<em>Waqteeyah</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it was mentioned that if the slave does not repent in these six hours, of course, the slave can still repent afterward &#8211; as long as the soul has not reached his throught.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] The Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa salam) said: <strong>If the slave itends to do good, the angels says, &#8220;Ya Rabb (Oh Lord), your slave intends to do good.&#8221; So Allaah will say, &#8220;Watch him; if he does it, write it for him as 10 good deeds.&#8221; And if he intends to do evil, then Allaah tells the angel: &#8220;Watch him. If he does it, write it down as one sin. And if he doesn&#8217;t do it, write it down as one good deed, because he left it for the fear of Allaah, &#8216;Azza wa Jall (Mighty and Majestic).&#8221; </strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#333333;">From the Book  &#8220;<strong>Essential Q &amp; A Concerning the Foundations of Imaan and Obstacles in the Path of Imaan&#8221;<br />
</strong>By: Shaykh Abdur-Rahman As-Sa&#8217;dee (Rahimahullah)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>What are the Different Classes of Believers?</strong><br />
Question 9 &#8211; Pgs. 31-32</span></span></p>
<p>There are 3 main types of believers:<br />
*(footnotes in italics)</p>
<p>This chapter is an explanation of Allah&#8217;s Statement {Surah Faatir 35:32}:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>ثُمَّ أَوْرَثْنَا الْكِتَابَ الَّذِينَ اصْطَفَيْنَا مِنْ عِبَادِنَا فَمِنْهُمْ ظَالِمٌ لِّنَفْسِهِ وَمِنْهُم مُّقْتَصِدٌ وَمِنْهُمْ سَابِقٌ بِالْخَيْرَاتِ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ ذَلِكَ هُوَ الْفَضْلُ الْكَبِيرُ</div>
</div>
</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><br />
<strong>&#8220;Then We caused Our chosen servants to inherit the Book.  Among them are self-oppressors, among them are frugal o­nes, and from them are those who rush forth to perfom good deeds, by the Permission of Allah.&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>The author&#8217;s reference to the 3 levels of believers found in this Verse is similar to Ibn Katheer&#8217;s own explanation of it, and it is in accordance with what has been said by Ibn Abbas, Ibn Mas&#8217;ood, and others from the Companions, {May Allah be pleased with them.}  Ibn Abbas {radiallahu anhu} said, &#8220;They are the Ummah (Nation) of Muhammad {alayhee salatul wasalaam}, the o­nes whom Allah caused to inherit all the books that He sent down.  The oppressive o­ne will be forgiven, the frugal o­ne will be given an easy reckoning, and the o­ne who rushed forth (to do good deeds) will enter Paradise with no reckoning.&#8221; {Tafseer al-Qur&#8217;an al-&#8216;Atheem, 6/546}</em></p>
<div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This chapter serves to further clarify the falsehood of the beliefs of the Murji&#8217;ah and Khawaarij, and builds upon the previous 2 chapters. It refutes the Murji&#8217;ah since Allah has described the believers as being three distinctly different levels, destroying their false claim that Imaan is o­nly o­ne level.  If Imaan is o­nly o­ne level, then how can it be that some believers are considered self-oppressors, and others are frugal, and others are those who rush forth to do good deeds? It is also a further refutation of the Khawaarij, since Allah has described some of the believers as being oppressors, and this oppression did not take them outside of the fold of Islaam.</p>
</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1)  <strong>Saabiqoon ilal-Khayraat &#8211; Those who rush to do good deeds:<br />
</strong>Those who rush to do good deeds are those who perform both the obligatory and recommended deeds, while avoiding both the prohibited and disliked affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) <strong>Muqtasidoon &#8211; Those who are frugal and selective:<br />
</strong>The frugal o­nes are those who restrict themselves to performing o­nly those deeds that are obligatory, while avoiding o­nly the prohibited affairs *(footnotes in italics).<br />
<em><br />
(i.e., Meaning that they fall into disliked affairs and leave off recommended deeds.)</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3) <strong>Thaalimoon li-Anfusihim &#8211; Those who oppress themselves:<br />
</strong>Those who oppress themselves are those who mix good deeds with the bad o­nes.   *(footnotes in italics)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>*(Meaning that they fall into prohibited affairs and leave off obligations.  In his Tafseer (6/546), Ibn Katheer (rahimahullah) said, explaining these three categories of believers: &#8220;The self-oppressor falls short of performing his obligations and falls into some prohibited things.  The frugal o­ne performs his obligations and stays away from prohibited things, however he tends to abandon some of the recommended deeds and falls into some disliked things.  The o­ne who rushes to do good deeds performs both obligatory and recommended deeds, while staying away from both disliked and prohibited things.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;">Question</span><span style="text-decoration:underline;">:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>What are the types of the Murji’ah? Please also mention their statements with regards to the issues of eemaan.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Answer</span><span style="text-decoration:underline;">:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Murji’ah are of four types:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>ONE: Those who say that eemaan is merely knowledge (ma’rifah), even if this is not accompanied by testification (tasdeeq).</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the statement of the Jahmiyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the most evil and the ugliest of statements. It is in fact disbelief (kufr) in Allah Azza wa Jall, because the mushrikoon from the early times, and Pharaoh (Firawn), and Haamaan and Qaaroon and (even) Iblees all acknowledged (the existence) of Allaah, Azza wa Jall, in their hearts. However because they did not state this on their tongues, nor testify to this in their hearts, nor act upon it with their limbs, then this knowledge did not benefit them.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">TWO: Those who say that eemaan is testification in the heart only.</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the statement of the Ashaa’irah (the Ash’arees).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is also a false statement since the disbelievers (kuffaar) testify in their hearts, they know that the Quraan is True and that the Messenger (sal Allaahu alaiyhi wa sallam) is True, and the Jews and Christians know that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Those to whom We gave the Scripture (Jews and Christians) recognise him (Muhammad sal Allaahu alaihi wa sallam) as they recognise their sons; but verily, a party of them conceal the truth while they know it – [i.e. the qualities of Muhammad sal Allaahu alaihi wa sallam which are written in the Tawraat and the Injeel].</strong> (Surah Al Baqarah: 146)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they testify to it in their hearts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta&#8217;aala says regarding the Mushrikoon: <strong>We know indeed the grief which their words cause you (O Muhammad sal Allaahu alaihi wa sallam); it is not you that they deny but it is the Ayaat of Allaah that the Dhaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers) deny.</strong> (Surah Al An’aam: 33)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these people did not state upon their tongues nor did they act with their limbs, yet they did testify in their hearts – so they did not become people of eemaan (mu’minoon).</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">THREE: The statement of those who are the direct opposite of the Ashaa’irah &#8211; and they are the Karaamiyah. Those who say that eemaan is statement on the tongue even if the person does not truly believe in his heart.</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Without doubt, this is a false statement since the hypocrites (munaafiqoon) – those who are in the lowest depths of the Fire – say “We bear witness that laa ilaaha ill Allaah and that Muhammad rasool ullaah’ with their tongues and they act (accordingly) with their limbs, but they do not truly believe in that nor do they testify to it in their hearts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is just as Allaah Ta&#8217;aala says: <strong>When the hypocrites come to you (O Muhammad sal Allaahu alaihi wa sallam) they say: ‘We bear witness that you are indeed the Messenger of Allaah’. And Allaah knows that you are indeed His Messenger and Allaah bears witness that the hypocrites are liars indeed. They have made their oaths a screen (for their hypocrisy). In this way they hinder (men) from the Path of Allaah. Verily, evil is what they used to do.</strong> (Surah Al Munaafiqoon: 1-2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says, Subhaanahu wa ta’aala: <strong>They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts.</strong> (Surah Al Fath: 11)</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">FOUR: The statement of the murji’ah al fuqahaa, and they are the lightest of the groups in terms of irjaa’ &#8211; those who say that eemaan is belief (i’tiqaad) in the heart and statement upon the tongue, but action does not enter into it.</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the statement of the Murji’ah al-Fuqahaa and this is a statement which is also incorrect since there is no eemaan without action.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a>The Belief in Allah</a></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>1 – Belief In Allah’s Existence Allah’s existence is affirmed through Fitrah&nbsp;</strong>(the innate purity that Allah creates in every human being), the Mind, the Shari’ah (Islamic Law) and the senses.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>a) As for the Fitrah,</strong>&nbsp;we say the following: Allah created the belief in Him in every human being. Mankind needs not to be taught this belief or think about how to possess it. However, the ones who have this Fitrah corrupted will not benefit from it. The Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) said, what translated means,&nbsp;<strong>“Every newly born will be born having Fitrah. However, his parents will either convert him to Judaism, Christianity or Majocism (fire worshipping).”&nbsp;</strong>[Saheeh al-Bukhari]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>b) The Human Mind&nbsp;</strong>must be used to prove the existence of Allah. All this creation, of old and new, must have a Creator who invented and started it. This creation could not have come to existence on its own or by chance. It could not have created itself, because it did not exist beforehand. Therefore, how can it create? Also, the creation could not have been started by accident or chance. Everything that exists must have a Creator who brought it into existence. Creation is magnificent in organization, coherent and correlated in its existence. There is a reason and originator behind every act. All this nullifies the saying that this entire universe was started by chance. What was started by chance cannot be organized in its form because it did not have any organization before it was formed. What makes what was created by chance to be this organized? If all this creation neither could have created itself nor was it created by chance, then it must have an Originator, Allah, the Lord of the worlds. Allah mentioned this reasoning in the Quran,&nbsp;<strong>“Were they created by nothing, or were they themselves the creators?”</strong>&nbsp;[52:35].</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">This Ayah means that men were neither created without a Creator nor did they create themselves. Therefore, Allah is the One who created them. This is why when Jubair ibn Mut’im (radiyallaahu anhu) heard the Messenger (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) recite this Surah until he reached,&nbsp;<strong>“Were they created by nothing, or were they themselves the creators? Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Nay, but they have no firm belief. Or are with them the Treasures of your Lord? Or are they the tyrants with authority to do as they like?”</strong>&nbsp;[52:35-37],</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Jubair, a disbeliever then, said,&nbsp;<strong>“My heart almost flew (from the power of this reasoning mentioned in the Surah). This was the first time that Iman entered my heart.”</strong>&nbsp;[Saheeh al-Bukhari]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>c) – As for the Shari’ah</strong>, all divine religions testify to the fact that Allah created the world. All Laws that were sent with these divine and revealed religions contain what benefits mankind. This is evidence to the existence of a Wise and All-Knowing Lord Who knows what brings benefit to His creation, All divinely-revealed religions describe a universe that is self evident to the existence and ability of Allah, Who Creates what He Will.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>d) – Also, the senses must be used</strong>&nbsp;to prove the existence of Allah. We know that Allah accepts the supplication from whoever seek His aid and help, and that He brings them the benefits that they desire. This is clear evidence to the existence of Allah, who said, what translated means,&nbsp;<strong>“And (remember) Noah, when he cried (to Us) aforetime We listened to his invocation.”&nbsp;</strong>[21:76] and,&nbsp;<strong>“(Remember) when you sought help from your Lord and He answered you?”</strong>&nbsp;[8:9].</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Anas ibn Malik (radhiyallahu anhu) said, “An Arabian (Bedouin) man entered (the Masjid) on Friday while the Prophet was delivering the speech. He said: ‘O Messenger of Allah! (Our) possessions are destroyed, (our) children are hungry. Ask Allah for us.’ He (the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) raised his hands in supplication (to Allah). All of a sudden, mountain-like clouds were formed. He did not descend from his Minbar (the podium) until I saw rain falling through his beard. On the second Friday, this Arabian man, or someone else, stood up and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam), Buildings have collapsed and possessions are flooded. Ask Allah for us.’ He (the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) raised his hands and said:&nbsp;<strong>‘O my Lord! Around us and not on us.’</strong>&nbsp;Wherever he pointed to an area (of the sky), they (the clouds) dispersed.” [Saheeh al-Bukhari]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Allah’s acceptance of supplication has been and still is a known matter until today. It is given to those who are true in their seeking refuge in Allah and perform supplication in the correct manner to ensure its acceptance. Also, there are the signs that Allah gave His Prophets, which are called miracles. People witnessed or heard these miracles. They are clear evidence that the One who sent the Messengers exists, and He is Allah the All Mighty.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">These miracles are activities that are beyond the capability of mankind. Allah gave them to His Messengers as a way of aiding them and giving them victory. An example of these miracles is the sign given of Moses. Allah ordered him to strike the sea with his stick, and the sea parted into twelve separate pads between mountains of water on each side of these parts,&nbsp;<strong>“Then We inspired Moses (saying): “Strike the sea with your stick. And it parted, and each separated part (of that sea water) became like the huge, firm mass of a mountain.” [26:63]. Another example is the miracle of Jesus. He was given the power by Allah to raise the dead from their graves and back into life. Allah said about him, what translated means, “And I bring the dead to life by Allah’s leave.”</strong>&nbsp;[3:49] and,&nbsp;<strong>“And when you (O Jesus) brought forth the dead by My Permission.”</strong>&nbsp;[5:110]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">A third example is the miracle Muhammad (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) performed. His tribe, Quraysh, asked him to perform a miracle. He pointed to the moon and it separated into two parts while his people were witnessing the incident. Allah said about this miracle, what translated means,&nbsp;<strong>“The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder. And if they see a sign, they turn away, and say: “This is continuous magic.”</strong>&nbsp;[54:1-2].[4] All these miracles, that Allah gave to His Messengers as an aid and victory and that were witnessed by their nations, are proof that Allah exists.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>2 – Belief In Allah’s Lordship</strong>&nbsp;This means to believe that Allah is the Lord, alone, and that He has no partners or helpers. The Rabb (Lord) is the One who Creates and Commands. There is no creator except Allah and there is no owner of the universe except Him. The Commandment and the Control is His. He said, what translated means,&nbsp;<strong>“Surely, His is the Creation and commandment.”</strong>&nbsp;[7:54] and,&nbsp;<strong>“Such is Allah your Lord; His is the Kingdom. And those whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmir (the membrane over the date-stone).”</strong>&nbsp;[35:13]. Only a few people rejected Allah’s Lordship. These are the arrogant ones who deny what they believe deep in their hearts. This happened from Pharaoh, when he said to his people, as was mentioned in the Qur’aan,&nbsp;<strong>“I am your lord, most high.”</strong>&nbsp;[79:24] and,&nbsp;<strong>“O chiefs! I know not that you have a god other than me!”</strong>&nbsp;[28:38].</p>



<p>However, what he said was not his true belief. Allah said, what translated means,&nbsp;<strong>“And they belied them (Our Signs) wrongfully and arrogantly, though their own selves were convinced thereof”&nbsp;</strong>[27:14].</p>



<p>Also, Moses said to Pharaoh, as was mentioned in the Quran,&nbsp;<strong>”Verily, you know that these Signs have been sent down by none but the Lord of the heavens and the earth as clear (evidences of His Oneness and Might). And I think you are, indeed, O Pharaoh, doomed to destruction.”</strong>&nbsp;[17:102]. The Arab disbelievers of old used to confirm Allah’s Lordship, although they associated others with Him in worship.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Allah said, what translated means,&nbsp;<strong>“Say: “Whose is the earth and whosoever is therein? If you know!” They will say: “It is Allah’s!” Say: “Will you not then remember?” Say: “Who is the Lord of the seven heavens and the Lord of the Great Throne?” They will say: “Allah.” Say: “Will you not then fear Allah?” Say: “In Whose Hands is the sovereignty of everything? And He protects (all), while against Whom there is no protector, if you know?” They will say: “(All this belongs) to Allah.” Say: “How then are you deceived and turn away from the truth?)”</strong>&nbsp;[23:84-89],</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And indeed if you ask them:&nbsp;<strong>“Who has created the heavens and the earth?” They will surely say: “The All-Mighty, the All-Knower created them.”&nbsp;</strong>[43:9]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">and,&nbsp;<strong>“And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: “Allah.” How then are they turned away (from His worship)”</strong>&nbsp;[43:87].</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Allah’s order comprises of both, His running of the universe and the Commandment.</strong>&nbsp;He is the One who controls the creation and the One who does what He will, according to His Wisdom. He is also the One who gives the Commandment organizing aspects of worship and dealings, according to His Wisdom. Whoever takes anyone, besides Allah, to be the one who commands acts of worship or types of dealings, will have committed Shirk (disbelief, association in worship) with Allah. This act negates Iman.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>3 – The Belief That He Is the ILAH:&nbsp;</strong>Allah is the Ilah, meaning He is the Worshipped One Who has no partners. This Ilah is worshipped with love and reverence. He said, what translated means,&nbsp;<strong>“And your Lord is One Lord, there is none who has the right to be worshipped but He, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.”</strong>&nbsp;[2:163]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">and,&nbsp;<strong>“Allah bears witness that none has the right to be worshipped but He, and the Angels, and those having knowledge (also give this witness); (He is always) maintaining His creation in Justice, none has the right to be worshipped but He, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.”&nbsp;</strong>[3:18].</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">All things that are taken as gods, besides Allah, are false gods,&nbsp;<strong>“That is because Allah is the Truth (the Only True God), and what they (the disbelievers) invoke besides Him, it is falsehood. And verily, Allah is the Most High, the Most Great.”</strong>&nbsp;[22:62].</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">To call these things “gods,” does not make them gods. Allah said about some idols, Al-Lat, Al-’Uzzaa and Manat,&nbsp;<strong>“They are but names which you have named, you and your fathers, for which Allah has sent down no authority”&nbsp;</strong>[53:23].</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Yousef (Joseph) said to his two companions in jail, as was mentioned in the Quran,&nbsp;<strong>“Are many different lords (gods) better or Allah the One, the Irresistible? You do not worship beside Him but only names, which you have forged, you and your fathers, for which Allah has sent down no authority.”</strong>&nbsp;[12:39-40].</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">All Messengers used to say to their nations,&nbsp;<strong>“Worship Allah! You have no other God but Him.”&nbsp;</strong>[23:23]. However, the disbelievers refused to accept this call. They took others as gods besides Allah. They worshipped them besides Allah, calling them when aid and help were needed. Allah refuted the disbelievers in their taking these idols as gods besides Him, using two logical arguments:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>The first argument:</strong>&nbsp;These idols, that were taken by the disbelievers as gods, do not have any attributes that qualify them to be gods. These false gods were created and do not create. They can neither bring about benefit for whoever worships them, nor can they fend harm off. They cannot give life or take it away. They neither own nor are they partners in the kingdom of the heavens and earth. Allah said, what translated means,&nbsp;<strong>“Yet, they have taken besides Him other gods that created nothing but are themselves created, and possess neither hurt nor benefit for themselves, and possess no power (of causing) death, nor (of giving) life, nor of raising the dead)”</strong>&nbsp;[25:3],</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>“Say (O Muhammad): ‘Call upon those whom you asset (to be associate gods) besides Allah, they possess not even the weight of an atom, either in the heavens or on the earth, nor they have any share in either, nor is there for Him any supporter from among them.”&nbsp;</strong>[34:22-23] and,</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>“Do they attribute as partners to Allah those who created nothing but they themselves are created? No help can they give them, nor can they help themselves.”</strong>&nbsp;[7:191-192].</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">If this is the case with false gods, then taking them as gods is a true misguidance and the lowest of all acts. The second argument: The Mushrikeen (polytheists) are among those who confirmed that Allah, alone, is the Lord, the Creator, the One Who Has the ownership of everything and the One Who gives protection and no one can give protection to anyone from His Might. This confirmation requires from these disbelievers to worship Allah alone. He said, what translated means,&nbsp;<strong>“O Mankind! Worship your Lord (Allah), Who created you and those who were before you so that you may become among the pious. Who has made the earth a resting place for you, and the sky as a canopy, and sent down rain from the sky and brought forth therewith fruits as a provision for you. Then do not set up rivals unto Allah (in worship) while you know (that He Alone has the right to be worshipped).”</strong>&nbsp;[2:21-22],</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>“And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: “Allah”.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>How then are they turned away (from His worship)?”&nbsp;</strong>[43:87]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">and,&nbsp;<strong>“Say (O Muhammad): “Who provides for you from the sky and from the earth? Or who owns hearing and sight? And who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living? And who disposes the affairs?” They will say: ‘Allah.” “Say: “Will you not then be afraid of Allah’s punishment?” Such is Allah, your Lord in truth. So after the Truth, what else can there be, save error? How then are you mined away?</strong>&nbsp;[10:31-32].</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>4 – The Belief In Allah’s Names and Attributes.&nbsp;</strong>This belief requires accepting whatever Allah described of Himself in His Book or in the Sunnah of His Messenger (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam). The Names and Attributes must be accepted without alteration&nbsp;<strong>[1]</strong>, rejection&nbsp;<strong>[2]</strong>, and precise description of their true nature or equating them with attributes of the creation. Allah said, what translated means,&nbsp;<strong>“And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allah, so call on Him by them, and leave the company of those who deny His Names. They will be requited for what they used to do.”</strong>&nbsp;[7:180],</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>“His is the highest description in the heavens and in the earth. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.”&nbsp;</strong>[30:27] and,&nbsp;<strong>“There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All Seer.”</strong>&nbsp;[42:11].</p>



<p><strong>Two groups have fallen into misguidance concerning this matter:</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>One of them is Al-Mu’attilah (the refuters).&nbsp;</strong>This group rejected the Names and Attributes, or some of them, claiming that to accept them is to equate Allah with His creation. This claim is false for many reasons following are two of them:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong>This claim leads to false conclusions that Allah’s Words are in Opposition to each other. Allah is the One who confirmed these Names and Attributes and denied that there is anything that resembles Him. If confirming these Names and Attributes leads to equating Allah with the creation, then this will lead to the conclusion that Allah’s Words are full of discrepancies and refute each other.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;For two things to have an attribute of some kind, does not mean that they are equal or look-likes. One can witness two persons who are both called “a human who hears, sees and speaks.” However, this description of both does not mean that they are of equal capabilities in their hearing, sight or speech. One can also see that animals have hands, legs and eyes. However, this does not mean that animals are equal in every respect with regards to their hands, legs and eyes. If disparity is this wide between that which creation possess of attributes or names, then the disparity between the Creator and creation is even greater and more evident.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>The second misguided group is called “Al- Mushabbihah.”</strong>&nbsp;They confirmed the Names and the Attributes. Yet, they equated them with the names and attributes of the creation. They claimed that this is what the Texts mean. They claimed that Allah reveals to His slaves what they can comprehend. This claim is false for many reasons, some of them are: Allah’s resemblance with His creation is false and is refuted with the mind and the Laws of Shari’ah. Texts of the Qur’aan and Sunnah cannot lead to falsehood in their meanings.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Allah revealed what His slaves can understand of the general meaning. However, the true nature of what these meanings are like is a knowledge that only Allah possesses, especially with regards to the true nature of His Names and Attributes. Allah confirmed that He is the All-Hearer. Hearing means to comprehend sounds. However, the true nature of Allah’s Hearing is unknown. Creation vary in their hearing capability. The difference between Allah’s Hearing and the hearing of creation is even greater and more evident. Also, Allah confirmed that He Istawa (Mounted or Settled) on His Throne. To mount and settle on a throne is known in the general meaning of the word “mounted,” or “settled.” The true nature of Allah’s mounting on His Throne is unknown. Mounting on something varies with regards to different creation. To mount on a chair is unlike mounting on a wild camel. If Istiwaa’ is this different between creation, then how can the Istiwaa’ of Allah be compared to the Istiwaa’ of creation? The difference between them is greater and more evident. Benefits of Believing in Allah, in the way described above, leads to many benefits for the believers:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong>To truly realize the Taw’hid of Allah, by depending only on Him and hoping in, fearing and worshipping Him alone.<br /><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;To prefect one’s love and reverence of Allah, and according to His Might as described by His Most-Beautiful Names and Most-High Attributes.<br /><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;To truly give one’s worship to Allah, by adhering to His Commandments and abandoning His Prohibitions.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p><strong>FOOTNOTES</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>[1]</strong>&nbsp;TAAWEEL – Introducing change in a statement, leaving out the meaning understood by it, expressing and accepting such a meaning which the words may indicate in a doubtful sense. In the present context (i.e. Attributes of Allaah) it means rejecting the true meaning of Attributes of Allaah, as understood by the companions (radiyallaahu anhum), and giving preferences to one own understanding.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>[2]</strong>&nbsp;TA’TEEL (Rejecting,Leaving or Vacating). It means negating the Attributes of Allaah and denying them with His Self. The difference between Taqweel and Ta’teel is that in the latter case the real meaning is denied which is proved by the Qur’aan and the Hadith. While in Tahreef the explanation of the text is done with such meanings that are false and the word does not prove them. So Ta’teel includes Tahreef. Wherever there is Tahreef, Ta’teel is certainly there, but the reverse is not true. If someone tries to prove the false meaning and denies the real meaning, he is committing both Ta’teel and Tahreef</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#333333;">Comments in red in square brackets like<span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong> [Comments]</strong></span> are added by AbdurRahman. org for better clarity</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#888888;">Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds. May peace and blessings be upon the Servant of Allah, His Messenger, the best of His Creatures, and His Trustee over His revelation, our Prophet, Imam, Muhammad ibn `Abdullah. May Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings be upon his family, Companions, and those who adopt his way and follow his guidance until the Day of Resurrection!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dear honorable brothers, my address to you will be on the <span style="color:#666699;">fundamentals of Iman</span>. This topic was chosen by the university and I agreed to deliver this speech because it is an <span style="color:#666699;">exceptionally important matter</span>. It is acknowledged that our Deen (Islam) is established upon these tenets, as our Ummah (nation) cannot succeed, live in a state of happiness, security, and glory above other nations except through holding fast to these tenets and acting accordingly in terms of its statements, actions, general conduct, Jihad, and all its affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur&#8217;an makes these fundamentals clear in many Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) and are also explained in the Prophet&#8217;s Hadiths (peace be upon him). <strong><span style="color:#666699;">The six fundamentals of Iman</span></strong> are themselves the tenets of the Islamic faith, for preaching Iman in Allah is the foremost objective of this Deen which awakens people&#8217;s inclination towards piety, guidance, and Taqwa (fearing Allah as He should be feared). It is the essence of the Message of the Prophet (peace be upon him) who propagated beneficial knowledge and practicing good deeds. All this falls under the realm of Iman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These six fundamentals have been explained in the Noble Book in different Ayahs, and highlighted in the Prophet&#8217;s Hadiths. Allah (may He be Praised) states in His Book: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 177" target="_blank" name="ItisnotAl-Birr(piety,righteousness,"></a><span style="color:#0000ff;">It is not Al-Birr (piety, righteousness, and each and every act of obedience to Allâh, etc.) that you turn your faces towards east and (or) west (in prayers); but Al-Birr is (the quality of) the one who believes in Allâh, the Last Day, the Angels, the Book, the Prophets</span></span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Allah (may He be Praised and Exalted) mentions in this Ayah fivefundamentals of Iman: To believe In Allah, the Last Day, His angels, Books, and Messengers. These are five matters upon which Islam is based in all its aspects. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) also states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 285" target="_blank" name="TheMessenger(Muhammadصلىالله"></a>The Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allâh, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. (They say), &#8220;We make no distinction between one another of His Messengers</span>&#8220;</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span id="more-277"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this Ayah, Allah mentions four matters in His statement: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 285" target="_blank" name="TheMessenger(Muhammadصلىالله"></a>E<span style="color:#0000ff;">ach one believes in Allâh, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers</span>.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Allah makes no mention of the Last Day although He mentioned it in the previous Ayah and others. This is Allah&#8217;s Law in His Book, as He variegates the discourse about His omnipotence (Glorified and Exalted be He), His Names, and Attributes, the tenets of this Deen, the events of the Day of Resurrection, about Jannah (Paradise) and Hellfire, His messengers and their nations, for the purpose of increasing the Iman and knowledge of those who ponder over the Ayahs of His Book and seek more knowledge with every Surah, even every Ayah of this Glorious Book or every Hadith narrated from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). However, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) mentions the Last Day at the end of the Ayah, as He states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 285" target="_blank" name="TheMessenger(Muhammadصلىالله"></a>(We seek) Your Forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the return (of all)</span>.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Nisa', 4: 136" target="_blank" name="Oyouwhobelieve!BelieveinAllâh,"></a><span style="color:#0000ff;">O you who believe! Believe in Allâh, and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and the Book (the Qur’ân) which He has sent down to His Messenger, and the Scripture which He sent down to those before (him); and whosoever disbelieves in Allâh, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, and the Last Day, then indeed he has strayed far away</span>.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah explains in this Ayah so that whoever disbelieves in these fundamental articles of Iman has strayed far from the Straight Path. There are many Ayahs to the same effect. At some places of the Qur&#8217;an, Allah mentions independently believing in Him alone, because all the articles of faith are part and parcel of having Iman in Allah, while in others He mentions belief in Him and His Messenger, or in Him and the Last Day.This is because believing in Allah naturally includes other matters of Iman mentioned in the other Ayahs, such as believing in angels, Books, messengers, and the Last Day. In this regard, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Nisa', 4: 136" target="_blank" name="Oyouwhobelieve!BelieveinAllâh,"></a><span style="color:#0000ff;">Believe in Allâh, and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and the Book (the Qur’ân) which He has sent down to His Messenger, and the Scripture which He sent down to those before (him)</span></span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Allah confined this Ayah to having Iman in Allah, His Messenger, the Book sent down upon Muhammad (peace be upon him), and the Book revealed before. He did not mention the other articles of Iman because they are included in the belief in Allah. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) further states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Taghabun, 64: 8" target="_blank" name="Therefore,believeinAllâhand"></a><span style="color:#0000ff;">Therefore, believe in Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) and in the Light (this Qur’ân) which We have sent down</span>.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> He mentioned believing in Allah, His Messenger, and the light revealed to Muhammad, namely the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah, because the other matters are contained in that light, and so are all that Allah and His Messenger informed about regarding what was and will be. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) also states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Hadid, 57: 7" target="_blank" name="BelieveinAllâhandHisMessenger"></a><span style="color:#0000ff;">Believe in Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and spend of that whereof He has made you trustees. And such of you as believe and spend (in Allâh’s Way), theirs will be a great reward</span>.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />Here, Allah only mentions Iman in Allah and His Messenger because other essential requirements of Iman are basically included in believing in Allah and His Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>[Islam and Iman]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sunnah also provides support for this. For example, the well-known Hadith of Jibril (Gabriel) when he asked the prophet (peace be upon him) about Islam, Iman and Ihsan (the perfection of Faith). He first asked about Islam, and in another narration he began by asking about Iman then mentioned Islam and Ihsan. The point is that he first asked about the requirements of Iman because it purifies the Muslim inwardly in a way that is reflected upon his outward behavior. This is why Allah defined Islam as outward submission because it has to do with a Muslim&#8217;s submissiveness to Allah (may He be Praised). The word &#8220;Islam&#8221; indicates submission to Allah (Exalted be He), and obeying His Commands. For that reason, Allah called the outward matters of worship &#8216;Islam&#8217; as they include humbling oneself and worshipping Him, obeying His Commands and abiding by His laws.It is said &#8220;A person submitted and surrendered to another i.e. he humbled himself to someone and followed his commands. Likewise, submission to Allah means humbling oneself to Him and observing His Shari&#8217;ah (may He be Praised and Exalted).</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam means outward submission to Allah while Iman combines inward and outward submission to Him as in observance of the teachings of Allah&#8217;s Purified Shar`ah (Law).</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why they were coupled in the Sahih (authentic) Hadith, the Prophet (peace be upon him) explained Islam as outward deeds which testify to one&#8217;s submission that includes verbal testimony that there is no God worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is His Messenger, performance of the five daily prayers, payment of Zakah, fasting the month of Ramadan, and performing Hajj to the Sacred House in Makkah. Also, Iman has to do with inward submission that includes believing in Allah and His Angels, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sahih Hadith reads: <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="OMessengerofAllahwhatarethe"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">O Messenger of Allah, what are the best acts? He said: to feed the food and send regardings to whom you know and to whom you know not.</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> According to another Hadith: <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="WhoseIslamisthebestiewho"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">Whose Islam is the best i.e. who is a very good Muslim? He replied: One who avoids harming the Muslims with his tongue and hands.</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, the word &#8220;Islam&#8221; refers to the outward deed which demonstrates a servant&#8217;s submission to Allah&#8217;s commands, obeying His Shari`ah, and abiding by it while Iman is akin to the inward Iman in one&#8217;s heart such as believing in Allah, His Angels, Books, Messengers, the Last Day, and Qadar (predestination) whether good or bad. When the Prophet (peace be upon him) was asked about Iman, he said, <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="TohavefaithinAllahHisAngels"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">To have faith in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Day of Resurrection and the Divine destiny whether good or bad.</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> He explained Iman as believing in these six matters which are essentially the fundamentals of Faith and the Deen of Islam, for whoever lacks Iman has no share in Islam, and whoever lacks Islam is not a Mu&#8217;min (believer). Accordingly, believing in these essential requirements of Iman is a prerequisite for the validity of one&#8217;s Islam. However, a Muslim&#8217;s Iman might be perfect or not, as Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) stated about the Bedouins: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Hujurat, 49: 14" target="_blank" name="Thebedouinssay:^Webelieve.^"></a><span style="color:#0000ff;">Say: “You believe not but you only say, ‘We have surrendered (in Islâm)&#8221;</span></span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because their Iman was not perfect and did not fulfill the essential requirements to be true believers, Allah denied them the perfect Iman as this cannot be associated with those who neglect religious obligations, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated, <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="Thereisnofaithforaperson"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">There is no faith, for a person who does not have patience</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Similarly, he (peace be upon him) said: <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="“Noneofyouwillbelieveuntil"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">“None of you will believe until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself.”</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> The Prophet (peace be upon him) also said: <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="HewhobelievesinAllahandthe"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">He who believes in Allah and the Last Day should either utter good words or better keep silent; and he who believes in Allah and the Last Day should show hospitality to his guest. He who believes in Allah and the Last Day should keep good relation with his Kith and kin. He who believes in Allah and the Last Day should not hurt his neighbors.</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> To explain it further, Iman entails practicing good deeds. Thus, Islam without Iman is the act of hypocrites. The perfect Iman necessitates abiding by what Allah and His Messenger commanded and refraining from what they forbade. If a Muslim falls short in adhering to this, then he is not a believer as Allah negated Iman from the Bedouins in His statement: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Hujurat, 49: 14" target="_blank" name="Thebedouinssay:^Webelieve.^"></a><span style="color:#0000ff;">Say: “You believe not but you only say, ‘We have surrendered (in Islâm)</span>&#8220;</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />and as negated also by the previous Hadiths.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To summarize, Allah (may He be Praised) and His Messenger denied the Iman of those who neglected some obligations of faith, although they remained within the fold of Islam. These six tenets are the core of the Deen of Islam; whoever fulfills them along with the outward matters of Iman, then they are believing Muslims. But those who neglect these tenets have no share either in Islam or Iman. Their status is like that of hypocrites who pretentiously adopted Islam, identified themselves as believers, offered Salah (Prayer) with Muslims, performed Hajj, and even fought in the cause of Allah but they are inwardly not with the Muslims, let alone those who antagonize them for nothing except their detesting the Deen of Allah and His Messenger and they belie and deny what was revealed to the messengers. They claim to be Muslims to fulfill their own wicked desires. Allah has exposed their matter and declared their Kufr (disbelief) and misguidance; they become even more disbelieving than those who openly declare their Kufr, and that is why they will go to Hell and abide there eternallyin the lowest place of the Fire. This is what they deserve because their evil towards the Islamic faith is emphatically confirmed and Muslims can be deceived by their pretension of being brothers and some important secrets might be disclosed to them which they exploit to harm Muslims and betray them. That is why their Kufr is more severe and their evil is more harmful. The same applies to whomever claims to believe in these fundamentals of Iman and does not offer the outward obligations of Islam such as testifying that there is no deity except Allah and Muhammad is His Messenger, offering Salah, Sawm (Fast), paying Zakah, performing Hajj or neglecting other outward practices of Islam which Allah has enjoined. This is evidence of their lacking Iman or its weakness. They are ar risk for Allah may reject their Faith as it is unanimously agreed upon that Iman is denied by not offering the two testimonies of Faith. However, Iman cannot be completely rejected from a Muslim, rather their Iman is not perfect owing to their falling short in certain obligations such as observing Sawm, performing Hajj and paying Zakah; although having the ability to do so and other matters defined by the majority of scholars. Whoever abandons such obligations, then he is Fasiq (someone flagrantly violating Islamic law) and devoid of guidance, but not a Murtad (apostate) according to the majority of the scholars as long as he does not deny such obligations. As for the obligation of Salah, some scholars held the view that neglecting it is a form of apostasy from Islam even if a person does not deny its obligation in accordance with the soundest opinion among scholars based on many proofs including the Prophet&#8217;s statement: <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="Thatwhichdifferentiatesusfrom"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">That which differentiates us from the disbelievers and hypocrites is our performance of Salat. He who abandons it, becomes a disbeliever.</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Compiled by<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Al-Imam Ahmad </span>Ahl-ul-Sunan (authors of Hadith compilations classified by jurisprudential themes) with a Sahih Sanad (chain of narrators) on the authority of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Buraydah ibn Al-Haseeb </span>(may Allah be pleased with him). Others ruled that the abandonment of Salah is Kufr, but not Kufr Akbar (a major disbelief that takes one out of the religion of Islam) if the person does not deny its obligation. This matter is an independent realm of study but our goal here is to explain that there is no Islam for one without Faith and no faith for one without Islam. They mutually define each other. As previously mentioned, the word &#8220;Islam&#8221; means submission and humbleness to Allah and His Omnipotence (may He be Praised) which is in relation to the outward submission of the servant to His Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, the word &#8220;Iman&#8221; is a term refers to the Muslim&#8217;s inward belief which Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) knows. It is also called so because it has to do with the belief of the heart which is associated with outward obligations that reflect this believing heart. They are, when adhering to and practicing,an indication of the validity of Iman. Conversely, whoever does not observe these outward obligations, this designates that they have no Iman or weak Iman. According to Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim main body), Iman in its generality includes Islam and vice verse, as Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-&#096;Imran, 3: 19" target="_blank" name="Truly,thereligionwithAllâh"></a>Truly, the religion with Allâh is Islâm.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> This Iman is included according to the main stream Muslims. No Islam without Iman and Iman means guidance, God-fearing, and righteousness. These terms, even different, refer to the same meaning i.e. believing in Allah and His Messengers, following His Guidance, abiding by the teachings of His Deen. Furthermore, the word &#8220;Ihsan&#8221; in general implies both Iman and Islam because it is confined to Allah&#8217;s servants who have perfected their faith. In the same way, if one of the three words were said generally, the other two are naturally implied. Thus, if it is said that the Muhsinon (good-doers) are the most beloved servants to Allah, then this implies that they have perfected their Islam and Iman, as Allah (Exalted be He) states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 195" target="_blank" name="AndspendintheCauseofAllâh"></a>and do good. Truly, Allâh loves Al-Muhsinûn (the good-doers).</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Allah (Glorified be He) also says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 128" target="_blank" name="Truly,Allâhiswiththosewho"></a>Truly, Allâh is with those who fear Him (keep their duty unto Him), and those who are Muhsinûn (good-doers. See the footenote of V.9:120).</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />The Muslim who reaches the degree of Ihsan must manifest this by their strong Islam and Iman, piety and observance of Allah&#8217;s orders. It is only then that he deserves to be ranked as Muhsin, for Ihsan is not reached unless preceded with sound Islam and perfect Iman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dear brother, you should know that the word Mu&#8217;minon (believers) implies the word Muslims, because it is more specific, as Allah (Exalted be He) states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Anfal, 8: 19" target="_blank" name="(Odisbelievers)ifyouaskfor"></a><span style="color:#0000ff;">and verily, Allâh is with the believers</span>.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Allah (Glorified be He) says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 72" target="_blank" name="Allâhhaspromisedthebelievers"></a><span style="color:#0000ff;">Allâh has promised the believers, men and women, Gardens under which rivers flow</span></span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> .The word &#8220;Mu&#8217;min&#8221; refers only to those who believe with their hearts and act accordingly with their bodily organs to demonstrate belief in the Oneness of Allah&#8217;s Lordship. The Mu&#8217;minon deserves to be called so because of their belief with the heart, their true Islam, their observance of Allah&#8217;s commands and not transgressing His Limits. This meaning is indicated by the Hadith of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Sa`d ibn Abu Waqas </span>(may Allah be pleased with him) <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="whenheaskedtheProphetpeace"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">when he asked the Prophet (peace be upon him) why he gave the bounties to certain people and excluded others, Sa`d said: O Messenger of Allah, you gave such-and-such and excluded such-and-such, and I think they are believers. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Or Muslims. Sa`d repeated his question and the Prophet kept saying: Or Muslims.</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />To explain it further, if coupled together, Iman and Islam have two meanings: a specific meaning and a general one. The word &#8220;Muslim&#8221; is more general than the word &#8220;Mu&#8217;min&#8221;, accordingly every Mu&#8217;min is a Muslim but not vice verse. Yet, when generally and separately speaking, both terms may be used interchangeably as previously stated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is also indicated in the Prophet&#8217;s statement: <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="Faithhasoverseventybranchesor"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">Faith has over seventy branches,or over sixty branches, the most excellent of which is the declaration that there is none worthy of worship (in truth) but Allah, and the humblest of which is the removal of what is injurious from the path: and modesty is the branch of faith.</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> (Agreed upon by Al-Bukhari and Muslim). This Hadith carries the general implication that Iman includes Islam (submissiveness to Allah), Huda (guidance), Ihsan, Taqwa. Iman, whose most excellent expression is that there is no deity but Allah, and humblest of which is the removal of what is injurious from the path; this is the essence of our Deen and it is Islam and Iman. That is why the Prophet stated: <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="Theuppermostofalltheseisthe"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">The uppermost of all these is the Testimony of Faith: &#8220;La ilaha illallah&#8221; (there is no true God except Allah).</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />It is known that the Shahadah (Testimony of Faith) that there is no deity but Allah is the first pillar of Islam along with testifying that Muhammad is His Messenger. Allah made this Shahadah the highest rank of Iman, and as such, it includes in its generality Islam, its pillars, and the obligations related to it. Similarly, when referring only to the Iman in Allah or in Him and His Messenger, this includes all what Allah Prescribed and His Messenger conveyed with regard to Salah, Zakah, Sawm, Hajj, belief in Angels, Books, the prophets,the Last Day, and Qadar whether good or bad. All of these pillars of faith goes within the realm of believing in Allah. This also entails believing in His Names, Attributes, and His Existence as the Lord of the Worlds and the Only One deserving worship. Not only this, but such Iman is not separated from believing in what Allah revealed or legislated, what He prescribed for His Servants, as it also encompasses believing in all Messengers, Angels, Books, Prophets, and all that Allah and His Messenger revealed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sunnah also confirm this meaning when the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="SayIaffirmmyfaithinAllahandthenbeupright"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">Say, &#8220;I affirm my faith in Allah&#8221; and then be upright.</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> It encompasses All what Allah revealed or legislated for His Servants. Allah (Glorified be He) says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Fussilat, 41: 30" target="_blank" name="Verily,thosewhosay:^OurLord"></a><span style="color:#0000ff;">Verily, those who say: “Our Lord is Allâh (Alone),” and then they stand firm</span></span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />i.e. they acknowledged that their Lord, Creator, Sustainer is Allah and their belief in Him urged them to adhere to His Book and the Sunnah of His Prophet (peace be upon him). It a Divine Way to mention narratives and parables in the Qur&#8217;an describing them in depth in certain verses and in brief in others, so that whoever seeks knowledge of such narratives will read them either in detail or brief with no confusion for he knows that each position has its own implications.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, Iman is mentioned separately in some Ayahs, and in others along with some of its prerequisites or branches to designate their importance and greatness, as Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 277" target="_blank" name="Trulythosewhobelieve,anddo"></a>Truly those who believe, and do deeds of righteousness, and perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât), and give Zakât, they will have their reward with their Lord.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Allah&#8217;s saying: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 277" target="_blank" name="Trulythosewhobelieve,anddo"></a>and perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât), and give Zakât</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> are essentially included in the realm of Iman and good deed but He mentioned them specifically to highlight their importance. The same applies to His statement: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Taghabun, 64: 8" target="_blank" name="Therefore,believeinAllâhand"></a>Therefore, believe in Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) and in the Light (this Qur’ân) which We have sent down.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Believing in Allah and His Messenger naturally includes the belief in the revealed light but again Allah mentioned it to emphasize its great rank. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-&#096;Asr, 103: 1" target="_blank" name="ByAl-‘Asr(thetime)."></a>By Al-‘Asr (the time).</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-&#096;Asr, 103: 2" target="_blank" name="Verily,manisinloss,"></a>Verily, man is in loss,</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-&#096;Asr, 103: 3" target="_blank" name="Exceptthosewhobelieve(inIslâmic"></a>Except those who believe (in Islâmic Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds, and recommend one another to the truth [i.e. order one another to perform all kinds of good deeds (Al-Ma‘ruf) which Allâh has ordained, and abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds (Al-Munkar which Allâh has forbidden], and recommend one another to patience (for the sufferings, harms, and injuries which one may encounter in Allâh’s Cause during preaching His religion of Islâmic Monotheism or Jihâd).</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Following the truth and recommending one another to patience are forms of good deeds which reflect one&#8217;s Iman. Therefore, Allah mentions offering good deeds preceded by the prerequisite of Iman as a way of apposition of the specific to the general. Similarly, He mentioned enjoining one another to the truth and patience after good deeds in the same opposition, because they are kinds of good deeds. Thus, they were not mentioned in another Ayahs. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Luqman, 31: 8" target="_blank" name="Verily,thosewhobelieve(inIslâmic"></a>Verily, those who believe (in Islâmic Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds, for them are Gardens of Delight (Paradise).</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> He did not mention recommending one another to the truth and patience, as they are included in His statement &#8220;and perform righteous good deeds&#8221; and in Iman generally. When referring to Iman in general, it includes all that Allah and His Messenger told of the past and the future until the end of time, on the Day of Resurrection, and about Jannah (Paradise) and Hellfire. It also encompasses all that Allah and His Messenger enjoined and what they forbade. Yet, Allah (may He be Praised) may make special mention of some specific good deeds or special mention of abandoning some sins as a way of emphasizing the particular after the general. The same goes to the fundamentals of Iman, as they are sometimes mentioned altogether as in Allah&#8217;s statement: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 177" target="_blank" name="ItisnotAl-Birr(piety,righteousness,"></a>It is not Al-Birr (piety, righteousness, and each and every act of obedience to Allâh, etc.) that you turn your faces towards east</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Here He mentioned five articles of faith and mentioned believing in Al-Qadar in other Ayahs. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Qamar, 54: 49" target="_blank" name="Verily,Wehavecreatedallthings"></a>Verily, We have created all things with Qadar (Divine Preordainments of all things before their creation as written in the Book of Decrees Al-Lauh Al-Mahfûz).</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> and <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Hadid, 57: 22" target="_blank" name="Nocalamitybefallsontheearth"></a>No calamity befalls on the earth or in yourselves but it is inscribed in the Book of Decrees (Al-Lauh Al-Mahfûz)</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />Other Ayahs stress the same meaning. At other positions of the Qur&#8217;an, Allah mentions only some of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Prophet&#8217;s Sunnah also mention some of these articles of faith although they were detailed in the Hadith of Jibril (Gabriel). In other Hadiths, only belief in Allah was mentioned such as the following Hadith: <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="SayIaffirmmyfaithinAllahandthenbeupright"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">Say, &#8220;I affirm my faith in Allah&#8221; and then be upright.</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Likewise, some Hadiths included only the mention of Iman in Allah and the Last Day, as believing implies believing in all that Allah and His Messenger informed us of. He who has faith in Allah and the Last Day, this Iman will lead him to hasten to fulfill all the commands of Allah and His Messenger and to refrain from what they prohibited. Therefore, in some Ayahs and Hadiths no mention was made with regard to believing in Allah and the Last Day, because whoever believed truly and sincerely in Allah and the Last Day will be steadfast in fulfilling what Allah has obligated, abandoning what He forbade, and observing His Limits. For example, Allah says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 62" target="_blank" name="Verily!Thosewhobelieveandthose"></a>Verily! Those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians, whoever believes in Allâh and the Last Day and does righteous good deeds shall have their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, believing in the essential prerequisites of Iman mentioned in the Ayah is obligatory. Those who do not do this are disbelievers in Allah regardless of their professed Islam and Iman. Disbelieving in one of these six essential pillars of faith or any established matters of Islam renders one a disbeliever even if they adhere to some of its rulings and tenets. Complete Iman in this Deen (Islam) with all its laws and teachings is obligatory; otherwise those who have incomplete or imperfect Iman will be considered disbelievers, as Allah (Exalted be He) states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Nisa', 4: 150" target="_blank" name="Verily,thosewhodisbelievein"></a>Verily, those who disbelieve in Allâh and His Messengers and wish to make distinction between Allâh and His Messengers (by believing in Allâh and disbelieving in His Messengers) saying, &#8220;We believe in some but reject others,&#8221; and wish to adopt a way in between.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Nisa', 4: 151" target="_blank" name="Theyareintruthdisbelievers."></a>They are in truth disbelievers. And We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating torment.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Hence, a believer knows the seriousness of these great and necessary fundamentals, and that believing in Allah encompasses believing in what Allah and the Prophet (peace be upon him) informed us about Himself, His Names, and Attributes. Similarly, this also includes the belief in Allah as the Lord of the Worlds, the Creator, the Sustainer, and that He is perfect in Himself, His Names, His Attributes and His acts. The believer must have firm Iman that Allah sent Messengers, revealed Books, predestined all matters, and that all things are known to Him (Exalted be He) before their existence as He is the Omnipotent and His Knowledge encompasses everything. Among the most concise Ayahs in this regard is Allah&#8217;s saying: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Ikhlas, 112: 1" target="_blank" name="Say(OMuhammadصلىاللهعليهوسلم):"></a>Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8220;He is Allâh, (the) One.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Ikhlas, 112: 2" target="_blank" name="^Allâh-us-Samad(السيدالذييصمد"></a>&#8220;Allâh-us-Samad (السيد الذي يصمد إليه في الحاجات) [Allâh the Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, (He neither eats nor drinks)].</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Ikhlas, 112: 3" target="_blank" name="^Hebegetsnot,norwasHebegotten."></a>&#8220;He begets not, nor was He begotten.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Ikhlas, 112: 4" target="_blank" name="^Andthereisnoneco-equalor"></a>&#8220;And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him.&#8221;</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Allah (Glorified be He) also says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Shura, 42: 11" target="_blank" name="TheCreatoroftheheavensand"></a>There is nothing like Him; and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Allah (Glorified be He) also says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 74" target="_blank" name="Soputnotforwardsimilitudes"></a>So put not forward similitudes for Allâh (as there is nothing similar to Him, nor He resembles anything). Truly! Allâh knows and you know not.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Allah (Glorified be He) says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Maryam, 19: 65" target="_blank" name="Lordoftheheavensandtheearth,"></a>Do you know of any who is similar to Him?</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />There are similar Ayahs indicating the Divine Perfection and that He (Glorified and Exalted be He) has all Attributes of Perfection and far above attributes of imperfection and defectiveness. As Allah informed us about Himself and as His Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him) told us that He has the Most Beautiful Names and Most Lofty Attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is precribed upon every Mu&#8217;min to believe in everything stated by Allah and His Messenger (peace be upon him) with regards to Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes and accept them as they are without any modification, increase or decrease ; rather, Muslims must accept themas stated by Allah and His Prophet without Tahrif (distortion of the meaning), Ta`til (denial of Allah&#8217;s Attributes), Takyif (questioning Allah&#8217;s Attributes or Tamthil (likening Allah&#8217;s Attributes to those of His Creation). A Muslim must follow the example of the righteous Salaf (righteous predecessors) in this regard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This includes the Attributes that Allah has proven for Himself, such as that of Istiwa&#8217; (Allah&#8217;s rising over the Throne in a manner that befits Him), Allah&#8217;s descending to the lower Heaven [in a manner that befits Him], Face, Hands, Mercy, Knowledge, Wrath, Will, and other Attributes which Allah established for himself as mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an or the Sunnah of His Prophet (peace be upon him). We are obliged to ascribe such Attributes to Allah as did the righteous Salaf from Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim main body) and the Messengers (peace be upon them). Accordingly, we should believe that Allah has risen over the Throne in a way that befits His Glory and Majesty, not as claimed by the sect of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Jahmiyyah (a deviant Islamic sect denying some Attributes of Allah, claiming they are ascribed to people and cannot be ascribed to Allah) </span>that He seized it, as Allah does not struggle against other deities; rather He is Omnipotent (Glorified and Exalted be He) and Dominant over all . However, Istiwa&#8217; is an attribute unique to the Throne that means rising above and high, as Allah is high above His Creation and has raised Himself above the Throne in a manner befitting His Sublimity. None of His Creation resembles Him in His Creation, for His rising above the Throne is an established matter, as said by<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Malik </span>(may Allah be merciful with him): The Istawa&#8217; is known and the manner is untold; to believe in it is obligatory and to ask about it is a Bid`ah (innovation). This was also said by<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Rabi`ah Sheikh Al-Imam Malik </span>(may Allah be merciful with them) and<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Um Salamah </span>(may Allah be pleased with her) and believed by Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah. The Attributes are known but the real manner is unknown whereas believing in them is obligatory. This is the rule applied to all Attributes such as Knowledge, Mercy, Wrath, Face, Hands, Foot, Fingers, etc. All the Ayahs and Hadiths conform with this fact. Likewise, we should believe in Al-Nuzul, i.e. the Hadith that deals with Allah&#8217;s descending to the lower Heaven [in a manner that befits Him] and ascribes it to Allah in a way that befits Him and its reality is known only to Him. Hence, we must believe that Allah descends to the lower heaven as He wills in a manner known only to Him, and His descending does not contradict His Loftiness and His Istiwa&#8217;, since He (Exalted be He) is not similar to His creation in any of His Attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same applies to His Istiwa&#8217; on the Throne which does not contradict that His Knowledge encompasses everything and that He is among His believing creatures with His knowledge and nothing is concealed from Him, as He Allah ( the Exalted andGlorified) states <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Hadid, 57: 4" target="_blank" name="HeitisWhocreatedtheheavens"></a>And He is with you (by His Knowledge) wheresoever you may be.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> This does not contradict His Loftiness and rising above His Throne, for Allah is with us with His knowledge as He informed us without Tahrif or Takyif. Furthermore, Allah is with those who obey Him with His Knowledge, protection, support and by granting them victory over their enemies. This means that Allah&#8217;s Ma`iyyah (accompaniment) is of two types; a general one which means that everyone is equal with regard to Allah&#8217;s Knowledge as He surrounds them all in His Knowledge, not only the believers; and a special accompaniment which is confined to the prophets and messengers (peace be upon them) and those who have Taqwa (fearing Allah as He should be feared), Iman, patience, and endurance in obeying Allah and obeying His commands and abstaining from His prohibitions, as Allah (may He be Praised) says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Ta­Ha, 20: 46" target="_blank" name="He(Allâh)said:^Fearnot,verily"></a>I am with you both, hearing and seeing.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Allah (Glorified be He) says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 40" target="_blank" name="Ifyouhelphim(Muhammadصلىالله"></a>Be not sad (or afraid), surely Allâh is with us.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Allah (Glorified be He) also says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Anfal, 8: 46" target="_blank" name="AndobeyAllâhandHisMessenger,"></a>and be patient. Surely, Allâh is with those who are As-Sâbirûn (the patient).</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> and the like Ayahs. This special Ma`iyyah includes protection, support from Allah, and also His Knowledge that surrounds everything, as He (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Hadid, 57: 4" target="_blank" name="HeitisWhocreatedtheheavens"></a>And He is with you (by His Knowledge) wheresoever you may be.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In utter contrast to what is claimed by<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Al-Jahmiyyah </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> and the Mu`tazilah (a deviant Islamic sect claiming that those who commit major sins are in a state between belief and disbelief) </span>and the like who maintain that Allah is everywhere (exalted be He far above any such thing). Allah (may He be Praised and Exalted) is above His creatures and is seated on His Throne as He stated. His Knowledge encompasses everywhere and He is not mixed with His Creation (may He be Praised and Exalted). Thus, Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah believe that Iman in Allah entails believing in all what Allah and His Messenger informed us about Him with regard to His Names and Attributes. This forms an essential pillar of their `Aqidah (creed), and accordingly, they believe in Allah as their Lord and the only One Who deserves to be worshipped and that He is perfect in Essence, Names, Attributes, and Actions. For them, He is the Creator, the Sustainer, the Giver, Al-Khafid (the Abaser), Al-Rafi` (the Exalter) and other Attributes of Perfection. Allah is the only One worthy of worship and He is All-Knowing, the Supreme Creator, and is the One that sustains His Servants for He is Omnipotent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All such Attributes are not similar to those of His Creatures, rather they are unique to Him in a manner that suits His Sublimity as our attributes befit us. Allah&#8217;s Attributes are everlasting and perfect whereas the servant&#8217;s are imperfect and vanishing. All this is related to believing in Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) and believing in in the Angels generally and in detail.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">[<strong>Angels:</strong>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Specifically speaking, angels are of two types; the first is known to us because they were mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an and accordingly we are obliged to believe in them and their names, such as Jibril (Gabriel), Mikha&#8217;il (Michael) and Israfeel (Seraph) and the angel of death. The second type are angels that we must believe in although Allah did not mention them or their names, for Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Anbiya', 21: 26" target="_blank" name="Andtheysay:^TheMostGracious"></a><span style="color:#0000ff;">but honoured slaves</span>.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Anbiya', 21: 27" target="_blank" name="TheyspeaknotuntilHehasspoken,"></a><span style="color:#0000ff;">They speak not until He has spoken, and they act on His Command.</span></span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These angels are groups of which some are assigned to record our deeds, others travel throughout the earth attending circles of Dhikr (Remembrance of Allah), others take turns among us by day and by night, and some hold the Throne etc. It is reported in the Sahih (authentic) Hadith: <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="Everydayseventythousandangels"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">Everyday, seventy thousand angels visit Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur (the house over the heavens parallel to Ka`bah), and never come again.</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> This indicates their great numbers and that only Allah Knows how many they are. Hence, we must believe in them generally and specifically as honored servants, not humans or Jinn, but as creatures created from light as narrated in the Sahih Hadith: <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="Angelswerecreatedfromlight"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">Angels were created from light, jinns were created from a smokeless flame of fire, and Adam was created from that which you have been told (i.e. sounding clay like the clay of pottery).</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Related by<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Muslim </span> in his Sahih on the authority of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> `Aishah </span>(may Allah be pleased with her) from the Prophet (peace be upon him). They were formed as Allah willed. Furthermore, they have their own deeds and Attributes which befit them; some of which are known through reports in the Sunnah, such as the appearance of Jibril in different forms or in the form with which Allah created him having six hundred wings, and at other times in the form of an unknown person who came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) to inquire about matters of Islam and Iman, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To explain further, they are formed according to Allah&#8217;s Will and their appearance is only known to Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) although they are known to have wings as mentioned by Allah in His noble Book in Surah Fatir and other matters which Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) told about in the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah. Thus, we should completely believe in them as far as their mentioned names and attributes are concerned, and generally accept that they are unknown to us, as are their affairs and attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>[Revealed Books]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same goes to believing in all the Books sent down by Allah, as the believer generally believes in all Allah&#8217;s books and that they are Books which Allah revealed upon His messengers and prophets we do not know about but we generally believe in them and that what was revealed in such Books refers only to Allah (may He be Praised and Exalted). However, some of these Books were made known to us such as Al-Tawrah (Torah), Injil (Gospel), Zabur (Book revealed to Prophet Dawud [David]) as well as scriptures of Ibrahim (Abraham) and Musa (Moses) and the Glorious Book, the Qur&#8217;an. We should believe in all these Books which were mentioned to us, and with regard to those, which were not mentioned to us, we have to believe that Allah sent them down to His messengers and prophets which He only knows unless there is evidence or a text from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that provides clarification of such books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>[Messengers]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We must believe generally in the Messengers of Allah that were sent to people to call them to Allah and on particular those mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an. He (Exalted be He) states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 36" target="_blank" name="Andverily,Wehavesentamong"></a><span style="color:#0000ff;">And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): “Worship Allâh (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from) Tâghût (all false deities i.e. do not worship Tâghût besides Allâh).”</span></span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Allah also says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Anbiya', 21: 25" target="_blank" name="AndWedidnotsendanyMessenger"></a><span style="color:#0000ff;">And We did not send any Messenger before you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) but We revealed to him (saying): Lâ ilâha illa Ana [none has the right to be worshipped but I (Allâh)], so worship Me (Alone and none else).&#8221;</span></span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Allah (Exalted be He) has sent the messengers as bearers of glad tidings and warners, but knowing exactly the number of such messengers and their names is a matter only known to Allah. Yet, it is authentically reported in the Hadith of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Abu Dharr, </span>which has some evidence from the Hadith of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Abu Umamah </span>and others that indicate the number of the messengers is more than three hundred and ten but the Isnad of such Hadiths is open for questions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the prophets, it was reported in some narrations that their number amounts to one hundred and twenty four thousand messengers. In another narration: one hundred and twenty thousand but some of the Isnads of such narrations are not authenticated. To distill, the specific number of prophets and messengers is only known to Allah (Exalted be He) alone (may He be Praised and Exalted). Therefore, we have to generally believe that there are messengers and prophets whom Allah sent to make the truth known and guide people to it, as Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Hajj, 22: 52" target="_blank" name="NeverdidWesendaMessengeror"></a><span style="color:#0000ff;">Never did We send a Messenger or a Prophet before you but when he did recite the revelation or narrated or spoke, Shaitân (Satan) threw (some falsehood) in it.</span></span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) also said: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al­Ahzab, 33: 40" target="_blank" name="Muhammad(صلىاللهعليهوسلم)is"></a><span style="color:#0000ff;">Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allâh and the last (end) of the Prophets</span>.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) also said: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Hadid, 57: 25" target="_blank" name="IndeedWehavesentOurMessengers"></a><span style="color:#0000ff;">Indeed, We have sent Our Messengers with clear proofs, and revealed with them the Scripture and the Balance (justice) that mankind may keep up justice</span>.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />Such Ayahs make it absolutely clear that there were many messengers and prophets whom Allah sent and He is the only One that knows their exact number.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This should form the basis of our Iman, whether generally or in detail, as they were so many and their mission was so great. They called to Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah/ monotheism); forbade Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship); elucidated Allah&#8217;s Shari`ah (Islamic Law); enjoined what Allah commanded and forbade the violation of His prohibitions. This is the sole goal of their mission. We should believe in those who were named in the Qur&#8217;an such as Nuh (Noah), Ibrahim, Musa,`Eisa, Dawud, Sulayman, Hud, Salih, and others including Adam, for it is reported in some narrations from<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Abu Dharr </span>and others that he is a prophet while other narrations tell that he is a messenger. There is no doubt that it a Shari`ah was revealed to him from Allah, but it is not known whether he is a prophet sent to people or just a prophet with no message. The narrations differed in this regard. It is known that Adam is one of the prophets and that its Shari`ah was revealed to him. This is supported by the Hadith of the gathering of people on the Day of Resurrection when the believers approach Nuh saying: <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="ONuhyouarethefirstmessenger"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">O Nuh, you are the first messenger Allah sent tohumankind.</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />This is evidence in support of the mission of Nuh and that he is the first messenger and that Adam is a prophet. Yet, even if he was a messenger, this means that he was a messenger to his children unlike Nuh who was sent to his people who were by then the entire population of the earth. As for Adam, he was sent to his offspring with a specific Shari`ah before Shirk prevailed. By contrast, Nuh was sent to his people who were the whole people on earth after Shirk dominated and prevailed. Thus, there is no conflict when Adam is a messenger, if the Hadith is sahih, and Nuh is the first messenger to the people of the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>[Last Day]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This could be said about the fifth pillar of Iman i.e. believing in the Last Day generally and in detail. We should believe in the existence of the events of the Last Day such as Jannah, Hellfire, Sirat (the bridge over the Fire), Mizan (the Scales for weighing deeds) and others which were not mentioned in detail in the Ayahs or the Hadiths but we are obliged to believe in it generally.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>[Qadr]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same is said about believing in Al-Qadar (Predestination), which is the sixth fundamental of Iman, as we should believe in it according to the texts on this regard. It should be noted that believing in Al-Qadar includes <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">four things</span></strong> as regards the creed of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: Knowing that Allah (may He be Praised) predestined everything and that His Knowledge encompasses everything, as He (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Anfal, 8: 75" target="_blank" name="Andthosewhobelievedafterwards,"></a>Verily, Allâh is the All-Knower of everything.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> This refutes the claim of extremists of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Qadariyyah (a deviant sect that claims Allah has no power over His Creation and humans are independent of Him) </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> and Mu`tazilah </span>who deny such Knowledge.<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Al-Shafi` </span>(may Allah be merciful with him) said, &#8220;Debate them with knowledge; if they acknowledge it, they are overcome and if they deny it, they disbelieve. That is because Al-Qadar means that Allah&#8217;s Knowledge encompasses everything, as matters cannot take place outside of His Knowledge. Once Allah predestined and decreed all things and matters, there is no way that they can take place in a way contrary to His Will; otherwise this would indicate Allah&#8217;s ignorance of their occurrence (Highly Exalted is Allah above their claims!)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, if they deny this and say that Allah (may He be Praised) does not know things except after theyalready exist, this is blatant Kufr (disbelief) and a form of disavowal to Allah (may He be Praised) and a description of Him with lack of knowledge, and therefore, whoever says this is a disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: Pre-writing and recording of what was and what will happen, as Allah (may He be Praised) predestined everything. He (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Hadid, 57: 22" target="_blank" name="Nocalamitybefallsontheearth"></a>No calamity befalls on the earth or in yourselves but it is inscribed in the Book of Decrees (Al-Lauh Al-Mahfûz) before We bring it into existence. Verily, that is easy for Allâh.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> He (may He be Praised) also says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Hajj, 22: 70" target="_blank" name="KnowyounotthatAllâhknowsall"></a>Know you not that Allâh knows all that is in the heaven and on the earth? Verily, it is (all) in the Book (Al-Lauh-al-Mahfûz). Verily that is easy for Allâh.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> This means that Allah decreed all things as indicated by the two mentioned Ayahs. This was also expressed by the Prophet (peace be upon him) in the Hadith narrated by<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> `Abdullah ibn `Amr ibn Al-`As </span> <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="Allahhadrecordedthedecrees"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">Allah had recorded the decrees of the creation fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth, as His Throne was upon water.</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Related by<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Muslim </span>in his Sahih.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Predestination of matters that were and that will be is supported by the texts of the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah. We have to believe that Allah ordained everything. Nothing is hidden from Him, His Knowledge encompasses everything, and He is omnipotent over all things. He (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Talaq, 65: 12" target="_blank" name="ItisAllâhWhohascreatedseven"></a>that you may know that Allâh has power over all things, and that Allâh surrounds all things in (His) Knowledge.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: Allah&#8217;s Mashi&#8217;ah (Will), namely whatever He wills happens and whatever He does not will never happens, and that nothing takes place without His Mashi&#8217;ah (Divine Will) that wanted it to happen regardless of people&#8217;s will and their desire for a certain matter to occur or not. This Belief is a prerequisite for the validity of one&#8217;s Iman. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Takwir, 81: 28" target="_blank" name="Towhomsoeveramongyouwhowills"></a>To whomsoever among you who wills to walk straight.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Takwir, 81: 29" target="_blank" name="Andyoucannotwillunless(it"></a>And you cannot will unless (it be) that Allâh wills &#8211; the Lord of the ‘Alamîn (mankind, jinn and all that exists).</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Allah (may He Be Glorified) also says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Muddathir, 74: 55" target="_blank" name="Sowhosoeverwill(lethimread"></a>So whosoever will (let him read it), and receive admonition (from it)!</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Muddathir, 74: 56" target="_blank" name="Andtheywillnotreceiveadmonition"></a>And they will not receive admonition unless Allâh wills; He (Allâh) is the One, deserving that mankind should be afraid of, and should be dutiful to Him, and should not take any Ilâh (god) along with Him, and He is the One Who forgives (sins).</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Allah (may He be Praised) has the absolute and perfect Mashi&#8217;ah, as He states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Ya­Sin, 36: 82" target="_blank" name="Verily,HisCommand,whenHeintends"></a>Verily, His Command, when He intends a thing, is only that He says to it, &#8220;Be!&#8221; &#8211; and it is!</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />(may He be Praised and Exalted).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth</strong>: The belief in Allah&#8217;s Power to create and make them exist as He has power over everything, the Supreme Creator, the All-Knower; He created all things and brought them into existence. This applies to the present and the future. He is the Omnipotent with no partner, the Creator, the Sustainer, and has power over all things. He (may He be Praised) states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Zumar, 39: 62" target="_blank" name="AllâhistheCreatorofallthings,"></a>Allâh is the Creator of all things, and He is the Wakîl (Trustee, Disposer of affairs, Guardian) over all things.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Believing in al-Qadar includes all the aforementioned prerequisites. It includes Iman in Allah&#8217;s Knowledge of everything and His Predestination; that whatever He wills happens, and whatever He does not will does not happen. Iman includes also the belief that Allah is the Supreme Creator Who created and caused all things to exist (may He be Praised). This refutes whoever claims otherwise from<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Mu`tazilah </span>and others. Whoever denies Allah&#8217;s Mashi&#8217;ah and claims that things happen beyond Allah&#8217; Will, then he refuses to accept the Omnipotence of Allah and does not give Him His due respect. Hence, every believer should have unquestionable Iman that Allah is potent over everything and that events occur according to His Cosmic Will. Yet, some people are inattentive of such articles of Iman with which the messengers were sent. Therefore, they should be educated about them with evidence and they should know the difference between Allah&#8217;s Divine Predestined Universal Will mentioned in His statement: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Ya­Sin, 36: 82" target="_blank" name="Verily,HisCommand,whenHeintends"></a>Verily, His Command, when He intends a thing, is only that He says to it, &#8220;Be!&#8221; &#8211; and it is!</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> andDivine Legal Will which is not applicable to all people such as the disbelievers which it is meant by Allah&#8217;s statement: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Nisa', 4: 26" target="_blank" name="Allâhwishestomakeclear(what"></a>Allâh wishes to make clear (what is lawful and what is unlawful) to you, and to show you the ways of those before you, and accept your repentance</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is known that some people have died while being ignorant of some basic tenets of Iman and without offering Tawbah (repentance to Allah). Allah (Exalted be He) says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Nisa', 4: 28" target="_blank" name="Allâhwishestolighten(theburden)"></a>Allâh wishes to lighten (the burden) for you</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> This is the Legal Will, because Allah eased matters for some people and left others. This means that Allah willed, loved and satisfied with it but some people were made to succeed in that while others failed. This is expressed in the sahih Hadith: <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="AllahtheExaltedwillsaytosome"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">Allah, the Exalted will say to some pagans on the Day of Resurrection: Would you like to go as ransom if you had all what equals to earth in gold? He would say: Yes. Allah would say to him: When you were in the loins of Adam, I asked you for something easier than this that you should not associate anything with Me. But you associated with Me others.</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />All messengers conveyed this message of worshipping Allah alone and forbidding associating others with Him but most people refused and took partners with Allah in worship and did not accept the Divine Will. Therefore, whoever believes in these four matters of Iman; Allah&#8217;s knowledge of all things; He predestined them to happen; He willed them to happen; and He is the Supreme Creator of all things, then he fully believes in Qadar but whoever falls short in this, his Iman is imperfect and is not following the creed of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah due to imperfect belief in all matters of Qadar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This belief in Qadar does not necessarily mean that the servant is predestined without a free will or Mashi&#8217;ah as a feather moved helplessly by the wind as claimed by<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Qadariyyah </span>who hold the view of Predestination from<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Jahmiyyah </span>and others, rather Human beings have choice, will, and volition,to discern truth from falsehood. Human beings have choice, will, and volition, but these are only realized through Allah&#8217;s Will (Glorified and Exalted be He), as He (Exalted be He) states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Takwir, 81: 28" target="_blank" name="Towhomsoeveramongyouwhowills"></a>To whomsoever among you who wills to walk straight.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Takwir, 81: 29" target="_blank" name="Andyoucannotwillunless(it"></a>And you cannot will unless (it be) that Allâh wills &#8211; the Lord of the ‘Alamîn (mankind, jinn and all that exists).</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Humans have free will and are predestined; free because Allah (may He be Praised) gave them minds, hearing, the ability to choose and the will to manage their spiritual and worldly affairs. They have wills by which they can avoid sin, obey Allah&#8217;s commands or disobey Him, and give in charity or not. In regard to being predestined, this occurs because humans cannot escape, due to their words and deeds, the Divine Decree and the Will of Allah (may He be Praised).They have a will but which can only be realized through Allah&#8217;s Will (Glorified and Exalted be He), and that is why Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Yunus, 10: 22" target="_blank" name="HeitisWhoenablesyoutotravel"></a>He it is Who enables you to travel through land and sea</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> By that, it could be said that human beings are predestined and also have free will and each person is led to that for which he has been created. Allah gives him the mind and the free will to act as he so likes. Similarly, he is predestined as far as Allah&#8217;s Knowledge is concerned and led to doing good or bad according to Allah&#8217;s Predestined Will, and as such, he cannot do anything contrary to what Allah decreed for him. In this regard, the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated: <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="Nodoperformgooddeedsforeveryone"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">No, do perform good deeds, for everyone is facilitated in that for which he has been created; For the good deeds are made easy for the blessed, and bad deeds are made easy for the wretched.&#8221; Then he recited the Ayahs: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Layl, 92: 5" target="_blank" name="Asforhimwhogives(incharity)"></a>As for him who gives (in charity) and keeps his duty to Allâh and fears Him,</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Layl, 92: 6" target="_blank" name="AndbelievesinAl-Husnâ."></a>And believes in Al-Husnâ.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Layl, 92: 7" target="_blank" name="Wewillmakesmoothforhimthe"></a>We will make smooth for him the path of ease (goodness).</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> </span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> and the next verse. (Agreed upon by Al-Bukhari and Muslim) from the Hadith of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> `Ali ibn Abu Talib </span>(may Allah be pleased with him). This makes it clear for a believer to differentiate between the creed of the Salaf (righteous predecessors) and that of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> the Mu`tazilah </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> and Qadariyyah </span>who denied the creed of Predestination, and<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Al-Qadariyyah </span>who held it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> As for the first sect of Qadariyyah, </span>they went so far in proving the Predestination that they said: The servant has no free willor Mashi&#8217;ah at all. Definitely, they were wrong about that although they were right in their proving of Al-Qadar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> the second sect of Qadariyyah </span>who denied Predestination, they also went far in that regard although they acknowledged that the human being has a free will and free choice but they separated it from Allah&#8217;s Will. Combining the merits of both sects, Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah hold the true opinions and abandoned their false thoughts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, it is incumbent upon those who seek Al-Haqq (the Truth) if they refute the claims of their adversaries to be fair in declaring what they benefited from them and what they avoided, telling them that you said so-and so and we agree with you in this regard and you said so-and-so and we do not accept that. They should say that they agree with them in believing in Al-Qadar but oppose their saying that the human being is predestined, as he has a free will and a free choice. It should be said to these sects of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Mu`tazilah </span>and their likes that we agree with the saying that the human being has a free will, but not confirming that this will is not realized through Allah&#8217;s Will and that His Mashi&#8217;ah is related to His Servant&#8217;s.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This should be said to the<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Shi`ah (Shi&#8217;ites) </span>that we are with you in your love Ahl-ul-Bayt (members of the Prophet&#8217;s extended Muslim family) and<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> `Ali </span>(may Allah be pleased with him), and that all goodness lies in following his way as one of the best companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him); rather he was the best after<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Al-Siddiq, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> `Umar </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> and `Uthman </span>(may Allah be pleased with them all). However, we contradict you in your claim of his infallibility or his precedence to the Caliphate after the Messenger of Allah as there are three persons before him more deserving of this honor. We are not with you with regard to your deifying him, seeking his help, making vows for him, and the like. Our dispute with you is because you went far from the righteous path, although we stand shoulder with shoulder with you in loving and revering Al-ul-Bayt who were committed to Allah&#8217;s Shari&#8217;ah, invoking Allah&#8217;s pleasure on them, and we believe that they are the best of Allah&#8217;s Creation as stated in the Messesnger of Allah&#8217;s will, as he said in the Hadith narrated by<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Zayd ibn Arqam </span>compiled in sahih<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Muslim: </span> <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="Iamleavingamongyoutwoweighty"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">I am leaving among you two weighty things: First: the Book of Allah in which there is right guidance and light, so hold fast to the Book of Allah and adhere to it&#8230; He then said: Second: the members of my household! I remind you (of your duties) to the members of my family.</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same applies to all other sects, as we accept their opinions that agree with the truth and admit that for them, and at the same time refute theirdeviance and falsehood through textual and rational evidence. Thus, it becomes so clear that these six fundamentals are themselves the pillars of this Deen and which include the essential tenets of Islam and Iman that whoever abides by their creed, in word and deed, then they have perfected their Iman and are saved from hypocrisy. This is because such articles of faith oblige the Mu&#8217;min to fulfill what Allah has obligated upon them and their belief in all that Allah informed us of in His Book or through the Prophet (peace be upon him) Sunnah. Whoever denies these articles or some of them is indeed not a Mu&#8217;min.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>[Summary]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In short, these fundamentals are great ones and basic rules for this Din and should be observed and abided by in all conditions avoiding what contradicts them. Whoever claims an opinion or does an act of disbelief proves his lack of true Iman in these prerequisites of faith or some of them, such as abandoning Salah (Prayer), as those who neglect Salah is utterly without faith, according to the soundest scholarly opinion; if he has true faith, it will hold him back from this sin. According to the most preponderant opinion, the person who neglects Salah commits kufr Akbar, for the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="Whatmakesoneadisbelieverand"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">What makes one a disbeliever and a polytheist is abandoning prayers.</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Recorded by<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Muslim </span>in his sahih. The Prophet (peace be upon him) also said: <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="Thatwhichdifferentiatesusfrom"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">That which differentiates us from the disbelievers and hypocrites is our performance of Salat. He who abandons it, becomes a disbeliever.</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Recorded by<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Al-Imam Ahmad </span>and Ahl-ul-Sunan (authors of Hadith compilations classified by jurisprudential themes) with a sahih (authentic) Sanad (chain of narrators) on the authority of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Buraydah ibn Al-Haseeb </span>(may Allah be pleased with him). Likewise, whoever shows disrespect to Allah (may He be Praised) or His Messenger (peace be upon him) or does not believe in what Allah told with regard to the existence of Jannah, Hellfire, and the Qur&#8217;an, then they are disblieversaccording to the Ijma` (consensus), because such mocking and disrespect reflect their false Iman or that they have no Iman at all in them due to such deviance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is also applicable to whoever desecrates the Mus-haf (Arabic Qur&#8217;an), blemishes it with impurity, or sits upon it knowing that it is the Book of Allah. This indicates that he has no faith at all; rather he only claims that; otherwise he would never commit such acts which render one a disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who mock the messengers or do not believe in them are disbelievers because by doing so, they admit their lack of true Iman and their falsely claiming to be believers. This applies to the other matters which people do, such as the people of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Musaylimah </span>who believed the call of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and offered Salah and Sawm (Fast), but at the same time they claimed that<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Musaylimah </span>is a partner with the Prophet in his mission. Accordingly, they were unanimously rendered disbelievers according to the scholars among the Sahabah and those who came after them, even though they offered Salah, Sawm, and said that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. Once they believed that<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Musaylimah </span>is a partner with Muhammad in his message, this alone entailed their Kufr, as they afterwards denied Allah&#8217;s statement: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al­Ahzab, 33: 40" target="_blank" name="Muhammad(صلىاللهعليهوسلم)is"></a>Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allâh and the last (end) of the Prophets.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />and denied the sahih and Mutawatir Hadiths that prove our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) as the Seal of prophets and messengers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> the Qadiyanis </span>and those among them who believed that Ghulam<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Ahmad </span>was a prophet to whom there was a certain message revealed by Allah, were regarded as having committed Kufr Akbar, because they are disbelievers of Allah and His Messenger, even if they offered Salah, Sawm and claimed themselves as Muslims. Those who also did not believe that the Jannah or Hellfire exist, and that the Hellfire is not a place of torment for its dwellers but a blessing for them as stated by<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Ibn `Arabi, </span>the deviant who is known for pantheism. Undoubtedly, this is a rejection of what Allah&#8217;s Book or the Sunnah of His Prophet mentioned as well as the Ijma` of scholars that the Hellfire is a place of torment, not pleasure, as a punishment for their neglect of what Allah enjoined upon them and committing what He forbade in addition to disbelieving in what the messengers called to. The Qur&#8217;an has many Ayahs indicating that the disbelievers will be punished with torment in the Hellfire. Nobody can deny this except a stubborn, arrogant, and ignorant person who is totally unaware of what the messengers were sent with or with no mind at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This makes it clear that evidence of Islamic matters is derived from the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah according to what Allah and His Messenger told as well as the authentically reported words from the Salaf of this Ummah (nation). Whoever refuses this and claims what contradicts these fundamentals of Iman deviates from the Straight Path and their claim is false.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) to grant us a good understanding of His Book and the Sunnah of His Prophet, and to bestow upon us and all Muslims the blessing of true Iman and good deed. May Allah make us steadfast in adhering to the Truth until we meet Him (may He be Praised)! Indeed, He is All-Hearer and Responsive! May peace and blessing be upon His Servant and Messenger, our Prophet, his Family, Companions, and those who followed him in righteousness!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Faith has both apparent and hidden aspects. Its apparent aspect is when it is related by the tongue and acted upon by the body. The hidden aspect is the acknowledgment of the heart, and its submission and love. Therefore, the apparent aspect of faith will be of no use for someone who does not have the hidden aspect, though his blood is spared and his wealth and children are preserved by it. And no hidden aspect will be of any use, unless there is no fear that it will be weakened, coerced or in fear of being ruined. Therefore, the failure of apparent deeds without the existence of any real prevention, means the corruption of the hidden aspect and lack of faith. Its deficiency refers to its deficiency of faith and intensity refers to its intensity of faith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, faith is the heart and core of Islam, and certainty is the heart and core of faith.<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> Any piece of knowledge or deed that does not make faith and certainty stronger is abnormal, and any faith that does not urge one to perform good deeds is abnormal.</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Source : </strong>Imam Ibn AI-Qayyim, <strong>Kitab al Fawa&#8217;id pg. 6-8</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This chapter clearly shows that Allah, the Exalted returns the same body that had obeyed or disobeyed Him in life, in  order to reward or punish it just like He rewards the soul itself, which believes in Him and punishes the one, which disbelieves in Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That does not mean that Allah, the Exalted creates another soul, which will be rewarded or punished, as some people say.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such people do not understand the nature of the  Resurrection, which the Messengers informed mankind about.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They claim that Allah, the Exalted will create another body that is different in all aspects and that Allah will reward or punish it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They also say that the soul is simply a part of the body, so Allah will create another soul other than this one and a body other than this body.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This belief is contrary to what the Messengers taught, and what the Qur&#8217;an, Sunnah, and other Books of Allah, the Exalted say. This is in fact denial of the Resurrection and adopting the belief of the disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such people find it difficult to comprehend that Allah, the Exalted will recreate the very same body and soul that had known life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They cannot imagine how the body will  become bones and dust and Allah will create it again in its original form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah quotes them as saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">أَإِذَا مِتْنَا وَكُنَّا تُرَابًا وَعِظَامًا أَإِنَّا لَمَبْعُوثُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">which means, &#8220;When we are dead and have become dust and  bones, shall we (then) verily be resurrected? (As-Saffat, 37:16)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And such people also say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ذَٰلِكَ رَجْعٌ بَعِيدٌ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">which means, &#8221; That is a far return.&#8221; (Qaf, 50:3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If what they assert is true and another body other than  the one that had known in life is rewarded or punished, this will neither be Resurrection nor returning back, indeed, it would be a new creation altogether.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the following verse would be rendered meaningless. May Allah forbid!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">قَدْ عَلِمْنَا مَا تَنقُصُ الْأَرْضُ مِنْهُمْ ۖ وَعِندَنَا كِتَابٌ حَفِيظٌ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">which means, &#8220;We know that which the earth takes of them (their dead bodies). 11 (Qaf, 50:4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah answered the question that He, the Exalted will separate these pieces which had mixed with the earth and turned it into elements which are difficult to be separated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allah, the Exalted told mankind that He knows what the earth is taking from their flesh, bones, and hair and just as He knows these pieces He is capable of separating, and gathering them after being separated, and creating them again.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Exalted decides the time of Resurrection by His perfect knowledge, power, and wisdom.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The likeness [of the munâfiq] is as the likeness of one who kindled a fire; then, when it lighted all around him, Allâh took away their light and left them in darkness. So they could not see. They are deaf, dumb and blind, so they return not [to the Right Path].</span> (Quran 2:17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qatâdah – Allâh’s mercy be upon him – said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the likeness Allâh has given of the Hypocrite (munâfiq); he says lâ ilâha illallâh and with it marries into the Muslims, inherits from the Muslims, fights alongside the Muslims, and protects his blood and wealth. But when death comes, [the testimony of faith] has no basis in his heart, and no reality in his actions, so the munâfiq is stripped of it at death and left in darkness and blindness wondering therein, just as he was blind about the right of Allâh and obedience to Him in his worldly life and deaf to the truth.</p>
</blockquote>
