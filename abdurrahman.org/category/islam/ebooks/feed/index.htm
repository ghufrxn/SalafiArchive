<p style="text-align:justify;">This book is a complete translation of a treatise entitled “<strong>Kayfa Yajibu ‘alaynaa an Nufassir al-Qur’aan-al-Kareem</strong>” (How are we Obligated to Interpret the Noble Qur’aan).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The source used for the translation was the Al-Maktabah al-Islaamiyyah first edition published in 1421H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The foundation of this treatise is questions that were posed to the Shaikh, may Allaah have mercy on him, to which he responded in recorded format. These questions and answers were then transcribed, printed on paper and presented to the Shaikh who read them and commented on them in his own handwriting. The publishing house printed and distributed the book after the death of Imaam Al- Albaanee due to the great benefit found in the work since the author discusses several rules and principles related to interpreting the meanings of the Qur’aan, which every Muslim should follow when trying to understand the Book of Allaah.</p>

We seek refuge in Allah, the Most High, from the evils of our own selves and from our wicked deeds. Whomsoever has been guided by Allah, none can misguide him, and whomsoever has been misguided by Allah, none can guide him. I bear witness that there is no true god worthy of being worshipped except Allah, alone, without partner or associate. I further bear witness that Muhammad is His true slave and Messenger. May Allah, the Exalted, bestow His peace and blessings on the final Prophet Muhammad, upon his good and pure family, and upon all of his noble companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="quran">&#8220;O you who believe! Fear Allah (by doing all that He ordered and abstaining from all that He has forbidden) as He should be feared, and die not except in the state of Islam (as Muslims with complete submission to Allah).&#8221;</span></strong></span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 3:102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="quran">&#8220;O mankind! Be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person (&#8216;Adam) and from him He created his wife, and from them both He created many men and women; and fear Allah through Whom you demand your mutual (rights) and (do no cut the relations of) the wombs (kinship). Surely, Allah is ever an All Watcher over you.&#8221;</span></strong></span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 4:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="quran">&#8220;O you who believe! Keep your duty to Allah and fear Him, and speak (always) the truth, He will direct you to do righteous good deeds and will forgive you your sins.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that the most truthful speech is that of Allah&#8217;s Book (the <em>Qur&#8217;an</em>), and that the best of guidance is that of Muhammad, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>. The worst of evils are innovations (foreign to the true teachings of Islam), and every innovated matter (in religion) is a <em>bid&#8217;ah</em>, and every <em>bid&#8217;ah</em> is a misguidance, and every mean of misguidance is in the Fire of Hell.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an introductory book for every Muslim. It is a summary of basic Islamic beliefs and acts of worship. We ask Allah by His Names and Attributes to accept this work and make it a benefit for those who read it and / or distribute it.</p>

<h3 id="h2-the-first-lesson-memorise-the-small-chapters-of-the-qur-an" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The First Lesson &#8211; Memorise the Small Chapters of the <em>Qur&#8217;an</em></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Memorizing the opening <em>surah</em> (chapter) of the <em>Qur&#8217;an</em>, <em>al-Fatihah</em> (the Opening) and some short passages and chapters from No. 99 (<em>az-Zalzalah</em>) to 114 (<em>an-Nas</em>). Every Muslim must make an effort to memorize, recite and understand passages and/or chapters from the Noble <em>Qur&#8217;an</em>.</p>
<h3 id="h3-the-second-lesson-the-conditions-of-the-shahadah" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Second Lesson &#8211; The Conditions of the <em>Shahadah</em></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowing the meaning and the conditions of the declaration of <em>ash-shahadatan</em> that, &#8220;There is no true God except Allah, and that Muhammad, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, is the Messenger of Allah&#8221;. The phrase that &#8220;there is no true God&#8221; negates anything or anyone that is being worshipped other than Allah, and the phrase, &#8220;except Allah&#8221;, confirms that all forms of worship, submission and adoration must be for Allah Alone, without setting up rivals with Him. The conditions needed to fulfill the meaning of <em>ash-shahadatan</em> are:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Knowledge about what it means;</li>
<li>Certainty about its meaning which dispels doubts and suspicions;</li>
<li>Sincerity that purifies its declarer from any form of <em>shirk</em> (association);</li>
<li>Honesty which negates hypocrisy;</li>
<li>Love and attachment to the declaration of <em>ash-shahadatan</em>, which leads to the dispel of uneasiness, dislike, or hate to what it implies;</li>
<li>Adherance &#8211; conducting what Allah has decreed regarding His worship;</li>
<li>Accepting to obey Allah by this declaration; and</li>
<li>Dissociating from anything or anyone being worshipped other than Allah.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="h4-the-third-lesson-the-six-fundamentals-of-faith" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Third Lesson &#8211; The Six Fundamentals of Faith</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The six fundamental articles of faith are:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Believing in Allah (His Oneness);</li>
<li>His Angels;</li>
<li>All of His Messengers;</li>
<li>All of His Scriptures (in their original and unaltered forms);</li>
<li>In the Last Day (of Judgment); and</li>
<li>Fate and Divine Decree (whether good or bad), which Allah Has measured and ordained according to His previous Knowledge and as deemed suitable by His Wisdom.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="h5-the-fourth-lesson-what-is-tawhid-and-shirk" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Fourth Lesson &#8211; What is <em>Tawhid</em> and <em>Shirk</em>?</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Tawhid</em> (Faith in the Unity of Allah) is divided into three articles:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Believing in the Oneness of Allah in the sense of His being the only Creator, Preserver, Nourisher, etc. This belief is called <em>tawhid ar-rububiyah</em>;</li>
<li>Acknowledging that Allah Alone is the One and Only true God who deserves to be worshipped and thus abstaining from worshipping any other being or thing. This belief is called <em>tawhid al-uluhiyah</em>; and</li>
<li>Having faith and belief in the Oneness of Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes. This belief is called <em>tawhid al-asma was-sifat</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <em>shirk</em> (associating anything or anyone in worship with Allah), it is divided into three types:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Major <em>shirk</em> (<em>ash-shirk al-akbar</em>) which Allah does not forgive. Allah says regarding <em>shirk</em>:<span class="quran">&#8220;But if they had joined in worship others with Allah, all that they used to do would have been of no benefit to them.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 6: 88]<span class="quran">&#8220;It is not for the <em>mushrikin</em> (polytheists) to maintain the Mosques of Allah (i.e. to pray and worship Allah therein, to looking after their cleanness and their building, etc.), while they witness against their ownselves of disbelief. The works of such bear no fruit, and in fire shall they dwell.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 9:17]The one who associate others with Allah and dies on this <em>shirk</em> will not be forgiven and<em>Jannah</em> (Paradise) is forbidden to him, as Allah, <em>Most Mighty and Honored</em>, says:<span class="quran">&#8220;Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him in worship, but He forgives anything else, to whom He pleases; and whoever sets up partners with Allah in worship, he has indeed invented a tremendous sin.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em>4:48]<span class="quran">&#8220;Verily, whosoever sets up partners in worship with Allah, then Allah has forbidden the <em>Jannah</em> for him.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 5:72]Asking the dead or idols for help, slaughtering for them and making vows for them are examples of this <em>shirk</em>.</li>
<li>Minor <em>shirk</em> (<em>ash-shirk al-asgar</em>) which is stated in the <em>Qur&#8217;an</em> or in the Prophet&#8217;s tradition but is not the same as major <em>shirk</em>. <em>Riya</em> (showing off) and swearing by other than Allah are examples of this kind of <em>shirk</em>. Prophet Muhammad, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, said:<span class="hadith">&#8220;Of which I fear for you the most is minor shirk.&#8221;</span> When he was asked what was it, he said, <span class="hadith">&#8220;Riya.&#8221;</span>He, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, also said, <span class="hadith">&#8220;He who swears by anything other than Allah commits minor <em>shirk</em>.&#8221;</span>The Prophet, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, also warned, <span class="hadith">&#8220;Do not say, &#8216;Had Allah and such and such (person) willed&#8217;, but say, &#8216;Had Allah then such and such (person) willed.&#8217; &#8220;</span>. This kind of <em>shirk</em> does not necessarily lead to disbelief from Islam or an eternal stay in Hell. It negates, however, the completeness of faith.</li>
<li>Hidden <em>shirk</em>. Prophet Muhammad, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, explained, <span class="hadith">&#8220;Shall I not tell you of which I fear for you more than I fear of the Antichrist?&#8221;</span> They said, &#8220;Yes, O Messenger of Allah&#8221;, and he said, <span class="hadith">&#8220;Hidden shirk, where one beautifies his way of praying only because another one is looking at him.&#8221;</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Alternatively, <em>shirk</em> could be divided into two kinds &#8211; major and minor. In this case, the hidden<em>shirk</em> encompasses both the major and minor kinds depending upon the act committed. It is major if it is the same as the <em>shirk</em> of the hypocrites who hide their false beliefs while showing off Islam out of fear. It is minor if it is the same as <em>riya</em>.</p>
<h3 id="h6-the-fifth-lesson-the-five-pillars-of-islam" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Fifth Lesson &#8211; The Five Pillars of Islam</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The five pillars of Islam are <em>ash-shahadatan</em> (bearing witness that there is none worthy of being worshipped except Allah and that Muhammad, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, is His Messenger), establishing prayers, paying the alms (<em>zakah</em>), fasting the month of <em>Ramadhan</em>, and performing pilgrimage (<em>Hajj</em>) if one can afford it.</p>
<h3 id="h7-the-sixth-lesson-the-nine-conditions-of-prayer" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Sixth Lesson &#8211; The Nine Conditions of Prayer</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The nine conditions of prayers are Islam, sanity, maturity, performing the ablution (<em>wudu</em>), cleanliness from impurities (on the body, clothes, and place of prayer), dressing properly, having the intention of prayers, facing the right direction of <em>qiblah</em> (direction of the <em>Ka&#8217;bah</em> at Makkah), and the praying at the proper time.</p>
<h3 id="h8-the-seventh-lesson-the-basic-elements-of-prayer" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Seventh Lesson &#8211; The Basic Elements of Prayer</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourteen basic elements (<em>arkan</em>) of prayers are standing (if one is able), saying <em>allahu akbar</em>(Allah is the Greatest), reading the opening <em>surah</em> of the <em>Qur&#8217;an</em> (<em>al-Fatihah</em>), lowering the head and back down at the right angle (<em>ruku&#8217;</em>), resuming the initial standing position, prostrating with the toes of both feet, both knees, both hands and the forehead touching the ground (<em>sujud</em>), rising in a sitting position, a short rest in a sitting posture between the two prostrations, tranquility in all actions, performing the basic elements of prayer in order, the last <em>tashahud</em> (the second part), sitting for the last <em>tashahud</em>, exalting the Prophet Muhammad, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, and turning the face to the right side and to the left one saying <em>as-salamu &#8216;alaykum wa rahmatullah</em> (peace and mercy of Allah be upon you) one time on each side.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Note: <em>Salah</em> is invalid if any of the above is missing.)</p>
<h3 id="h9-the-eighth-lesson-the-obligatory-acts-of-prayer" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Eighth Lesson &#8211; The Obligatory Acts of Prayer</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eight obligatory acts of the prayer are all the occasions of saying <em>allahu akbar</em> other than<em>takbirat al-ihram</em> (which is basic); saying <em>samiallahuliman hamidah</em> (Allah accepts any who are thankful to Him) by the <em>Imam</em> as well as the one who is praying alone, and saying <em>rabbana wa laka al-hamd</em> (Our Lord, praise be to You) for both the <em>Imam</em> and the individual; saying <em>subhana rabbi al-athim</em> (Glory to my Lord, the Most Great) in <em>ruku</em>; saying <em>subhana rabbi al-a&#8217;la</em> (Glory to my Lord, the Most High) in <em>sujud</em>; saying <em>rabighfirli</em> (Oh my Lord, grant forgiveness to me) between the two prostrations; the first part (<em>at-tashahud al-awwal</em>); and sitting for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Note: if any of the above is missing, the Muslim needs to make <em>sujud al-sahw</em>).</p>
<h3 id="h10-the-ninth-lesson-the-contents-of-at-tashahud" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Ninth Lesson &#8211; The Contents of <em>At-Tashahud</em></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowing the contents of <em>at-tashahud</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First Part: <em>&#8220;At-tahiyyato lillahi was-salawatu wat-tayyibat. As-salamu alayka ayyuha an-nabi warahmatullahi wa barakatuh, as-salamu alayna wa ala ibadillahi as-salihin, ashadu an la ilaha illallah, wa ashadu anna muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Greetings, prayers ant the good things of life belong to Allah . Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the Mercy of Allah and His blessings. Peace be upon us all and on the righteous servants of Allah. I bear witness that there is no true God worthy of worship but Allah alone, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His true slave and Messenger.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second Part: <em>&#8220;Allahumma salli ala muhammad wa ala ali muhammad kama sallayta ala ibrahima wa ala ali ibrahim. Wa barik ala muhammad wa ala ali muhammad, kama barakta ala ibrahima wa ala ali ibrahim, innaka hamidon majid.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Oh Allah! Exalt Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, as you did exalt Ibrahim (Abraham) and the family of Abraham. And bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, as you did bless Abraham and the people of Abraham, verily You are the Most Praised, The Most Glorious.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Following the reciting of the <em>tashahud</em>, the slave asks Allah&#8217;s protection from the torment of Hell, the torment of the grave, the trials in life-time and after death, and from the impostor Anti-Christ. After that he may supplicate and ask Allah whatever he wishes, especially the type of invocation said by the Prophet, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="hadith">&#8220;O Allah help me to perform remembrance of You and to give all due thanks to You and allow me to worship you in the good way (i.e. as ordained by Allah and His Messenger). O Allah I have inflicted a great deal of wrong upon myself and there is none other than You who can offer forgiveness. Grant me forgiveness from You and grant me your Mercy. You are the All-Merciful, The Oft Forgiving.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3 id="h11-the-tenth-lesson-the-sunan-acts-of-prayer" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Tenth Lesson &#8211; The <em>Sunan </em>Acts of Prayer</span></h3>

<li>The opening call of the prayer;</li>
<li>Placing the right hand over the left one with both over the chest while in the standing position;</li>

<li>Saying &#8220;<em>rabighfer li warhamni wahdini warzuqni wa&#8217;afni, wajburni</em>&#8221; (Allah, my Lord, grant me forgiveness, have mercy on me, guide me, provide me with your blessings and console me) more than once between the two prostrations;</li>
<li>Bowing down, making the head and back on one level. This is the position of <em>ruku</em>;</li>

<li>Reciting another passage from the Holy <em>Qur&#8217;an</em> after the opening <em>surah</em> of <em>al-Fatihah</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h12-the-eleventh-lesson-invalidation-of-the-prayer" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Eleventh Lesson &#8211; Invalidation of the Prayer</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Any prayer is invalid and nullified if any of the following acts are committed &#8211; Intentional talking, laughing, eating, drinking, uncovering the parts of the body of which are not allowed to be uncovered during prayer, excessive alteration in the direction towards the <em>qiblah</em>, excessive moving outside the regular acts and movements of prayer, without a proper reason and nullifying the ablution.</p>
<h3 id="h13-the-twelfth-lesson-the-conditions-for-ablution" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Twelfth Lesson &#8211; The Conditions for Ablution</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ten conditions for performing ablution are:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Islam;</li>
<li>Sanity;</li>
<li>Maturity;</li>
<li>Intention;</li>
<li>&#8230; its continuity (i.e. the person should not intend to discontinue his ablution before its completion);</li>
<li>If one performs <em>istinja&#8217;</em> (cleaning the areas of natural discharges with water) or with stones, tissues, leaves etc. (<em>istijmar</em>) before ablution;</li>
<li>Water must be pure and <em>mubah</em> (i.e. it is not stolen or taken by force);</li>
<li>The removal of all things that prevent water from reaching the parts of ablution such as mud;</li>
<li>Those who continually lose their ablution (for example due to release of gas, urine, or any reason that nullifies ablution), must make prior to prayers; and</li>
<li>Causes that requires ablution (e.g. urine, eating camel meat, sleep, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="h14-the-thirteenth-lesson-the-obligatory-elements-of-ablution" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Thirteenth Lesson &#8211; The Obligatory Elements of Ablution</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The obligatory elements of ablution are:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Washing the face, including rinsing out the mouth with water and cleansing the nostrils of the nose;</li>
<li>Washing the two hands up to and including the elbows;</li>
<li>Wiping the whole head including the two ears;</li>
<li>Washing the two feet including the heels; and</li>
<li>Doing the ablution in the prescribed sequence, without delays.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h15-the-fourteenth-lesson-the-six-nullifying-acts-of-ablution" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Fourteenth Lesson &#8211; The Six Nullifying Acts of Ablution</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The six nullifying acts of the ablution are:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Natural excretion, such as urine, feaces, gas, etc.;</li>
<li>Any unclean substance excessively discharged from the body;</li>
<li>Losing one&#8217;s reason due to sleep, loss of consciousness or otherwise;</li>
<li>Eating camel meat (because the Prophet, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, ordered so);</li>
<li>Rejection of Islam; and</li>
<li>Touching the sexual organs with hand (without any barrier: clothes and so on).</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Notice: Washing the dead does not nullify the ablution except for that the washer&#8217;s hand touches (without any barrier) the sexual organs. Kissing women with or without desire does not nullify ablution because the Prophet, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, once kissed one of his wives and prayed without performing ablution. This holds as long as there is no associated sexual excretions (e.g. semen). As for the saying of Allah, Most Glorified:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="quran">&#8221; &#8230; or you have been in contact with women (by sexual relations) &#8230; &#8220;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 4: 43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The contact with women is the involvement in a full sexual relation as related by Ibn Abbas (companion) and others, and it is the correct opinion.</p>
<h3 id="h16-the-fifteenth-lesson-recommend-morals" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Fifteenth Lesson &#8211; Recommend Morals</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The recommended morals for every Muslim are truthfulness, honesty, abstinence, modesty, courage, generosity, loyalty, refraining from everything that Allah had made unlawful, being a good neighbor, helping the needy, and other morals stated either in the Holy <em>Qur&#8217;an</em> or in the Prophet&#8217;s, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, tradition.</p>
<h3 id="h17-the-sixteenth-lesson-islamic-decencies" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Sixteenth Lesson &#8211; Islamic Decencies</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islamic decencies &#8211; greeting, cheerfulness, eating and drinking with the right hand, adhering to the Islamic conduct in entering and leaving homes and mosques and while traveling, dealing kindly with parents, relatives, neighbors, the old man and the young; congratulating, lamenting, and other Islamic ethics.</p>
<h3 id="h18-the-seventeenth-lesson-warning-others" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Seventeenth Lesson &#8211; Warning Others</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Warning against <em>shirk</em> (association) and against other wrongdoing such as witchcraft, murdering, taking the money of the orphan, dealing with interest (<em>riba</em>), escaping on the day of<em>Jihad</em> (war), speaking evil of faithful women, disobeying parents, breaking up with one&#8217;s relatives, false witnessing, harming neighbors, committing outrage upon others, and other warnings as declared by Allah and His messenger, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<h3 id="h19-the-eighteenth-lesson-the-funeral-prayer" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Eighteenth Lesson &#8211; The Funeral Prayer</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Washing the dead body and performing the funeral prayer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a) Washing the dead:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a Muslim is confirmed dead his eyes must be closed and his jaws brought together.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When washing the dead body, the whole body beginning with the exposed parts of ablution must be washed. The abdomen is gently squeezed and followed by washing of the anus and the sexual organs using a wet piece of cloth. Normal ablution will then be performed. The body is washed starting with the head and beard using water mixed with the leaves of<em>sidr</em> (lote tree, if available). The right side must be washed before the left side and the body must be washed three times. Each time the abdomen is squeezed as above. The mustache and the nails are clipped, and when the body is clean, it is wrapped in three white cotton sheets covering all parts of the body and perfumed with incense. If the body is still unclean, ablution must be extended to 5-7 times after which the body is dried with a clean cloth. Men&#8217;s hair should not be combed while that of a woman is to be braided into three chains and left hanging down behind her (as done to the Prophet&#8217;s daughter).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is preferred to shroud men with three white sheets without a gown or <em>amamah</em> (head cover); children in one up to three sheets and women in five sheets, these sheets are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Dir&#8217;</em>: a loose outer garment with sleeves slit in front.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Khimar</em>: covering head and face.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Izar</em>: a sheet wrapped around the waist, and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Two overall wrapping sheets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Young girls can be wrapped with a gown and two sheets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who has the most right to wash the dead body of a man is his chosen guardian (if any) then his father, his grandfather, then the closest of his relatives. The woman is best washed by her chosen female then the mother, the grandmother, then the closest one of her female relatives. The husband can wash the body of his wife and vice versa because Abu Bakr, <em>may Allah be pleased with him</em>, was washed by his wife; and Ali ibn Abi Talib, <em>may Allah be pleased with him</em>, washed his wife, Fatimah, the daughter of the Prophet, <em>may Allah be pleased with her</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b) The funeral prayer (<em>salat ul-janazah</em>):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saying <em>takbir</em> (<em>allahu akbar</em>) four times. Reciting <em>al-Fatihah</em> after the first <em>takbir</em>. Following the second <em>takbir</em>, one prays for the Prophet, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, as he does in<em>tashahud</em>. Then after saying <em>allahu akbar</em> for the third time, one recites what is usually said in other prayers like asking Allah to forgive all Muslims or any supplications he knows, preferably this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;Allahumma ighfir li hayyina wa mayyitina, wa shahidina wa ghaibina wa sagheerina wa kabeerina wa thakarina wa unthana. Allahumma man ahyaytahu minna fa ahyihi ala al Islam, wa man tawaffaytah u minna fa tawaffahu ala al-iman. Allahmma la tahrimna ajrah, wa la taftinna badah.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O Allah, grant forgiveness to our living and to our dead, and to those who are present and to those who are absent, and to our young and our old folk, and to our males and our females. O Allah, whomsoever you grant to live, from among us, help him to live in Islam and whomsoever of us you cause to die, help him to die in faith. O Allah, do not deprive us of the reward for patience on his (her, their) loss and do not make us subject to trial after him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or one could say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;Allahumma ighfir lah u warhamhu wa&#8217;afihi wa&#8217;fu anhu, wa&#8217;akrim nuzulahu wa wassi&#8217; madkhalahu, wa&#8217;ghsilhu bil mae wathalgi walbarad, wanaqihi mina al-thunoubi walkhataya kama unaqa athawbo alabiado mina addanas, wa abdilhu daran khairan min darihi, wa ahlan khairan min ahlihi, wa adkhilhu al-jannah, wa aidhu min adhabi al qabr, wa adhabi an-nar; wafsah lahu fi qabrihi, wanawir lahu fehi. Allahumma la tahrimna ajrahu, wa la tudhlilna ba&#8217;dahu.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O Allah forgive him (her, them) and have your Mercy upon him; protect him and pardon him, receive him with honor and make his grave spacious; wash him with water, snow and hail, and clean him from sins and wrong-doings as is cleaned a white garment from impurity; requite him with an abode more excellent than his, and with a mate better than his mate. Admit him to the Garden, and protect him from the torment of the grave and the torment of the Fire; widen his space in his grave and bring him light therein. O Allah don&#8217;t deprive us from his reward and don&#8217;t let us go astray after him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then after saying <em>allahu akbar</em> for the fourth time one turns his head to the right (making<em>taslim</em>) and thus ending the funeral prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is best to raise one&#8217;s hand while saying <em>allahu akbar</em>. In the case when the dead is a child or an infant, the following <em>du&#8217;a</em> is made:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;Allahumma ejalhu dhiktan liwalidayehi, washafeean mujaban. Allahuma thaqil bihi mawazeenahuma wa a&#8217;dhun bihi ujorahuma wa alhiqhu bi salih al-mu&#8217;minin, waj&#8217;alhu fi kafalati ibrahim alayhi as-salam, waqihi bi rahmatika adhaba al-jahim.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O Allah make him a preceding reward and a reserve treasure (on the Day of Judgment) for his parents; a one whose intercession would be granted. O Allah make of him an excess in the measures and in the rewards (granted by Allah) to his parents. Let him join the company of the righteous believers and make him under the care of Abraham (may the peace of Allah be upon him), and protect him, by Your Mercy, from the torment of the blazing Fire.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tradition is for the <em>Imam</em> to stand right next to the head of the body if it is a man, and to the middle of the body if it is a woman. If the dead were many, men, women, male and female children in one funeral, the following positions are to be taken:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The men right in front of the <em>Imam</em>. The women further towards the <em>qiblah</em>. The male children are between the men and women and more towards the men while the female children follow women further down in the direction of <em>qiblah</em> (all of the dead bodies are to be laid parallel to those praying). The bodies are to be arranged such that the head of the male child lies next to that of a man while the middle of a woman lies next to the head of a man. The head of the female child lies next to the head of a woman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The followers of <em>Imam</em> are to stand behind him just as in other prayers. It is acceptable for one to stand to the right of the <em>Imam</em> if he finds no place behind him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>All praise is due to Allah and His blessings and peace be upon His Prophet, his family and his companions.</em></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>An excerpt taken from the Chapter</strong>: <em>Listening to The ‘Eid Khutbah</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Haafidh Ibn Battal</em> mentioned in ‘<em>Sharh Saheeh al-Bukhaaree</em>’, vol.2, pg. 572: “The scholars considered the people talking as the <em>Imaam </em>gives the <em>khutbah </em>as being <em>makrooh</em> (disliked).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the <em>hadeeth</em>: “Indeed, we will give the <em>khutbah</em>, thus whoever wishes to stay for the <em>khutbah</em> is to sit and stay and whoever wishes to leave, may leave.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The majority of the People of Knowledge are of the opinion that this <em>hadeeth</em> is <em>mursal</em> and from those scholars who were of this opinion include: <em>Ibn Ma’een, Abu Zur’ah ar-Raazee, an-Nasaa’ee, Abu Daawood, al-Bayhaqee</em>and <em>al-Waadi’ee</em>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>From the Introduction of the Book:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">KNOW, may Allaah’s Mercy be upon me and you, that the issue of Soofism may be confusing to some and may be clear to others. Many have come to know about Soofism as the highest form of “Spiritual Islamic practices.” A kind of rich tradition, that only the special and very pious can adhere to and practice. Consequently, if Soofism is criticized, they see that as an insult to Islam. Some, however, consider Soofism as a “Spiritual” path which Muslims and non-Muslims can associate with. The fact, however, is that the reality of Soofism is known only to the few amongst Muslims. This is due, in part, to the very deceptive nature of the propagation of the teachings of Soofism as done by its advocates who present it as a very special way of worship that is linked to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and his noble companions (may Allah be pleased with them) and those who follow their path in righteousness. Is it, however, the case?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Attempting to answer this question about “Soofism,” I ask Allaah, the Most High, to assist me in relating the truth and to make this effort sincerely done for His Most Honorable Face.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>In conclusion</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sensible person must not be deceived therefore in the deceptive ways of mystic Soofism which tries to present itself as ‘spiritual Islam.” <strong>True spiritual matters in Islam do not oppose the Sharee’ah in any way</strong>. The address of Islam to the actions of the hearts is based upon sincerity and following the path of the Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم. This is the way that truly draws the person to Allaah.</p>
<p>May Allaah guide all Muslims to the Path of Righteousness.<br />
He is All-Able to do all things. Aameen.</p>

Have You not entered us into the paradise and saved us from the fire?!&#8221; He (the Prophet) said: ‘He (Allaah) will then remove the covering and they will not be given anything more beloved to them than looking at their Lord, the Mighty and Majestic.’ </span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">There is a connection between seeing Allaah and the prayer. Whoever is from the people who establish prayer, then he is much deserving of this favor. And the one who is neglectful (of the prayer) then he is worthy of being deprived (of this favor) and will be from the people of loss. Certainly, this connection is substantiated by the Book and the Sunnah. As for the Book, Allaah says:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#008000;">“Faces that Day will radiant (22) Looking towards their Lord, (23) And many faces, that day, will be gloomy, (24) Realizing that a back-breaking calamity is going to be afflicted on them. (25) Never, (you will never remain in this world forever!) When the soul (of a patient) reaches the clavicles, (26) And it is said, “Who is an enchanter (that can save him?)” (27) And he realizes that it is (the time of) departure (from the world,) (28) And one shank is intertwined with the other shank, (29) Then on that day, it is to your Lord that one has to be driven. (30) So (the denier of the Hereafter) neither believed, nor prayed, (31) But rejected the truth and turned away (from it)(32)”</span> (75:22-32)</p>



<p>So His statement:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Faces that day will be radiant&#8221;</strong> </span>(75:22)<br />Meaning; from the beauty, meaning a beautiful radiance; brightly pleased. And His statement:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Looking at their Lord&#8221;</strong> </span>(75:23)<br />Meaning: by seeing Him with their eyes, by their vision.</p>



<p>Hasan al-Basri said:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">&#8216;They have the right to be radiant while they are looking at the Creator. Then Exalted is He, mentioned another category (of people) the people whose faces will be contorted, completely gloomy. He mentioned from among their actions was abandonment of the prayer. This shows that the people of the first category are the people of radiance and are those who will see Allaah. These are from the people who establish the prayer.&#8217;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>As for (evidence from) the Sunnah</strong>, then in the two Saheeh&#8217;s, on the authority of Jareer ibn Abdillaah, who said:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">&#8220;We were sitting with the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) when he looked towards the moon on a full-moon night and said afterwards: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;Surely you will see your Lord just as you see this moon, you will not be obstructed in seeing Him. So if you are able to not be occupied and overcome by things which will distract you from the prayer before the sun rises and before it sets then do so!&#8217;</span> Meaning the Asr prayer and the Fajr. Then Jareer recited (the verse) <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And praise your Lord before the sun rise and before the sunset&#8221;</span> (20:130)</p>



<p>In this hadeeth is an indication to the connection between the prayer and seeing (Allaah).</p>



<p>Ibn Rajab (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">&#8220;It is said as it relates to the command with preserving these two prayers coming immediately after mention of the seeing (of Allaah) that the greatest (loftiest) thing in paradise is seeing Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and the most noble of actions in the life of this world are these two prayers. Therefore in guarding them it is hoped that the person will enter Paradise and will see Allaah there.&#8221;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And there is no doubt that the companions when they heard the statement of the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) : <span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;Surely you will see your Lord just as you see this moon, you will not be obstructed in seeing Him&#8217;</span>, a great yearning filled their souls and a wondering about the actions which will be the cause of obtaining this greatly sought pursuit. And from the excellence of the Prophet&#8217;s advice and completeness of his clarification, he answered it without being asked.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In this is an indication from him (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) that, seeing Allaah on the Day of Judgment will not be obtained by merely wishing. As Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;This is not a matter of your merely wishing or the wishing of the People of the Book&#8221;</span> (4:123) Rather it is a must to perform actions, be upright, strive hard and have full commitment to Allaah. For this reason the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) explained the means which will allow the servant to obtain seeing Allaah. Therefore he directed to two great prayers, namely Fajr and Asr. Many texts have been narrated in relation to the matter of these two (prayers) which point to their virtues. They are mentioned specifically for what is contained in them of great virtues and from the weightiness (of them) upon many people.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Therefore whoever elevates his concern and Allaah assists him and gives him success in preserving these two prayers then he must be much more preserving of the other prayers (as well) rather the Fajr prayer specifically, (as it ) is the commencement of the day. Whoever Allaah honors with getting up to perform this prayer and giving importance to it will be aided for the remaining prayers of that day. For how the servant acts in relation to the Fajr prayer applies (to his actions) for the rest of the day.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">As some of the Salaf would say: <strong>&#8220;Your day is like your camel; if you take hold of the beginning of it then the later part of it will follow you&#8221; </strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And the Prophet&#8217;s statement:<strong> &#8220;Do not become occupied…&#8221;</strong> Is an indication that in this life are many affairs that will distract and divert man from guarding these two prayers. And how much more are the things that divert in these days of ours! There are people whom drinking tea overcomes and diverts from these prayers which is the beauty of this worldly life. Some are distracted by petty conversation, immoral night chat, useless entertainment and evil viewings. And also from people are those whom sleep overcomes, and so on.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In this Hadeeth also is evidence that the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>correct sound belief</strong> </span>affects the actions of the slave and his ways. So the more his faith increases and his certainty strengthens, the more he increases in uprightness, diligence, (righteous) work, and observing the obedience of Allaah.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And because of this connection between the prayer and seeing Allaah our Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) used to supplicate at the end of his prayer before tasleem for this great delight and wealthy reward. Narrated by an-Nasai in his sunan on the authority of Ataa ibn as-Saaib from his father who said: &#8220;Ammaar bin Yaasir led us in prayer and he shorted it. So some of the people said to him:&#8217;you have made the prayer light or shorted it! He said: &#8216;As for that, I was supplicating with some supplications I heard from the Messenger of Allaah. So he when he stood a man from the people followed him, he was Ubay though he didn&#8217;t reveal his name and asked him about the supplication then the man came (back) and informed the people of it. (The supplication was)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O Allaah, by Your Knowledge of the unseen and by Your Power over the creation , let me live if You know that life is good for me , and let me die if You know that death is good for me . O Allaah , I ask You to grant me fear of You in private and in the open . I ask you for the word of truth in times of contentment and anger. I ask You for moderation in wealth and in poverty. I ask you for blessings never ceasing and the coolness of my eye (i.e. pleasure) that never ends. I ask You for pleasure after Your Judgment and I ask You for a life of coolness after death. I ask You for the delight of looking at Your Face and the earning of meeting You without any harmful distress and misleading trials befalling me. O Allah, dress us with the beauty of Faith, and make us guides who are upon (correct) guidance. </span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">May Allaah favor us all with guarding the prayer. We ask Allaah for the delight of looking at His Face and the yearning to meet Him without any harmful distress or misleading trial.</p>



<p>We ask Allaah to make this a benefit for us and for you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">The Book of Knowledge Of the Imaam, the Haafidh: Abu Khaithama Zuhair Ibn Harb An-Nasaa’ee</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Checking and Notes by:Imaam Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Translation by:isma’eel alarcon &#8211; al-ibaanah.com</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>INTRODUCTION TO THE BOOK</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah and may His peace and blessings be on the Final Messenger, his family and those who follow him in goodness until the Day of Judgement. To Proceed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are pleased to present this, our seventh E-Book, entitled: “<strong>The Book of Knowledge</strong>” &#8211; a complete translation of the classical work “<strong>Kitaab-ul-‘Ilm</strong>” of Imaam Abu Khaithama An-Nasaa’ee (rahimahullaah). This treatise is comprised of a collection of ahaadeeth (sayings of the Prophet) and athaar (sayings of the Salaf) on the subject of Islaamic Knowledge. By reading the various narrations, it is hoped that the reader will benefit and reflect on the merits and virtues of seeking, acquiring and teaching knowledge. The treatise also provides a first-hand look on how the Salaf’s attitude was with respect to knowledge – how they sought it, how they learned it and how they taught it to others. There are several narrations, also, that give us a description of the characteristics of some of the Salaf, their knowledge and their virtues.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, this treatise is of the utmost importance, as it provides the reader with an account of the Salaf &#8211; those whom we are obligated to follow and take their example. And it deals with one of the most important topics in Islaam, which is Knowledge, since knowledge is the foundation that is required before doing all sayings and actions. Al-Haafidh Ibn &#8216;Abd-il-Barr said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;The scholars have unanimously agreed that there is from knowledge that which is a specified obligation upon every individual with respect to himself (fard ‘ayn) and that which is a collective obligation (fard kifaayah) – if someone rises to fulfill it, its obligation becomes withdrawn from the remaining people of that area.&#8221;</strong></span> [3]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Qudaamah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;As for knowledge of the Religion, all of it is praiseworthy. It is divided into <em>usool</em> (fundamental issues), <em>furoo</em>&#8216; (subsidiary issues), <em>muqaddimaat</em> (introductory knowledge) and <em>mutammimaat</em> (complementary knowledge). The usool consist of the Book of Allaah, the Sunnah of the Prophet, the consensus of the Muslim scholars and the narrations of the Sahaabah. The furoo’ consist of what is understood from these fundamental sources from the meanings that are perceived by the intellect, such that what is understood from it is something other than the written wording.”</strong></span> [4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The treatise has been verified by the great scholar of our time, Imaam Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen AlAlbaanee. He has provided gradings for many of the narrations as well as notes and commentaries that give an explanation for some of these narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah that He make this present E-Book a source of benefit for its readers and a source of guidance for those who act upon what is in it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy<br />
And my success is due to none but Allaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh, the Imaam, the &#8216;Aalim (scholar), the Zaahid (ascetic) &#8216;Izz-ud-Deen Abul-Hasan &#8216;Alee Ibn Muhammad Ibn &#8216;Abd-il-Kareem Al-Juzree – may Allaah support him – informed us in the month of Ramadaan of the year 614H in the city of Mausil (In northern &#8216;Iraq) from the home of his brother, saying: The Shaikh, the Imaam, the &#8216;Aalim Majd-ud-Deen Abul-Faraj Yahyaa Ibn Mahmood Ibn Sa&#8217;ad Al-Asfahaanee informed us, saying: The Shaikh, the Imaam Abul-Fath Isma&#8217;eel Ibn Al-Fadl Ibn Ahmad Ibn Al-Akh-sheed As-Sarraaj informed us in the year 518H and in the year 522H, saying: Shaikh Abu Taahir Muhammad Ibn Ahmad Ibn &#8216;Abd-ir-Raheem informed us, saying: Abu Hafs &#8216;Umar Ibn Ibraaheem Al-Kitaanee Al-Muqree informed us, saying: Abul-Qaasim &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Muhammad &#8216;Abdul-&#8216; Azeez Al-Baghawee informed us that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Abu Khaithama Zuhair Ibn Harb narrated to us, saying: Wakee&#8217; reported to us, saying: Al-A&#8217;amash reported to us from Tameem Ibn Salamah from Abu &#8216;Ubaidah that he said: ‘Abdullaah [Ibn Mas’ood] (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Aspire to become a scholar or a student of knowledge, and do not aspire to become anything other than that.”</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Ishaaq Ibn Sulaimaan Ar-Raazee stated: I heard Handhala report from ‘Awn Ibn ‘Abdillaah that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I said to ‘Umar Bin ‘Abd-il-‘Azeez: ‘It was said (to me): If you are able to be a scholar, then be a scholar. And if you are not able to do so, then be a student of knowledge. And if you are not able to be a student of knowledge, then love them. And if you can’t love them, then do not hate them.’ </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So ‘Umar said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">‘SubhaanAllaah! (Glory be to Allaah!) Allaah has indeed made a way out for this person.’”</span></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Whosoever Allaah intends to do good for, He gives him understanding of the Religion.”</strong></span> [5]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Mu&#8217;awiyah Ibn &#8216;Amr reported to us, saying that Zaa&#8217;idah reported from Al-A&#8217;amash from Tameem Ibn Salamah from Abu &#8216;Ubaidah on the authority of ‘Abdullaah [Ibn Mas&#8217;ood] that he (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“O people, learn! Then whoever learns, must act (upon what he knows).”</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Sufyaan Ibn &#8216;Uyainah reported to us on the authority of &#8216;Aasim Ibn Abee An-Najood on Zur Ibn Hubaish that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“I went to Safwaan Ibn ‘Assaal Al-Muraadee, so he said: ‘What did you come for?’ I said: ‘In search of knowledge.’ So he said: ‘Verily, the angels lower their wings for the seeker of knowledge, out of contentment for what he seeks.’”</span></strong> [6]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. Abu Khaithama reported to us, saying: Muhammad Ibn Khaazim reported to us, saying: Al-A&#8217;amash reported to us from Shimr from Sa&#8217;eed Ibn Jubair on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbaas (radyAllaahu ‘anhu), that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Indeed, every creature, even the fish in the sea, asks forgiveness for the one who educates people about the good (i.e. Islaam).” [7]</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: &#8216;Abd-ur-Rahmaan Ibn Mahdee reported to us, saying Bishr Ibn Mansoor reported to us from Thawr from ‘Abd-ul-‘Azeez Ibn Adh-Dhibyaan that he said: &#8216;Eesaa Ibn Maryam said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Whosoever learns, then knows, then acts, then this is considered something grand in the kingdom of the heavens.”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying Muhammad Ibn Khaazim reported to us, saying: Al-A&#8217;amash reported to us from Shaqeeq from ‘Abdullaah [Ibn Mas&#8217;ood] (radyAllaahu ‘anhu), that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Learn, for indeed none of you knows when he will be needed by the people.”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Mu&#8217;aadh Ibn Mu&#8217;aadh reported to us, saying: Ibn &#8216;Awn reported to us from Al-Ahnaf that he said: ‘Umar [Ibn Al-Khattaab] (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Acquire understanding (of the Religion) before you are given positions of authority (for then it will be too late).”</strong> </span>[8]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Muhammad Ibn Khaazim reported to us, saying: Al- A&#8217;amash reported to us from Shaqeeq from ‘Abdullaah [Ibn Mas&#8217;ood] (radyAllaahu ‘anhu), that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“By Allaah, any individual that issues a ruling (fatwa) to the people for every matter they ask him of, is truly insane.” </span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Al-A&#8217;amash (one of the narrators) said: “Al-Hakam said to me:</p>
<p>‘Had I heard this hadeeth from you yesterday, I would not have issued fataawaa (on that day) for much of the instances in which I did issue fataawaa.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Muhammad Ibn Khaazim reported to us, saying: Al- A&#8217;amash reported to us from Rajaa Al-Ansaaree from &#8216;Abd-ur-Rahmaan Ibn Bishr Al-Azraq that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Two men entered from the gates of Kinda while Abu Mas&#8217;ood Al-Ansaaree was sitting in a gathering. One of the two men said: &#8216;Is there any man here that can judge between us?&#8217; A man from the gathering said: &#8216;I can.&#8217; So Abu Mas&#8217;ood grabbed a handful of pebbles and struck him with it.

He did not leave behind him anyone equal to him. And what is remarkable is that he preferred Ibn Jubair over himself. I will inform you about that. Indeed he was born to a family with much knowledge in their household, so he took hold of that understanding. Then he sat with us and memorized the best of our hadeeth (and combined that) with the understanding of the members of his household. So who can equal himself to him?'&#8221;</span></strong></p>

He gave me away as a present to a man from Hudhail in Egypt. So he benefited me by doing so. I did not leave from Egypt until I thought that there was no knowledge within it except that I had heard it. Then I went to Al-Madeenah. And I did not leave from there until I thought that there was no knowledge within it, except that I had heard it. Then I met Ash-Sha&#8217;bee and I did not see the likes of him (before).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“I (once) accompanied Salmaan (on a journey) because I wanted to examine him, learn from him and serve him. So I began to not do any action except that it was the same as his. Then we stopped at Dijlah (Tigris River) and it extended wide and was overflowing with water, so we said: ‘Let us give drink to our riding animals.’ We gave them to drink and then I had a desire to drink myself, so I drank (from the river). When I lifted my head, he (Salmaan) said: ‘O brother of the tribe of ‘Abas! Go back and drink again.’ So I sat down and drank again even though I did not want to do so, yet I hated to disobey him. Then he said to me: ‘How much do you estimate to have deducted from it (the river)?’ So I said: ‘May Allaah have mercy on you! Is it possible that my drinking can deduct anything from it? He (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) then said: “Likewise with knowledge. You take it, yet you do not deduct anything from it. So stick to those aspects of knowledge that benefits you (most).’”</span></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;I accompanied the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger and they were like the pool of water, which quenches the thirst of the traveler, and like the pool of water that quenches the thirst of two travelers, and the pool of water that quenches the thirst of ten people and the pool of water which if all the inhabitants of the world were to settle by it (to drink from it) it would produce enough (water) for all of them. And verily &#8216;Abdullaah [Ibn Mas’ood] (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) was from among this pool of water.&#8221; [27]</span></strong></p>

Verily, there is a reporter calling at the gates of Kindah who believes that the sign of the Smoke will come and grasp the breaths of the disbelievers (i.e. kill them), while it will give the believers something like a cold.&#8217; So &#8216;Abdullaah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) said while sitting up and in a state of anger:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8216;O people, fear Allaah! Whoever amongst you knows something then let him speak concerning what he has knowledge of. And whoever does not know then let him say, Allaah knows best. For indeed it is the best form of knowledge for one of you to say, concerning things he has no knowledge of: Allaah knows best. Verily Allaah has said to His Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam): &#8216;Say: I do not ask you for any reward for this (Qur&#8217;aan), nor am I from the pretenders.&#8217; [Surat-un-Nisaa: 86]&#8221;</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Who will buy knowledge from me for a dirham?” Abu Khaithama said: “He means by this: &#8220;Buy a piece of paper so that knowledge can be written down on it.”</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">150. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Wakee&#8217; reported to us from Ibn &#8216;Awn on the authority of Muhammad (Ibn Sireen) that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“I asked ‘Ubaidah: ‘Shall I write all that I hear?’ He said: ‘No.’ I said: ‘If I find writings (notes), shall I read it?’ He said: ‘No.’”</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">151. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Wakee&#8217; reported to us from Shareek that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;I heard a shaikh (and then I described him, so they said that he was Abu Damurah) [68] say: &#8216;I saw Hamaad writing in the presence of Ibraaheem who was wearing a garment from Anbijaan and saying: &#8216;By Allaah, we do not desire the worldly life by this (garment).'&#8221;</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">152. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Wakee&#8217; reported to us, saying: Al-Hakam Ibn ‘Atiyyah reported to us, saying: (Muhammad) Ibn Sireen said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“They used to hold the opinion that the Children of Israa’eel were only misguided because of the writings that were passed down to them.”</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">153. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Wakee&#8217; reported to us from Talha Ibn Yahyaa on the authority of Abu Burdah that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;I wrote a book on the authority of my father from what he disclosed to me (i.e. he compiled a book from hadeeth reported to him by his father). So he called for a wash basin, placed my books in it and washed them (i.e. erased what was in them).&#8221;</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">154. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Wakee&#8217; reported to us from &#8216;Imraan Ibn Hudair69 from Abu Mujliz on the authority of Basheer Ibn Naheek that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;I recorded a collection (of hadeeth) from Abu Hurairah. Then when I desired to part from him, I said &#8216;O Abu Hurairah! I recorded a book (of hadeeth) from you, so shall I narrate them on your authority.&#8217; He said: &#8216;Yes, narrate on my authority.'&#8221;</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">155. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Jareer reported to us from Mugheerah from Ibraaheem that he said: ‘Abdullaah (Ibn Mas&#8217;ood) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Indeed, you will never cease to be upon good so long as the knowledge remains with the elders. For when the knowledge is with the youth, the one who is older in age while reject learning from the youth out of pride.”</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">156. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Al-Fadl Ibn Dukeen reported to us, saying: Al-A&#8217;amash reported to us from Ibraaheem on the authority of ‘Alqamah that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Whatever I heard as a youth, it is as if I am looking at it written on a piece or a sheet of paper (right now).”</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">157. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: &#8216;Abd-ur-Rahmaan Ibn Mahdee reported to us from &#8216;Abdul-&#8216; Azeez Ibn Abee Rawwaad on the authority of &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn &#8216;Ubaid70 that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Knowledge is the goal of the believer. Every time he attains some aspect from it, he embraces and takes hold of it, and (then) seeks after another goal.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">158. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Jareer reported to us from Mansoor from Ibraaheem (An- Nakha’ee) that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;They (the Salaf) used to hate that people would walk behind them.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">159. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Jareer reported to us from Mansoor from Ibraaheem (An- Nakha&#8217;ee) that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“They (the Sahaabah) would gather together and remind one another of knowledge and goodness. Then they would depart and separate from one another. And they would not ask forgiveness for one another (upon departing) nor would they say: ‘O such and such person, make du’aa (supplication) for me.’” [71]</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">160. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: &#8216;Abd-ur-Rahmaan reported to us from Sufyaan from Mansoor from Ibraaheem (An-Nakha&#8217;ee) that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“They (the Sahaabah) would hate the recording (of hadeeth) [as opposed to memorizing].”</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">161. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Jareer reported to us from Mansoor on the authority of Ibraaheem that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“There is no harm in recording the first portions of the hadeeth (atraaf).”</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">162. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Al-Hasan Ibn Moosaa reported to us, saying: Ibn Lahee&#8217;ah reported to us, saying: Darraaj reported to us from Ibn Hajeerah on the authority of Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) that he said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;The example of one who has acquired knowledge and does not speak about it, is like the example of a man whom Allaah has given wealth, yet he does not spend from it.&#8221; [72]</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">163. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Jareer reported to us from Mugheerah from Ibraaheem on the authority of &#8216;Alqamah, that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Search for the mentioning of the hadeeth before it disappears.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">*This completes the ahaadeeth of Abu Khaithama, all praise be to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">164. Abu Hafs Ibraaheem Al-Kitaanee Al-Muqree [73] narrated to you, saying: &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Muhammad Ibn &#8216;Abd-il-&#8216;Azeez Al-Baghawee reported to us, saying: Muhammad Khalf Ibn Hushaim Al-Bazaar reported to us from Mansoor Ibn Abee Mazaahim and Muhammad Ibn Sulaimaan Al-Asadee that they said: Maalik Ibn Anas reported to us from Az-Zuhree on the authority of Anas (radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa) that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) entered Makkah while wearing a helmet on his head. When he took it off, it was said to him: ‘It is Ibn Khatal74 and he is hanging from one of the curtains of the Ka’bah.’ So he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: ‘Kill him.’” [75]</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">165. &#8216;Abdullaah [Al-Baghawee] narrated to us, saying: Abu Nasr At-Tamaar76 reported to us, saying: Hamaad Ibn Salamah reported to us from Qataadah on the authority of Anas (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;The Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) used to say: &#8216;O Allaah, indeed I seek refuge in you from a knowledge that does not benefit, a deed that is not risen (to You; i.e. not accepted), a heart that does not fear and a statement (supplication) that is not heard.'&#8221;</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">166. &#8216;Abdullaah [Al-Baghawee] narrated to us, saying: &#8216;Abd-ul-A&#8217;alaa Ibn Hamaad An-Nursee reported to us, saying: Hamaad Ibn Salamah reported to us from Abu &#8216;Aasim Ibn Bahdala from Abu Saalih on the authority of ‘Aa’ishah (radyAllaahu ‘anhaa) that she said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) used to go out to observe the Fajr prayer, while his head (i.e. hair) would still be dripping from (having bathed due to) sexual intercourse, and not a wet dream. Then he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) would observe the fast” [77]</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">167. &#8216;Abdullaah [Al-Baghawee] narrated to us, saying: Suraij Ibn Yoonus reported to us, saying: Hushaim reported to us, saying: Humayd reported to us from Anas [Ibn Maalik] (radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa) that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;When the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) observed the funeral prayer (janaazah), he would say the takbeer (Allaahu Akbar) four times.&#8221;</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">**This completes the ahaadeeth, all praise be to Allaah. And may the peace and blessings be upon His Prophet Muhammad (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and his entire family.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Footnotes</span></strong>:</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 This report is authentically attributed to the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam). Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim transmitted it from Mu&#8217;awiyah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 This hadeeth is found in Sunan At-Tirmidhee and other collections, and he (At-Tirmidhee) authenticated it. Some of the reporters stop it as being the saying of a companion only, while others raise it to a saying of the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam). It takes the ruling of marfoo&#8217; (raised to a saying of the Prophet) without a doubt. This is because such a statement is not being said according to ones opinion and view, as has been stated by Ibn &#8216;Abd-il-Barr in Jaami&#8217; Bayaan-ul-&#8216;Ilmi wa Fadlihi (1/32-33).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7 This report is authentically attributed to the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam). At-Tabaraanee transmitted it in Al-Awsat from the hadeeth of Jaabir (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) and At-Tirmidhee from the hadeeth of Abu Umaamah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) and he said it was saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8 Translator’s Note: This advice is to acquire knowledge before taking a position of leadership, for when someone is in that position, it becomes difficult to seek knowledge due to the time and effort that is required for that position. And also, when one is in a position of leadership, no doubt, he will need to have knowledge in order to make the right decisions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9 The chain of this narration is jayyid (good). It is also established in marfoo&#8217; form. Ahmad and At-Tabaraanee reported it from two paths on the authority of Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu). The author (Abu Khaithama) has transmitted one of these two, as shall come later under number 162. Ibn &#8216;Abd-il-Barr also reported it from the hadeeth of Ibn &#8216;Umar (radyAllaahu ‘anhu).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10 This statement is established in marfoo&#8217; form as a saying of the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam). At- Tabaraanee reported it on the authority of Ibn &#8216;Umar and Hudhaifah (radyAllaahu ‘anhum). Al-Mundhiree declared its chain to be hasan. Al-Haakim reported it from Sa&#8217;ad Ibn Abee Waqqaas (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) and he as well as Adh-Dhahabee authenticated it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11 Its chain of narration is jayyid (good) in mawqoof form (i.e. saying of a Companion). It is also authentically attributed to the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu). Muslim and others have transmitted it and it will occur later in this book under number 25.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12 Ad-Dareer is the nickname of Muhammad Ibn Khaazim, Abu Mu&#8217;awiyah. Muslim has transmitted this hadeeth from this path of narrators (18/71-72) in marfoo&#8217; form. Then he reported it from different paths on the authority of Al-A&#8217;amash.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13 Its chain of narration is munqata&#8217; (broken), for Yahyaa Ibn Ja&#8217;ada never met &#8216;Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab. In fact it is even held that he never met Ibn Mas&#8217;ood, and he died ten years after that of &#8216;Umar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You must know that there was an old dispute amongst the Salaf with regard to recording the prophetic hadeeth. Among them were those who forbade it and among them were those who allowed it. There will follow in this book, many narrations regarding both of these sides. Then the matter settled in favor of the permissibility of writing down the hadeeth – rather in favor of its obligation. And this was based on the Prophet&#8217;s command mentioned in more than one hadeeth, such as his saying: &#8220;Write for Abu Shaah.” Al-Bukhaaree reported this hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the matters that are well known is that it is the hadeeth that contains the explanation for the general aspects of the Qur&#8217;aan as well as the detailed aspects of its rulings. And if it were not for the hadeeth, we would have no way of knowing how to perform the prayer, observe the fast, as well as fulfill the other pillars and acts of worship, upon the way that Allaah intended for us. And whatever is essential for an obligatory matter to be fulfilled, becomes itself obligatory. Indeed a people from this era have gone astray for they believe that the Qur&#8217;aan is sufficient for them over the hadeeth. This is in spite of Allaah&#8217;s saying: &#8220;And we revealed to you the Reminder so that it could explain to the people what was already revealed to them (from before).&#8221; [Suratun- Nahl: 44] Thus, Allaah informs us that there is something that is explained, which is the Qur&#8217;aan, and something that is explaining, which is the Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and his hadeeth. Furthermore, his (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) saying in the authentic and famous hadeeth: &#8220;Indeed I was given the Qur&#8217;aan and something equal to it&#8221; confirms this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14 This refers to the letters that the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) used to write to some individuals and to certain tribes. Refer to Zaad al-Ma&#8217;aad (1/30). This narration on Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) has an authentic chain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15 He is &#8216;Uqbah Ibn &#8216;Aamir and he traveled to see Maslama Ibn Mukhallid, who was in charge of Egypt (at that time) as occurs in the Musnad (4/104).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16 Its chain of narration is saheeh (authentic). Muslim has transmitted it in his Saheeh (2/95).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">17 Surat-un-Nisaa: 37</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">18 He is Ibn Abee Saleem and he is da&#8217;eef (weak).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19 Meaning: One sentence, regardless of whether it comes from the Book or the Sunnah. The following is stated in An-Nihaayah: “What is meant by the word ayah in the Qur&#8217;aan is a collection of letters and words. This is derived from the people’s saying: ‘The people left with their ayaat’, meaning they went out with all their possessions not leaving anything behind. The word ayah in any other context means a sign.” Some said in explaining this hadeeth: &#8220;It means a sign, either a gesture or a conveyance.&#8221; This means that if the thing that is being conveyed occurs in the form of an action or a gesture, with the hand or the finger, then indeed it is to convey it in the same way in order to preserve the Sharee&#8217;ah. The hadeeth has a saheeh chain of narration. Al-Bukhaaree reported it through another path on the authority of Al-Awzaa&#8217;ee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">20 Its chain of narration is saheeh from Masrooq. And he is Ibn Al-Ajda&#8217;, a Taabi&#8217;ee (Second generation of Muslims), a Faqeeh (scholar capable of issuing rulings), an &#8216;Aabid (devout worshipper). He died in the year 62H. And he has been mentioned previously in another chain that connects to him under number 15.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">21 He is Ibn Mas&#8217;ood (radyAllaahu ‘anhu). And the chain of narration to him is saheeh upon the standards of the two Shaikhs (Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim). Al-Haakim transmitted it (3/537) from another path on Al-A&#8217;amash without the saying: &#8220;The best interpreter…&#8221; and he (rahimahullaah) authenticated it based on both of their standards. Adh-Dhahabee agreed with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">22 Its chain of narration is munqata&#8217; (broken) because Saalim Ibn Abee Al-Ja&#8217;ad never met Abu Ad-Dardaa (radyAllaahu ‘anhu). It has also been reported on his authority through another path of narrators in marfoo&#8217; form. However, its chain is da&#8217;eef (weak), also.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">23 It is a saheeh hadeeth. Its narrators are all reliable for they are narrators of the standards of the two Shaikhs (Al- Bukhaaree and Muslim). Ahmad and Ibn Maajah have reported this from Wakee&#8217; connected to him (Ibn Umm Lubaid), while Al-Haakim and Ahmad have reported it from the path of narration of &#8216;Amr Ibn Murrah: &#8220;I heard Saalim Ibn Abee Al-Ja&#8217;ad say&#8221; on his (Ibn Umm Lubaid) authority. Al-Haakim authenticated it and mentioned that there were two other paths of narration to them, the first of which is on the authority of &#8216;Awf Ibn Maalik (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) and has been reported by Al-Khateeb Al-Baghdaadee in his book Al-Iqtidaa (no. 90). The other has been reported on the authority of Abu Ad-Dardaa (radyAllaahu ‘anhu). Adh-Dhahabee declared the chains of both of these to be saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">24 The chain of this narration is saheeh. Ibraaheem here refers to Ibn Yazeed An-Nakha&#8217;ee. Although he never met &#8216;Abdullaah, who is Ibn Mas&#8217;ood (radyAllaahu ‘anhu), it is still authentically reported on him that he said: &#8220;If I narrate a hadeeth to you on the authority of a man on the authority of &#8216;Abdullaah, then that means that I heard it (from that person). And if I say, &#8216;Abdullaah said…&#8217; (without mentioning the narrator), then it is from someone reporting on the authority of &#8216;Abdullaah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">25 He is Abu Zur&#8217;ah Ibn &#8216;Amr Ibn Jareer Ibn &#8216;Abdillaah Al-Bajlee Al-Koofee. There is a difference of opinion concerning his name. He was a Taabi&#8217;ee (Second generation of Muslims), reliable and the compilers of the six collections rely on his narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">26 Its chain of narration in mawqoof form (stopped at level of being the saying of a companion and not of the Prophet) upon &#8216;Ubaid Ibn &#8216;Umair is saheeh. Al-Bazaar and At-Tabaraanee have also reported it from the hadeeth of Ibn Mas&#8217;ood in marfoo&#8217; form (raised to a saying of the Prophet), with a chain of narration in which there is no defect, according to Al-Mundhiree.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: Later, it became apparent to me that there is, in fact, a defect in it. Adh-Dhahabee has testified to it, as I have explained in Al-Ahaadeeth Ad-Da&#8217;eefah (no. 5032).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">27 The chain of narration is authentic. &#8216;Abdullaah here refers to Ibn Mas&#8217;ood (radyAllaahu ‘anhu).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">28 Its chain of narration is saheeh (authentic), as well as the one that comes after it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">29 Its chain is saheeh and Mas&#8217;ood Ibn Maalik is Abu Razeen Al-Asadee, a Taabi&#8217;ee who was reliable and<br />
trustworthy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">30 He is Ibn Abee Saleem and he is da&#8217;eef (weak) as has been stated previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">31 He is Al-Hasan Al-Basree, the righteous Taabi&#8217;ee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">32 Translator’s Note: A Mujtahid is a scholar that has reached high levels of knowledge such that he is able to form opinions and issue fataawaa (rulings), without basing it on the scholars before him. They can determine rulings for issues that have no clear mention in the Qur’aan and the Sunnah, and Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">33 Its chain of narration is saheeh according to the standards of Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">34 Its chain is saheeh, just like the one before it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">35 Its chain of narration is saheeh according to the standards of the two Shaikhs (Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim). They have both transmitted it on the authority of (Imaam) Maalik and it is found in Al-Muwatta (2/56/34) within a hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">36 This refers to the non-Arabs. The chain of narration is according to the standards of Muslim. However, it is in mawqoof form. It has been reported in marfoo’ form from three different paths on the authority of Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) without mentioning the Tribe of Farrookh and with the wording: “&#8230;a group of people from Persia would surely grasp it.” These reports have been transmitted by Abu Nu’aim in Akhbaar Asbahaan (1/5) but they all have defects in them. One of them is found in (the Saheeh of) Ibn Hibbaan (no. 2309). And what is authentic is what occurs with the wording: “If Eemaan (Faith) were clinging from the sky, there would be some people from Persia who would surely grasp it.” Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim have reported this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">37 His name is Dhakwaan As-Samaan Az-Ziyaat Al-Madanee. He was the guardian of Juwairiyah Bint Al-Ahmas Al-Ghatfaanee. And he was the father of Suhayl, the one mentioned in the previous chain of narrators. Abu Saalih died in the year 101H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">38 The hadeeth here is mawqoof and in its chain is Laith Ibn Abee Saleem who is da&#8217;eef (weak). Others have reported it from &#8216;Adiyy Ibn &#8216;Adiyy in marfoo&#8217; form. Ibn &#8216;Asaakir (10/28/2) reported it as well as Al-Khateeb Al- Baghdaadee in Iqtidaa-ul-&#8216;Ilm (no. 2). It has a supporting evidence (in a hadeeth reported) on the authority of Abu Burzah in marfoo&#8217; form. At-Tirmidhee reported this one and authenticated it. Ad-Daarimee also reported it as well as Abu Ya&#8217;laa in his Musnad (2/353) with an authentic chain of narration. Also, Al-Khateeb reported this in his book Iqtidaa-ul-&#8216;Ilm under (no. 1).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">39 The original source of this hadeeth is in mawqoof form and not marfoo&#8217;. Some people have mentioned it on the authority of Ka&#8217;ab Al-Ahbaar (radyAllaahu ‘anhu), saying that it is found in the Torah. And some liars and weak reporters have raised it to the level of being a saying of Abu Ad-Dardaa and Jaabir (radyAllaahu ‘anhum). See Al- Laalee Al-Masnoo&#8217;ah of As-Suyootee and Silsilat-ul-Ahaadeeth Ad-Da&#8217;eefah (no. 2750).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">40 Know that there is not found in this description of the Muhaajireen, and likewise this description of the Ansaar, any reviling or derogation of them, as many of the contemporary writers that slander Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) without due right claim. This goes as well for those who interpret his sayings in a way contrary to what he intended. Indeed, doing an action in addition to seeking the halaal is from the Way of Allaah, as has been reported authentically in some ahaadeeth. And Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) was aware of this, for he was one of the reporters. Thus, he made excuses for them in regard to that matter for (their lack) of memorizing hadeeth the way he was able to memorize. Al-Haakim (3/511-512) reported from Talha Ibn &#8216;Ubaidillaah, one of the ten who were given the glad tidings of Paradise, and one of the Muhaajireen and first Muslims, that he (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) said concerning the Muhaajireen and Abu Hurairah something similar to this hadeeth: &#8220;By Allaah, I have no doubt that Abu Hurairah heard from the Messenger of Allaah, that which we did not hear and he learned that which we did not learn. Verily, we were rich people, in possession of houses and large families. We used to go and stay with the Prophet until the end of the day, then we used to go back. And Abu Hurairah was a poor person. He had no money nor family nor children. His hand was only where the Prophet&#8217;s hand was. And he used to stay over wherever he resided. And we have no doubt that he learned what we didn&#8217;t learn and that he heard what we didn&#8217;t hear. And no one among us accuses him.&#8221; Al- Haakim authenticated it and Al-Haafidh mentioned a supporting evidence for it in Fath-ul-Baaree (1/191).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the hadeeth has an authentic chain of narration, according to the standards of the two Shaikhs. Muslim transmitted it through the same path of narrators as the author (Abu Khaithama) and he and Al-Bukhaaree have both transmitted it through other paths on the authority of Sufyaan. And with this chain, Ahmad (2/240) also reported it. Furthermore, he (2/274), Al-Bukhaaree and others reported it through other paths of narration on the authority of Az-Zuhree. Muslim reported it from Az-Zuhree on the authority of Sa&#8217;eed Ibn Al-Musayyib and Abu Salamah Ibn &#8216;Abd-ir-Rahmaan that Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) said: &#8220;Indeed, you…&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">41 He is Ibn &#8216;Abdillaah Al-Qaadee. There is speculation concerning his memory, however Zuhair Ibn Mu&#8217;awiyah followed him and he is reliable. Due to this, At-Tirmidhee authenticated the hadeeth. It is reported in Al- Ahaadeeth As-Saheehah under no. 330.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">42 This is an authentic hadeeth. Its chain is in mursal form (meaning stopped at the level of being a saying of a Taabi&#8217;ee). However Al-Haakim (4/279-280) has reported it from the path of: &#8220;Umayyah Ibn Khallid from Sulaimaan Ibn Al-Mugheerah on the authority of Thaabit on &#8216;Amr Ibn Shu&#8217;ayb on his father on the authority of &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn &#8216;Amr who reported it on the Messenger of Allaah. And he (Al-Haakim) authenticated it based on the standards of Muslim, and Adh-Dhahabee agreed. It is only this hadeeth that is saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">43 Translator’s Note: This means that if you can convey the meaning of a hadeeth, as opposed to quoting it, then there is no harm, in that, and Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">44 Surat-ul-Baqarah: 159</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">45 I say: Its chain of narration is saheeh according to the standards of the two Shaikhs. Al-Bukhaaree (1/42) has transmitted it from the path of Al-A&#8217;araj on Abu Hurairah t.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">43 Translator’s Note: This means that if you can convey the meaning of a hadeeth, as opposed to quoting it, then there is no harm, in that, and Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">44 Surat-ul-Baqarah: 159</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">45 I say: Its chain of narration is saheeh according to the standards of the two Shaikhs. Al-Bukhaaree (1/42) has transmitted it from the path of Al-A&#8217;araj on Abu Hurairah t.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">46 This narration in mawqoof form (saying of a companion only) has an authentic chain. Its narrators are all narrators of the category of the two Saheeh collections, except for &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Yazeed As-Sahbaanee. However, he is trustworthy and his biography occurs in Al-Jarh wat-Ta&#8217;deel.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">47 He is Ibn &#8216;Amr As-Salmaanee. He was a Taabi&#8217;ee, reliable and trustworthy. The one who reports from him, Abu Zaid Al-Muraadee, is Nu&#8217;maan Ibn Qais. Ibn Abee Haatim wrote a biography for him (4/1/446) and reported his reliability from the sayings of Ibn Ma&#8217;een and others. Sufyaan Ath-Thawree reported this narration on his authority also and added to the end of it that he (&#8216;Ubaidah) said: &#8220;Indeed I fear that a people will succeed after it (i.e. his books) and not give it its due place.&#8221; Ad-Daarimee (1/121) reported it as well as Al-Khateeb in Taqyeed-ul-&#8216;Ilm (pg. 61)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">48 I say: Its chain is munqata&#8217; (broken). This is because Ibn &#8216;Abdillaah, who is Abu &#8216;Ubaidah Ibn &#8216;Abdillaah Ibn Mas&#8217;ood did not hear from his father. Therefore, it is cut short to being a saying of Ibn ‘Abdillaah. And it is authentic on Ibn Mas&#8217;ood in marfoo&#8217; form (saying of the Prophet r). At-Tirmidhee reported it and authenticated it, as did Ibn Hibbaan in his Saheeh. And it has been mentioned from other Companions apart from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">49 Its chain is saheeh in mawqoof form. It is also reported from the path of Isma&#8217;eel Ibn Mujaalid on &#8216;Abd-ul-Malik Ibn &#8216;Umair in marfoo&#8217; form (saying of the Prophet r). And it has a supporting witness from the path of Mu&#8217;awiyah t. I have spoken about it in Al-Ahaadeeth As-Saheehah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">50 Its chain of narration is saheeh in mawqoof form. And it is authentic in marfoo&#8217; form from different paths on the authority of Abu Hurairah. Al-Bukhaaree, Muslim and others have transmitted it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">51 He is &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Al-Muthnaa Ibn &#8216;Abdillaah Ibn Anas. He was honest yet made many mistakes. This hadeeth has been reported in marfoo&#8217; form as a saying of the Prophet, and it is not authentic. Later, I encountered many paths of narration for the hadeeth reported in marfoo&#8217; form, such that it directs towards the fact that it is saheeh. I have clarified this in Al-Ahaadeeth As-Saheehah (no. 2026).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">52 Its chain is saheeh according to the standards of the two Shaikhs and they have both reported it. One of the paths of narration reported by Muslim is the same one used by the author (Abu Khaithama) here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">53 Its chain is saheeh according to the standards of the two Shaikhs and they have both transmitted it. Some of its paths of narration are found in Saheeh Muslim on the authority of the author (Abu Khaithama).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">54 He is Al-Haitham Ibn Habeeb, Abu Al-Haitham As-Sairafee. And he is reliable as are the rest of the narrators in this chain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">55 His name is &#8216;Amr Ibn &#8216;Abdillaah As-Subai&#8217;ee. He is reliable, but used to commit tadless and mix (confuse) his narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">56 His name is &#8216;Abdullaah and he is reliable, from the narrators of the category of the two Shaikhs (Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim). This goes the same for the rest of the narrators of the chain. However there is a break in the chain. Taawoos on the authority of &#8216;Umar is in mursal form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">57 This means that there is no one who is able to narrate a hadeeth without there occurring an addition or a subtraction to it. So it is upon one to exert himself and to not fall short with regard to memory and precision. Hence, &#8220;Allaah does not burden a soul with more than it can handle.&#8221; The chain of the narration is saheeh. And Gheelaan is Ibn Jareer Al-Ma&#8217;oolee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">58 This is a well-known city in Yemen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">59 Its chain is saheeh according to the standards of the two Shaikhs. Abu &#8216;Abd-ir-Rahmaan is &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Habeeb As-Sulamee. He was a Taabi&#8217;ee, reciter of the Qur&#8217;aan, reliable and trustworthy. The name of Abu Hiseen is &#8216;Uthmaan Ibn &#8216;Aasim Al-Asadee. He was also reliable and trustworthy. He died in the year 127H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">60 The chain of this narration is jayyid (good). And it shows the praiseworthy manners of Ibn &#8216;Abbaas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">61 He is Ibn Abee Sulaymaan Al-Koofee, the Faqeeh. The Ibraaheem that is mentioned here is Ibn Yazeed An- Nakha&#8217;ee. The name of Ibn &#8216;Awn is &#8216;Abdullaah, and he was a famous Faqeeh (Scholar of Fiqh). All of them are reliable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">62 This is how it was written originally contrary to the format that has been used beforehand and afterwards. The author repeats the same hadeeth again under no. 161, which will come later. And what is meant by the word atraaf, and Allaah knows best, is the first portions of hadeeth (i.e. the first words of a hadeeth), which they used to write out and by which they would remember the ahaadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">63 He is Al-Qarqisaanee, and he was honest yet committed many errors. In spite of this a group of people followed him (in narration) according to Ad-Daarimee (1/122), Al-Khateeb in Taqyeed-ul-&#8216;Ilm (pg. 42) and others. The chain of narration is saheeh when attributed to Abu Hurairah. And Abu Katheer is As-Suhaymee Al-Yamaanee Al-A&#8217;amaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">64 He is Ibn Abee Saleem and he is da&#8217;eef (weak) as has been stated several times previously. However, he is not alone in his narration of this hadeeth. Rather it has supporting evidences which Al-Haakim and Adh-Dhahabee have authenticated. We have discussed this hadeeth in detail in our commentary to it in Mishkaat-ul-Masaabeeh (no. 260). I will further add to it here, saying: Ad-Daarimee (1/96) reported this hadeeth from another path on the authority of Laith in mawqoof form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">65 In mawqoof form (saying of a companion only), this narration is da&#8217;eef. It is authentic in marfoo&#8217; form from the path of &#8216;Ataa on Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu). At-Tirmidhee, Ibn Hibbaan, Al-Haakim and Adh-Dhahabee have authenticated it. See (my book) Tah-dheer-ul-Masaajid (pg. 4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">66 His name is Al-Hasan Ibn &#8216;Uqbah Al-Muraadee. Ibn Ma&#8217;een declared him to be reliable and Abu Haatim said of him: &#8220;He was a shaikh, his hadeeth were written down.&#8221; The chain of narration linked to Ash-Sha&#8217;bee is saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">67 He (&#8216;Ilbaa) is Ibn Ahmar Al-Yushkaree Al-Basree and he was a Taabi&#8217;ee of trustworthy and reliable status. Likewise, the rest of the narrators of the chain are all reliable. So it is saheeh, if &#8216;Ilbaa heard it from &#8216;Alee, because there is no report mentioned from him on his authority.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">68 I do not know who this Abu Damurah is. As for Hamaad, then he is Ibn Abee Salmaan, the Faqeeh. And Ibraaheem here refers to Ibn Yazeed An-Nakha&#8217;ee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">69 He is reliable, as are the rest of the narrators of the chain. Thus it is saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">70 He is Abu Haashim Al-Makkee, a Taabi&#8217;ee that is reliable. The chain of narration linked to him is saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">71 Ibraaheem, and he is (ibn Yazeed) An-Nakha&#8217;ee, may Allaah have mercy on him, means by this that it was not from the actions of the Sahaabah to supplicate for one another after the end of a class or a study session. Therefore, this is an innovation. Another thing similar to it is when the teacher (shaikh) walks ahead of his students and they walk behind him. This is because this action is from that which leads to fitnah and amazement with oneself, as is indicated in the narration mentioned before this one. And both of them (i.e. this narration and the one before it) have authentic chains of narration on the authority of Ibraaheem.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">72 This is a hasan hadeeth. Even though Ibn Lahee&#8217;ah and Darraaj are both weak, it has another path on the authority of Abu Hurairah as well as a supporting evidence on the authority of Ibn &#8216;Umar in marfoo&#8217; form. And it is mentioned through another path on the authority of Salmaan in mawqoof form, as has been stated previously by the author under number 12.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">73 Translator’s Note: He is one of the narrator’s in the chain of narration of the book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">74 Translator’s Note: He was a man who had accepted Islaam, but who later apostated. When he was given the task of collecting Zakaat with another Companion from the Ansaar, he killed him during the journey, apostated, and seeked shelter in Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">75 This hadeeth has an authentic chain of narration, and it is found in Al-Muwatta, and on his (Maalik&#8217;s) authority in the Saheehs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">76 He is &#8216;Abd-ul-Malik Ibn &#8216;Abd-il-&#8216;Azeez Al-Qushairee An-Nasaa&#8217;ee. He is reliable and from the narrators of Muslim. This goes the same for the rest of the narrators of this chain, thus it is authentic according to his (Muslim&#8217;s) standards. It has been transmitted by Ahmad (3/192 &amp; 225) through other paths on the authority of Hamaad. And it is also in (3/283) and in An-Nasaa&#8217;ee (2/316) from the path of Hafs on Anas. It is also found in Saheeh Muslim (8/72) from the hadeeth of Zayd Ibn Arqam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">77 Its chain of narration is hasan and the hadeeth is authentic. The two Shaikhs (Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim) have transmitted it through another path on the authority of &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah, may Allaah be pleased with her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">78 Its chain of narration is saheeh according to the standards of the two Shaikhs. And they have both transmitted it through other paths of narration on the authority of Anas without the mention of his (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) saying: &#8220;…for indeed each of you…&#8221;. There is a supporting evidence for this addition (to the hadeeth) in the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) in marfoo&#8217; form which is found in Saheeh Muslim (7/65) and Ahmad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">79 His name is Muhammad Ibn Ja&#8217;far Ibn Ziyaad and he is reliable. However, his shaikh, Sa&#8217;eed Ibn Maisira, is accused (of weakness). Regardless the hadeeth is saheeh. The two Shaikhs (Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim) as well as others have transmitted it from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu), with different wordings and additions to it. I have gathered and checked all of them in my book Ahkaam-ul-Janaa&#8217;iz wa Bid&#8217;ihaa and it has been published by Al-Maktab-ul-Islaamee.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AUTHOR: Shaikh Rabee&#8217; bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Excerpt from the forthcoming Al-Ibaanah Publication &#8220;The Methodology of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah in Criticizing Individuals, Books and Groups&#8221;, may Allaah facilitate it!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a chapter from the book <b>“<i>Manhaj Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah fee Naqd-ir-Rijaal wal-Kutubi wat-Tawaa’if</i>”</b> (The Methodology of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah in Criticizing Individuals, Books and Groups) written by Shaikh Rabee’ Al-Madkhalee. This book has been highly praised and recommended by the scholars, and has become a classical work in its own time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this book, Shaikh Rabee’ Al-Madkhalee clarifies the correct methodology of Ahlus-Sunnah with regard to criticizing, explaining its foundations and principles and relying on the various statements of the Salaf (predecessors) to support his points. The book is primarily geared towards refuting a false concept that has crept into the Muslims’ ideologies and slogans in recent times, which is the principle of Muwaazanah. This principle dictates that when someone criticizes a person, book or group, he is obligated to also mention the good qualities of that person, book or group along with his criticism. By doing this one would be creating a balance and thus applying “fairness”, hence the term Muwaazanah, which means to make a balance, which in this case means a balance between the good and the bad aspects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this specific chapter of the book, Shaikh Rabee’ brings many quotes from the Salaf showing that it was from their methodology to warn against innovators and their books without requiring themselves to mention their positive aspects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Ibn Al-Jawzee said: ‘Abul-Wafaa ‘Alee bin ‘Aqeel, the Fiqh scholar, said: ‘Our Shaikh Abul-Fadl Al-Hamdhaanee said: The innovators in Islaam and those who fabricate <i>ahaadeeth </i>are worse than the disbelievers. This is since the disbelievers attempt to corrupt the Religion from the outside, whereas these individuals attempt to corrupt it from the inside. They take the likeness of the inhabitants of a land, who strive to corrupt its condition (from the inside), while the disbelievers take the likeness of raiders laying siege to the land from the outside. So it is the ones on the inside who open the doors of the land’s surrounding barrier (and let the besiegers in). These types (of people) are more dangerous to Islaam than those who don&#8217;t ascribe themselves to it.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I say: Today, the opponents of the Sunnah and Tawheed are capitalizing on the pamphlets and cassettes of some individuals that ascribe themselves to the Sunnah and Tawheed, which defame the true scholars and callers of the Sunnah and Tawheed. Rather, what is worse in terms of danger and affliction is that these pamphlets and tapes have influenced many of the children of Tawheed and Sunnah, so that now they launch their arrows of disparagement and oppressive accusations towards the scholars of Tawheed and Sunnah, those who carry their banner and those who defend their sanctity. What is worse than this in terms of misfortune and grief, is that they attach themselves and join forces with the people of innovation and misguidance in their campaign of launching poisonous missiles at them, which the enemies of the Sunnah and Tawheed have been preparing as the ultimate attack to finish off the last remnants of the Sunnah and Tawheed.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Ibn Al-Qayyim said: ‘The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) once saw a book in the hand of ‘Umar (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) that he had transcribed from the Torah, and which caused him to be amazed at how much it conformed to the Qur’aan. So the face of the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) became very angry to the point that ‘Umar went over to a fire and threw it in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how would it be if the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) saw what was written after him from the books that oppose and contradict what is in the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah?! And we ask Allaah to aid us!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) commanded everyone that recorded anything from him apart from the Qur’aan to erase what they had written down. However, afterward, he allowed his Sunnah to be written, but did not grant permission for anything besides that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So all of these books that contain opposition in them to the Sunnah, have no permission to be written. Rather, they only have permission to be erased and destroyed, for there is not anything more harmful to the ummah than these books. The Companions (of the Prophet) burned all the copies of the <i>mus-haf </i>that contradicted the <i>mus-haf </i>of ‘Uthmaan (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) out of fear that differing would spread amongst the ummah. So how would it be if they were to see the books of today that cause disunity and division amongst the ummah…!?’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is the rightly guided methodology, which all of the Salafee youth are obligated to know – it is the methodology indicated in the Qur’aan and the Sunnah, and which the best of this ummah – its scholars of Hadeeth and Fiqh &#8211; followed. One of the conditions for implementing this methodology is that the one criticizing must do that for the sake of Allaah and out of sincerity to Allaah and His Book and in order to preserve Allaah’s Religion and what it encompasses from beliefs, laws and acts of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the severely unfortunate matters is that the people of falsehood and innovation have succeeded in deceiving many of the smart and intelligent students of knowledge, not to mention others, by making them believe that it is not permissible to talk about (i.e. criticize) those active in the field of Da’wah (calling). They mean by this, those who call to innovation and misguidance! By doing this, they intend to broaden the field (of Da’wah) so that they can spread their destructive deceptions! And they hope that with this they will be able to put an end to the Call to Tawheed, Sunnah and the Methodology of the Salaf As-Saalih!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the offshoots of this deceitful way of thinking are those conditions that some of the children of Tawheed have put forth, such as: When criticizing the people of innovation – or those whom they label “callers” – one is obligated to mention their good qualities alongside their bad qualities&#8230;”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of the classical treatise of Imaam Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab <b><i>“Masaa’il-ul-Jaahiliyyah”</i></b><i></i> (Aspects of the Days of Ignorance), which is a list of 128 points &#8211; each point representing one aspect of belief or practice that the people of the Days of Ignorance were upon, which Islaam came to oppose. The source used for this translation can be found on sahab.org.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The original Arabic text of the treatise is included within this translation so as to make this e-book a comprehensive reference guide and an easily-accessible study guide. Footnotes were added by the translator in order to clarify and provide evidence for some of the points that the author mentioned but didn’t provide proof or an explanation for. In recent times, this treatise has been explained by Shaikh Saalih Al-Fawzaan in several lectures. These lectures were recorded and transcribed and put into a book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The subject matter of this treatise is one of great importance, for the aspects of the Days of Ignorance have not ceased to be acted upon till this very day. And the people that call towards these misguided beliefs and practices of the Days of Ignorance are many, such as innovators and people of desire. So it is important for the Muslim to learn what the People of the Days of Ignorance were upon in terms of beliefs, actions and practices, so that he may avoid that, since Islaam came to oppose these aspects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b> “These are the aspects that the people of the Days of Ignorance – both the people of the Book and the non-People of the Book – were upon, which the Messenger of Allaah opposed. They are from the matters that every Muslim is required to possess knowledge of. This is since with (understanding) one side of the opposite, the goodness of the other side of the opposite can be made apparent. And it is by (making apparent the) opposite of something that matters become clarified. The most important of these aspects (of the Days of Ignorance) and most severe in terms of danger was the absence of faith (Eemaan) in the heart, for what the Messenger of Allaah came with. And if approval for what the people of the Days of Ignorance were upon is further added to this (absence of faith), then the total ruin is achieved, as Allaah says: <b>‘And those who believe in the falsehood while disbelieving in Allaah, it is they who are the losers.’</b> [Surah Al-‘Ankaboot: 52]”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<b>[3]</b> They held the acts of opposing the figure of authority and failing to comply with him as being something virtuous. And they saw the acts of hearing and obeying as being humiliating and degrading. So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger opposed them and commanded that patience be observed when facing the oppression of the rulers. And he commanded with hearing and obeying them, as well as advising (them). And he spoke extensively in regards to that and he constantly brought it up and repeated it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<b>[5]</b> From their greatest principles was that they were deceived by (following) the majority, using that as a proof against the correctness of a matter. And they also used as evidence for declaring the falsehood of something, the fact that it was strange and that its adherents were few. So Allaah prescribed the opposite of that and He clarified this in many places of the Qur&#8217;aan.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<b>[23]</b> They were deluded by the life of this world. So they perceived Allaah’s bestowal of worldly material (on someone), as an indication of He was pleased (with that person), as He says: <b>‘And they say: We are abundant in wealth and in children. And (because of that) we are not going to be punished.’</b> [Surah Saba’: 35]”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Imaam Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translated transcription of a lecture delivered by Imaam Al-Albaanee (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) that was recorded and distributed under the title <b><i>“Hadhihi Da’watunaa”</i></b><i></i> (This is Our Call). The present translation was translated directly from the Arabic audio.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this lecture, Imaam Al-Albaanee explains the basis of the Salafee Manhaj, which is following the way, understanding and practical application of the Salaf, who were namely the first three generations of Muslims: The Sahaabah, Taabi’een and Atbaa’ at-Taabi’een. They are the ones referred to in the Prophet’s saying: <b>“The best of mankind is my generation, then those that come after them, then those that come after them.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the basis that distinguishes the true call to Islaam from all other false and erroneous calls, regardless if they claim to be “upon the Qur’aan and the Sunnah.” Al-Albaanee goes into depth discussing this fact, that one cannot truly understand and apply the Qur’aan and Sunnah unless he follows the understanding and application of the Salaf. We ask Allaah to accept this effort and benefit the Muslims with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So here we have given the answer from the ayah and the two hadeeth, we just mentioned. Follow the way of the Believers! The way of those believers from present times? The answer is no, we mean the Believers from the past &#8211; the first era &#8211; the era of the Companions &#8211; the Salaf As-Saalih (pious predecessors). These are the people whom we should take as our example and as the ones whom we follow. And there is absolutely no one equal to them on the face of the earth. Therefore, the essence of our call is based on three pillars &#8211; on the (1) Qur&#8217;aan, the (2) Sunnah and (3) Following the Salaf As-Saalih (pious predecessors).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So everyone claims to follow the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah, and how often have we heard this kind of talk from the youth who are in confusion, when they say: ‘Ya akhee, these people claim to follow the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah and those people claim to follow the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah.’ So what is the clear and decisive distinction? It is the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah and the Methodology of the Salaf As-Saalih. So whoever follows the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah without following the Salaf As-Saalih, he in fact has not followed the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah, rather he has only followed his intellect, if not his desire.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“After making clear this important condition of &#8220;upon the methodology of the Salaf As-Saalih&#8221;, I must give you some examples. In the past, the Muslims split up into many sects. You hear about the Mu&#8217;tazilah, you hear about the Murji&#8217;ah, you hear about the Khawaarij, you hear about the Zaidiyyah, not to mention the Shi&#8217;a and the Raafidah and so on. There is no one amongst these groups, no matter how deep in misguidance they are, that does not share the same saying as the rest of the Muslims, which is that: &#8220;We are on the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah.&#8221; No one amongst them says: &#8220;We don’t follow the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah.&#8221; And if one of them were to say that, he would completely leave the fold of Islaam. So then why did they split up so long as all of them rely on the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah &#8211; and I bear witness that they do rely on the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah for support. But how is this relying done? It is done without relying on the third foundation, which is what the Salaf As-Saalih were upon.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Imaam Zayn-ud-Deen Ibn Rajab Al-Hanbalee<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a complete translation of the classical treatise <b><i>“Al-Farq baynan-Naseeha wat-Ta’yeer”</i></b><i></i>[The Difference between Advising and Condemning] of Imaam Ibn Rajab Al-Hanbalee, may Allaah have mercy on him. The source used for this translation was the Daar ‘Ammaar publication.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this treatise, Imaam Ibn Rajab discusses some of the manners and etiquettes of differing amongst Ahlus-Sunnah, explaining the distinction between advising and condemning. This is since these two things are often confused for one another. So the author goes into depth explaining the characteristics of sincere advice and condemnation. This treatise also lays down some guidelines for Ahlus-Sunnah in their criticisms and refutations. It should be noted, as the author states, that this treatise only applies to Ahlus-Sunnah, and as for the innovators and people of desires, then these guidelines do not apply to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In recent times, Shaikh Rabee’ Al-Madkhalee has provided an explanation for some of the important points covered in this book in a two-part lecture which was later transcribed and can be downloaded for free from his website <a href="http://www.rabee.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.rabee.net</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Therefore, refuting weak (erroneous) opinions and clarifying the truth with regard to what opposes it, based upon sound evidences, is not from what these scholars detested. Rather, it was from that which they loved and for which they commended and praised those who did it. So it does not enter into the realm of backbiting at all. But suppose there is someone that hates to have his error, which contradicts the Sunnah, exposed. In this case, there is no consideration given to his hatred for that, because hating to manifest the truth &#8211; if it is in opposition to the opinion of a man &#8211; is not from those matters that are praiseworthy. Rather it is an obligation on the Muslim to love that the truth be made manifest and that the Muslims (in general) are aware of it, regardless of whether it is in conformity or in opposition to his (personal) view.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Therefore, these characteristics are the characteristics of the Jews and the hypocrites. And it is that someone outwardly displays a saying or an action, while presenting an image in which he appears to be upon good. Yet his intention in doing that is to accomplish an evil goal. So he is praised for what good he has made manifest outwardly, while accomplishing by it, the evil goal he has kept hidden inwardly. And he basks in the praise he receives for that which he has outwardly portrayed as being good, which is in fact evil on the inside, and he is happy that his evil hidden objective has been achieved. So his benefit is perfected for him and his scheme is carried out effectively by this deception!!”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Shaikh &#8216;Abdul-Muhsin bin Hamad Al-&#8216;Abbaad<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah.Com<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a small treatise entitled <b>“<i>’Aqeedatu Ahlis-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah fis-Sahaabat-il-Kiraam</i>”</b> (The Creed of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah concerning the Companions) written by Shaikh ‘Abdul-Muhsin Al-‘Abbaad. The source for this treatise was an article the Shaikh wrote for the Islamic University of Madeenah Newsletter (Issue 2 of their fourth year) Shawaal 1391H. This article was distributed together with a transcribed lecture from the Shaikh entitled “Sending Salaat on the Prophet” in a booklet published by the Islamic University of Madeenah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this brief presentation, Shaikh Al-‘Abbaad, one of the senior scholars and a Muhaddith in Saudi Arabia, may Allaah preserve him, outlines the proper belief a Muslim should have with regard to the Companions, and that is of moderateness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Muslim should not go to either extreme of being fanatical towards individuals amongst the Companions or being lenient and heedless about the rights they deserve. Rather, it is upon the believer, the adherent of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, to have love and respect for all of them, as well as to acknowledge their virtues and refrain from mentioning their errors and mishaps. The Shaikh presents the material in a concise but educational manner, quoting numerous ayaat, ahaadeeth and statements of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The <i>madh-hab</i> of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah concerning the Companions is that of moderateness between the two ends of extremism and heedlessness. It is moderateness amidst the extremist fanatics who elevate the esteemed ones amongst them to a level that is only befitting for Allaah or for His messengers and moderateness amidst the heedless and harsh ones who belittle and revile them. So they are in the middle between those who are excessive and those who fall short &#8211; they love all of them and put each one of them in the due place that they deserve, with fairness and justice. So they do not elevate them to a level they don’t deserve, nor do they belittle them, taking away what they are worthy of. Their tongues are moist with mentioning them only in good, according to what is befitting for them. And their hearts are filled with love for them.“</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And whatever disputes and differences that occurred between (some of) them, that can be authentically confirmed, we hold that they were Mujtahideen in that regard – either they were correct and will receive one reward for their Ijtihaad and one reward for being correct, or they were wrong and will receive just one reward for their Ijtihaad while their error will be forgiven. They were not infallible since they were human beings. At times they were correct and at times they erred. But how much more were they correct as compared to others being correct, and how fewer were their errors as compared to the errors of others? And on top of this, they will receive Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness and contentment.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;These are five examples from the sayings of the Salaf As-Saalih (righteous predecessors), which demonstrate what we are obligated to believe in with respect to the best of creation after the Prophets and Messengers. One thing we must understand is that defaming these chosen and unique individuals is equal to defaming the Religion itself, since it was none other than them who passed the Religion down to those who came after them. And we already mentioned the words of Abu Zur&#8217;ah, in which he said: &#8216;The only ones who brought this Qur&#8217;aan and Sunan (plural of Sunnah) to us are the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger. (So) they only wish to disparage and demolish our witnesses so that they can nullify the Book and the Sunnah, whereas they are more deserving of being disparaged for they are the heretics (<i>zanaadiqah</i>).'&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>About the Book:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of the classic treatise Lum&#8217;at-ul-&#8216;Itiqaad (Sufficiency in Creed) of the great Imaam, Abu Muhammad Muwaffaq-ud-Deen Ibn Qudaamah AI-Maqdisee, may Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this book, Imaam Ibn Qudaamah presents the Creed of the Salaf as is the custom of the scholars of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah in every century — to preserve the authentic Creed by way of writing it down in books and spreading it So this Creed became well known amongst the scholars and studied in the gatherings of knowledge. In fact the treatise continues to be studied and reviewed by students of knowledge throughout the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This book was explained in recent times by Imaam Muhammad bin Saalih Al-Uthaimeen and assigned for study by the Board of Educational Institutes in Saudi Arabia. All footnotes and hadeeth verifications were extracted in abridged form from Ashraf bin Abdil-Maqsood&#8217;s checking of Imaam Ibn Al-Uthaimeen&#8217;s explanation of &#8216;Sufficiency in Creed&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah to make this treatise a benefit for the students of knowledge to study and acquire understanding of their Religion.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is due to Allaah, the One praised in every tongue (i.e. language), the One worshipped in every era. There is not a place that is free of His Knowledge nor does one affair preoccupy Him over another. He is far beyond any equals and rivals, as well as being free of any wife or children. His Decree is carried out in all of His servants. No intellect can derive an example of Him with its pondering, nor can any heart attempt to depict Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“There is nothing whatsoever like Him (in comparison). And He is the AllHearer, the All-Seer.”</strong> [Surah Ash-Shoora (42): 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To Him belong the best of Names and the most honorable of Attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The Most Gracious (Allaah) rose over the Throne (in a manner that suits His majesty). To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth, and all that is between them, and all that is under the soil. And if you speak aloud, then verily, He knows the secret and that which is yet more hidden. Allaah! None has the right to be worshipped except Him. To Him belong the best of Names.”</strong> [Surah TaHa (20): 5-8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His knowledge encompasses everything. He subjugates all creatures by His Honor and Rule. And His knowledge and mercy engulf everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“He (Allaah) knows what happens to them (His creatures) in this world, and what will happen to them (in the Hereafter) but they will never encompass anything of His knowledge.”</strong> [Surah TaHa (20): 110]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is described by what He has attributed to Himself in His Magnificent Book and upon the tongue of His honorable Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are obligated to believe in and to welcome with submission and acceptance everything that is mentioned in the Qur&#8217;aan or that is authentically reported on the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) concerning Allaah&#8217;s Attributes. And we must abandon opposing it (which is done) by radd (rejection), ta&#8217;weel (distortive misinterpretation), tashbeeh (comparison) and tamtheel (representation). As for what appears unclear from that, then we are obligated to affirm its wording and not oppose it’s (literal) meaning. We are to return the precise knowledge of it to the One who stated it and we entrust it upon the one who transmitted it, following the example of the ones who are deeply endowed with knowledge, those whom Allaah has praised in His manifest Book, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And those who are firmly grounded with knowledge say: ‘We believe in it (the Qur&#8217;aan); the whole of it (clear and unclear verses) is from our Lord.’”</strong> [Surah Aali &#8216;Imraan (3): 7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says, dispraising the one who seeks the ta&#8217;weel (hidden meaning) of the unclear verses of His revelation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“As for those in whose hearts there is deviation, they follow that which is not entirely clear thereof, seeking fitnah (mischief) and seeking for its ta&#8217;weel (hidden meanings), but no one knows its hidden meanings except Allaah.”</strong> [Surah Aali &#8216;Imraan (3): 7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus Allah has placed the aspect of seeking after the hidden meanings (ta&#8217;weel) as a sign of deviation. And He has placed it at the same level of seeking after mischief, in the dispraise of it. Then He placed a barrier between them and that which they aspire and He cuts off their ambitions from what they seek after, by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“But no one knows its hidden meanings except Allaah.”</strong> [Surah Aali &#8216;Imraan (3): 7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the hadeeths: “<strong>Verily, Allaah descends to the lowest heaven</strong>&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>Verily, Allaah will be seen on the Day of Judgement</strong>” and what is similar to these ahaadeeth, Imaam Abu &#8216;Abdillaah Ahmad bin Hanbal (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;We believe in them and we attest to their verity, without saying how and without ascribing a (fixed) meaning for them. Nor do we reject any part from them. We know that whatever the Messenger came with is the truth. We do not reject what Allaah&#8217;s Messenger came with, nor do we describe Allaah with more than He has described Himself, without limits.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says: ‘<strong>There is nothing whatsoever like Him (in comparison). And He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer</strong>.’ We say as He has said. We describe Him with what He has described Himself and we do not transgress that. The description of those who (attempt to) describe Him, cannot grasp Him. We believe in the Qur&#8217;aan, all of it, its clear verses as well as its unclear verses. We do not reject any of His Attributes due to a discomfort (that we may perceive towards it). We do not transgress the Qur&#8217;aan and the Hadeeth. And we have no knowledge of how to understand them, except through the affirmations of the Messenger and the confirmation of the Qur&#8217;aan.” Imaam Abu &#8216;Abdillaah Muhammad bin Idrees Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee, may Allaah be pleased with him, said: “I believe in Allaah and in what has been reported concerning Allaah, upon what was intended by Allaah. And I believe in the Messenger of Allaah and in what has been reported concerning the Messenger of Allaah, upon what was intended by the Messenger of Allaah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the way that the scholars of the past and present have followed, may Allaah be pleased with them. They all unanimously agreed on acknowledging, accepting, and affirming what has been mentioned in the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) concerning the Attributes, without turning towards the use of ta&#8217;weel.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have been commanded to follow their way (the Prophet and his Companions) and to be guided by their example. And we have been warned of the newly invented matters and we have been informed that they are from among the things that lead astray. The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Stick to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly-guided Khaleefahs (who will come) after me. Bite onto it (i.e. the Sunnah) with your molar teeth and beware of newly invented matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For indeed, every newly invented matter is an innovation and every innovation is a misguidance.” [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullaah bin Mas&#8217;ood (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) said: “Follow (the Sunnah) and do not innovate! For you have been sufficed.” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umar bin &#8216;Abd-il-&#8216;Azeez (rahimahullaah) said something with the meaning:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Stop where the people have stopped! For, indeed, they stopped upon receiving knowledge. The clear evidences would suffice them and they were the strongest at manifesting it. If there were any addition (to the Religion), they would be most likely to have done it (first). So if you say: it was introduced after them, then no one introduces into it except for he who opposes their guidance and desires other than their example. They have described from it what was enough and they have spoken concerning it what has sufficed. What is above them is excessiveness. And what is below them is inadequacy. Some people have fallen short of them and so they have drawn away. And others have transgressed them and so they became extreme. But indeed, they were between these two, upon a straight guidance.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu &#8216;Amr Al-Awzaa&#8217;ee (rahimahullaah) said: “Stick to the narrations of those who came before you (man salafa), even if the people reject you. And beware of the opinions of men, even if they beautify them for you with their speech.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad bin &#8216;Abd-ir-Rahmaan Al-Adarmee (rahimahullaah) said to a man who was speaking of an innovation and calling the people towards it:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Did the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), Abu Bakr, &#8216;Umar, &#8216;Uthmaan and ‘Alee have knowledge of it or did they not have knowledge of it?” He said: “They did not have knowledge of it.” He said: “So something which they had no knowledge of, you know!?!&#8221; The man said: “Then I say that they did have knowledge of it!” He said: “Was it sufficient for them that they not speak about it nor call the people towards it, or was it not sufficient for them?” The man said: “Of course it was sufficient for them.” He said: &#8220;So something which was sufficient for the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and his Khaleefahs is not sufficient for you!?!” So the man refrained (from his call) and the Khaleefah, who was present there, said: &#8220;May Allaah not suffice the one who is not satisfied by what they found sufficient.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, whoever does not feel content with what was sufficient for the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), his Companions, those who followed them in righteousness, the Imaams that came after them and those deeply endowed with knowledge, regarding reciting the verses on (Allaah’s) Attributes, reading the reports about them and leaving them the way they came (i.e. were reported), then may Allaah not suffice him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among what has been revealed in the verses concerning Allaah’s Attributes, is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And the Face of your Lord, full of Majesty and Honor, will remain forever.”</strong></span> [Surah Ar-Rahmaan (55): 27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Nay, both His Hands are widely outstretched.” </strong></span>[Surah AlMaa&#8217;idah (5): 64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His statement in which He informs us that &#8216;Eesaa bin Maryam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“You know what is in my inner-self, though I do not know what is in Your Self.”</strong></span> [Surah Al-Maa&#8217;idah (5): 116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His statement: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And your Lord comes…”</strong></span> [Surah Al-Fajr (89): 22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Do they then wait for anything other than that Allaah should come to them.”</strong></span> [Surah Al-Baqarah (2): 210]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Allaah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him.”</strong> [Surah Al-Maa&#8217;idah (5): 119]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“Allaah will bring a people whom He will love and they will love Him.”</em> </span>[Surah AlMaa&#8217;idah (5): 54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His statement concerning the disbelievers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“And the Anger of Allaah is upon them.”</em></span> [Surah Al-Fath (48): 6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“That is because they followed that which discontented Allaah…”</em></span> [Surah Muhammad (47): 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“But Allaah disliked their being sent forth.”</em></span> [Surah At-Tawbah (9): 46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the Sunnah is the statement of the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Our Lord, may He be Blessed and Exalted, descends to the lowest heaven every night.”</strong> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Your Lord is amazed by the youth who does not possess childish manners.”</strong> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Allaah laughs at two men – one of whom kills the other, then they both enter Paradise.”</strong> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We believe in this and what is similar to it, from that which has an authentic chain and reliable reporters. We do not reject it nor do we negate it. Nor do we change its meaning with something that contradicts what is literally apparent from it. We do not compare it to the attributes of the creation nor by (using) the naming schemes of the innovators. And we know that Allaah, Glorified and Exalted, has no equal or comparison.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“There is nothing whatsoever like Him (in comparison). And He is the AllHearer, the All-Seer.”</strong> [Surah Ash-Shoora (42): 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everything that is imagined by the intellect or pondered in one’s thoughts, then Allaah is contrary to that. Another example is His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;But they give preference to others over themselves, even though they had a need for it.&#8221;</em></span> [Surah Al-Hashr (59): 9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“The Most Merciful rose over the Throne.”</em></span> [Surah TaHa (20): 5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“Do you feel secure that He, who is above the heavens…”</span></em> [Surah Al-Mulk (67): 16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the statement of the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Our Lord, Allaah, who is above the heavens! Sanctified be your Name.”</strong> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) saying to the slave girl: “Where is Allaah?” She said: “Above the heavens.” So he said: “Free her, for indeed, she is a believer.” Maalik bin Anas, Muslim and other scholars have reported this hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said to Husayn (bin &#8216;Imraan): “How many gods do you worship?” He said: “Seven. Six in the earth and one above the heavens.” He (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said “Who is it that you hope in and fear (most)?” He said: “The One that is above the heavens.” He said: “Then abandon the six and worship the One who is above the heavens, and I will teach you two supplications.” So he accepted Islaam and the Prophet taught him to say: “O Allaah, Grant me guidance and save me from the evil of my self.” [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What was reported in the previously revealed books, concerning the signs of the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and his Companions, is that: <strong>“They prostrate on earth while claiming that their god is above the heavens.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Dawood reported in his Sunan that the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>“Indeed what is between one level of heaven and (another) level of heaven is a distance of such and such…”</strong> He continued until he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) mentioned: <strong>“And above that is the Throne. And Allaah, the One free of all defects, is above that.”</strong> [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This and what is similar to it is from what the Salaf, may Allaah have mercy on them, have unanimously agreed on reporting and accepting. And we do not incline towards rejecting it (radd), nor toward distorting its meaning (ta&#8217;weel), nor towards making comparisons to it (tashbeeh), nor towards likening it (tamtheel).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Maalik bin Anas (rahimahullaah) was questioned once, and it was said to him: “O Abu &#8216;Abdillaah! (Allaah says): ‘The Most Merciful rose over the Throne.’ How does He rise?” So he (rahimahullaah) responded: “The Rising (Al-Istiwaa) is not something unkown. How (it is done) is incomprehensible. Believing in it is an obligation. And asking concerning it is an innovation.” Then he put someone in charge of the man and he was thrown out. [9]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">THE SPEECH OF ALLAAH</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the Attributes of Allaah is that He speaks with a speech that is pre-existent. He causes whomsoever He wills to hear it. Moosaa heard it from Him without there being any intermediary. Jibreel heard it, as well as whomever He permits from His angels and messengers. He, the One free from all defects, will speak to the believers in the Hereafter and they will speak to Him. He will grant them permission and they will visit Him. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And to Moosaa, Allaah spoke directly.” [Surah An-Nisaa (4): 164]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“He (Allaah) said: ‘O Moosaa, I have chosen you above men by My messages, and by My speaking (to you).’” [Surah Al-A&#8217;araaf (7): 144] And He says: “Those messengers! We preferred some of them over others; to some of them Allaah spoke (directly).” [Surah Al-Baqarah (2): 253]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It is not for any human being that Allaah should speak to him unless (it be) by Revelation, or from behind a veil.” [Surah Ash-Shuraa (42): 51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And when he came to it (the fire), he was called by name: ‘O Moosaa! Verily, I am your Lord!’” [Surah TaHa (20): 11-12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Verily, I am Allaah! None has the right to be worshipped but I, so worship Me, and establish the prayer for My Remembrance.” [Surah TaHa (20): 14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible for anyone to say this (last ayah) except Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullaah bin Mas&#8217;ood (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) said: “When Allaah speaks through revelation, the inhabitants of the heavens hear His Voice.” He reported this on the Prophet. [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullaah bin Anees (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) reported that the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Allaah will gather the creatures on the Day of Judgement, naked, barefoot, uncircumcised and not having anything with them. He will then call them with a voice that those who are far as well as those who are near will be able to hear: ‘I am Al-Malik (the King). I am Ad-Dayyaan (the Recompenser).’” [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In some narrations, it mentions that: One night Moosaa saw the Fire and it overthrew him so he became frightened from it. Then his Lord called to him: “O Moosaa!” So he responded quickly, being familiar with the voice: “Here I am to serve you! Here I am! I hear Your voice but I do not see Your place (i.e. where you are). Where are You?” He said: “I am above you and in front of you and on your right and on your left.” So he realized that this attribute did not befit anyone except Allaah. He (Moosaa) then said: “You are just as You say, my Lord. Do I hear Your speech or the speech of one of Your messengers (angels)?” He said: “No, rather My speech, O Moosaa.”</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">THE QUR’AAN IS THE SPEECH OF ALLAAH</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the Speech of Allaah, is the Glorious Qur&#8217;aan. It is the plain Book of Allaah and His firm rope. It is His straight path and the revelation of the Lord of the universe. The most honorable spirit (Jibreel) brought it to the heart of the best of messengers, in a clear Arabic language. It was revealed and not created. From Him it began and to Him it will return.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It consists of precise chapters, clear verses, and letters and words. Whoever recites it and does so properly (with &#8216;Iraab), he will have ten good deeds for every letter he recites. It has a beginning and an end, and it consists of sections and parts. It is that which is recited by the tongues, memorized in the hearts, listened to by the ears, and recorded in the scriptures (masaahif).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In it are verses that are clear and ambiguous, that which abrogates and those that are abrogated, those that are specific and those that are general, and those that contain obligations and prohibitions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Falsehood cannot approach it from before it or behind it. (It is) sent down by the All-Wise, Worthy of all praise (Allaah).” [Surah Fussilat (41): 42]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Say: If mankind and jinn were to gather together to produce the likes of this Qur&#8217;aan, they would not produce the likes thereof, even if they helped one another.” [Surah Al-Israa (17): 88]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Arabic Book of which the disbelievers said concerning it: “We will never believe in this Qur&#8217;aan.” [Surah Saba (34): 31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And some of them said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is nothing but the words of a human being!” [Surah Al-Mudaththir (74): 25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I will cast him into the Hellfire.” [Surah Al-Mudaththir (74): 26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of them said that it was poetry, so Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And We have not taught him (i.e. Muhammad) poetry nor is it suitable for him. This is only a reminder and a plain Qur&#8217;aan.” [Surah YaaSeen (36): 69] Thus, when Allaah denies that it is poetry and confirms that it is a Qur&#8217;aan, there should not remain any doubt for the one possessing intellect, that the Qur&#8217;aan is that Arabic Book which is composed of words, letters and verses. This is because if it were not so, then they (disbelievers) would not have claimed that it was poetry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Mighty and Sublime, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And if you (disbelievers) are in doubt concerning what We have sent down (i.e. the Qur&#8217;aan) to Our slave (Muhammad), then produce a chapter the like thereof and call your witnesses besides Allaah.” [Surah Al-Baqarah (2): 23] It is not right for Him to challenge them with producing something that they neither know nor understand (i.e. it is words and letters, which they know).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And when Our clear verses are recited unto them, those who hope not to meet Us, say: ‘Bring us a Qur&#8217;aan other than this, or change it.’ Say (O Muhammad) ‘It is not for me to change it on my own accord. I only follow that which is revealed unto me.’” [Surah Yoonus (10): 15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This confirms that the Qur&#8217;aan is (made of) verses, which are recited unto them (i.e. the disbelievers).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Nay, but they are clear verses that are preserved in the hearts of those who have been given knowledge.” [Surah Al-&#8216;Ankaboot (29): 49]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says after having sworn upon it:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is indeed an honorable Qur&#8217;aan. In a Book well guarded (i.e. Al-Lawh-ulMahfoodh), which none can touch, except the purified (i.e. the angels).” [Surah<br />
Al-Waaqi&#8217;ah (56): 77-79]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Kaaf-Ha-Ya-&#8216;Ayn-Saad” [Surah Maryam (19): 1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Ha-Meem. &#8216;Ayn-Seen-Qaaf” [Surat-ush-Shooraa (42): 1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He commences twenty-nine chapters of the Qur’aan with individually separated letters. The Prophet (sallAallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Whoever recites the Qur&#8217;aan and recites it properly, there will be ten good deeds for him, for every letter from it. And whoever recites the Qur&#8217;aan and recites it improperly, there will be one good deed for him for every letter.” [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he (sallAallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Read the Qur&#8217;aan before there comes to you a people who will throw forth its words as fast as an arrow (shoots out), yet it will not pass their throats. They will hasten its reward and not delay it.” [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar (radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa) said: “To make &#8216;Iraab of the Qur&#8217;aan (recite it properly with all its rules) is more beloved to us than to memorize some of its letters.” [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Alee (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) said: “Whoever disbelieves in one letter from it, then he has disbelieved in all of it.” [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslims (i.e. scholars) have unanimously agreed on the number of chapters (suwar), verses, words and letters of the Qur&#8217;aan. There is no disagreement amongst the Muslims (i.e. scholars) concerning the disbelief of one who denies a chapter (surah), verse (ayah), word, or letter from the Qur&#8217;aan, which has been agreed on. There is a clear decisive proof in this that it is (made of) letters.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">THE BELIEVERS WILL SEE THEIR LORD ON THE DAY OF JUDGEMENT</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The believers will see their Lord in the Hereafter with their own eyes and they will visit Him. He will speak to them and they will speak to Him. Allaah says: “(Some) Faces on that Day will be shiny and radiant. Looking at their Lord (Allaah).” [Surah Al-Qiyaamah (75): 22-23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says: “Nay! Surely, they (evildoers) will be veiled from seeing their Lord that Day.” [Surah Al-Mutaffifeen (83): 15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If Allaah is screened from these people (disbelievers) during a state in which they are in discontentment this indicates that the believers will see Him while being in (the opposite) a state of pleasure. If this were not so, there would be no distinction between the two.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) said: “Indeed, you will see your Lord, just as you see this moon. There is no difficulty in your seeing it.” This is an authentic hadeeth that has been agreed upon. [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This statement is a comparison between one manner of seeing with another manner of seeing. It is not a comparison between what is being seen and something else that is being seen, for indeed, Allaah has neither comparisons nor equals.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE DIVINE DECREE AND ORDAINMENT OF ALLAAH</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the Attributes of Allaah, is that He does whatsoever He wants. Nothing comes to pass, except by His desire (Iraadah) and nothing escapes His Will (Mashee&#8217;ah). There is nothing in this world that escapes from His Preordainment (Taqdeer) and nothing comes to pass except with His Administration (Tadbeer). There is no one that can go around the Preordainment (Qadar) that has been recorded for him. Nor can one transgress the limits of what has been decreed for him in the Written Tablet (Al-Lawhul-Mahfoodh). He wills all that the creation does. Had He made them infallible, they would not disobey Him, and had He willed that they all obey Him, they would surely obey Him. He created the creation and their actions, and He preordained their provision and lifespans. He guides whom He wills by His wisdom. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“He cannot be questioned as to what He does, while they will be questioned.” [Surah Al-Anbiyaa (21): 23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:<br />
“Verily, We have created all things with Qadar (Divine Preordainment).” [Surah Al-Qamar (54): 49]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:<br />
“He has created everything, and so He has assigned its Preordainment.” [Surah Al-Furqaan (25): 2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“No calamity befalls on the earth or in yourselves, except that it is (written) in a Book (Al-Lawh-ul-Mahfoodh) before We bring it into existence.” [Surah Al-Hadeed (57): 22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And whoever Allaah wills to guide, he opens his breast (i.e. heart) to Islaam. And whoever He wills to send astray, He makes his breast (i.e. heart) closed and constricted.” [Surah Al-Ana&#8217;aam (6): 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Umar reported that Jibreel asked the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) what Eemaan was, so he responded: “To believe in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day and Al-Qadar, the good of it and the bad of it.” So Jibreel told him: “You have spoken truthfully.” Reported by Muslim [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8220;I believe in Al-Qadar, the good of it and the bad of it, the sweet of it and the bitter of it.&#8221; [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the supplications that the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) taught AlHasan bin &#8216;Alee and which he himself used to supplicate with during the Qunoot of<br />
Witr, was: &#8220;And save me from the bad of what You have ordained.&#8221; [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We do not use the Qadaa and the Qadar of Allaah as an excuse for us to abandon following His commandments and avoiding His prohibitions. Rather, we are obligated to believe in and know that with Allaah lies the proof (eliminating all excuses) by His revealing of the Books and His sending of the Messengers. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“In order that mankind shall have no excuse (i.e. proof) against Allaah after the (coming of) Messengers.” [Surah An-Nisaa (4): 165]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We know that Allaah, High and Exalted, did not command or forbid except that which can be acted upon or abandoned. He did not force anyone to commit acts of disobedience nor did He compel anyone to abandon obeying Him. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah has not given any soul a responsibility, except that He has given it the ability (to carry out that responsibility).” [Surat-ul-Baqarah (2): 286]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:<br />
“So fear Allaah as much as you are able to.” [Surah At-Taghaabun (64): 16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:<br />
“This Day every person will be recompensed for what he earned. There will be no injustice (upon anybody in their judgement) on that Day.” [Surah Ghaafir (40): 17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates that every servant possesses actions and things he earns – he will be recompensed for his good deeds with reward and for his bad deeds with punishment. This will occur by the Divine Execution (Al-Qadaa) and Decree (Al-Qadar) of Allaah.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">EEMAAN IS SPEECH AND ACTION</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Eemaan (Faith) is a statement of the tongue, an action of the limbs and a belief of the heart. It increases with obedience and decreases with disobedience. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And they were commanded not, except that they should worship Allaah alone, making the Religion sincere to Him, and establish the prayer, and give the Zakaah. And that is the right religion.” [Surah Al-Bayyinah (98): 5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He has placed the worship of Allaah, the sincerity of the heart, the establishment of prayer and the giving of Zakaah, all as being from the Religion (i.e. Eemaan). The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Eemaan consists of more than seventy branches. The highest of them is to testify that La ilaaha illa Allaah (None has the right to be worshipped except Allaah). And the lowest of them is removing a harmful object from the road.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) placed speech and action as part of Eemaan (Faith). Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“As for those who believe, it has increased their Eemaan.” [Surah At-Tawbah (9): 124]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:<br />
“In order that they may grow more in Eemaan (Faith), along with their (present) Eemaan.” [Surah Al-Fath (48): 4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Whoever says: &#8216;Laa Illaaha Illaa Allaah&#8217; and he has in his heart Eemaan, the weight of a wheat grain, or a mustard&#8217;s seed or an atom, he will be extracted from the Hellfire.” Therefore he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) has placed Eemaan at different levels.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>FAITH IN EVERYTHING THAT THE MESSENGER INFORMED OF</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are obligated to have Faith in everything that the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) informed us about and in what has been authentically attributed to him through reports, whether we witnessed it or it was hidden from us. We know that it is a reality and the truth. This is the same with regard to whether we comprehend it or we do not comprehend it. We do not go beyond the outer actuality (i.e. literalness) of its meaning, such as the hadeeth concerning the Israa and the Mi&#8217;raaj.[20] It occurred while the Prophet was awake and not in a dream, for indeed the Quraish denied it and considered it something incredible. And they did not used to deny dreams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example of that, is when the angel of death approached Moosaa in order to take his soul. He (Moosaa) struck him and gouged his eye, so he returned to his Lord who gave him his eye back.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example of that: are the signs of the Hour, such as the emergence of the Dajjaal, the descent of &#8216;Eesaa bin Maryam, who will then kill him, the coming out of Ya&#8217;jooj and Ma&#8217;jooj, the emergence of the Beast, the rising of the sun from the west, and all that is related to this from what has been authentically reported. [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The punishment and pleasure of the grave are true. The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) would seek refuge from it (the punishment) and he commanded that it be done in every prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The trial of the grave is true. The questioning of Munkar and Nakeer is true. The resurrection after death is true, and that will occur when Israafeel blows on the trumpet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And behold from the graves they will come out quickly to their Lord.” [Surah YaaSeen (36): 51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mankind will be gathered on the Day of Judgement, barefoot, naked, uncircumcised, and having nothing with them (i.e. possessions). They will stop at the final place of standing, until our Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) intercedes for them and Allaah, Blessed and Exalted, reckons with them (i.e. judges them). The Balances will be set up, the records will be distributed and the pages containing the deeds of each individual will be dispersed into the right hands and the left hands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Then as for him who will be given his record in his right hand, he surely, will receive an easy reckoning. And will return back to his family in joy! But whoever is given his record behind his back (or in his left hand), he will invoke (for his) destruction. And he shall enter a blazing Fire and made to taste it’s burning flames.” [Surah Al-Inshiqaaq (84): 7-12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Balance (Al-Meezaan) has two scales and a tongue, with which it will weigh the deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Then those whose Balances (of good deeds) are heavy, they are the successful. And those whose Balances (of good deeds) are light, they are those who lose their own selves, in Hell will they abide.” [Surah Al-Mu&#8217;minoon (23): 102- 103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Prophet Muhammad (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) will have the Fountain (AlHawd) on the Day of Judgement. Its water is whiter than milk and sweeter than honey. Its drinking vessels are as numerous as the stars in the sky. Whosoever drinks a serving from it, will never thirst again after that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Bridge is true. The righteous ones will cross it and the evil ones will fall from it. Our Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) will intercede for the members of his ummah who have entered the Hellfire due to their major sins. Thus they will be</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">extracted from it due to his (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) interceding (for them), but only after having been set ablaze and burned to ashes and charcoal. Then they will enter Paradise due to his intercession.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There will also be interceding done by the rest of the prophets, believers and angels. Allaah says:<br />
“And they cannot intercede except for him with whom He is pleased. And they stand in awe for fear of Him.” [Surah Al-Anbiyaa (21): 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The intercession of the interceders will be of no avail to the disbelievers. Paradise and the Hellfire are two creations that will not cease to exist. Paradise is the abode of the close friends of Allaah, while the Hellfire is the place of punishment for His enemies. The inhabitants of Paradise will abide therein (i.e. Paradise) forever. “Verily, the sinful evildoers will be in the torment of Hell to abide therein forever. (Their torment) will not be lightened for them, and they will be plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows.” [Surah Az-Zukhruf (43): 74-75]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Death will be brought in the form of a sturdy ram and slaughtered between Paradise and Hellfire. Then it will be said: “O inhabitants of Paradise! Eternity for you and no (more) death! And O inhabitants of Hellfire! Eternity for you and no (more) death!” [22]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>MUHAMMAD, THE SEAL OF THE PROPHETS</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), the seal of the Prophets and the leader of those sent by Allaah. The Eemaan (Faith) of a servant is not valid until he believes in his message and bears witness to his prophethood. Mankind will not be judged on the Day of Judgement except with his (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) intercession. And no nation will enter Paradise, until his nation has entered it first.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is the possessor of the banner of praise, the most praiseworthy station (almaqaam-ul-mahmood) and the flowing Fountain (Al-Hawd). He is the leader (Imaam) of the prophets, their spokesman and the one who holds their intercession. His (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) nation is the best of nations and his Companions are the best of those who accompanied prophets, may the peace of Allaah be upon them. The best of the Prophet&#8217;s ummah was Abu Bakr As-Siddeeq, then &#8216;Umar Al-Faarooq, then &#8216;Uthmaan Dhun-Noorain, and then &#8216;Alee Al-Murtadaa. May Allaah be pleased with all of them. This is due to what has been reported on &#8216;Abdullaah bin &#8216;Umar that he said: “We used to say, while the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) was alive: ‘The best of this nation, after its Prophet, is Abu Bakr, then ‘Umar, then &#8216;Uthmaan, then &#8216;Alee.’ This would reach the Prophet and he would not oppose it.” [23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is authentically reported on &#8216;Alee that he said: “The best of this nation after its Prophet is Abu Bakr, then &#8216;Umar. And if I wanted to, I would have named the third.” [24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Ad-Dardaa reported that the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “The sun does not rise nor does it set upon anyone better, after the prophets and the messengers, than Abu Bakr.” [25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Abu Bakr) was the most deserving of the Khilaafah from all of the creation, after the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), due to his merits, his precedence, and also due to the Prophet&#8217;s preference of him to lead the prayer over all of his Companions, may Allaah be pleased with them. It is also due to the unity in agreement of the Companions upon his precedence and giving the oath of allegiance to him. And Allaah would not have united them in agreement upon something erroneous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then after him was ‘Umar, due to his merits and Abu Bakr&#8217;s empowering it to him. Then ‘Uthmaan due to the preference of him by the members of the governing council. Then &#8216;Alee due to his merits and the unanimous agreement of the people of his time on it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the rightly guided Khaleefahs. They are the ones about whom the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Stick to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly-guided Khaleefahs (who will come) after me. Bite onto it (the Sunnah) with your molar teeth.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “The Khilaafah after me will endure for thirty years.” [26] The last part of it occurred with the Khilaafah of ‘Alee, may Allaah be pleased with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We bear witness that the ten (individuals) will be in Paradise, just as the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) bore witness to it, when he said: “Abu Bakr is in Paradise. &#8216;Umar is in Paradise. &#8216;Uthmaan is in Paradise. &#8216;Alee is in Paradise. Talha is in Paradise. Az-Zubair is in Paradise. Sa&#8217;ad is in Paradise. Sa&#8217;eed is in Paradise. &#8216;Abd-ur-Rahmaan bin &#8216;Awf is in Paradise. Abu &#8216;Ubaydah Ibn AlJarraah is in Paradise.” As for everyone else whom the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) has testified will be in Paradise, then we bear witness to that (as well). This is reflected in his statement: “Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn are the (two) leaders of the youth in Paradise.”[27] And his statement to Thaabit bin Qays: “Indeed, he (Thaabit) is from the inhabitants of Paradise.” [28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We do not ascertain for anyone from the people of the Qiblah (i.e. Muslims) that he will be in Paradise or the Hellfire, except for he whom the Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) has ascertained it for. However, we wish well for the good-doer and we fear for the evildoer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We do not declare anyone from the people of our Qiblah (Muslims) a disbeliever due to a sin nor do we cast him out of the fold of Islaam based on a deed. We hold that Hajj and Jihaad are everlasting along with the obedience to every leader, whether he is righteous or evil. In addition, praying behind them (in congregation) is permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) reported that the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Three things are from the essence of Eemaan: Refraining from (harming) anyone who says: &#8216;Laa Ilaaha Illaa Allaah&#8217;. We do not declare him a disbeliever due to a sin (he may have committed) nor do we cast him out of Islaam due to an action. The Jihaad is everlasting from the time that Allaah sent me to the time when the last part of my ummah fights the Dajjaal. Neither the oppression of a tyrant nor the justice of a righteous leader nullifies it. And (the third is) the belief in Al-Qadar (Divine Preordainment).” Abu Dawood reported it. [29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the Sunnah is: Loyalty to the Sahaabah, love for them, mentioning their good qualities, and asking Allaah to grant them mercy and to forgive them. And (also) refraining from mentioning their bad qualities and what they differed in, believing in their virtues and acknowledging their superiority. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And those who came after them say: ‘Our Lord! Forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in Faith. And put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed.’” [Surah Al-Hashr (59): 10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah. And those who are with him are severe against the disbelievers, while being merciful among themselves.” [Surah Al-Fath (48): 29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Do not revile my Companions, for indeed if one of you were to give in charity, the equivalent of mount Uhud in gold, it would not reach a mudd (handful) of one of them, nor even half of it.” [30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the Sunnah is: Being content with the wives of Allaah’s Messenger, the Mothers of the Believers, and the pure ones free from every type of evil. The best of them were Khadeejah Bint Khuwailid and &#8216;Aa&#8217;isha Bint As-Siddeeq, whom Allaah absolved from guilt in His Book. She is the wife of the Prophet in this world and the next. Whosoever discards her from what Allaah has absolved her from, has disbelieved in Allaah, the Most Great.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mu&#8217;awiyah is the (maternal) Uncle of the Believers and one of those who wrote down the revelation of Allaah. He was one of the Khaleefahs of the Muslims, may Allaah be pleased with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the Sunnah is: Hearing and obeying the Muslim leaders and the Khaleefahs (Ameer-ul-Mu&#8217;mineen), the righteous from among them as well as the evil. This is so long as they do not command us with disobedience to Allaah, for indeed, there is no obedience to anyone if it involves disobedience to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory to obey: Whoever is given the Khilaafah while the people agree and are pleased with him, as well as (to obey) the one who fought against the people till he became the Khaleefah and was proclaimed “Ameer-ul-Mu&#8217;mineen.” Opposing him, revolting against him and sowing the seeds of dissension amongst the Muslims against him is forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the Sunnah is: Making Hijrah from (i.e. Boycotting) the People of Innovations and separating oneself from them, abandoning arguing and disputing in the Religion, not looking into the books of the innovators and giving attention to their speech. And every newly invented matter in the Religion is an innovation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who attributes himself with something other than Islaam and the Sunnah is an innovator, such as the Raafidah, the Jahmiyyah, the Khawaarij, the Qadariyyah, the Murji&#8217;ah, the Mu&#8217;atazilah, the Karaamiyyah, the Kilaabiyyah and those similar to them. These are sects of misguidance and groups of innovation. May Allaah grant us refuge from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In respect to an Imaam, concerning the (differing in the) subsidiary issues of the Religion, such as the four madhaahib (schools of thought), then it is not blameworthy. For indeed, differing in the subsidiary issues of the Religion is a mercy and those who differ in it are praiseworthy in their differing, and will be rewarded for their Ijtihaad. Their differing is a vast mercy and their agreement is a conclusive evidence. We ask Allaah that He protect us from innovations and fitnah and that He cause us to live upon Islaam and the Sunnah. And (we ask) that He make us from among those who follow the Messenger of Allaah when alive, and that He resurrect us in his company after death, by His Mercy and His Grace, Ameen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the last of the Creed – all praise is due to Allaah, alone. And may Allaah send His peace and blessings upon our leader Muhammad, his family and his Companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] An authentic hadeeth transmitted by Ahmad in his Musnad (4/126-127), Abu Dawood in his Sunan: Book of Adhering to the Sunnah (no. 4607) and At-Tirmidhee in his Sunan: Book of Knowledge (no. 2676). Ibn Maajah reported it in the introduction to his Sunan (no. 42 &amp; 43) as did Ad-Daarimee in his Sunan (1/44) and Ibn Hibbaan (no. 102 of Al-Mawaarid). Al-Haakim (1/97), Ibn Abee &#8216;Aasim in As-Sunnah (pg. 17, no. 20,29 &amp; 30), AlBayhaqee in Dalaa&#8217;il-un-Nubuwah (6/541) and Ibn &#8216;Abd-il-Barr in Jaami&#8217; Bayaan-il-&#8216;Ilm wa Fadlihi (1/222) also reported it. Al-Albaanee authenticated it in Saheeh Al-Jaami&#8217;-us-Sagheer (2/346) as well as his takhreej (checking) of As-Sunnah by Ibn Abee &#8216;Aasim (pg. 29-30).</p>

Al-Albaanee declared it weak in AdDa&#8217;eefah (no. 2426). Allaah’s Attribute of Amazement is still affirmed by the hadeeth reported in Saheeh AlBukhaaree (no. 4889) from Abu Hurairah about the guest. The Prophet said: &#8220;Allaah was indeed amazed at – or He laughed at – this man and this woman (who did a good deed by providing food for the Prophet&#8217;s guest).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] A weak hadeeth reported by Ahmad (1/206-207), Abu Dawood (4723), At-Tirmidhee (3320), Ibn Maajah (193) and many others. Al-Albaanee graded it da&#8217;eef in his checking of As-Sunnah by Ibn Abee &#8216;Aasim (no. 577) as did Al-Arna&#8217;oot in his notes to Al-&#8216;Aqeedat-ut-Tahaawiyyah (2/365).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] An authentic hadeeth reported on Ibn Mas’ood in mawqoof form (as his saying), as well as in marfoo’ form (as a saying of the Prophet) in Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, At-Tawheed of Ibn Khuzaimah and Sunan Abee Dawood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] A good (hasan) hadeeth reported by Al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh (1/173), (13/453) and in his book Al-Adab-ulMufrad (970). The hadeeth was also reported by Ahmad in his Musnad (3/495), Al-Bayhaqee in Al-Asmaa wasSifaat (pg. 78-79), Ibn Abee ‘Aasim in As-Sunnah (pg. 514) and Al-Haakim in Al-Mustadrak (2/437/574-575) who authenticated it, and Adh-Dhahabee agreed. Al-Albaanee said in his checking to As-Sunnah (514): “It is an authentic hadeeth.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12] A very weak hadeeth reported by At-Tabaraanee in Al-Awsat as is stated in Majma&#8217;-uz-Zawaa&#8217;id (7/163) on the authority of Ibn Mas&#8217;ood who said: “The Messenger of Allaah said: ‘Recite the Qur&#8217;aan pronouncing it properly (with &#8216;Iraab), for indeed whoever recites the Qur&#8217;aan and pronounces it properly will have ten good deeds. And ten evil deeds of his will be expiated and he will be raised ten levels.’” Al-Haythamee said of it: “In its chain is Nuhshal and he is rejected (matrook).” Nuhshal is Ibn Sa&#8217;eed bin Wardaan Al-Wardaanee. Ishaaq Ibn Raahawaih declared him a liar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] An authentic hadeeth reported by Ahmad (5/338), Abu Dawood (831) and Ibn Hibbaan (1876 of Al-Mawaarid). Its chain of narration is saheeh as has been stated by Al-Albaanee in As-Saheehah (259). Ibn Qudaamah also mentioned the hadeeth in Al-Burhaan (pg. 35-36) from the report of Sahl bin Sa&#8217;ad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14] This is an extremely weak narration reported by Ibn Al-Anbaaree in Al-Waqf wal-Ibtidaa (1/20) with the wording: &#8220;Some &#8216;Iraab (pronouncing properly) of the Qur&#8217;aan is more pleasing to us than memorizing some of its letters.&#8221; Its chain is da&#8217;eef jiddan (very weak) for there is weakness and a break in its chain, according to Badr AlBadr&#8217;s notes to Lumu&#8217;at-ul-&#8216;Itiqaad (19).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[18] The chain of this hadeeth is weak. It is reported by Al-Haakim in Ma’arifatu ‘Uloom-il-Hadeeth (31-32) and from that path of narration, by Al-‘Iraaqee in his Sharh of Al-Ulfiyyah (pg. 327), from the path of Yazeed ArRaqaashee on the authority of Anas bin Maalik.</p>

And in another wording found in AlBukhaaree (no. 3697), it states: “During the lifetime of the Prophet, we used to not put anyone equal to Abu Bakr, then (the same was with) ‘Umar, then (the same was with) ‘Uthmaan. Then we left the (remaining) Companions of the Prophet alone, not distinguishing between any of them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[24] An authentic narration reported by Ahmad in his Musnad (1/106 &amp; 110) and his son ‘Abdullaah in his Zawaa’id (1/10620110 &amp; 127).

Refer to Al-Albaanee’s As-Saheehah (459) for a tremendous discussion on it as well as a refutation against those who claim it to be da’eef.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[27] Al-Albaanee authenticated it in As-Saheehah (796), saying: &#8220;For the most part, the hadeeth is authentic, without any doubt about it. Rather, it is mutawaatir as has been stated by Al-Manaawee.&#8221;</p>

PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p><strong>About the Book: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a complete translation of the booklet Fusool fis-Siyaam war-Taraweeh waz-Zakaat (Lessons on Fasting, Taraaweeh and Zakaat) written by Imaam Muhammad bin Saalih Al Uthaimeen, may Allaah have mercy on him. The source used for this on-line publication was the version of the book available on binothaimeen.org.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this treatise, Imaam Ibn Al-Uthaimeen discusses various topics concerning Ramadaan, such as fasting, the Taraaweeh prayer and Zakaat-ul-Fitr. He also includes two sections on Zakaat and those who are entitled to receive it since it is the custom of many people to give out their yearly Zakaat during this blessed month of Ramadaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author presents the material broken down into eight short lessons, including proofs and evidences for his points. At times, he goes into detail regarding some issues and gives the correct scholarly opinion with regard to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We hope that this treatise can benefit the English speaking Muslims as we are now well into the month of Ramadaan for this year.</p>

TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p><strong>About the Book: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allaah, before you is a complete translation of the booklet &#8220;<strong>Qiyaamu Ramadaan</strong>&#8221; (The Night Prayer in Ramadaan) of Imaam Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee, may Allaah have mercy on him. The source used for this translation was the seventh edition of this book published by Dar Ibn Harm in 1997. This shows the tremendous benefit of this book and the great effect it had on the Muslim ummah, such that it underwent several printings and was spread throughout the Muslim lands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The treatise was revised and updated after its initial printing. Thus the second edition contains more updated information and reference, and all subsequent editions maintained the same format as the second edition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The book&#8217;s introduction consists of a counter-refutation of those who replied to Al-Albaanee&#8217;s book <strong>Salaat at-Taraaweeh</strong>, namely Shaikh &#8216;Abdullaah AI-Ansaaree. But the main core of the book contains a point-by-point discussion on the Night Prayer during Ramadaan, as well as the benefits and rulings of itikaaf. This books serves as an abridgement to Imam Al-Albaanee&#8217;s larger treatise Salaat at-Taraaweeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/the-night-prayer-in-ramadhan-shaykh-al-albanee-al-ibaanah-com.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>Download the PDF eBook Here</strong></a>]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Imaam Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdil-Wahhaab<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of the beneficial treatise of Imaam Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab, “<i>Shuroot as-Salaat wa Arkaanuhaa wa Waajibaatuhaa.</i>” <b>[The Conditions, Pillars and Requirements of the Prayer]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this short treatise, Imaam Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab, may Allaah have mercy on him, briefly outlines the nine conditions for the acceptance of one’s prayer, as well as the fourteen pillars and eight requirements of the prayer, mentioning some of their proofs and evidences from the Book and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A condition is something that is required before the commencement of prayer in order for it to be valid. “The pillars are that which if one fails to perform any of them out of forgetfulness or intentionally, his prayer is rendered invalid because of his abandoning it. The requirements are that which if one fails to perform any of them intentionally, his prayer is rendered invalid due to his abandoning it, but if he leaves any of them due to forgetfulness, he is obligated to perform the (extra) prostrations for forgetfulness.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author also lists the conditions, obligations, requirements and nullifiers of <i>wudoo</i> (ablution). The translator has provided a quick reference guide as an appendix listing each of these points, as well as footnotes with hadeeth references and other comments gathered from several sources of this treatise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The things that nullify (<i>nawaaqid</i>) the ablution are eight: (1) Whatever comes out from the two private parts; (2) Any foul impure substance that comes out from the body; (3) Loss of consciousness (i.e. sleep/insanity); (4) Touching a woman with sexual desire; (5) Touching one’s private part with the hand, whether it is the frontal or rear (private part); (6) Eating the meat of camels; (7) Bathing a deceased person; and (8) Apostating from Islaam, may Allaah protect us from that!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The pillars of the prayer are fourteen: (1) Standing, if one has the ability to do so; (2) The opening Takbeer; (3) Reciting Surah Al-Faatihah; (4) Bowing; (5) Rising from Bowing; (6) Prostrating on all seven limbs; (7) Erecting oneself from it; (8) Sitting between the two prostrations; (9) Remaining tranquil (i.e. not rushing) during all of these pillars; (10) Maintaining the same sequence; (11) the Final Tashahhud; (12) Sitting for it; (13) Sending Salaat on the Prophet; and (14) the (final) two Tasleems.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AUTHOR: Naasir bin Hamad Al-Fahad<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a small booklet titled: <b><i>“Al-Qaradaawee fil-Meezaan”</i></b><i></i> [Al-Qaradaawee on the Scales] compiled and prepared by Naasir bin Hamad Al-Fahd and published by Maktabah Asad as-Sunnah, Egypt (2nd Edition).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This small pamphlet provides a glimpse into some of the peculiar and strange opinions of the well known Dr. Yoosuf Al-Qaradaawee so that the Muslims could be aware of his reality. If it were not for his widespread fame throughout the Muslim and non-Muslim lands, there would be no need for treatises such as this, let alone detailed books, which have also been authored about him by various authors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, for the sake of advising the Muslims and warning them from the dangerous views and philosophy of this individual, these books and treatises were written – this pamphlet being one of the smaller abridged ones. This e-book is in no way meant to be a definitive source or a comprehensive refutation. Rather, the main goal intended here is to provide the readers with a glimpse of some of Al-Qaradaawee’s outlandish views and statements, which prove his remoteness from knowledge and the way of the true scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah to make this treatise a source of guidance for the Muslims and a means for them to avoid deviation and misguidance and all those who call to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Excerpts from the Book: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“He said about the Christians: ‘All of the issues that exist between us are common. We are all sons of one country – our destiny is one…our nation is one…I say about them that they are our Christian brothers…but some people condemn me for this…How can I say that they are our Christian brothers when Allaah says: <b>‘Verily the believers are only brothers?’</b>…yes, we are believers but they too are believers from another perspective.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“As for the Raafidah, who inherited the beliefs of the Mu’tazilah and added more grotesque and bizarre views to it of which the least of them is enough to associate them with the likes of Abu Jahl, then you find him defending them and fraternizing with them. In fact, he even regards inciting any conflicts with them as an act of treachery against the ummah. And he considers their cursing of the Companions, their distortion of the Qur’aan, their beliefs that their Imaams are infallible, and their pilgrimage to the gravesites among other things as ‘marginal oppositions to Creed.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said in quote: ‘Unfortunately, I am in my seventies and I go to America to participate in Islamic conferences, but the lectures in these conferences are held with the women on one side and the men on another side. So sternness has overcome the organizations there and they have forced customs on the western community itself to the point that they have followed the stricter views whilst abandoning the more favorable views. So this has resulted in men having their own gathering place apart from the gathering place of women.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“You will find that the elder figures and prominent members of the Ikhwan-ul-Muslimoon group do not allow one single hair to grow on their faces. And this is even though everyone knows that this person is from the Ikhwan-ul-Muslimeen – I mean by this (especially) the national security forces. So therefore, the issue (of shaving) is not that of someone who is fearful and afraid of being targeted, rather it is a matter of flattering the secular community and presenting the Ikhwani version of Islamic moderation!!! Did you not see their most recent caller, ‘Amr Khaalid, and how he always appears clean-shaven, charming the crowds and demolishing what Ahlus-Sunnah have built, since when confronting the low ones among them, they are faced with the argument: ‘Are you better than ‘Amr Khaalid?!’ As for those from the Ikhwan-ul-Muslimoon that do grow a beard, then it is only a light circular set of hairs around the face – the trademark of the Ikhwan and the practice of Hasan Al-Bannaa, not that of the Prophet! [Written by the Publisher]”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">In this treatise, the author briefly touches upon the definition, history, and characteristics of the Khawaarij, one of the first and most dangerous sects in Islamic history whose effects and ideologies continue to exist up to today and will remain until the Final Hour. The majority of the treatise is dedicated to outlining the major and distinguishing attributes of the Khawaarij, which the author counts at 58.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is important to study and be aware of these attributes so that one may avoid characterizing himself with them and thus fall into the ranks of the Khawaarij. This is from the perspective of learning evil in order to avoid it. And it is also beneficial since today, the ways and ideologies of the Khawaarij are prevalent, as can be seen in terrorist acts, suicide missions, assassinations and political strife. So by understanding the characteristics of the Khawaarij, the reader will be able to identify the perpetrators of such crimes, acknowledge their remoteness from Islaam and the fact that they are indeed from the extremist Khawaarij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Excerpts from the Book: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The word <i>Khawaarij </i>is the plural of <i>Khaarijee</i>, and that refers to a person that removes himself from the obedience of the true ruler, outwardly proclaims opposition to him and incites the people against him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“If someone (1) outwardly proclaims rebellion against the Muslim rulers or (2) holds Muslims to be disbelievers due to major sins, apart from Shirk, or (3) justifies the views of the Khawaarij and considers it permissible to shed the blood of Muslims in the name of Jihaad in the Way of Allaah and in the name of changing an evil, then these are all factors for identifying the Khawaarij.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“‘Alee tried to convince ‘Aa’ishah, Talhah and Az-Zubair of the pressing importance of first declaring allegiance to the ruler and then to seek retribution for the murder of ‘Uthmaan. The matter finally became resolved in their mutual agreement to that. However, on the following day, the callers to mischief mobilized their forces and began skirmishes and clashes on both sides. So the peace-makers from both groups thought that the other group had deceived the other, and fighting broke out. The battle that ensued, which later came to be known as the Battle of the Camel, ended with the death of Talhah, Az-Zubair and ten-thousand members from each group.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<b>The Fifteenth Characteristic: </b>They go to extremes in worship. So they perform acts of worship to the extent that those who see them become amazed with them and they become amazed with themselves. [<i>As-Sunnah </i>of Ibn Abee ‘Aasim (no. 945) from the hadeeth of Anas bin Maalik] Ibn ‘Abbaas said: ‘And I have not seen a people that are stricter in their exertion (of worship) than them. Their hands are like the calluses of camels and their foreheads are marked due to the traces of prostration.’ [<i>Majma’-uz-Zawaa’id </i>(6/240)]”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Imaam Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi&#8217;ee<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of the small treatise titled <b><i>“Hiwaar ma’a Jamaa’at at-Takfeer”</i></b> (A Debate with the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer) by Imaam Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi’ee, may Allaah have mercy on him. The source used for this e-book was the treatise that is found within Imaam Muqbil’s book Fadaa’ih wa Nasaa’ih (pg. 168-186) [Dar-ul-Haramain: 1st Edition; 1999]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this treatise, Imaam Muqbil refutes the false concepts of the Takfeeri Jamaa’at, a group that was founded in Egypt by a man named Shukree Mustafaa, and which later spread to other Muslim countries. Their beliefs revolve around declaring Muslims to be disbelievers, hence the name Jamaa’at at-Takfeer, declaring the leaders infidels and actively calling the people to revolt against the Muslim governments and anyone that supports them. Even though Mustafaa was executed in 1978, the false concepts of his group have still managed to creep into the hearts of many Muslims today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This treatise is especially important, since it deals with the beliefs of those who in recent times call to rebellion, revolution, terrorism and those who seek to spread instability in the Muslim lands as well as throughout the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The best remedy for them is to seek knowledge. As for one of them remaining ignorant and not knowing anything about the Arabic language, and then he says: ‘We are men and the Companions are (also) men’, then yes, you are men and the Companions, too, are men. However, the difference between you and the Companions is like the difference between the heavens and the earth.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Who is it that the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer preys on? They prey on those individuals who have enthusiasm and zeal for their Religion based on ignorance. The founder of the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer, which has appeared during these recent times, was Shukree Mustafaa Al-Misree, who used to be part of the Bankrupt Brotherhood (Ikhwaan-ul-Muslimeen). Then he experienced great trials in prison and was hardened along with a group of individuals. The governments (at that time) strove hard to disunite the Muslims. So this group would call themselves the Jamaa’at-ul-Hijrah (The Party of Withdrawal). This Shukree Mustafaa used to have some knowledge and he would challenge the faculty of the Azhar University to debate with him, but the Azharees would be afraid due to two reasons: <b>First:</b> All that many of them had to offer was a scanty portion of knowledge of Hadeeth and knowledge of the Book and the Sunnah. So they were either only strong in their knowledge of Grammar or their knowledge of Fiqh. <b>Second:</b> They feared that if they beat him, he and his group (Jamaa’at) would come to them at night and kill them. As a result of this, the group grew and spread. So it originated in the Jamaal ‘Abdun-Naasir Prison and then spread to Sudan and to the lands of the Sacred Precincts (Makkah and Madeenah), inconspicuously, and to Yemen, openly. Jamaa’at Ansaar-us-Sunnah rose against them in Sudan after we said that there were some individuals from the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer amongst them. So they feared that people would hear this speech and therefore not support them anymore.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So the one who these Takfeeris prey on is the individual who has lots of zeal for the Religion based on ignorance. I challenge all of them – the Egyptians, Sudanese, Yemenis, Kuwaitis and Algerians among them to bring forth one scholar from amongst them. And they claim that they strive hard to have a scholar amongst their ranks! We seek refuge in Allaah from any scholar agreeing with your Da’wah, for he would then be one of the dogs of the Hellfire on the Day of Judgement, and he would shoot out from the Religion just as an arrow shoots out from the hunted game.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is how Ahlus-Sunnah is, may Allaah preserve them – they are the ones who confront the people of falsehood, such as the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer. Don’t think that I am condoning the other groups, for I consider them to be the product of ignorance and calamities caused by the enemies of Islaam in order to split up the ranks of the Muslims. So I say to the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer: You must repent to Allaah and ask the people of knowledge (when you are unaware of matters), as Allaah says in His Noble Book: <b>‘So ask the People of the Reminder if you don’t know.’</b> [Surah An-Nahl: 43] This is since if you were to ask one of them what’s your proof on raising the hands in prayer, you would find him saying: ‘I don’t know.’ Or if you were to ask him what’s your proof for prostrating on the seven limbs, he would reply: ‘I don’t know.’ But yet after all that, he puts himself in charge of declaring Muslims to be disbelievers! So take things easy, you small ignoramus! How can you put yourself in charge of declaring Muslims to be disbelievers?? By doing this, you would be assisting the Communists, the Ba’athees, the Naasirees and the governments, rather, the enemies of Islaam, in splitting up the ranks of the Muslims. Then you would just dwindle away (and be forgotten) like Shabeeb, Naafi’ bin al-Araq, ‘Imraan bin Hattaan and other heads of the Khawaarij. So the ignorant ones melt way, but the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger remains and continues.”</p>

<p>About the Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a traanslation of the small booklet Radd-al-Jawaab alaa man Talaba Minnee &#8216;Adam Taba&#8217;il-Kitaab (Returning a Reply to the one who Requested me not to Print my Book) by Shaikh Ahmad bin Yahyaa An-Najmes, may Allaah preserve him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The original source for this booklet was a letter Shaikh Ahmad An-Najmee sent to <strong>Shaikh &#8216;Abdullaah bin Jibreen</strong> in response to a letter he received from the latter requesting him not to print his book Mawrid-ul-Adhb az-Zulaal, which is a valuable work consisting of about 300 pages and provides an in-depth analysis and refutation of the deviant groups, <strong>Jamaaat at-Tableegh</strong> and <strong>Ikhwaan-ul-Muslimoon</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This magnificent book was published in 1418H with forewords from <strong>Shaikh Saalih al-Fawzaan</strong> and <strong>Shaikh Rabee</strong>&#8216; bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee. The letter was also later published and distributed, in order to refute those who misuse Shaikh Ibn Jibreen&#8217;s erroneous  stances regarding <strong>Hasan Al-Bannaa</strong> and the <strong>Ikhwaan-ul-Muslimoon</strong> as a means to attack the Salafi Da&#8217;wah and create disunity amongst its ranks. May Allaah reward Shaikh Ahmad An-Najmee for the sincere advise, valuable work and exposition of the deviations of Hasan Al-Bannaa that he produces in this treatise.</p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Read the Book Below:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Returning a Reply</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, Bestower of Mercy</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ahmad bin Yahyaa An-Najmee to my brother and loved one for the sake of Allaah, a member of the Committee of Religious Verdicts (Daar-ul-Iftaa), Shaikh ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Jibreen:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Salaamu ‘Alaykum wa Rahmatullaahi wa Barakaatuh. To Proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I am in receipt of your kind letter written on 4/11/1418H as well as your valuable gift, which was copies of your precious books, may Allaah reward you with good, bless you, guide you and me and protect you and me from the evils of our souls. And since I am thanking you for the gift, I also thank you for your advice and for your openness, if only they were put in their proper place, since a Muslim is only obligated to accept the advice if that person’s advice implicates an incorrect understanding or an erroneous statement. So I apologize and ask your forgiveness beforehand if I state something in this discussion that you may interpret as being or having in it that which hurts your feelings. So I say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You stated in your letter concerning my book <em>“The Pure and Pleasant Spring containing criticisms of the beliefs and actions of some of the Methodologies used in Da’wah”</em>:[1] “I was delighted by this splendid title … (up to where you said) … but when I reached the ninth chapter, I encountered that which I didn’t expect…” I felt saddened upon reading your letter that such a thing would emanate from the likes of someone with your standing, in terms of knowledge and status. Why did you not continue reading it in order to find out if what I had written in it was the truth or falsehood? So if it were true you would then support it, acting on the statement of the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), the prophet of guidance and the messenger of mercy, when he said: “Assist your brother whether he is oppressing or being oppressed.” It was said: “A person can help him if he is oppressed but how can he assist him if he is oppressing others?” He (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Impede him or prevent him from oppressing (others).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if what I had written in it were false, you would then assist me by clarifying the truth to me with proofs and evidences. And I would have been ready to accept that from you and to thank you and supplicate for you, because you would have saved me from a sin and a wrong that I would have fallen into. But this is on the condition that this criticism would be detailed with clear proofs and decisive evidences, which would clarify to me my error. But as for you reaching the ninth chapter and then abandoning reading the rest of it and thereafter launching an all-out attack without proofs, then I can never accept this from you or agree with you on it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for your saying that the title pleased you and that you decided to read the whole book, stating: “I was delighted by this splendid title such that I set out to read the entire book. However, in the beginning of it, I found beneficial subjects regarding Calling to Tawheed and the methodologies employed in Da’wah. But when I reached the ninth chapter, I encountered that which I didn’t expect from the likes of you, such as <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>attacks on the personality of Hasan Al-Bannaa</strong></span>. And you unleashed great anger against him”, then I say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: Allaah, the All-Knower of what is seen and unseen, knows that I did not intend to attack the honor of anyone, not Hasan Al-Bannaa or anyone else. This is especially since I know that on the Day of Judgement people’s rights will be recompensed with the taking of good deeds (from others’ scales) and the giving of bad deeds (to others’ scales).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: You know that mentioning the bad qualities a person has in him is permissible if it is done for a beneficial reason, and this is from the allowable forms of backbiting. The proof for this is what the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) told Faatimah bint Qays when she came to him seeking advice on who to marry. He (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “As for Mu’aawiyah, then he is utterly broke, he has no money. And as for Abu Jahm, then he beats his wives. Instead, marry Usaamah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) consented with Hind bint ‘Utbah’s statement concerning (her husband) Abu Sufyaan that he was: “A stingy man who doesn’t give me enough money for me and my children.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said concerning a man who sought permission to enter his home: “What an evil brother of his family he is.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: You also know that the Scholars of Hadeeth spoke against those narrators who had in them that which necessitated that their reports be rejected and declared weak. So they issued such statements as: “So and so is a liar”, “So and so is a fabricator”, “He narrates from reliable reporters that which is not found in their narrations”, “So and so has weak memory”, “So and so make many errors”, and “So and so is heedless.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They did this out of sincerity to Allaah, His Messenger and the Muslims, and in order to defend the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger from having what isn’t part of it enter into it. This was such that when it was said to one of these scholars: “What will you do when these people – meaning those whom he spoke against and criticized – come to you on the Day of Judgement disputing with you (i.e. seeking their right)?” He responded: “That all of these people be my opponents (on the Day of Judgement) is more beloved to me than that the Messenger of Allaah be my opponent on the Day of Judgement.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So because of this, they spoke out against the criticized narrators without any hesitancy and they considered that as being the best of their deeds, which they hoped would be stored for them and wished would be rewarded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth</strong>: You stated in your book “The Lone (Ahaad) Reports in the Prophetic Hadeeth” in the fifth chapter on “Efforts of the Scholars in Preserving the Hadeeth” (pg. 30), and you were correct in what you said that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“2. Investigating the Conditions of the Reporters and Researching their Status in Hadeeth and their Qualification for conveying it: They took it upon themselves to speak out against them, from the aspect of sincerity to the ummah, since they were entrusted for conveying something from the affairs of the Religion that had a ruling in it. And they distinguished this aspect as being separate from the general forbiddance of backbiting, due to what it contained from overall benefit to the ummah.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the view of all of the people of knowledge from the scholars of Fiqh and Hadeeth, without exception, may Allaah reward them with good. You will see in what follows that I only spoke against Hasan Al-Bannaa and those who follow his group in order to sincerely advise the ummah. And I am not praising myself, as Allaah knows all that we conceal and reveal and nothing is hidden from Him whether it is in the the heavens or the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifth</strong>: Please think, what is the reason that caused me to speak against this man who died while I was still in my adolescence? [2] He didn’t shed any of my blood or destroy my honor, nor did he take any of my wealth. So what is it that caused me to speak out against him when he didn’t transgress against me personally in any way? If I had spoken against him without him having previously oppressed me or not due to some religious benefit, just speaking against him for the sake of it, then I would be an oppressor and a transgressor and Allaah would take his right from me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sixth</strong>: We are afflicted in this time of ours with methodologies of Da’wah that have come to us from abroad,[3] which turn the eyes away from Major Shirk and allow it to spread. The greatest of these in terms of self-corruption and corrupting of others is the methodology of the Ikhwaan-ul-Muslimeen for it indeed brainwashes the minds of the youth who are raised upon its way, transforming them into revolutionists, takfeeris, terrorists and khawaarij. The proofs for this are many, the most significant of them being the own acknowledgement of this by those who bombed the upper part of Riyadh – ‘Abdul-‘Azeez ‘Athaam and his cohorts. So this is what caused me to write about him (i.e. Hasan Al-Bannaa) and his group, before the story of this bombing occurred.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Seventh</strong>: Concerning your saying that when you reached the ninth chapter, you encountered that which you didn’t expect from me, such as attacking the personality of Hasan Al-Bannaa, and that I unleashed great anger against him and that I took his words to mean what he didn’t intend, my response to this is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you had read the entire book with impartiality, you would have known that I made clear what this methodology and its founder have in them from opposition to the Islamic Legislation and the Creed of the Salaf. He is the one, according to his own brother’s acknowledgement, who would boastfully say, and this is widely circulated in the books of his party:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah raised and scattered (all) the existence and what it contains<br />
So if you desire to attain His perfection<br />
Then everything in the universe if you realize it<br />
is non-existent, specifically and generally.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if you think that I understood from his words that which he didn’t intend, then please interpret for me what this statement of his contains religiously and intellectually, other than wahdat-ul-wujood.[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And Secondly:</strong> He is the one who would recite the following poetry: “May the Divine (Allaah) bless the light (i.e. Muhammad) that appeared to the creation and so he surpassed the (light of the) sun and the moon This beloved one (i.e. Muhammad) along with his loved ones has attended And pardoned everyone of what they did and will do (of sins).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Interpret these verses with an interpretation that this wording contains other than that of Major Shirk, as in his statement “And pardoned everyone of what they did and will do (of sins)” and other than that of a lie against Allaah’s Messenger, as in his statement: “This beloved one (i.e. Muhammad) along with his loved ones has attended”, as well as what these words contain from affirming the lies of the Sufis who say that the Prophet attends their innovated gathering, which is nothing else but the celebration of the Prophet’s Birthday.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: Explain to me his praise for Al-Mirghanee, who was well known for wahdat-ulwujood with an explanation that would please Allaah and His Messenger and then the believers other than that he was pleased with wahdat-ul-wujood and praised those who held that view.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth</strong>: Explain to me the statement he made to the Associated Press: “There is no religious enmity between us and the Jews” with an explanation pleasing to Allaah and His Messenger and then the believers other than the fact that he was flattering the Jews and Christians by lying on Allaah, His Messenger and the Religion of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifth</strong>: Explain to me why he attended the gravesite of Sayyida Zaynab (radyAllaahu ‘anhaa) on the occasion of the yearly migration, and why he didn’t mention the Shirk that occurred there nor forbid it, even though he saw people making Tawaaf around the grave and asking the one buried in it requests that only should be made to Allaah? Explain that to me in a way that pleases Allaah and His Messenger, and then the believers, other than that it was because he was pleased with Major Shirk and that he permitted it with himself and in his methodology.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sixth</strong>: Explain to me why he would walk to the graves of Ad-Dasooqee and Sinjar on foot, 20 kilometers going and (another) 20 kilometers returning, with an explanation pleasing to Allaah and His Messenger and then to the believers other than that it was because he was either performing a polytheistic form of visitation or an innovated form of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Seventh</strong>: Explain to me why he strived to unite the Sunnees and the Raafidees with an explanation pleasing to Allaah and His Messenger and then the believers, other than that it was because he was ignorant of what the Raafidah were upon from innovations and deviations or that he was lenient towards them and their deviations and sacrificed the Islamic Creed for the sake of pleasing them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Eighth</strong>: Explain to me how he could combine between opposing factors in the description of his Da’wah (Call), (stating) that it was a “Call to the Salaf, a Path upon the Sunnah and a Sufi Reality.” Is it possible that these opposing factors can be united? Is it possible to unite Sufism and Salafiyyah and to unite Sufism and the Sunnah? Trying to combine between these two is like trying to mix water with fire!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ninth</strong>: Explain to me the ten pillars of his <em>ba’yah</em> (pledge of allegiance) with an explanation pleasing to Allaah and His Messenger and then the believers, other than that he brought a new legislation to the Da’wah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tenth</strong>: Explain to me why he took the <em>bay’ah</em> (pledge of allegiance) from people who <em>bay’ah</em> was binding on other than that it was because he was disobeying Allaah and His Messenger and introducing new laws into Islaam, which neither Allaah nor His Messenger gave permission for.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Eleventh</strong>: Explain to me why he made obedience to him, which he placed as a condition in his <em>bay’ah</em>, as something obligatory to be carried out immediately and without any reservations, even though according to Islaam, obedience is restricted by two things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. It must be with regard to something good, and<br />
2. It is dependent upon one’s ability.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So isn’t this legislating a law into the Religion, which neither Allaah nor His Messenger authorized?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Twelfth</strong>: Explain to me why he limited Islaam to just <span style="color:#993300;">twenty principles</span> or why he gave these principles the ultimate importance with an explanation that Allaah and His Messenger, and then the believers would be pleased with, other than that it was because he introduced a new legislation into Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirteenth</strong>: Explain to me why he said <em>Tafweed</em> was the madh-hab of all of the Salaf without exception, with an explanation pleasing to Allaah and His Messenger and then the believers, other than that it was because he was ignorant of the madh-hab of the Salaf regarding Allaah’s Attributes or because he forged a lie against them stating that the Salaf would believe in the meaning (of the Attribute) but return knowledge of how the attribute was to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Lastly</strong>, I say: If you can interpret and explain these statements of his, which I just mentioned, with explanations that do not contradict the Religion and do not leave from the fold of what is contained in the wording, then I rightfully deserve your comment of me understanding from his words that which they don’t contain. And if you are unable to do that, then it becomes clear that you lied on me and slandered me with this statement. And know that I will not seek my right from you, even if your wronging of me becomes manifest, except before Allaah on the Day of Judgement. However I will place between you and I the noble Shaikh, ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin ‘Abdillaah bin Baaz, Chief Muftee of the Kingdom (of Saudi Arabia), head of the Committee of Senior Scholars, and head of the Committee for Religious Research and Verdicts, as well as his deputy, Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin ‘Abdillaah Aali Shaikh, and Shaikh Saalih bin Fawzaan Al-Fawzaan, Shaikh ‘Abdullaah Al-Ghudayyaan and Shaikh Saalih Al-Atram to read the ninth chapter of the book from its beginning to end. So if they find that I have misinterpreted Al-Bannaa’s words in a way that they were not intended then they shall pronounce me guilty, and if they find that the one who stated this wronged me and slandered me with this statement, then they will find him guilty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">As for your statement that I took my anger out on him</span></strong>, then Allaah knows that I didn’t write what I wrote except to clarify the truth and to advise the people. This is what I hope for and I am not praising myself nor am I purifying my soul from sin:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Verily the soul commands to evil except for those whom my Lord has mercy on. Verily, my Lord is Most Forgiving, Bestower of Mercy.”</span> </strong>[Surah Yoosuf: 53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if there was some anger on my part, then Allaah knows that it was only for His sake. This is since, it can hardly be imagined that I would be angry for my own sake towards a man that didn’t oppress me in any way, along with there being great distances and time-spans between him and I. And indeed I ask Allaah, may He be Glorified, to make my deed sincerely for His Face, intending to please Him by it, and to not make any part of it for the sake of anyone from His creatures. Verily, he is the All- Hearer, the One who responds to invocations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>As for your saying that you encountered that which you didn’t expect from me</strong></span>, then did you find that I disobeyed Allaah and His Mesenger and opposed the Religion of Islaam by clarifying the truth that I did? Didn’t Allaah take a covenant from the People of the Scripture that they would convey the truth to the people and not conceal it? Isn’t this covenant that He took binding upon us? Didn’t the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) take this covenant from his Companions when giving the <em>bay’ah</em> (pledge), as is stated in the agreed upon hadeeth of ‘Ubaadah bin Saamit, where he said: “<strong>And (we pledge allegiance to you) that we will speak the truth wherever we may be and not fear the blame of the blamers?</strong>” Doesn’t Allaah curse those who conceal the truth in His Book, as He states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Verily, those who conceal what We have revealed from the clear proofs and the guidance after We clarified it to the people in the Book, they are the ones cursed by Allaah and cursed by the cursers. Except for those who repent, rectify matters and clarify. These people, I will accept their repentance, and I am the Acceptor of Repentance, the Bestower of Mercy?”</span></strong> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 159-160]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Isn’t refuting those who oppose the mandates and laws of the Religion an obligation upon the people of knowledge? So if they fall short of this necessary obligation and someone fulfills this task, the obligation is removed from the rest. And from the rights he has over others is that they should supplicate for success for him and thank him after thanking Allaah in a good and nice manner, and not that he be confronted with accusations and bad thoughts about him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Didn’t the Salaf carry out this order and fulfill this obligation, thus authoring numerous books, the likes of which cannot be counted, refuting the innovators from the time of the Taabi’een to this time of ours, and they still continue to do this?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Didn’t you, O Shaikh, write two books refuting the people of innovation, the first of which is the book “<em>Akhbaar-ul-Aahaad</em>”, in which you refuted the Mu’tazilah and whoever holds their views, and the second of which is your book “<em>Al-Faa’iq fir-Raddi ‘alaa Mubaddil-il-Haqaa’iq</em>?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And, by the One of whom there is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Him, I truly love a man who defends the religion, protecting it and shielding it, and who refutes those who enter into it that which doesn’t belong to it. However, I don’t know why some of the Mashaayikh, may Allaah guide them, have swerved away from the truth, when they know (better), instead rebuking the one who rises to fulfill this obligation, calling him a criminal, transgressor and an oppressor! And yet on the other hand if this evil were to affect anyone else, the world would be in an uproar and huge commotion. But when it affects the Religion, violating it and oppressing its right, the whole world is peaceful and forgiving! Would we be giving justice to the Religion and fulfilling its right this way, or would we be violating it, disregarding it and neglecting its characteristics, especially if what was affected from it was its foundations, principles and fundamentals, such as Tawheed when it is demolished by Major Shirk, and the Sunnah when it is destroyed by innovations, and the truth when it is ruined by falsehood? So at this point, do you hold that we should remain silent? No, by Allaah! Unless some of us rise to fulfill this right, since it is a collective obligation. And as for the one who fulfills this obligation (of refuting innovation), he has a huge reward and a grand recompense with Allaah, the Mist High, the All-Able, as has been stated just now.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">As for your statement that for the past forty years you received news about him from noble scholars</span></strong> such as Shaikh ‘Abdur-Razzaaq ‘Afeefee, Shaikh ‘Abdur- Rahmaan Ad-Dawsiree, Shaikh ‘Abdullaah bin Humaid and Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin Baaz, and that they praised his Da’wah and mentioned his positive effects and they examined news of him, then I say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: As for the Mashaayikh you mentioned, then you probably asked them before they were aware of what is well known today about his condition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: Perhaps during that time news about the outer appearance of his Da’wah reached them. Many people are deceived by the outer appearance of his Da’wah even up to today, because they do not know this (Ikhwaanee) methodology well enough since they didn’t read about it during those times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: If they didn’t say anything against him, then this was because they weren’t aware of any of the mistakes he made. So they had a right to refrain (from speaking against him) if this was the case.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth</strong>: But as for now, then it has been made clear and manifest that there are many errors in his Da’wah. And “The one who preserved it is a proof against the one who didn’t preserve it.” This is a principle that is well known amongst the Muhadditheen, and acting on it with regard to this matter is an obligation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifth</strong>: As for Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin Baaz, who is the only one who remains alive from them,[5] then he knows what they are upon and there is no doubt about this. He responded to a question related to the movement of the Ikhwaan-ul-Muslimeen founded by Hasan Al-Bannaa, in which the questioner said: “Noble Shaikh, the movement of the Ikhwaan-ul-Muslimeen entered the Kingdom (of Saudi Arabia) some time ago, and they became active amongst the students of knowledge. What is your opinion with regard to this movement and to what extent do they comply with the methodology of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He responded by saying: “The movement of Ikhwaan-ul-Muslimeen has been criticized by specialized scholars because they do not have any enthusiasm with regard to calling to the Tawheed of Allaah and rejecting Shirk and rebuking innovations. And they have specific methods, which are made deficient by their lack of efforts to call to Allaah and their lack of guiding towards the correct Creed, which Ahlus-Sunnah wal- Jamaa’ah are upon. So it is upon the Ikhwaan-ul-Muslimeen to give importance to the Salafee Call to the Tawheed of Allaah, and to reject the worship of graves, the devotion to the deceased and the seeking assistance of those buried in the graves such as Husayn or Badawee and so on. This is what I wanted to convey.” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Did you hear, O brother in Islaam, what Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin Baaz said, may Allaah prolong his life? So why won’t you say similar to what he said concerning the Da’wah of the Ikhwaan-ul-Muslimeen and what it contains from oppositions to the methodology of the Salaf as-Saalih. By this, you would be aiding the truth, removing an evil and advising the ummah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">As for your statement that they would mention his positive effects</span></strong>, then if any of the Mashaayikh you mentioned, with the exception of Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin Baaz, stated that he had positive effects, then he has been deceived just like you. However, what seems apparent from your words is that you are convinced that he had positive effects, therefore I must ask you the following questions, which I hope you can answer clearly and truthfully. So I say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Is it from his positive effects that he was silent about the polytheistic worship that the people committed at the gravesites and tombs present in Egypt and that he didn’t forbid it, as if it had been sent down definitively from the heavens in verses recited?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Was from his positive effects the partisanship and division that he left behind amongst the ummah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Is it from his positive effects that he established the Call to the Khilaafah and abandoned the Call to Tawheed, which all the messengers called to?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Is it from his positive effects that he caused the youth to hate the leaders and the scholars and prepared them to overthrow the present (Muslim) countries in order to establish a Khilaafah, which they claim will be opposite to them?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Is it from his positive effects that he brought about the false ascription of faults and blemishes on the leaders and the scholars, which his followers do, claiming afterward that these leaders are not fit for ruling and that the scholars are only flattering them?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. Is it from his positive effects that he transformed the youth and placed them in positions in Da’wah while they were ignorant?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. Is it from his positive effects that he instituted giving bay’ah (pledge of allegiance) to common people whilst abandoning those who rightfully deserve the bay’ah, such as the rulers?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. Is it from his positive effects that he called to the coming together of the Shi’ees and the Sunnees? What is meant by coming together, is that each group should refrain from criticizing any of the beliefs of the other groups, so that the first group can come closer to the second group.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. Is it from his positive effects that he claimed that the Salaf would commit Tafweed, designating the meaning of all of Allaah’s attributes (back to Allaah)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. Is it from his positive effects that he said: “There is no religious enmity between us and the Jews” which means that the Jews are our brothers?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. Is it from his positive effects that he said: “We will work with one another in that which we agree on, and overlook from one another that which we differ on” which means that we should nullify the acts of commanding good and forbidding evil, which Allaah described the believers with, while praising them, in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“You were the best nation brought forth for mankind &#8211; commanding towards good and forbidding from evil and believing in Allaah” [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 110] and other ayaat?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. Is it from his positive effects that he gathered together people whose beliefs differed and whose convictions varied? So this person is a Sunnee and that person is a Shi’ee. This person is a Sufi and that person is a Jahmee. This person is an Ash’aree and that person is a rationalizing Mu’tazilee and so on and so on. And he claimed that they are all brothers because they say Laa Ilaaha IllaaAllaah Muhammad Rasoolullaah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. Is it from his positive effects that he revived innovations, amongst which was the innovation of celebrating the Prophet’s Birthday and his attending a gathering for it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. Is it from his positive effects that he claimed that the Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) attended his gathering, blessed it and forgave the sins of those present?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15. Is it from his positive effects that he was immersed in Sufism, having passion and affection for it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16. Is it from his positive effects that he limited Islaam to twenty principles, making that binding upon his followers?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">17. Is it from his positive effects that he made the conditions of bay’ah ten and that he obligated conditions that are not found in the Book of Allaah or in the Sunnah of His Messenger?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">18. Is it from his positive effects that he made blind obedience a condition for the bay’ah, where he said: “By obedience I mean that the command should be carried out and executed immediately in times of hardship and in times of ease, in things pleasing and in things detested. This is because the levels of this (Ikhwaanee) Da’wah are three…(up to where he said about the second level, which is the level of Formation)…Organizing the da’wah in this level is to be carried out purely in a Sufi way from the spiritual standpoint and militarily from the practical standpoint.” [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hearing and obeying is obligatory to the one in authority. However it is constrained by two restrictions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First: It must be obedience with regard to something good. So there is no obedience to be given if it entails disobedience to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second: It must be in those things that a person is able to do, therefore he is not required to do what he is unable to. The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) would instruct his Companions to only obey in what they were able to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19. Is it from his positive effects that he attended the gravesite of Sayyidah Zaynab (radyAllaahu ‘anhaa) on the occasion of the annual gathering, and did not reject one word of the Shirk that took place there? On the contrary, he would advise and encourage the attendees to purify their souls and hearts from spite and malice!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">20. Is it from his positive effects that he allowed Coptic Christians to enter his organization, making them supporters of his Call? Did any of the callers ever do this?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">21. Is it from his positive effects that he established an assembly for Muhammad ‘Uthmaan Al-Mirghanee, who is well know for his belief in wahdat-ul-wujood, praising him and saying in this gathering: “Indeed, we the gathering of Ikhwaan owe the Mirganee leaders pure affection and a warm welcome?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">22. Is it from his positive effects that he would go to public assemblies from the first night of Rabee’-ul-Awwal to the 12th of Rabee’-ul-Awwal in which he would recite a chant that consists of Major Shirk:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“May the Divine (Allaah) bless the light (i.e. Muhammad) that appeared to the creation and so he surpassed the (light of the) sun and the moon This beloved one (i.e. Muhammad) along with his loved ones has attended And pardoned everyone of what they did and will do (of sins).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">23. Is it from his positive effects that he and his associates would travel three hours on foot going and three hours returning in order to visit the graves of the elite among the Husaafee Shaadhilee Order? But if it is said that his intention behind visiting was for purposes related to the Sunnah (i.e. to remind himself of death), then we say that it is not permissible to set out on a journey to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">24. Is it from his positive effects that he would chant the following verses, which clearly indicate wahdat-ul-wujood:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah raised and scattered (all) the existence and what it contains<br />
So if you desire to attain His perfection<br />
Then everything in the universe if you realize it<br />
is non-existent, specifically and generally.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">25. Is it from his positive effects that he claimed that Tawassul, which is the greatest of ways that people fall into Shirk, is from the subsidiary issues, which should not be given importance?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Lastly, I ask you, by Allaah, are these things that I have just listed above in these numbers in agreement with the Religion or in contradiction to it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I ask you, by Allaah, a third time: Is the one who clarifies the truth to the people and defends the Creed considered erroneous and a criminal who deserves to be censured, reprimanded, incriminated and told that your books should not be printed?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">As for your statement that they excused him from the errors he committed, then I say:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: What are the errors that should be excused – aren’t they those that are made in subsidiary issues, which stem from Ijtihaad? So are the errors committed by Al- Bannaa on subsidiary issues, such that they can be excused? And is Al-Bannaa from the people of Ijtihaad whose status should be preserved? Who are his teachers whom he studied religious knowledge under?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: Errors made in matters of Creed are not excused based on the unanimous agreement of the scholars from Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah. And the books that they wrote refuting the innovators during every era and every location, which are too many to be counted, from the time of the Taabi’een to our present time, bears witness to this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: The Mashaayikh you mentioned are from Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, and if they knew of Al-Bannaa’s contradictions against the Religion in fundamental issues and matters of Creed, they would not make excuses for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth</strong>: As for your saying that they excused him, then this is an allegation on your part. So if you have with you something that confirms this, then present it. This only applies to you with respect to those who have passed away. But as for Shaikh ‘Abdul- ‘Azeez [8] then he is still alive and his stance regarding them (i.e. Ikhwaan-ul-Muslimeen) is well known. And he is our Imaam and our role model, and we know from the Shaikh that he refutes every error that he hears or learns of even if the one who commits it may be far away and even if the error is in relation to subsidiary issues. So how many errors has he refuted – they are too many to be taken into account. And if they were to be counted, then it would be long. And if it is possible, I will write to him asking:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There is a person that claims that you have excused Hasan Al-Bannaa for the errors in Creed that he made, so is this correct?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifth</strong>: Even if we assume that someone from Ahlus-Sunnah excused him for what he committed from errors in Creed, then his opinion of excusing him is to be considered as irregular and in contradiction to what Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah are upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sixth</strong>: As for the one who excused him, did he say that he can’t be refuted? If he said that he can’t be refuted, then he has aided the innovators and troublemakers who seek to deviate others by it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">As for your saying: “And they found in his words that which makes it known that he is a Mukhlis (sincere), Muwahhid (affirmer of Tawheed)”</span></strong>, then I say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his being sincere (mukhlis), then no one can know this except Allaah because sincerity is something hidden, which only Allaah has knowledge of. It is stated in the authentic hadeeth: “Actions are only base don’t heir intentions, and indeed every person will have only that which he intends.” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the hadeeth of Abu Moosaa: “Whoever fights so that the Word of Allaah could be the highest, then it (his fighting) was for the sake of Allaah.” And in the hadeeth of Ibn Mas’ood reported by Ahmad: “Perhaps a person may be killed between two groups and Allaah only knows his intention.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the hadeeth of ‘Ubaadah: “Whoever fights not intending anything except recognition, then he will have what he intends.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the story of the (brave) man who would follow and kill with his sword every pagan he encountered (during a battle), and the Companions were amazed by him and said: “No one amongst us has profited today like so and so has profited.” So the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “He is from the inhabitants of the Hellfire.” So a man followed him the next day (while the battle continued), and found him fighting (with polytheists). When he had suffered many wounds, the man placed the tip of his sword on his upper chest and fell on it, thrusting it in him and thus killing himself. The man (who followed him) then went to the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and said: “I bear witness that you are the Mesenger of Allaah.” He (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Why is that?” He said: “That man about whom who said what you said yesterday killed himself.” So the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Rise, O Bilaal, and announce to the people that no one shall enter Paradise except a believing soul, and that Allaah will indeed aid this religion by an evil man.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The important point here is that sincerity is something hidden, which no one has knowledge of except Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">As for you saying that he is a Muwahhid,</span></strong>[10] then this is a testimony and a commendation for him on your part that Allaah will question you about. It is obligatory for you to think carefully before sending out such commendations – where they put in their proper place or not? I don’t know if perhaps this is due to ignorance on your part of what Al-Bannaa fell into from Shirk, his disregard for those who committed it, as well as their polytheistic rituals, and his accepting them as members in his methodology. He is the one who said during the innovation of the Prophet’s Birthday:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This beloved one (i.e. Muhammad) along his loved ones has attended And pardoned everyone of what they did and will do (of sins).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that the Messenger of Allaah attends their gathering, blesses it and pardons and forgives them! So I ask is this Shirk or not, O Shaikh?! And is the one who says such a statement and chants it a Muwahhid?! Is the one who takes the bay’ah (pledge of allegiance) in accordance with the Husaafee Shadhilee (Sufi) order a Muwahhid?! Have you come to know that the Sufis are Muwahhids and that they call to Tawheed, or that they commit Shirk and call to polytheism and innovation? Are you aware that Sufism is built upon Shirk and that it weaves its thread and fabric from polytheism and innovations?! Did you know that Hasan Al-Bannaa used to walk by foot, 20 kilometers going and the same distance returning, every Friday, to visit the graves of the (deceased) high members of Sufism, like Ad-Dasooqee, Sinjar and their likes? Is the one who does this a Muwahhid? O Shaikh, fear Allaah and know that you have severely damaged and violated your Tawheed by testifying that those upon Shirk (polytheism) and Bid’ah (innovation) are Muwahhideen. So repent to Allaah and turn to Him before time runs out.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, the true Caller who was a Muwahhid was Shaikh Muhammad bin ‘Abdil- Wahhaab, may Allaah have mercy on him, as well as those who treaded upon his methodology and followed his way from the scholars and the leaders from his time and the time of the Ameer, Muhammad bin Sa’ood up to this day of ours. May Allaah have mercy on those of them who passed away and preserve those of them who remain living.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also the Shaikh, ‘Abdullaah bin Muhammad Al-Qar’aawee, who spread Tawheed throughout the southern areas (of Saudi Arabia) with the help of the late king, who went by the nickname of “The Falcon of Arabia”11 and who brought most of the areas of the (Arab) peninsula together under his sovereignty, uniting them under his rule, and cleansing them of aspects of polytheism and innovation. And he was followed in this by his noble children, may Allaah have mercy on those of them who passed away and may He preserve those of them still living.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask you, by Allaah, O Shaikh, if a person were to ask you: “What do you say concerning an individual who participated in a procession from the first of Rabee’-ul- Awwal to the twelfth of Rabee’-ul-Awwal and happily chanted verses of poetry, which I mentioned previously, amongst which was:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This beloved one (i.e. Muhammad) along with his loved ones has attended And pardoned everyone of what they did and will do (of sins)?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Will you make a ruling on him, that he is upon Shirk or Tawheed? What would be your answer?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if you were asked about a man who endured the hardship of traveling by foot every week the distance of twenty kilometers to the Sufi gravesites and then the same distance returning, how would you judge this individual? Would you say that he is a Sunnee or an innovator, and would you say that he is a Muwahhid or a Mushrik?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So fear Allaah man and return to the truth, and repent to Allaah for indeed He accepts the repentance. Do not misguide the people, especially the students of knowledge, by defending the innovators. This traveling that Hasan Al-Bannaa and his associates would do every week is not free from three possibilities:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Either they intended to supplicate to those buried in the graves, which is Major Shirk and takes one out of the Religion, or</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. They intended to supplicate to Allaah while at these gravesites, which is an innovation, or</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. They intended to visit the graves as part of the Sunnah (i.e. to be reminded of death). However this couldn’t be achieved except by setting out on a journey, and setting out on a journey to make the lawful visitation of the graves, is an innovation. So based on this, the one who does it is either a polytheist or an innovator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>As for your statement: “Allaah granted benefit through his Da’wah and guided many people”, then:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What benefit came about for them? Is having disregard for Major Shirk and being silent about those who perform it, such as the deviants and the innovators considered a benefit? Is keeping silent about evil and not forbidding it – which stems from the principle that Hasan Al-Bannaa instituted: “We will work together in that which we agree on and pardon one another in that which we disagree on” – is this a benefit. Are those who are calling to the Khilaafah and who have abandoned calling to Tawheed, which was the way of all the messengers, a benefit?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is intending to destroy the present (Muslim) states and revolting against them, even if those who govern them are Muslims and rule by Allaah’s Legislation, establishing the penal laws, a benefit?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, the Da’wah (Call) of the Ikhwaan (Al-Muslimoon) only destroys the youth and doesn’t benefit them, and it only corrupts them and doesn’t rectify them. As for your statement that you didn’t stop hearing him being praised in gatherings and his books being read until about seven years ago when the brothers turned against him and degraded his rank, then I say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is this a proof for him? If someone praises his methodology or praises him, who doesn’t know what is in his methodology from destructive ideologies and what he had from vile errors, this is not a proof for him or a scale determining the correctness of his methodology.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You know as well, deep down inside, that this is not a proof, and that they only praised him when they were misled by the general outer appearance of his methodology. But when they came to realize what he was upon, they rebuked it and censured him. and they had every right to do what they did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah, You indeed know that we do not intend to disparage anyone nor to speak out against anyone, rather we only intend to clarify the truth and to warn the youth and the students of knowledge from the methodologies that consist of innovations and deviations. And we are only pointing out to them the errors in them so that they may not be deluded by them, entering into them and missing the path of truth, thus being misguided and misguiding those who come after them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for them having degraded his rank, then this is not correct. Rather they said about him what was conveyed to them with statements established in their sources, mentioning the names of the books and their page numbers. So are they degrading his rank when they relate these quotes to convince the youth that this methodology is erroneous because it contains truth and falsehood and mixes that which is correct with that which is wrong? This is like someone who drinks from water with impurities and dirtiness, and next to him is a person who drinks from water that is pure and free from pollution. Which of these two would you love most to drink from? So by doing this are they degrading or destroying his status?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: No, then again no. Rather, the heavens and the earth were not established nor were the messengers sent nor were the divine books revealed except to establish the truth and suppress the falsehood and to command the good and forbid the evil. So if the universe is void, or more appropriately, if the earth is void of one who will establish the truth for the sake of Allaah and those who command good and forbid evil, the earth will earn Allaah’s wrath and His punishment will descend. What indicates this is Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And when the Word is fulfilled against them, we shall bring out from the earth a Beast for them to speak to them because mankind believed not with certainty in our ayaat (signs).” [Surah An-Naml: 82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Umar and Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudree, may Allaah be pleased with them, said: “When they stop commanding good and forbidding evil, (Allaah’s) Discontentment becomes binding upon them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the part “when the word is fulfilled”, ‘Abdullaah bin Mas’ood said: “It will be when the scholars die, knowledge goes away and the Qur’aan is raised up (to Allaah).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: It is clear from this that commanding good and forbidding evil prevent torment from descending and Allaah’s Displeasure of His servants from being mandated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what falls into commanding good and forbidding evil is refuting the errors in Creed made by those who pronounce that, whoever they may be and wherever they may be. Would you like that the people of truth remain silent about clarifying it (i.e. the truth) and hold back from purifying it from that which is not part of it mixing and entering into it? Never! This will never be, by the Will of Allaah, so long as there are men to carry the Hadeeth and there is room for speech and there is force and strength for the truth and its people, who in doing this hope for Allaah’s Contentment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">As for your saying: “And they imposed themselves over him without there being anything mandating that he be specified (apart from others), for there were other more famous books that were worse that his books. And there are other leading figures, both dead and alive, that are more deviant than him”, </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">then I say: First: All praise be to Allaah who caused you to speak the truth even though you weren’t aware of it, for you have acknowledged that there is evil in his books, as well as deviation in his methodology and history. How close in resemblance is your statement O Shaikh to the speech of the people of innovation in terms of contradiction, so reflect!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second: The obligation on the scholars is to clarify to the people, according to the extent of their ability, what they are unaware of and to distinguish the truth from falsehood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Third: We have been afflicted by this methodology in our very own lands and so it has corrupted the minds of our children. So now they reject the compassionate father, the affectionate friend and the educating teacher. And they do not take the advice of the advisor or the criticism of the critic unless he is a member of their party. So they resemble those who Allaah spoke about in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And do not believe (in anyone) except he who follows your religion.” [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 73]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they say: “Do not believe anyone except the people of your group.” So this makes it necessary that one speak out against this methodology and its founder, as well as its offshoots, such as the Suroorees and the Qutubees. This is the reason that caused it (i.e. Ikhwaanee Manhaj) to be specified because it has spread amongst us and extended throughout our lands and regions. And it has corrupted the minds of our youth turning them into revolutionaries, takfeeris and terrorists.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there is nothing strange if the Salafee students of knowledge rebuke this methodology and spread the errors it has in it, in order to uphold the truth, advise the people, seek nearness to Allaah and make Jihaad in His Cause:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Verily We will not cause the reward of one who does a good deed to be lost.” [Surah Al-Kahf: 30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>As for your saying: “They have specifically chosen him and his books out of other well known books that are far worse than his books and callers, dead and alive, that are more deviant than him”, then I say:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have already explained to you the reason for this. Also, along with this is the fact that the Salafees, all praise be to Allaah, do not remain silent with falsehood for they have refuted all of the deviant sects, past and present, old and new, as much as they were able to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this time, I specifically mean our noble teacher and our unique great intellectual and our sincere and dignified scholar, Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin ‘Abdillaah bin Baaz, may Allaah preserve him, grant him success and aid him, then the Committee of Senior Scholars after him, may Allaah grant all of them success, assist them with every good and aid them against every evil. So whoever flips through the fataawaa of Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin Baaz, whose number has reached seven volumes, will realize that he has written many refutations against the people of falsehood, with all of its components and all of their factions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this goes as well for what has been written from verdicts and refutations in the magazine of Islamic Research of the Committee of Senior Scholars, may Allaah reward them with good and bless their time</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point is that your statement: “Many of the brothers have imposed themselves over him without there being anything mandating that he be specified (apart from others), for there are other more famous books that were worse that his books. And there are other leading figures, both dead and alive, that are more deviant than him” means that they should not be refuted. This is a statement that is not put in its proper place. May Allaah forgive you and us and rectify our affairs and yours. This, O Shaikh, isn’t the way the arguments of the scholars are. On the contrary, their proofs were in affirming what the texts of the Book and the Sunnah, according to the understanding of the Salaf of the ummah, affirmed and negating what they negated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, O brother in Islaam, if you hold that refuting Hasan Al-Bannaa and the people of his group from those who wallowed in Sufism and idolatry, entered innovations into the Religion and legislated into it that which Allaah and His Messenger didn’t legislate. If you consider that refuting these people and clarifying what their methodology consists of from falsehood and deviation – if you consider that to be a violation against the members of this methodology and its founder, then we have no control over guiding others, however it is upon us to supplicate to Allaah to remove from you this strange ideology and this false understanding that has deprived you and confused matters for you. And at the same time we fear that this ideology causes you to enter into the ranks of those whom Allaah spoke of when He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And whoever opposes the Messenger after the guidance was made clear to him and follows a way other than the Way of the Believers, We will turn him to what he has chosen and land him in Hell – what an evil destination.” [Surah An-Nisaa: 115]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that supporting the people of falsehood and defending them is not from the Way of the Believers, especially if they are polytheists or innovators, whose innovation leads to disbelief or sin. So I advise you and ask Allaah for you, O brother in Islaam, that you return to the truth and to supporting it. And I ask Allaah that He allow you to see it (i.e. the truth) and that he remove the veil that is before your eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is my advice to you, and it is the advice of every Salafee that loves good for you and fears for you the consequences of this foreign ideology and erroneous understanding. And with Allaah lies the success, to him I place my reliance and to Him I repent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>As for your statement: “Therefore I advise you O Shaikh to withhold your tongue and your pen from attacking this Caller, whom Allaah granted benefit by”</strong></span>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: What a great advice this is, if only it were put in its proper place. This is a valuable gift for the one who wishes to preserve his Religion by it. However, you advised me not to advise, so is this a proper advice? So in reality it is only preventing good and hindering from the Path of Allaah. So fear Allaah, O Shaikh ‘Abdullaah [12], and return to the truth. By Allaah, of whom there is no deity worthy of worship except Him, there is not one percent of doubt in my heart that would lead me to undo what I have done. Rather, I hold that this is obligatory on me, since I have come to know about this man and his methodology that which entitles me to advise others and to clarify the observations made against this methodology, out of sincerity for the students of knowledge who have been deceived by them, in order to fulfill Allaah’s right over me that I defend the Religion of Islaam and to protect the Tawheed and preserve its honor as the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">As for your statement where you advised me to not attack the honor of this Caller, I say:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In your opinion, what has more right to be defended and protected – Tawheed and the authentic Creed, the Creed of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah or the honor of Hasan Al- Bannaa? Didn’t Allaah order us to fight the polytheists and the disbelievers for the sake of the Creed? Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And fight them until there is no more fitnah and the Religion is for Allaah.” [Surah Al-Baqarah: 193]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word fitnah has been interpreted here as Shirk. Didn’t Allaah permit the termination of the lives of the disbelievers and the polytheists, the imprisonment of their women and children and the taking of their wealth as booty for the Muslims due to the Creed? Shouldn’t this be permitted for one who commits Major Shirk, agrees with those who perform it, and introduces innovations into the Religion as well as laws that have not been legislated?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shouldn’t this be permitted against his honor, for the purpose of clarifying the truth to those who have been deceived by this man and his methodology?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, by Allaah of whom there is no deity worthy of worship except Him, the obligation upon me and you and all of the seekers of knowledge is that aiding the Religion and exposing the truth must take precedence over everything in this world, out of obedience to Allaah, establishing His right, aiding his Religion and defending the beliefs of the Muslims from deceptions. And with Allaah lies the success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>As for your statement in which you advised me to not print my book, then:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: I consider this to be hindering from the Way of Allaah on your part. This is because I hold this book as being one of the best of my good deeds since I aided the truth by it, preserved the honor of Tawheed with it and defended the authentic Creed through it. I hope that I have done this sincerely for Allaah’s sake, establishing His right and defending the sanctuary of His Religion, but I am not freeing myself from shortcomings and errors. And I ask Allaah to forgive me, for indeed whatever deed an individual performs, he is prone to deficiencies and shortcomings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: I consider this to be an abandonment of the truth from you, a siding with the people of falsehood on your part and support for them. This is enough as an offense against the Religion and then against those who carry it, those about whom Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And who is better in speech than he who calls to Allaah and does righteous deeds and says: ‘I am from the Muslims.’” [Surah Fussilat: 33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: I heard that some of the hizbees (partisans) buy the books that criticize and speak against their party in large amounts and then burn them. So what is the difference between one who burns my book after it’s printed and one who tells me not to print it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth</strong>: I consider this to be from interfering in other people’s affairs in order to prevent the spread of good. And it states in the hadeeth: “From the goodness of a person’s Islaam is that he abandons what doesn’t concern him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Fifth</span></strong>: If I printed it and the people disseminated it, then I would be printing a book that affirms Tawheed and censures Shirk, that affirms the Sunnah and censures Innovation, and that affirms the truth and censures falsehood. So it would be an obligation on you to request the expeditious printing of the book, in order to aid Tawheed, the truth and the Sunnah. However, you have done the opposite and instead requested me not to print the book. And by doing this, you are supporting the people of innovations and partisanship wrongfully against the people of Tawheed and the Sunnah, the followers of the way of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So seek forgiveness from Allaah and repent to Him before your life passes and comes to an end. For by Allaah, neither this person nor that person will be able to benefit you before Allaah (on the Day of Judgement). Rather, the only thing that will benefit you is your standing up for the truth and your support for it and its people. And Allaah is the only One whom we ask that He guide us and you to the truth and to supporting it and its people. And He is the only One whom we seek refuge in from vain desires and misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">As for your warning me against printing the book out of fear for me that it will ruin my reputation, then I say to you:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that the ruining of one’s reputation comes only due to supporting falsehood and speaking it or doing it. And I, thanks to my Lord, have not committed any falsehood and nor have I supported the people of falsehood in order that my reputation would be ruined in front of the believers, who are Allaah’s witnesses on His earth. Rather, I have performed the truth and supported the truth, which I hope I will be rewarded for by Allaah and due to which I will be considered honest amidst the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the people of falsehood, then I am not concerned about my reputation with them. I ask Allaah the Most Great, Lord of the Noble Throne, to protect me from their evil and to save me from their plots. And I will continue to pursue my printing and distribution of the book, if Allaah wills, relying upon Allaah in whose Hand lies the forelock of all His slaves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Was-Salaam ‘Alaikum wa Rahmatullaahi wa Barakaatuh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s Note: This tremendous book written by Shaikh Ahmad An-Najmee was written and published in the same year as this letter (1418H). It is about 300 pages long and contains an in depth analysis of the two most popular deviant methodologies in the field of Da’wah today, that of the Jamaa’at at-Tableegh and the Ikhwaan-ul- Muslimeen. The book has introductory commendations from Shaikh Saalih Al-Fawzaan and Shaikh Rabee’ Al- Madkhalee, may Allaah preserve all of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Translator’s Note: Shaikh Ahmad An-Najmee was born in 1346H and was around 22 years old when Hasan Al- Bannaa was shot and killed in Egypt on 2/12/1949 (1368H).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Translator’s Note: He means by this outside of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Translator’s Note: The belief of wahdat-ul-wujood is a deviant Sufi concept that entails the belief that Allaah and His creation are one existence. Thus there is no distinction between Creator and creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] This treatise was written during the lifetime of Shaikh Ibn Baaz, may Allaah have mercy on him</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] Translator’s Note: The word Muwahhid comes from Tawheed. Consequently it means someone who abides by the mandates of Tawheed, which means worshipping Allaah alone without any partners, and shunning all forms of Shirk.</p>

PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>About the Book</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a small booklet titled <strong>Dhammu maa &#8216;alayhi Mudda&#8217;oo at-Tasawwuf </strong>(Condemning the Practices of those who Claim Sufism) by Imaam Abu Muhammad Ibn Qudaamah Al-Maqdisee, may Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The booklet was published by Maktab al-Islami and is a short treatise containing a fatwa (religious verdict) from this great scholar of the seventh century on some of the practices that those who ascribed themselves to Sufism were upon in those days, and still are upon till this day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fatwa generally focuses on <strong>musical instruments and singing</strong>, which were practices the Sufis performed, taking it as part of the religion and using that as a means of drawing nearer to Allaah. The Shaikh has filled his response With Quranic verses, prophetic ahaadeeth and narrations from the Salaf.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Al-Haafidh Ibn Rajab Al-Hanbalee<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This book is a translation of a short treatise entitled “<i>Kashf-ul-Kurbah fee wasfi Haali Ahlil-Ghurbah</i>”<b>[Alleviating Grievances in Describing the Condition of the Strangers]</b> written by the great Imaam, Al-Haafidh Zayn-ud-Deen Ibn Rajab Al-Hanbalee, may Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this treatise, Ibn Rajab discusses the topic of the “Strangers”, listing the many <i>ahaadeeth</i> of the Prophet reported about them. They are given this name because they will be strange during the Last Days, due to their adherence to the Sunnah and to the Way of the first Muslims, the Salaf As-Saalih. So just as those who first accepted Islaam at the hands of Muhammad were considered strangers to their families and close ones, then indeed, those who adhere to the Sunnah in the last Days, when innovations and misguidance are rampant and widespread, will also be considered strangers to their families and close ones, not to mention the disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It must be noted that Ibn Rajab uses several weak ahaadeeth in this treatise, which have been pointed out. Also, towards the end of his treatise, he begins to divert from the topic by going deep into the issue of inner strangeness, sometimes focusing on aspects that have no basis in Islaam, such as talk about <i>wajd</i>, <i>khulwah</i> and so on. These were Sufi concepts that were prevalent during his time. Consequently, the last pages of the treatise, which included several quotes and lines of poetry, were left out from this translation. However, the omission of this last part of the book does not detract from the overall meaning and intended theme of the treatise, and Allaah knows best. For the most part, the treatise is of great importance and is often referenced by the scholars, and that is what we hope to convey to the readers. All footnotes were added by the translator based on research and the use of several sources. We ask Allaah to accept this work as a sincere act and that He place it in our scale of good deeds on the Day of Judgement. And we ask that He benefit all the Muslims generally with it</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b><br />
“So when the Prophet was sent forth and began calling to Islaam, his call was not answered at first instance except by a few from each tribe. And those that did accept his call feared from their tribes and families lest they should be subjected to extreme punishment. And they would suffer while being patient with that for the sake of Allaah. Due to their weakness, the (first) Muslims would be frightened by every opposing force and they would flee for the sake of their Religion to far-off lands as was shown when they migrated twice to the land of Abysinnia, and then when they migrated to Madeenah. And there was from among them, he who was tortured for the sake of Allaah and he who was killed. <b>So those who entered into the fold of Islaam, back in those days – they were the strangers. </b>Then Islaam spread after the Hijrah to Madeenah and its followers became victorious over every group. After that, the people entered into the Religion of Allaah in multitudes. And Allaah perfected the Religion for them and completed His favor upon them. Then the Messenger of Allaah died, and the Muslims were upon the utmost level due to their firm adherence to their Religion. They were powerful and dominant, and they continued to be upon this condition during the times (i.e. <i>khilaafah</i>) of Abu Bakr and ‘Umar. Then the Devil unleashed his evil plot upon the Muslims and discord fell between them. And the trials of <b>Doubts</b> (<i>Shubuhaat</i>) and <b>Desires</b>(<i>Shahawaat</i>) became widespread. These two evils did not stop increasing at all until the plan of the Devil was established and the majority of the creation obeyed him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Concerning the statement of the Prophet: <b>‘Islaam began as something strange and will return to being strange, as it began’</b>, Imaam Al-Awzaa’ee (rahimahullaah) said: ‘As for this, then it does not mean that Islaam will go away, rather it means that Ahlus-Sunnah will go away, up to the point that there will not remain any from them in a land except one person.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Based on this understanding, there can be found much praise in the statements of the Salaf for the Sunnah and their describing it as being strange, and describing its adherents and followers as being few. Al-Hasan Al-Basree (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) used to say to his companions: ‘Oh Ahlus-Sunnah! Be gentle with one another, and may Allaah have mercy on you, for indeed, you are from amongst the fewest of people.’ Yoonus bin ‘Ubayd (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said: ‘There is not a thing more strange than the Sunnah. But what is stranger than it, is the one who knows it.’ Sufyaan Ath-Thawree (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said: ‘Treat Ahlus-Sunnah kindly, for verily, they are strangers.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And from the words of Ahmad bin ‘Aasim Al-Andaakee, who was one of the biggest scholars at the time of Sulaymaan Ad-Daaraanee, was: ‘Indeed, I have reached from all the times, a time when Islaam has returned to being strange as it began. In it, the description of truth has returned to being strange as it began. If you were to turn to the scholar, you would find him being tested with the love of this worldly life and the love for honor and authority. And if you were to turn to the worshipper, you would find him ignorant in his worship, deceived and fallen victim to his enemy Iblees (i.e. the Devil). He has mounted to the highest levels of worship while being ignorant of how to perform them so how can he be at that level? And the rest of the people are from among the ignorant followers, simple-minded and quick to follow a way, as if he were a wolf looking to steal a sheep, or a hungry lion, or a fox on the prowl. This is the description of the people of your time from the carriers of knowledge and the Qur’aan and the callers of wisdom.’ This was the description of the people of his time. So how much has the situation increased and the crisis become greater after it. Indeed, it has reached a point that would have never been thought of nor imagined!”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Imaam Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a booklet titled <b>“<i>Manzilat-us-Sunnah fil-Islaam</i>”</b> (The Status of the Sunnah in Islaam) of Imaam Muhammad Naasir-u-Deen Al-Albaanee, may Allaah have mercy on him. The source for this booklet was a lecture he gave in Doha, Qatar during the month of Ramadaan, 1392H. The talk was later transcribed and published. This book can be downloaded in Arabic at sahab.org.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This treatise clarifies the position of the Sunnah in Islaam, in that it bears the same status as the Qur’aan when it comes to deriving religious rulings and laws. So one cannot possibly understand and implement the Qur’aan in the absence of the Sunnah, rather they go hand in hand. Imaam Al-Albaanee gives several examples for this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author then goes on to explain what is meant by Sunnah in his discussion, in that it refers to only the authentic Sunnah, and not the weak and fabricated hadeeth. This is a very important treatise, defining a key principle of the Salafi Manhaj, which consists of following the Qur’aan and the Sunnah, along with the understanding of the Salaf (i.e. Sahaabah, Taabi’een, Atbaa’ at-Taabi’een). This treatise is also a refutation of the deviant groups that rely on the Qur’aan alone, such as the Qur’aaniyoon, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It is unfortunate that there can be found some contemporary tafseer writers and authors that have taken the view of making permissible what has been mentioned in the last two examples, such as the permissibility of eating predatory animals and wearing gold and silk, relying upon the Qur’aan (as proof) only! In fact, there can be found in this present time a group that call themselves the Qur’aaniyoon, who interpret the Qur’aan according to their desires and intellects, without seeking assistance for that in the authentic Sunnah. Rather, the Sunnah, according to them, is subordinate to their desires. So whatever part of it conforms to their desires, they affirm it, and whatever doesn’t conform to their desires, they throw behind their backs (rejecting it).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“From what has been stated previously, it becomes clear that there is no way for anyone, even if he be a scholar of the Arabic Language and its disciplines, to understand the noble Qur’aan, without seeking assistance in that from the Prophet’s Sunnah in speech and action. This is since he will never be more knowledgeable of the language than the Companions of the Prophet, those who the Qur’aan was revealed to in their language. And (at that time) the language was not blemished with the errors of the non-Arabs and the slang of the common people, but in spite of that, they still erred in understanding these previously mentioned ayaat, when they relied on their knowledge of the language only.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“In summary: It is an obligation upon all of the Muslims to not differentiate between the Qur’aan and the Sunnah, with regard to the obligation of accepting both of them together and establishing Laws based on both of them. Indeed this is the guarantee that will prevent them from drifting to the right and the left, and from returning to deviation.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this treatise, the author dispels many of the false claims and accusations that are spread and circulated about Imaam Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdil-Wahhaab died 1206H] by using the Imaam&#8217;s own testimony from statements he made in his writings. The author brings seven of the most popular misconceptions that surround Imaam Ibn Abdil-Wahhaab and his da&#8217;wah and refutes them through the words of the Imaam, as has been recorded in his writings and collected by reliable sources into compilations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By doing this we clearly see the Imaam&#8217;s position with regard to these fundamental issues based on his own testimony and not having to rely on someone else&#8217;s explanation in his defense. We hope that through this treatise, those who have doubt about Imaam Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdil-Wahhaab and his call, can gain clarity about the true state of affairs and not listen to the lies and slander of his opponents who seek and strive to discredit the tremendous efforts of this great reformer.</p>

<p><strong>Read the Book Below:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">INTRODUCTION</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For many years and long decades now, there has been much talk and debate going on about Shaikh Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (rahimahullaah) and his da’wah between those who agree and those who disagree, and those who accuse him and those who defend him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But anyone who looks at the words of those who oppose the Shaikh, those who attach all kinds of accusations to him, will find that their words are void of any proof. This is since there can’t be found any basis for what they claim either in his statements or in his books. Rather, they are just allegations mentioned by those in the past and repeated by those in later times, nothing more.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I think a fair and just person would only agree that the best and most correct way to find out the truth about him would be by returning to and taking from the main source (i.e. the Shaikh himself).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the books of the Shaikh are present and his words are preserved. And by looking into them, one can find out the truth or falsehood of what is being spread about him. And as for the claims that are void of evidences then they are just a mirage and not real.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In these following pages, I will present brief excerpts from the speech of Shaikh Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab, using quotes from him, which I relied on from the trustworthy books that have collected all of his statements. And I have not added anything to them except for arranging them in order.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These quotes consist of responses from the Shaikh himself against the most popular accusations that his opponents launch against him, in which he asserts the opposite of what they claim. I am certain that, by Allaah’s Guidance, these responses will suffice in clarifying the truth to those who seek it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who reject the Shaikh and oppose his Da’wah, those who spend their time spreading falsehood and circulating lies, then I say to them: Lie against your own selves for indeed the truth is clear and indeed the Religion of Allaah is victorious, and the sun shines bright, one cannot cover it with his hands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So here is the speech of the Shaikh, which disproves these claims and refutes all of your accusations. So if you have some speech from him that contradicts it then bring it out in the open and do not conceal it. And if you can’t do this, and you will not be able to do it, then I counsel you with one piece of advice: That you stand up for Allaah, free from every vain desire or bigotry, and ask Him sincerely to show you the truth and to guide you to it. Then reflect on what this man said – did he bring forth something better than the Speech of Allaah and the speech of His Messenger?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then reflect a second time: Is there any other way to salvation than speaking the truth and believing in the truth? So if the truth becomes clear to you, then return to your guidance and go back to the truth, for that is better than lingering upon falsehood. And to Allaah return all the affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">THE REALITY OF THE DA’WAH OF SHAIKH MUHAMMAD BIN ‘ABDIL-WAHHAAB</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is proper to begin this discussion by relaying some brief words from Shaikh Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab, may Allaah have mercy on him, in which he explains the reality of what he was calling to, far removed from the dark clouds of propaganda that his opponents have placed as an obstacle between many people and that Da’wah. He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I say, and to Allaah belongs the Praise and the Blessing, and all might is by Him, that my Lord has guided me to a Straight Path, an upright religion, the pure monotheistic way of Ibraaheem, and he wasn’t from the polytheists. And I, all praise be to Allaah, do not call to a madh-hab (way) of Sufism or (a madh-hab) of a Fiqh scholar or a speaker or one of the Imaams that they magnify.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the contrary, I call to Allaah alone and with no partner. And I call to the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger, which he advised the first part of his ummah and the last part of it to abide by. And I hope that I will not reject the truth if it comes to me. In fact, I call on Allaah, His angels and all of His creation to bear witness that if one of you brings one word of truth to me that I should accept it immediately and throw against the wall everything that opposes it, from the statements of my Imaams, with the exception of Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) for indeed he doesn’t speak anything but the truth.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/37-38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And I, all praise be to Allaah, am a follower (muttabi’) and not an innovator (mubtadi’).” [Mu’allafaat ash-Shaikh Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab: 5/36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The correct representation of the affair is that I say: No one should be supplicated to except Allaah, alone and with no partner, as Allaah says in His Book: ‘So do not call unto anyone along with Allaah.’ [Surah Al-Jinn: 18] And He said about the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Say: It is not in my power to cause you harm or to bring you to the Right Path.’ [Surah Al-Jinn: 21] So this is the Speech of Allaah, which the Messenger of Allaah mentioned to us and counseled us with. And this is what stands between me and you, for if he mentioned something besides this, then it is a lie and a slander.” [Ad-Durar as- Saniyyah: 1/90-91]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">THE FIRST ISSUE: THE SHAIKH’S BELIEF WITH REGARD TO THE PROPHET</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh is charged by his enemies with terrible accusations related to his belief concerning the Prophet. These accusations are as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First: That he didn’t believe he was the last of the Prophets. This is what is claimed (!), but yet all the books of the Shaikh are filled with a refutation of this misconception and they testify that this claim is a lie. Some examples are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I believe that our Prophet Muhammad (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) is the seal (last) of the prophets and messengers. And the Eemaan (Faith) of a servant (person) is not valid unless he believes in his messengership and bears witness to his prophethood.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So the most prosperous of creatures and those who will have the greatest blessing and highest level are those who are foremost in following him (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and in conforming with him in knowledge and action.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 2/21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second: That he violates the right of the Prophet and doesn’t give him the position he deserves. In order to find out the reality of this claim, I will quote some of his statements in which he clearly asserts what his belief is with regard to the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Because Allaah wanted His Tawheed to be supreme and His Religion to be completed and because He wanted His Word to be the highest and the Word of the disbelievers to be the lowest, He sent Muhammad (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), the last of the prophets and the loved one of the Lord of creation. So he did not cease to be known throughout every generation, being mentioned in the Torah of Moosaa and the Gospel of ‘Eesaa, until Allaah brought forth that pearl from between the tribes of Kinaanah and Zahra.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he brought him out during a period of time that was void of messengers, and guided him to the most upright of paths. So he had signs and indicators that proved his prophethood before he was even sent forth (with the message), which amazed the people of his time. And Allaah brought him up in a good manner. That’s why he was the noblest, the best mannered, the nicest neighbor, the most lenient and the most truthful in speech amongst his people. This was such that his people would call him ‘Al-Ameen’ (The Trustworthy One), because of what Allaah gave him from righteous conditions and praiseworthy characteristics.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 2/19, 90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“He is the chief of the intercessors, possessor of the most praiseworthy station, and Aadam as well as those besides him will be under his banner.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/86]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The first of the messengers was Nooh, and the last and most virtuous of them was Muhammad.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/143]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“He clarified with the most profound of clarifications (i.e. the Religion) and he completed and finalized it. He was the most sincere of creatures towards the servants of Allaah, and he was compassionate and merciful to the believers. He conveyed the message and fulfilled the trust, and he made true Jihaad in the Cause of Allaah. And he worshipped Allaah until certainty (i.e. death) reached him.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 2/21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, he (rahimahullaah) mentioned that one of the benefits derived from the Prophet’s statement: “None of you truly believes until I become more beloved to him than his father, his son, and all of mankind” is the obligation of loving him above loving one’s self, family and wealth. [Kitaab at-Tawheed: 108]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Third: They claim that he rejected the Prophet’s intercession. The Shaikh responds to this misconception by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“They claim that we reject the Prophet’s intercession. Far removed is Allaah from imperfections, this is a great slander. Rather, we bear witness before Allaah that the Messenger of Allaah is the intercessor and possessor of the praiseworthy station. We ask Allaah, the Most Generous, Lord of the Mighty Throne, that He allow him to intercede for us and that he resurrect us under his banner.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/63-64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“No one rejects the Prophet’s intercession except for the people of innovation and misguidance. However, the intercession will not occur unless permission is granted first (by Allaah) and He is pleased with it, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And no one will intercede except for he whom He is pleased with.’ [Surah Al- Anbiyaa: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Who is it that will intercede in His presence except by His permission.’ [Surah Al-Baqarah: 255]” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh explains the reason why this false claim was spread about him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“These people, when I mentioned to them what Allaah and His Messenger, as well as the scholars from all the groups, stated about the obligation of making the worship solely for Allaah and the prohibition of resembling the People of the Scripture who came before us in the aspect of taking their priests and rabbis as lords besides Allaah, they said to us: ‘You have degraded the status of the prophets, righteous people and the awliyaa (friends of Allaah)!’” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 2/50]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">THE SECOND ISSUE: THE PROPHET’S HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the many accusations directed at the Shaikh is that he didn’t love the members of the Prophet’s Household and that he violated their rights. The response to this is that what is claimed is in contradiction to the true state of affairs. In fact, he, may Allaah have mercy on him, fully acknowledged the right that they had of being loved and honored, and he abided by it. In fact, he would even rebuke those who didn’t abide by this, as he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah has obligated certain rights for the members of the household of Allaah’s Messenger, which they have over the people. So it is not permissible for a Muslim to abandon their rights thinking that to be part of Tawheed. Rather this is from extremism. The only thing we reject is honoring them for the sake of the (false) claim that they have the right to be worshipped, as well as honoring those who claim this.” [Mu’allafaat ash-Shaikh: 5/284]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever reflects on the life and history of the Shaikh will realize the truthfulness of what he stated here. It is enough to know that the Shaikh named six of his seven children with names from the Prophet’s Household, may Allaah be pleased with them: ‘Alee, ‘Abdullaah, Husayn, Hasan, Ibraaheem and Faatimah. This is a clear proof of the great love and respect he had for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">THE THIRD ISSUE: THE WONDROUS OCCURRENCES OF THE AWLIYAA</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people spread around that Shaikh Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab denied the extraordinary occurrences (karaamaat) of the awliyaa (close friends of Allaah). What disproves this false claim is that the Shaikh has clearly affirmed in several places of his Creed the opposite of what is spread around about him concerning this issue. An example of this is the statements he makes in some of his speech in which he explains his belief and creed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And I affirm the karaamaat (wondrous occurrences) of the awliyaa.” [Ad-Durar As- Saniyyah: 1/32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I wonder how the Shaikh can be accused of such a claim when he is the one who described those who deny the wondrous occurrences of the awliyaa as people of innovation and misguidance, when he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And no one rejects the wondrous occurrences of the awliyaa except for the people of innovation and misguidance.” [Ad-Durar As-Saniyyah: 1/32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>THE FOURTH ISSUE: TAKFEER</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the greatest of misconceptions that are spread about the Shaikh and his followers is that they declare the general masses of Muslims to be disbelievers (i.e. takfeer), and that they claim that marrying them is not valid except for those who are part of them or those who join their group.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh has refuted this misconception in numerous places, amongst them are: “The statement that we declare the Muslims to be disbelievers generally is from the lies of the enemies who wish to prevent people from this Religion. So we say: ‘Glorified and far removed are You (O Allaah), this is a tremendous slander!’ [Surah An-Noor: 16]” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/100]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“They have ascribed to us various lies, and so the fitnah has increased. Amongst these lies are: Spreading slander, which any sane person would be shy to transmit, not to mention be fooled by. An example of this is what you have mentioned that I deem all people to be disbelievers except for those who follow me, and that I claim that marrying them is not valid! How strange that such a notion could enter into the mind of a sane person! Would a Muslim say such a thing?! I absolve myself before Allaah from this claim, which only emanates from one with deficient intellect and no understanding. So may Allaah curse the people of evil and false objectives.” [Ad- Durar As-Saniyyah: 1/80]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The person I deem to be a disbeliever is the one who knows the Religion of the Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), but then after coming to know it, turns to reviling it and forbidding the people from it and making enmity with those who adhere to it. This is the person that I declare to be a disbeliever. And the majority of the ummah (i.e. Muslims), all praise be to Allaah, are not like this.” [Ad-Durar As-Saniyyah: 1/73]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>THE FIFTH ISSUE: THE WAY OF THE KHAWAARIJ </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are some people who accuse the Shaikh of being upon the beliefs of the Khawaarij, those who declare Muslims disbelievers because of sins. The response to this from the words of the Shaikh is as follows: He, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “I do not testify for any of the Muslims that he is in Paradise or the Hellfire except for those who Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) testified it for. However, I wish well for the good-doer and I fear for the evildoer. And I do not deem anyone amongst the Muslims to be a disbeliever due to a sin, nor do I extract him from the fold of Islaam.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>THE SIXTH ISSUE: TAJSEEM</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is also spread about the Shaikh is that he was a mujassim, i.e. that he likened Allaah’s attributes to the creation’s attributes.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh has mentioned his belief concerning this aspect, and he is far removed from the lies his opponents accuse him of. He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“From the Belief (Eemaan) in Allaah, is that one believes in what Allaah has described Himself with in His Book and upon the tongue of His Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), without committing tahreef (distortion) or ta’teel (denial). Rather, he must believe that there is nothing equal to Allaah and that he is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer. So he must not negate what Allaah described Himself with, nor should he distort the words from their true state, nor should he deny His Names and Attributes, nor should he say how Allaah’s Attributes are or resemble them to the creation’s attributes. This is because Allaah has no equals or rivals or similars, nor can He be compared to His creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Allaah is the most knowledgeable about Himself and about others, and He is the most truthful in words and the best in speech. So He has removed Himself from what His opponents from the people who commit takyeef and tamtheel have described Him with, and from what those who commit tahreef and ta’teel have negated from Him, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Far removed is your Lord, the Lord of Glory and Might, from what they ascribe to Him, and peace be on the Messengers. And all praise belongs to Allah, Lord of all that is created.’ [Surah As-Saafaat: 180-182]” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/29] “It is well known that ta’teel is the opposite of tajseem, and those who commit this (ta’teel) are enemies of those who commit that (tajseem). The truth lies in between these two (extremes).” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 3/11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">THE SEVENTH ISSUE: OPPOSING THE SCHOLARS</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people say that Shaikh Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab opposed the rest of the scholars in what he called to, not turning to their statements or relying on their books. Rather, he introduced something new and brought forth a fifth madh-hab. The best person to clarify the reality of this issue is the Shaikh himself. He (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“We are blind followers of the Book and the Sunnah and the righteous predecessors of this ummah, as well as what is relied on from the opinions of the four Imaams: Abu Haneefah An-Nu’maan bin Thaabit, Maalik bin Anas, Muhammad bin Idrees and Ahmad bin Hanbal, may Allaah have mercy on all of them.” [Mu’allafaat ash-Shaikh: 5/96]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So if you hear that I have issued a ruling on something that does not conform with the unanimous agreement of the scholars, then reject my opinion.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“If you claim that the scholars are upon something different than what I am upon, then here are their books present.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 2/58]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I challenge the follower of Abu Haneefah with the opinions of the old Hanafee scholars and also the followers of Maalik, Shaafi’ee and Hanbal with the opinions of the previous scholars of each madh-hab, who are relied upon.” [Ad-Durar as- Saniyyah: 1/82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“In summary, the thing that I forbid is when one believes that someone other than Allaah can do things that it is not possible for anyone to do except Allaah. So if I said something to this effect from myself, then accuse me of that, or in a book you find, which doesn’t adhere to this, then accuse me with that also. Or if I quoted it from the people of my madh-hab, then accuse me of that. But if I stated it based on the Command of Allaah and His Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and based on what the scholars in every madh-hab have unanimously agreed on, then it is not appropriate for a person who believes in Allaah and the Last Day to reject it due to the people of his time or the people of his country or because most of the people in his time reject it.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/76]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To conclude this discussion, we present two pieces of advice from the Shaikh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First: For those who strive against this da’wah and its followers, conspiring against it and attaching all kinds of accusations and falsehoods to it, the Shaikh says to these people:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I remind those who oppose me that the obligation upon the people is to follow what the Prophet counseled his ummah with (i.e. the Sunnah). And I say to them: The books are with you. Look in them and do not take any of my speech. However, when you come to know the words of Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) that are in your books then follow it even though most of the people oppose it…Do not (unconditionally) obey me or anyone else except for the command of Allaah’s Messenger, which is found in your books. And know that nothing can save you except for following Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam). This worldly life is temporary and it is not proper for someone with common sense to be forgetful about Paradise and Hell.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/89-90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I call those who oppose me to four things: Either the Book of Allaah or the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger or to the Ijmaa’ (consensus) of the scholars. And if he refuses this then I call him to a mubaahalah.” [2] [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second: To those who are confused about this matter, the Shaikh says: “You must constantly supplicate to Allaah and humble yourself before Him, especially during the times in which the invocations are answered, such as: the last part of the night, the last portion of the prayer and after the Adhaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And you must also use the supplications reported in the texts, especially the one that has been reported in the Saheeh, that he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) would say: ‘O Allaah, Lord of Jibraa’eel, Mikaa’eel and Israa’eel, Originator of the heavens and the earth, All-Knower of the Hidden and the Apparent, You will judge between Your servants in those matters which they differed on. Guide me in that which is differed on from the truth, by Your Will. Verily, You guide whom You will to a Straight Path.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You must be persistent in saying this supplication before the One who answers the call of the distressed when he calls, and the One who guided Ibraaheem to oppose all of the people. And say: ‘O teacher of Ibraaheem, teach me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if you find difficulty in opposing the people, then reflect on Allaah’s statement: ‘Then we placed you upon a Legislation from Our Command, so follow it, and do not follow the vain desires of those who know not. Verily, they can avail you nothing before Allaah.’ [Surah Al-Jaathiyah: 18-19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And if you obey most of those on the earth, they will mislead you far away from Allaah’s Path.’ [Surah Al-An’aam: 116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And reflect on the Prophet’s words found in the Saheeh: ‘Islaam began strange and it will return to being strange as it began’ and his (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) statement: ‘Verily Allaah will not snatch away knowledge…’ and his statement: ‘Stick to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly guided Khaleefahs who come after me’ and his statement: ‘And beware of newly invented matters, for indeed every innovation is a misguidance.’” [Ad-Durar As-Saniyyah: 1/42-43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And if it becomes clear to you that this is the truth in which there is no doubt, and that it is an obligation to spread it amongst the people and to teach it to the women and men, then may Allaah have mercy on the one fulfills his duty, repents to Allaah and acknowledges this to himself, for indeed a person who repents from a sin is like one who has no sin at all. May Allaah guide us and you and our brothers to that which He loves and is pleased with, and peace be on you.” [Ad-Durar As-Saniyyah: 2/43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah send His peace and blessings on His slave and messenger, our prophet and loved one, Muhammad, as well as His family and all of his Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s Note: Tajseem comes from the word jism (body), and it literally means to make something into a body. This is the term applied when someone gives anthropomorphic (i.e. human-like) qualities to Allaah, by saying His hand is like my hand, and His seeing is like my seeing, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Translator’s Note: A Mubaahalah is when two people who are in opposition to one another come together to invoke Allaah’s curses on the one who is lying and upon falsehood between the two disputants.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: &#8216;Abdullaah bin Salfeeq Adh-Dhufairee<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This book is a complete translation of a small booklet entitled: <b><i>“Ar-Rakaa’iz-ul-‘Ashar Lit-Tahseel-il-‘Ilmee”</i></b><i></i> (Ten Guidelines for Obtaining Knowledge) printed by Daar-ul-Minhaaj, 1st Edition, 2003.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this short treatise, the author ‘Abdullaah bin Salfeeq Adh-Dhufairee, presents concise advice to the seekers of knowledge in the format of ten simple guidelines. These guidelines cover characteristics and etiquettes that a student of knowledge should adorn himself with in order to obtain knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The treatise has been introduced and praised by Shaikh Ahmad An-Najmee, one of the elder scholars in Saudi Arabia, thus indicating its importance and benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Excerpts from the Book:</b><br />
&#8220;The greatest form of dutifulness (Taqwaa) to Allaah is making one’s intention purely for the sake of Allaah. As for the one who seeks knowledge for the sake of showing off, then apart from being a loser in this world, he will also be punished for this in the Hereafter as has been reported in the hadeeth about the three people who will be dragged on their faces into Hell, amongst whom will be a man who sought knowledge so that it could be said: <b>&#8216;He is a scholar&#8217;</b> and such was said about him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;An upright heart comes about through awareness of Allaah and knowledge of His Names, Attributes and Actions. It also comes about by way of reflecting on His signs and creations, and by pondering on the Qur’aan. An upright heart also comes about due to one constantly prostrating (in prayer) and frequently observing the night prayer.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;One of the ways that help in motivating a person to seek knowledge is: Reading the biographies of the scholars, as well as their patience and endurance in the face of trials. This also includes reading about the journeys they undertook for the sake of acquiring knowledge and obtaining Hadeeth.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Explanation of &#8220;The Meaning of Taaghoot&#8221;</p>
<p>AUTHOR: Dr. Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Khumayyis<br />
TRANSLATED: isma&#8217;eel alarcon<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p><strong>About the Book: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Before you is a complete translation of a treatise written by Imaam Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdil-Wahhaab, &#8220;<strong>Ma&#8217;anaa at-Taaghoot</strong>&#8220;, with an explanation by Dr. Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdir-Rahmaan AI-Khumayyis. The treatise, along with its explanation, was printed in a larger book: &#8220;Jam-ul-Funoon fee Sharh Jumlati Mutoon Li Aqaa&#8217;id Ahlis-Sunnah &#8216;alal-Madhaahib-il-Arba&#8217;ah <strong>[A Compilation of Explanations of Treatises on the Creed of Ahlus-Sunnah according to the Four Madh-habs</strong>] by Daar Ilaaf Publishers. The treatise was then printed as a separate booklet in order to spread the benefit and facilitate the knowledge for the readers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This treatise is one of the several treasures the great Imaam and Mujaddid, Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdil-Wahhaab, left behind. Although short in size, it provides a comprehensive breakdown of the subject at hand, which is the meaning of Taaghoot and a clarification of its principle figures.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What adds to the benefit, is the concise explanation provided by Muhammad bin Abdir-Rahmaan AI-Khumayyis, which brings to light key points of the treatise. He also adds a summary and several test questions at the end of each section, in order to facilitate the study of the material for the readers and student.</p>

<p><strong>About the Book:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a small booklet called &#8220;Al-Qadaa wal-Qadar (The Divine Pre-Decree and Ordainment of Allaah), which is a lecture from Imam Muhammad bin Saalih Al-Uthaimeen that was later transcribed and published. The current translation came from the Maktabat-ul-&#8216;llm edition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this treatise, Shaikh Ibn Al Uthaimeen clarifies the correct belief of Ahlus-Sunnah with regard to the Divine Pre-Decree, while refuting the false notions of some groups who deviated with regard to this issue such as the <strong>Qadariyyah</strong>, who believe that Allaah has no part in a person&#8217;s actions, and the <strong>Jabariyyah</strong>, who believe that a person is forced to do perform his sayings an actions by Allaah. He then lists and discusses the four levels for believing in Allaah&#8217;s Divine Pre-Decree, which are: Knowledge, Recording, Will and Creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By presenting this treatise, we hope to provide a basic and easy guide for beginning and intermediate students to learn and understand this fundamental aspect of the Religion, which is also one of the Six Pillars of Faith.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon Allah’s Messenger, his household, his companions, and whoever followed his guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed, we do advise those concerned and occupied with memorizing the Qur’an to fear Allah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) and to be dutiful to Him, for He it is Who has guided them towards that goodly and blessed direction, namely memorizing the Book of Allah. This is a tremendous affair as it is the religion of Allah which He sent down as guidance to people. So memorize the Qur’an so proficiently that it is not forgotten, for this requires patience and perseverance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It takes some people only two or three readings of a Qur’anic text to memorize it, yet this is not sufficient to firmly commit the Qur’an to one’s memory. As a matter of fact, it demands great deal of repetition and long practice and perseverance, for the Qur’an is more liable to escape (from one’s memory) than a camel from its tying rope.[1a] If a person does not strongly and meticulously commit it to his memory and on top of that neglects to study it and to read it regularly, it will certainly escape from his memory faster than a camel escapes from its tying rope. So long as Allah has guided you to study and memorize the Qur’an, it behooves you to perfect that memorization.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having done with its memorization, you should then embark on learning the Sunnah of Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) . Memorize as much as you can from it, such as ‘Umdatul- Ahkam and Bulugh Al-Maram. Memorize Imam Muhammad Ibn Adbulwahhab’s Book of Tawhid, whose subject matter is the tawhid of worship; and Imam Ibn Taymia’s “Al- Aqidatul-Wasitiyah”, on the topic of tawhid pertaining to the Names and Attributes and on the topic of ‘aqidah and manhaj. These are the foundations of Islam. If you learn them strongly and accurately, all of your ‘aqidah and manhaj related matters will be rectified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, I advise you to be sincere towards Allah, the Lord of the Universe, for all these matters that I have mentioned to you, i.e. memorizing the Qur’an and memorizing these texts and books, are amongst the greatest acts of worship whereby we seek nearness to Allah. We are in need of sincerity towards Allah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) with regards to these acts. So cultivate yourselves upon sincerity towards Allah, the Lord of the Universe, and study the texts that encourage towards sincerity from Riyadus-Salihin and from other than it, from the Qur’an itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says: <span style="color:#008000;">And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allah, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him).</span>(Qur’an, 98:5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Say (O Muhammad): &#8220;Verily, I am commanded to worship Allah (Alone) by obeying Him and doing religious deeds sincerely for Allah&#8217;s sake only and not to show off, and not to set up rivals with Him in worship</span>. (Qur’an, 39:11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah commands the Messenger (peace be upon him) to single Him out for worship and orders him to be sincere. Similarly, He commands the Ummah and those who follow him to be sincere. No act of worship is accepted unless it is carried out with sincerity, for sincerity is a great condition from the conditions for accepting acts of worship. Any act of worship that is performed seeking nearness to Allah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) must fulfill two conditions: sincerity towards Allah and following the Messenger (peace be upon him) ; that is to say, your deed should emanate from the Book and the Sunnah and be established upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness, i.e. by following the Messenger (peace be upon him) , and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord.</span>(Qur’an, 18:110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is to say, neither type of shirk should enter into this worship, be it major or minor shirk such as showing off.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, sincerity is an affair that is of considerable importance, and without it acts of worship are null and void, and are of no benefit in this life as well as in the hereafter. Worse still, they should bring destruction upon the one who performs them. For the one who shows off, Allah shall make a display of him; and the one who seeks to be heard, Allah shall expose him and disgrace him on the Day of Resurrection before those who will be witnessing. So do not recite the Qur’an in order to be said about you that so-and-so is a reciter. Indeed, one of the first three people upon whom hellfire will be enflamed is such a reciter. As the noble Messenger (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the first people who will be judged on the Day of Resurrection are: a man who died as a martyr. He will be brought forth, and He (Allah) will make His favors known to him and he will acknowledge them. Allah will say: What did you do with them? He will say: I fought in Your cause until I died as a martyr. Allah will say: You have lied. Rather, you fought in order to be said that you are brave, and that was said. Then a command will be passed regarding him and he will be dragged along on his face until he is cast into Hellfire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And a man who acquired knowledge and taught it (to others), and learned the Qur’an and taught it (to others). He will be brought forth, and He (Allah) will make His favors known to him and he will acknowledge them. Allah will say: What did you do with them? He will say: I obtained knowledge and taught it and recited the Qur’an for Your sake. Allah will say: you have lied. Rather, you acquired knowledge so as to be said that you are a knowledgeable man and recited the Qur’an so as to be said that you are a reciter, and that was said. Then a command will be passed regarding him and he will be dragged along on his face until he is cast into Hellfire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And a man whom Allah increased his provision and granted every type of wealth. He will be brought forth, and He (Allah) will make His favors known to him and he will acknowledge them. Allah will say: What did you do with them? He will say: I left no way in which You like money to be spent without spending in it for Your sake. Allah will say: you have lied. Rather, you did that in order to be said that you are a generous man, and that was said. Then a command will be passed regarding him and he will be dragged along on his face until he is cast into Hellfire.[<em>Reported by Muslim (1905) from the narration of Abu Hurairah radhi Allaahu anhu</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadith causes fear in every Muslim and makes him think seriously about every action he performs, every word he utters, and every movement he makes. It makes him observe Allah in everything he does. It behooves every believer to try to be from the people of uprightness and people of sincerity and to achieve the level of Ihsan in his worship, and that is to worship Allah as if you see Him, and since you do not see Him then He sees you. Therefore, it is binding upon man to cultivate himself upon these affairs, not to be cultivated upon the love of showing off and fame or any insignificant worldly pursuits and interests that do not weigh with Allah the wing of a mosquito. So you recite the Qur’an and memorize it so as to act upon it. Hence, the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the senior companions used to read ten verses to the other companions in order to memorize them and never moved on to other verses until they had memorized them and acted upon them, so they used to acquire knowledge and action simultaneously. This is a great manner of cultivation that Muslims have become totally oblivious to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Messenger (peace be upon him) , then Allah revealed the Qur’an to him gradually in sequential parts in proportion to the events and occasions over a period of twenty-three years. All this was done in order to raise the Ummah upon understanding this Qur’an, acting upon it, and implementing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (peace be upon him) used to teach them the Qur’an part by part, ten verses in each, and explain to them its meaning so that they would learn it and implement it. They would not proceed to the next text until they have grasped its meaning and put it into action. If it were a text pertaining to ‘aqidah, they would hold as a belief what is contained therein; if it were an exhortation to fight in the cause of Allah, they would hope in fighting in the cause of Allah or would actually set off for the battleground; and if it were an exhortation to charity and a righteous act or a promise of reward or a warning, they would never surpass it until they have fully comprehended all its content.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a great cultivation indeed, yet people now are not capable of it. O young people! Bear this in your minds, for the Ummah is in need of sincere scholars who are free from whims and desires and purely devoted to Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brothers, nowadays desires are blowing the youth of the Ummah away (from the right salafi path) &#8212; desires pertaining to partisanship and other than it. A student of knowledge would devote himself sincerely to teaching the Qur’an, yet would be umbilically attached to parties that do not act upon that Qur’an but rather follow their own desires. So beware of this type of people, and upon you is sincerity towards Allah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala), seeking knowledge and acting upon the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of Allah’s Messenger. And I hope that you continue to pursue that 10 A WORD OF ADVICE FOR THOSE MEMORIZING THE BOOK OF ALLAH blessed course which started with memorizing the Qur’an until you become from the firmly established scholars whom Allah has praised and in whose favor He has said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allah.</span>[Qur’an, 35:28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So much so, that some people of knowledge have stated that knowledge is fear of Allah, and this is not attainable except for scholars, scholars who have true knowledge of Allah, uphold His Names and Attributes and worship Allah therewith, and believe in Paradise as if they see it with their very eyes and believe in Hell as if they see it with their very eyes. In line with this, Handhalah ? said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr met me and said: How are you, Handhalah? I replied: Handhalah has become a munafiq (i.e. hypocrite).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: Glorified is Allah! What are you saying? I said: When we are in the company of Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him)  and he reminds us of Hell and Paradise, it is as if we can see them with our very eyes. But when we leave the company of Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) , we turn to our wives, children and properties, and so we tend to forget much (of what we heard from him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is to say, they become busy with farming and attending to their wives, etc. which he deemed to be hypocrisy. When he is in the company of Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him), he is in a different state from that when he is away from his company.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr said: By Allah! I do experience the same. So I and Abu Bakr went to Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) and entered upon him. I said: Handhalah has become a munafiq (i.e. hypocrite), O Allah’s Messenger. So Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) said: And what’s that? I replied: When we are in your company and you remind us of Hell and Paradise, it is as if we can see them with our very eyes. But when we leave your company, we turn to our wives, children and properties, and so we tend to forget much (of what we hear from you). Thereupon, Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) said: By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, if you persist upon that state which you achieve in my company and upon remembering (Allah), the Angels will shake hands with you in your beds and in your pathways; however, O Handhalah, there is time for this and time for that. He said this three times.[<em>Reported by Muslim (2750)</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet who amongst us now reaches that level?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah has commanded that this Qur’an be contemplated: <span style="color:#008000;">That they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may remember</span> [Qur’an, 38:29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By Allah, the souls cannot rise to that high levels or come up to the same standing as that of the companions. Yet the Qur’an is the means of elevation. By Allah, souls shall never rise to high levels except through this Qur’an and this Sunnah. Through genuine commitment, sincere belief and open sensibility, souls and minds get uplifted to superior status such that this world becomes of little worth to them and their lives become just as insignificant. Hence when the companions of Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) used to sit with him, it was as if they saw Paradise with their own eyes. Due to the strength of their belief, they presented their hearts and souls as a sacrifice in the cause of Allah for they deemed them to be of no value.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now you see many Muslims thoroughly preoccupied with this worldly life, such that al-wahan has crept up on us, and that is the love for this worldly life and hatred of death. Thus with this kind of life and with the deviant cultivation they acquire at misguided schools, Muslims have become scum, as the scum on a stream of water. By Allah, were they to understand this Qur’an, to be raised upon it in the correct manner, and to found their ‘aqidah and manhaj upon it, this condition of theirs would alter completely. Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When you conduct ‘inah [1] transaction, and you follow the tails of cows, and you are content with farming, and you abandon jihad, Allah shall inflict disgrace upon you which He will not withdraw until you return to your religion.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is to say, to that Qur’an and to the Sunnah by way of understanding it, implementing it, believing in it, and recognizing its lofty status with Allah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala), and with His Messenger and with the believers. If they return (to their religion) with this kind of spirit, Allah will reestablish their position and status in this life. But if they did not acknowledge the status of this Qur’an and went about taking their aqidah from here and there and importing their manhaj from here and there, they would be moving from one pitfall to another until they recover their awareness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The youth need to learn the Qur’an and to get the proper cultivation (based upon it) and to recognize its lofty status. They should also display the banner of the Qur’an and the Sunnah to the Ummah by spreading and disseminating the essence of the Qur’an which will raise them to the high standing that the companion achieved, in order that the Ummah return to its genuine religion &#8212; the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger (peace be upon him) , not this party, nor that group, nor that school of thought, nor that other sect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Implementing the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger (peace be upon him) is the one and the only way out. There is no other remedy for the Ummah except that. All these distorted visions and empty slogans destroy the Ummah worse and worse. They are of no avail or use to the Ummah in any way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If memorizing and learning the Qur’an and the Sunnah is done with the purpose of ensuring victory and support for one’s party, then this is not the correct way. Today we find those who study to obtain degrees in order to promote their own parties, such that they distort and twist the religion of Allah and the speech of the scholars, all this in favor of their own parties. Some read the Qur’an as a means to promote their own party, some read the Qur’an as a means to promote their own sect, while others read the Qur’an as a means to promote their own ‘aqidah and manhaj. No! This is not the correct way. The correct way is to submit to the Qur’an and the Sunnah, not to direct them (i.e. the course of their interpretation) according to your frame of mind and desire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We want memorizers of the Qur’an who understand it and comprehend it in accordance with the understanding of the righteous salaf, not the understanding of the people of innovations and misguidance or the understanding of the deviant parties. No matter what, do not put your trust in these parties, and do not lean towards them in matters of your religion. Rather, turn to the books of the salaf, the books of ‘aqidah, the books of hadith, the likes of the two Sahihs, the four books of Sunan [3], Ahmad’s Musnad, and other Masanid [4] and Ma’ajim [5]. We advise you to turn to these books, not to nashids and movies and other nonsense that has compromised and softened the youth of this Ummah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These people have no knowledge. Therefore, it is obligatory that the youth be warned against their nonsense and their tricks and deception. They raise the youth upon fun and amusement and upon love for that. This was not the case with the companions, the followers, nor with the Imams up to this time of ours. Now amusement has become the primary occupation and interest before anything else. While the neglectful person intends to occupy himself with seeking knowledge, these people divert him towards these means of entertainment, namely nashids, movies, music, and so on and so forth. Indeed they have caused this Ummah more calamities on top of the ones it is already suffering. They claimed to save the Ummah from the state of loss it has come to, yet they only added to its trials and tribulations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is important though is that the sole remedy lies in the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger and the way of the salaf. That is to say, how they used to cultivate themselves, how their relationship with the Qur’an was, what their occupation was and how they spent their time. To the salaf, time was more precious than gold, yet now countless hours are wasted in amusement and absolute nonsense. Therefore, be cautious, O brothers, and commit yourselves to memorizing the Book of Allah and invest your time in memorizing it and memorizing the Sunnah, then memorizing some portion of the mutun (texts) that I mentioned to you above, and then acquire knowledge from scholars and traverse this path upon that clear and noble methodology. After that you will become the men of this Ummah, and by the Will of Allah you shall direct it towards goodness by means of knowledge, proof, and evidence and the correct cultivation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah to save the Ummah by virtue of sincere men, and sincere men do not materialize except through the way part of which I elucidated above that is attained through correct cultivation upon the Qur’an and the Sunnah and holding in high esteem the manhaj of the salaf and keeping steadfast upon it and leading the Ummah to that good and to that path of guidance. We ask our Lord to accomplish that, for verily our Lord is indeed All-Hearer of invocation. And peace and blessings be upon Allah’s Messenger, his household, and his companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This book is a complete translation of a transcribed lecture from Shaikh Saalih Al-Fawzaan entitled: <b>“<i>Naseehah Lil-Mar’at-il-Muslimah</i>”</b> (Advice to the Muslim Woman). The source used for this translation was the book Muhaadaraat fil-‘Aqeedah wad-Da’wah, a large compilation of over 25 transcribed lectures from Shaikh Saalih Al-Fawzaan on issues of Creed and Methodology (vol. 3, pg. 281-299, Markaz Fajr, 2003 Edition)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this particular lecture, Shaikh Saalih Al-Fawzaan covers many important topics related to women, such as veiling, being in privacy with male-strangers, traveling without a mahram and other things that are critical for a Muslim woman to understand and implement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This treatise will be included as the fourth essay in the forthcoming second publication of the veiling book published by Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing, which will be entitled “Four Essays on the Obligation of Veiling” by the Will of Allaah. May Allaah facilitate its publication.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Excerpts from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Both a man and a woman must cover their private parts with ample coverings, since this preserves morals. As for shamelessness and nudity, these are things that lead to the corruption of morality, the loss of honor, and the spreading of lewdness. But when the private parts are concealed with the covering that Allaah has instructed the men and women to abide by, this protects the private parts from fornication and homosexuality and it protects the private parts from the unlawful things that Allaah has prohibited.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allaah ordered that the women be asked from behind a Hijaab. What is meant by the word Hijaab is: Anything that covers a woman whether a garment, a wall, a door or any other object that can be used to screen a woman from a man when he is talking to her or asking her about something or handing her something. All of these should be done from behind a Hijaab, i.e. from behind a screen or covering. So he should not make any contact with her while she is unscreened or lacking covering and exposed. Rather, she must be behind a screen that covers her, regardless if it is her garment, her door, a wall or so on. This is since this is <b>&#8216;purer for your hearts and their hearts&#8217;</b> from temptation. If women screen themselves by way of a Hijaab and the gaze of men does not fall upon them, the hearts of both the men and women will be saved from temptation and enticement. This is clearly visible in the Muslim societies that strictly adhere to the Hijaab.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;As for what we hear about today from some ignoramuses that a husband’s brother, paternal uncle or other male relative can greet his wife, shake her hand, be alone with her and enter into her presence – this is baseless. It is not permissible for a non-mahram to enter into the presence of a woman (without Hijaab), nor to shake her hand, nor to be alone in privacy with her unless there is someone else in the house through which the privacy will be removed. But as for him entering into a house that has no one in it but her, and he is not one of her mahaarim, then this is the forbidden type of privacy and it is dangerous.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a woman has a need to speak to a man that is not one of her mahaarim, she may speak to him, but with a casual tone that has no softness or gentleness in it and not in a joking or laughing manner. Rather, her speech must be ordinary and in accordance with what necessity dictates – i.e. a question and an answer – as per the need only. She must not speak in a tone that appears friendly, laughing or teasing, or in a mellow or beautified voice, thus stirring the desires of the one who has a disease in his heart. This is based on Allaah’s saying: <b>&#8216;But rather speak in an honorable manner.&#8217;</b> [Surah Al-Ahzaab: 32]&#8221;</p>

Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This book is a complete translation of the concise booklet <b><i>“Fildhaat-ul-Akbaad Huqooq-ul-Awlaad”</i></b> (Your Flesh and Blood: A Lecture on the Rights of Children). The source used for the translation was the 2006 Daar-ul-Istiqaamah Edition. The origin of this publication in the Arabic language was a lecture the Shaikh gave which was then transcribed and published in book format. All quotes and narrations are referenced in the original publication.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Although small in size, this booklet presents the readers with a valuable discussion on some of the rights and privileges of children, which parents are obligated to fulfill. Indeed, it is not only the children who will be asked concerning their behavior towards their parents on the Day of Judgement but also the parents will be asked concerning their children and how they raised them. Therefore, we must know the rights of our children and strive to fulfill our duties towards them so that they in turn may serve as righteous deeds for us and benefit us after we die.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Muhammad Baazmool is one of the well known people of knowledge in Saudi Arabia. Currently, he serves as a member of the teachers’ committee in the College of Da’wah and Usool-ud-Deen at Umm-ul-Qurraa University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia. He has authored numerous books and given many lectures, some of which have been transcribed, as is the case with this booklet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Excerpts from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah has given importance to the caring and maintaining of our flesh and blood since their inception – from the time that a Muslim thinks about getting married. The Messenger ordered every youth to strive towards marriage on the condition that he can accommodate a wife, i.e. he has the ability to fulfill the responsibilities of marriage and the obligations of marital life.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Thereafter, he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) ordered us to choose a righteous wife. This is since the Messenger informed us of the effect that a person’s immediate family has over him in the narration reported by Abu Salamah bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan who related from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: <b>‘There is no child except that he is born upon true faith (Fitrah), but it is his parents that make him a Jew or a Christian or a Zoroastrian. Just as an animal gives birth to a baby animal that is whole, do you find it mutilated?’</b> Then Abu Hurairah recited: <b>‘…the Fitrah of Allaah which He created mankind upon.’</b> [Surah Ar-Room: 30]”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Messenger of Allaah has instructed us how to expiate this fitnah. Hudhaifah reported: ‘We were sitting one day with ‘Umar when he asked us: ‘Which one of you memorized the words of Allaah’s Messenger concerning trials?’ I replied: ‘I did, just as he said it.’ He said: ‘You are quick to respond!!’ I said: <b>‘A man’s trials with regard to his family, his wealth, his children and his neighbor are expiated by prayer, fasting, charity, and commanding (good) and forbidding (evil).’</b>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“A Muslim may work and comply with all of the things (we just mentioned) and ask Allaah for success and assistance. However, what occurs may be something other than what you intended. So you must know that this is part of Allaah’s Divine Decree which He has allowed to occur. Just look at the son of the messenger of Allaah, Nooh, and at how he wasn’t righteous. And look at the wife of Loot who also wasn’t righteous, as well as the wife of Nooh, even though they were married to prophets of Allaah. Allaah says: <b>‘And Nooh called upon his Lord and said: ‘O my Lord, verily my son is of my family! And certainly Your promise is true, and You are the most just of judges. He said: ‘O Nooh! Surely, he is not of your family. Verily, it is an act that is dishonorable. So do not ask Me about that of which you have no knowledge. I admonish you lest you should be one of the ignorant.’ Nooh said: ‘O my Lord! I seek refuge in you from asking You about that which I have no knowledge of. And unless You forgive me and have mercy on me, I would indeed be one of the losers.’</b> [Surah Hood: 45-47]”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/forbidden-business-transactions-in-islaam-shaykh-fawzan-al-ibaanah-com.pdf" target="_blank">Dowload PDF of Forbidden Business Transactions in Islaam- Shaykh Fawzan- Al-Ibaanah.com</a>]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Introduction to the Book</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah and may the peace and blessings of Allaah be on His Final Messenger, his family and those who follow him in goodness until the Day of Recompense. To Proceed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a small booklet entitled <strong>“<em>Al-Buyoo’ al-Munhee ‘anhaa fil-Islaam” </em></strong>[Forbidden Business Transactions in Islaam] by the noble scholar of Saudi Arabia, Shaikh Saalih bin Fawzaan Al-Fawzaan, may Allaah preserve him. The original source for this book was a recording of a lecture he gave in 1411H in a masjid in Saudi Arabia . The book was chosen due to the importance of this topic amongst Muslims in the West. This is because as the number of Muslims in the lands of the West increase and the communities grow, the need for instituting Muslim-owned businesses that will support and benefit these Muslim communities also grows.And since it is not befitting for the Muslims to engage in matters without knowledge, we felt a need to present this small but informative book to our readers for the purpose of providing knowledge on those matters, which Allaah and His Messenger have warned us against and forbidden with regard to everyday business transactions. You will find that this treatise is not only intended for the businessman who buys merchandise and sells to his customers, but also for the purchasers who buy the products. The Shaikh spends much of the time focusing on several products that are forbidden to buy, sell and promote, but yet which have found their way into Muslim communities in large quantities, such as music, alcohol and cigarettes. We hope that every Muslim benefits from this book, by avoiding buying or selling those products that have been forbidden and abstaining from conducting business schemes that are against Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Written by: isma’eel alarcon on April 26, 2002</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In the Name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>From the Lecture: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allaah, Lord of the Worlds, and may the peace and blessings be upon the chief of all Messengers and upon his family and all of his Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a short treatise on the subject of Prohibited types of business transactions, which has been compiled so that the Muslim can avoid them in his daily affairs – so that his earnings can be from the lawful, which Allaah will benefit him with in this life and the next. Originally, the source for this treatise was a lecture I gave at Masjid Sumoo Walee al-‘Ahd Al-Ameer ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Abdil-‘Azeez Aali Su’ood in Riyadh in the month of Jumaadal-Oolaa 1411H. The following is the transcription of that lecture:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Brothers! There is no doubt that commerce and business are two things that are required and necessary. This is because Allaah has commanded us to seek after gaining provision and sustenance for ourselves according to the proper channels generally. And specifically, He said concerning commerce (i.e. buying and selling): <em> </em><strong><em>“But Allaah has permitted trading and forbidden interest (Ribaa).”</em></strong> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 275]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says: <strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em> “O you who believe, when the prayer is called for on the Day of Jumu’ah, then rush to the Remembrance of Allaah and leave off the trading (commerce). That is better for you if you did but know. And when the prayer is finished then spread throughout the land and seek from Allaah’s Bounty and remember Allaah much in order that you may be successful.”</em></strong> [Surah Al-Jumu’ah: 9-10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says, praising those who combine between their seeking of sustenance (<em>rizq</em>) and their performing of worship:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“In houses (masaajid), which Allaah has ordered to be raised, and in which His name is mentioned. He is glorified therein during the mornings and the evenings. Men whom neither business nor commerce diverts them away from the Remembrance of Allaah, nor from performing the Prayer or giving the Zakaat.”</em></strong> [Surah An-Noor: 36-37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this ayah, Allaah states that from the attributes of the Muslims is that they buy and sell (i.e. they trade). But when the time for prayer comes, they leave off the buying and selling and head for the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“Neither trading nor business diverts them away from the Remembrance of Allaah.”</em></strong> [Surah An-Noor: 37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has commanded us to seek after the means of sustenance (<em>rizq</em>) along with the command to worship Him, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“So seek your provision from Allaah and worship Him (alone). And be grateful to Him, to Him you will return.”</em></strong> [Surah Al-‘Ankaboot: 17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So conducting business by buying and selling or any of the other types of permissible ways of earning provision is something that is required according to the Religion since tremendous benefits will result from that for both the individual and the society.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Buying and Selling, in itself, are both praiseworthy and necessary, so long as they do not cause harm to one’s worship or cause him to delay performing the prayer in congregation in the masaajid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<em>The honest and trustworthy businessman will be with the prophets, martyrs and righteous people</em>.” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means: The businessman who buys and sells while being honest will be with these groups of people on the Day of Judgement. This is a great position, which indicates the nobility of holding such an occupation. And the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) was once asked as to which kind of earning was the most purest? So he responded:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<em>A blessed trading (accepted by Allaah) and the labor a man does with his hand.</em>” </strong> [Reported by At-Tabaraanee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“The two persons conducting a business are in a state of goodness so long as they do not separate from one another. So if they are both honest and open with one another, they are blessed in their transaction. But if they lie and conceal (the truth), the blessing of their transaction is wiped out.” </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So doing business while being honest and righteous is from the best ways of earning sustenance. As for conducting business with lies, fraud, swindling and deception, then this is from the worst forms of earning sustenance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) once passed by a group of Muslims who were buying and selling in the marketplace of Madeenah. So the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em> ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O you gathering of traders!” So they raised their heads waiting to hear what he would say. He said: “Indeed the traders will be resurrected as sinful evil-doers (<em>fujaar</em>) except for those who fear (are dutiful to) Allaah, are righteous and honest.” </strong> [Reported by At-Tirmidhee who said it was hasan saheeh]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet himself (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) engaged in business transactions during the first part of his life, when he used to manage the money of Khadeejah. This was before the advent of his prophethood. And he would buy and sell and gain profit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the same for the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger – they would buy and sell and trade. And there were found wealthy people amongst them who used their wealth to support the Jihaad in Allaah’s Cause, such as ‘Uthmaan bin ‘Affaan (<em>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</em>) who supplied the poor in the army with equipment. And such was ‘Abdur-Rahmaan bin ‘Awf (<em>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</em>) who would donate money to the Muslims at the time of need and at the time of Jihaad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And such was Abu Bakr as-Sideeq (<em>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</em>) for he would buy and sell and sacrifice his wealth to support Islaam and the Muslims, from the time he was in Makkah before migrating, as well as after migrating. He would give away much and much of his wealth for the Cause of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, seeking the means of sustenance according to the permissible channels the greatest of which are buying and selling – has much good in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, this buying and selling must be set with religious guidelines, so that the Muslim can avoid falling into forbidden transactions and unlawful forms of earning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) has forbidden us from certain types of business transactions due to what they contain from sinful means of earning and what is found in them from dangers to mankind and the taking of wealth unjustly. From these types of prohibited transactions are:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong> When the buying and selling keeps one preoccupied from performing worship</strong> , i.e. they take away from the time of the worship, such as when a person is busy buying and selling and holds back from praying in congregation in the masjid, to the point that he misses it or misses part of it. This is forbidden. Allaah says:</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em> “O you who believe, when the prayer is called for on the Day of Jumu’ah, then rush to the Remembrance of Allaah and leave off the trading (commerce). That is better for you if you did but know. So when the prayer is finished then spread throughout the land and seek from Allaah’s Bounty and remember Allaah much in order that you may be successful.” </em></strong> [Surah Al-Jumu’ah: 9-10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says in another ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“O you who believe! Do not let you wealth or your children divert you from the Remembrance of Allaah. And whoever does that, then such are the losers.” </em></strong>[Surah Al-Munaafiqoon: 9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Take note of Allaah’s saying: <strong>“…then such are the losers.” </strong>He rules upon them that they are losers even though they may be wealthy, having amassed hoards of money even if they may have many children.This is because their wealth and their children cannot replace what they missed out on from the Remembrance of Allaah. So even if they gain a profit or earn income in this world, they will still be losers in every sense of the word. They can only be profiting in reality if they combine between these two good things. If they were to combine between the seeking of sustenance and the worship of Allaah, by buying and selling when it is time for buying and selling and attending the prayer when it is time for prayer, then they would have combined between the good of this life and the good of the Hereafter. And they would have acted on Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>  </em><strong><em>“So seek your provision from Allaah and worship Him (alone)”</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>  <em>“So when the prayer is finished then spread throughout the land and seek from Allaah’s Bounty.”</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>  </strong>Therefore, commerce is of two types – the commerce of the worldly life and the commerce of the next life (Hereafter). The commerce of this life is with wealth and with earnings while the commerce of the next life is with righteous actions. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em> “O you who believe, shall I not direct you to a trade (i.e. commerce) that will save you from a painful punishment? Believe in Allaah and His Messenger and strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allaah with your wealth and your lives. That will be better for you, if you but knew! (If you do so), He will forgive you your sins and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow and pleasant dwellings in the gardens of ‘Adan (i.e. Paradise). That is indeed the great success. And He will also give you another (blessing), which you will love – help from Allaah and a near victory. So give glad tidings to the believers.” </em></strong> [Surah As-Saff: 10-13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the immense commerce, which is profitable. So if the permissible commerce of this worldly life is attached to it, it becomes good upon good. But if a person limits his commerce to solely that of this worldly life while abandoning the commerce of the Hereafter, he becomes a loser, as Allaah says: <strong>“…then such are the losers.” </strong>[Surah Al-Munaafiqoon: 9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, if a person were to turn his attention to performing worship and establishing</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">the prayer, and if were to remember Allaah much, by doing what Allaah commanded him to do, Allaah would surely open the doors of sustenance for him. As a matter of fact, the prayer is a means for attaining sustenance (<em>rizq</em>), as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“And command your family with prayer and be patient in offering them. We are not asking you to provide Us with sustenance (rizq). (Rather), We will provide for you and the good end is for those who have Taqwaa.” </em></strong> [Surah TaHa: 132]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the prayer, which some people claim takes time away from them seeking after the <em>rizq </em>(sustenance) and from buying and selling, is in fact the opposite of what they claim. It opens for them the door of provision, comfort and blessing. This is because the sustenance (<em>rizq</em>) is in the Hand of Allaah. So if you were to turn your attention towards remembering Him and worshipping Him, He would facilitate and open the door of sustenance for you. <strong>“And Allaah is the best of Providers.” </strong>[Surah Al-Jumu’ah: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says, describing the worship of the believers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>  </strong>“In houses (masaajid), which Allaah has ordered to be raised, and in which His name is mentioned. He is glorified therein during the mornings and the evenings. (They are) Men whom neither business nor commerce diverts them away from the Remembrance of Allaah, nor from performing the Prayer or giving the Zakaat. They fear a day when the hearts and the eyes will be overturned out of fear (of the horrors of the Day of Judgement).” [Surah An-Noor: 36-37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In explanation of this ayah, some of the Salaf said: “They (the Sahaabah) would buy and sell, but when one of them heard the mua’dhin calling to prayer, and the scale was still in his hand, he would drop the scale and head out for the prayer.” So as stated before, the point is that if the buying and selling preoccupies you from performing your prayer, then this commerce is forbidden and futile. And the money earned from it is Haraam (unlawful) and filthy.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>And from the forbidden types of business is: <strong>Selling a forbidden commodity</strong>. This is because when Allaah makes something forbidden, He also makes taking money for it forbidden, such as when someone sells something that is forbidden to be sold.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) forbade that dead animals, khamr (i.e. wine), swine and statues be sold .So whoever sells dead animals, i.e. meat for which no prescribed Zakaat was given, then he has sold a dead animal and earned unlawful money. This goes the same for selling khamr. What is meant by the word khamr is everything that intoxicates, based on the Prophet’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>  </em><strong><em>“Every intoxicant is khamr and every kind of khamr is Haraam (unlawful).”</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>  </strong>And he (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) cursed ten people with regard to khamr, as is recorded in the authentic hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“Verily Allaah cursed khamr – the one who produces it and the one for whom it is produced, the one who sells it and the one who buys it, the one who drinks it and the one who earns from the sale of it, the one who carries it and the one who it is carried to, and the one who serves it.” </em></strong> [Reported by At-Tirmidhee and Ibn Maajah]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Khamr is every type of intoxicant regardless of whether it is called khamr or alcoholic beverages or liquor or wine or whiskey. It doesn’t matter if it is called by any of these or other names – changing the name does not change the fact that it is khamr. It has been reported in a hadeeth that: <strong>“There will come a people during the Last days that will call khamr by another name and drink it.” </strong>Also, what is worse than this is selling narcotics, such as <strong>hasheesh and opium</strong>, as well as other types of drugs, which are being dealt out to the people in these days. So the one who sells it and deals it is a criminal – in the eyes of the Muslims <strong><em>and </em></strong>in the eyes of the whole world. This is because drugs kill people, so it is like a destructive weapon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, anyone who sells drugs or distributes it or assists in its distribution all of them fall under the curse of Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>). And taking money from it is from the wickedest of acts and the most detestable of gains. Furthermore, the one who deals drugs deserves to be executed because he is one of those who cause mischief in the land.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same goes for selling <strong>cigarettes and qaat </strong>(leaves that are chewed in Arabian lands). Cigarettes are harmful and they cause diseases to occur. In fact, all of the characteristics of <em>khubth </em>(wickedness) are gathered together in cigarettes. There is no benefit in smoking in any way whatsoever. Its harms are many. The one with the worst kind of breath, the most despicable appearance and the most burdensome to accompany out of all people is the one who smokes cigarettes. If he sits next to you or he rides next to you in a car or on a plane, you feel constricted by the smoke he makes and its foul stench. The odor coming from his mouth is bad enough when he breathes in your face, so how much more so if he were to smoke in your presence and the cigarette smoke were to float in your face! The matter would be worse. So smoking is wicked from all perspectives and there isn’t any benefit found in it. Therefore, it is forbidden without any hesitation or doubt. It is unlawful to smoke based on several perspectives, not just one.When one smokes, he throws away money and wastes time. Cigarettes disfigure the face, blacken the lips and stain the teeth. As for the diseases that are caused by it, then they are many. Many people have been afflicted by it and yet they take it lightly and as something trivial. This is even to the point that some are suffering from its effects even though they never smoked and they hate smoking. However, they sold it to the people because they loved to make money any way they could. But these people don’t know that this type of business spoils all of their earnings, because some of them mix the money they make from it with their business and so they spoil it, since (doing this) is forbidden and disobedience (to Allaah). Sustenance is not to be sought from Allaah through disobeying Him. Rather, sustenance and provision are to be sought from Allaah by way of obeying Him. Whatever Allaah has ordained for you from <em>rizq </em>(sustenance) will surely come to you. If you seek after it while being obedient to Allaah (in all that He commands and prohibits), He will facilitate and bless your wealth.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Another type of forbidden business is: <strong>Selling musical and entertainment instruments </strong>in all of their various forms, such as stringed instruments and wind instruments or musical appliances and all of the instruments that are used for that purpose, even if they are called by other names such as “technical apparatuses.”</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is Haraam (unlawful) for the Muslim to sell these instruments and appliances because it is an obligation to destroy them and not have any of them remain in the lands of the Muslims. So if this is the case, how can they be sold? And how can one take money for them? This is from the forbidden acts!</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>And from the forbidden types of business transactions is: <strong>Selling images (i.e.pictures, statues)</strong>. The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) forbade us from selling statues, and what was intended by statues was (all life) images. This is because originally statues are based on image representations, regardless of whether it is representing horses, birds, animals or human beings. Everything that has a spirit (<em>rooh</em>), then selling an image of it is Haraam, and the money made from it is Haraam.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) cursed the image-makers and he informed us that they will be the ones with the worst and most severe punishment on the Day of Judgement. Likewise, it is not permissible to sell <strong>magazines that are filled with pictures</strong>, especially if these magazines contain immoral pictures (i.e. of naked women). This is because along with the fact that they contains pictures, which are forbidden, they also serve as <em>fitnah </em>(temptation) and an incitement towards doing evil acts. This is since when a man looks at a picture of a beautiful girl who is exposing some of her features or she is uncovering some of her body (i.e. naked), then most of the time this will rouse the man’s desires. And these desires will lead this individual to commit lewd and criminal acts. This is exactly what the devils amongst mankind and the jinn hope for by the distribution and sale of these pictures.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, from a higher perspective, is <strong>selling immoral movies </strong>(i.e. pornographic films), especially videotapes, which the Muslim communities have poured into the arena of their homes. These movies display images of naked women in them as well as images of lewd and immoral sexual acts! These movies tempt and incite the young men and women and cause them to be raised upon loving this kind of immorality.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is not permissible to sell these kinds of lewd films. Rather, it is binding upon you to prevent, destroy and distance these films away from the Muslim environments.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So anyone who opens a store to sell (or rent) these immoral videotapes, he has in fact opened a place for the disobedience of Allaah to be conducted and he has earned unlawful and illegal money, if he uses it or spends it on his family. Rather, he has opened up a place of <em>fitnah </em>(mischief) and a fortress for the Devil.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>And also from the forbidden types of business transactions is: <strong>Selling Tapes in which are recorded immoral songs, </strong>with the voices of male and female singers accompanied by music. And these songs consist of words that talk about lust, infatuation and craze for women. So it is forbidden (Haraam) to listen to, record and sell these songs. And taking money for it is considered unlawful earnings and illegal gains, which Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) forbade severely since they spread evil and immorality. And they corrupt one’s manners and transport evil into the homes of the Muslims.</li>
<li>And from the forbidden types of business transactions is: Selling something which the buyer will use towards committing Haraam. So if the seller knows that the buyer will use the product he is buying to commit some forbidden act, then selling it to him is forbidden and void. This is because you will be assisting him upon sinfulness and transgression, and Allaah says:</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“And help one another towards piety and fearing of Allaah, and do not help one another towards sinfulness and transgression.”</em></strong> [Surah Al-Maa’idah: 2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So for example, if someone buys grapes or dates for the purpose of making wine from them, or he buys a sword for the purpose of killing Muslims with it or for the purpose of committing highway robbery or to be tyrannical or a troublemaker and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everyone that will use a product against what Allaah has forbidden or will use it in a way Allaah has forbidden, then selling that product to him is not permissible. This is if one knows for sure that the buyer will do that or he suspects for the most part that he will do that.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>And from the forbidden types of business transactions is: <strong>When a man sells something that he doesn’t own</strong>. For example, a man goes to a businessman looking for a specific product, but this businessman doesn’t have this specific product. Yet they both agree to a contract (for the sale of the product) and agree on the extent of the price (on the item) presently or in the future. And all the while, the product is not found in the possession of the businessman or the buyer. Then the businessman goes and buys this product and hands it over to the buyer after they already agreed to a price and they made a contract and determined the value as it relates to present terms or in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this kind of business transaction is haraam. Why? Because he sold something he didn’t own and he sold something before gaining possession of it, if the product was specified. As for if the product was not specified and its price was delayed, he actually sold a debt on credit. The Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) forbade us from doing that, as was the case when Hakeem bin Hazaam (<em>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</em>) came to him, saying: “O Messenger of Allaah, what if a man comes to me wanting to buy something from me, but I don’t have it. Then I go to the marketplace and buy it for him?” The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: <strong>“Do not sell what you don’t have.” </strong>This is a clear cut forbiddance, therefore it is not permissible for a person to sell some specified commodity unless he is in possession of it before making a contract on it, whether he will sell it right there or in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible to take this matter lightly. So whoever wants to sell something to the people, then he should store the products in his store or in his shop or in a warehouse or in the trunk of his car or in his office, so that he can have the products ready with him. Then if some people who want to buy the products come to him, he can sell it to them directly or at a later time.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>And from the forbidden types of business transactions is: <strong>The ‘Aynah Transaction</strong>.What is the ‘Aynah Transaction? It is when a product is sold to a person for a deferred price (i.e. a raised price to be paid later), then that same product is bought back from him at current value less than the deferred price for which it was given to him. So when the time comes in which the deferred payment is due, he pays his creditor in full. This is what is known as an Al-‘Aynah Transaction. It is called ‘aynah (i.e. derivate of ‘ayn = same) because the same product that was sold is returned back to its owner. This is Haraam because it is deceiving someone into interest (Ribaa). In reality, it is as if you are selling dollars at the current price for deferred dollars (i.e. to be given later), which are more than the original amount. And you are just using the product as a device or means to gaining this interest.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is an obligation on you if you are owed money by someone, because you sold him some product for a deferred price that you let him sell it to someone else, or that you let him act freely in the matter – if he wishes he can keep it or if he wishes he can sell it to someone else, if he is in need of the money. The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: <strong>“When you deal with <em>al-‘aynah </em>transactions and you hold onto the tails of cows and you are pleased with the agriculture, Allaah will send humiliation down upon you. He will not remove it from you until you return back to your Religion.” </strong>[Reported by Abu Dawood and it has supporting evidences]</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>And from the forbidden types of business transactions is: <strong>An-Najash</strong>. What is meant by an-Najash is when you display a product for sale in a public auction. Then a person comes and bids up the price of the item, but he doesn’t intend to purchase the item, rather he only wants to raise the price for the customers intending to deceive the buyers. This is the same whether he agreed with the seller to do this or he did it on his own. So whoever bids for a product and he doesn’t want to buy it, rather he only wants to raise its price for the customers, then this person is a Naajish, who has opposed the prohibition of Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>). Doing this is Haraam, as the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: <strong>“And do not perform Najash on each other.”</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 [<strong>Translator’s Note: </strong>Another example is if you sell an item that is worth $25 to someone for $50 because he will pay you next month and not now. This may be agreed because perhaps you feel the value of the item will go up by then. But for some reason, the buyer is short of money and wants to sell the item back to you, so he comes to you the next day and you make him sell it to you for the current market price, which is still $25. So when the date, next month, on which you agreed he would pay you the $50 comes, he pays you the money. So altogether you make $25 apart from the item, which is considered interest.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a person who has no desire or need for the item, he should not participate in the auction and not bid for it. Instead, he should leave the customers, who really desire the item, to outbid each other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps a person may want to help the seller, and sympathy for the seller overcomes him. So he bids up the price of the item for the purpose of helping the seller according to his perception. Or perhaps, the seller may agree with a group of his associates to create a crowd around the item for sale in order to draw the people’s attention. These acts are considered from Najash and are Haraam because they are a means of deceiving the Muslims and a way of taking their money unjustly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, the scholars of Fiqh have stated that what falls under Najash is when a seller tells his customer: “I bought this item for such and such price”, lying about the price, so that the buyer may be fooled and buy the item at an increased value. Or it is when the seller says: “I was given this product at this price” or he says: “I received it for this much”, lying about the price. He only wants to fool the customers into bidding the price up to reach this alleged and false price, which he claims he spent for the item. This is from the Najash, which Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) forbade. It is a treachery and deception of the Muslims, and it is lying and disloyalty, for which he will be accountable for before Allaah. So what is obligatory on the seller is that he reveals the truth if the buyer asks him how much he got it for. He must tell him the truth and not say that he attained it for this much money, lying about the price. What also falls into the definition of An-Najash is if the people of the marketplace or the storeowners agree to not outbid one another when an item is presented for sale, for the purpose of forcing the owner to sell it for a (discounted) cheaper price. So therefore, they are all participating in this act, which is Haraam. And this is from An-Najash. It is also a form of taking the people’s money unjustly.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>And from the forbidden types of business transactions is: <strong>When a Muslim conducts a sale on top of the sale of his brother.</strong> The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “And none of you should conduct a sale on top of the sale of his (Muslim) brother.” How is this done? It is done, for example, when a person who wants to buy a certain product comes and buys it from one of the businessmen, who gives him the option to finalize the deal in two or three days or more. So in this case, it is not permissible for another businessman to come and interpose, saying to the buyer: “Leave this product. I will give you the same item, even better than it, for a cheaper price.” This is Haraam because he is conducting a sale on top of the sale of his brother.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, so long as he sells him the item and gives him the option (to finalize the deal later), let him obtain it and do not interfere in the deal. If he wishes, he will take the product, and if he wishes, he will cancel the deal. So if he calls off the deal due to his own choice (i.e. not being coerced or influenced), then there is nothing preventing you from selling it to him (now). (On the opposite end) conducting a purchase over his purchase is also Haraam. So if a Muslim comes and buys a product from one of the businessmen for a fixed price and is then given the option for a period of time (to finalize the deal), it is not permissible for another buyer to interfere by going to the businessman or the seller, saying: “I will buy that product from you for a higher price than that person bought it from you.” This is Haraam because these kinds of transactions cause harm to the Muslims and violate their rights and puts hatred into their hearts (for one another). This is since if a Muslim comes to know that you interfered in his transaction and you were the cause for ruining the deal that was between the two of them, he will be filled with hatred, spite and abhorrence for you. Or perhaps he may even supplicate against you, because you have oppressed him. And Allaah says: <strong>“And work with one another upon piety and fear of Allaah. And do not work with one another upon sin and transgression.” </strong>[Surah Al-Maa’idah: 2]</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>And also from the business transactions that are forbidden is: <strong>The Deceptive Sale</strong>, which is when you deceive your Muslim brother by selling him a product that has defects and you know about these defects yet you do not inform him about them. So this kind of sale is not permissible and it is from deception, swindling and fraud. It is obligatory on the seller to make these defects clear to the seller and to let him know about them. But if he fails to inform him about them, then this is from deception and swindling, which Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) forbade in his saying: <strong>“The two persons conducting a business transaction are in a state of goodness for as long as they do not separate from one another. So if they are both honest and open with one another, they are blessed in their transaction. </strong>But if they lie and conceal (the truth) from one another, the blessing of their <strong> transaction is wiped out.” </strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory upon us, O servants of Allaah, to be sincere. Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The Religion is sincerity, the religion is sincerity, the religion is sincerity.” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They (the Companions) said: “To who O Messenger of Allaah?” He said: <strong>“To Allaah, to His Book, to His Messenger, to the Muslim leaders and the Muslim general masses.” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Muslim must be sincere. What is meant when one is sincere towards something is that he is free or absolved from certain things. So being sincere means being free from cheating (for example).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One time the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) passed by a person selling some food in the marketplace who had his food in a pile. So the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) put his noble hand inside the pile of food and found some wet portions in the bottom of the pile. So he said: <strong>“What is this O owner of the food?” </strong>He said: “The sky has affected it” – meaning the rain has affected some of it. So Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: <strong>“Then won’t you make it visible so that the people can see it? Whoever cheats us (i.e. swindles Muslims) is not from us.” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth is considered one of the fundamental principles in conducting business transactions between the Muslims. So it is not permissible for a Muslim to conceal the defects. If his merchandise has a defect then he must make it visible so that the buyer sees it and is aware of it, and so that he could acquire the item for a price that is appropriate for this defect. He must not acquire the item for the price it would be if it were flawless, for then the seller would be deceiving, cheating, fooling and swindling, based on the saying of Allaah’s Messenger: <strong>“Then won’t you make it visible so that the people can see it? Whoever cheats us is not from us.” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So O servants of Allaah! How much of swindling do you see in these days? How many times do you see people placing the defective items in the bottom of the containers and cases while placing the good items on the top – whether vegetables or food items? They purposely put the defective item in the bottom while putting the flawless item on the top. This is trickery, which is done intentionally.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah to pardon and forgive us and you, and that He make our <em>rizq </em>(sustenance) Halaal and that He make our earnings Halaal. And we ask Him to provide us from His vast Bounty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah suffice us with what You have made Halaal over that which You made Haraam, and (suffice us) with Your Bounty over that of others besides You. And forgive us, have mercy on us and accept our repentance. Verily, You are the One who accepts Repentance, the Bestower of Mercy. And may the peace and blessings of Allaah be on Allaah’s Messenger.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><b>PREFACE</b></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dear pilgrim brothers and sisters,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Assalamu alaikumwa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu. </i>Congratulations and welcome on your arrival at these sacred precincts, on this blessed journey as guests of Allah, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This brief but comprehensive Guide is presented to you to outline the obligatory rites of <i>Hajj </i>and <i>&#8216;umrah </i>with which you ought to be familiar. It begins with some important advice. This advice is, first of all, for ourselves, and then it is offered to you in accordance with what Allah, the Most High, says concerning those of His servants who receive salvation and success in this world and the Hereafter: &#8220;They counsel each other of the truth and counsel each other of patience.&#8221; It is further to put into practice His saying: &#8220;Cooperate with each other in goodness and fear of Allah, and do not cooperate in sin and transgression.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask you to read this booklet before you begin the rites of <i>Hajj </i>in order that you may acquaint yourself with what is to be done. You will f Ind in It answers to many of your questions. We hope that you will keep this booklet with you as a reference for this year, and possibly for later years as well if It Is Allah&#8217;s will that you return again for <i>Hajj.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask you to share this booklet with other Muslims in order that they may also benefit from reading its contents. We ask Allah to accept from all of us our <i>Hajj, </i>our striving, and our good deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Wassalamu &#8216;alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu.</i></p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;">IMPORTANT ADVICE</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dear pilgrims, we praise Allah for having guided you to the <em>hajj</em> of His House and to the visit of the Sacred Precincts. May He accept from all of us our good deeds and increase His reward for us and for you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following advice is being offered to you in the hope that Allah will accept from all of us our hajj and our striving.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Remember that you are on a blessed journey. This journey, which is a migration toward Allah, is based on belief in His Unity <i>(tawheed), on </i>sincerity toward Him, on responding to His call, and on obedience to His commands. There is no greater reward than that of a <em>hajj</em> which<i> is </i>acceptable to Allah Ta&#8217;alah-the reward of the Garden of Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Be on your guard against the mischief of Satan, who intends to cause dissension among you. Love each other as brothers and avoid disputes and disobedience to Allah. Know that the Messenger of Allah (may peace and blessings of Allah be on him) said, &#8220;<strong>None of you has truly believed unless he likes for his brother what the likes for himself</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Whenever you have a question concerning religious matters or concerning the <i>hajj, </i>ask knowledgeable Muslims until you receive a satisfactory answer. This is in accordance with what Allah has said: &#8221; <strong>If you realize this not, ask of those who possess The Message</strong>.&#8221; it is also in accordance with what the Prophet (peace be on him) has said. &#8220;<strong>When Allah intends good for someone, He gives him understanding of the religion</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Know that Allah has made certain acts <i>fard </i>(obligatory) and other acts <i>sunnah </i>(according to the practice of the Prophet, peace be on him). Allah does not accept a <i>sunnah </i>which violates some fard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some pilgrims ignore this fact when they harm believing men and women in their zeal to kiss the <i>Black Stone, </i>to hasten in their circuits around the K&#8217;abah, to make <i>salah </i>behind the Station of lbraheem, to drink from Zamzam,.and similar practices. These practices are <i>sunnah. </i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>To </i>harm any believer in doing them is <i>haram </i>(prohibited). How is it possible to carry out a <i>sunnah </i>observance while doing a <i>haram </i>deed? Therefore, avoid hurting each other, and Allah will grant you His mercy and will increase your reward.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>We would also like to emphasize the following:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) It is not fitting that a Muslim man performs his Salat next to, or behind a woman in the holy Mosque or at any other place if it is at all possible to avoid doing so. Women should pray behind men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) The doors and entrances to the holy Mosque are for traffic and should not be blocked by people praying there, even though if it is to join the congregational prayer that may be in progress.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(c) It is not permissible to block the free flow of people around the K&#8217;abah by sitting near the K&#8217;abah, by praying near it, or by standing near the Black Stone, or al-Hijr or at the Station of lbraheem, especially when the place is crowded, as this is a source of harm to other people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(d) While safeguarding the dignity of Muslims is a <i>fard, </i>kissing the Black Stone is a <i>sunnah. A fard </i>cannot be sacrificed for a <i>sunnah. </i>When the area is crowded, it is sufficient to point to the Black Stone, saying <i>&#8220;Allahu akbar.&#8221; </i>and to continue to move with the flow of people without causing a break in the lines. indeed, keeping an easy flow during circuits is the most commendable thing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(e) It is not a sunnah to kiss the Yamani corner, but to touch it with the right hand, if it is not overcrowded, and say: <i>&#8220;Bismillahi w</i>al-lahu <i>akbar. &#8221; But </i>if it is difficult to touch it, then move on, do not point to it with your hand, or say <i>takbir. </i>For it is not reported of the Prophet. It is mustahabb (good) to recite the following supplication in between the Yamani corner and the Black Stone:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">رَبَّنَا آتِنَا فِي الدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةً وَفِي الآخِرَةِ حَسَنَةً وَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>&#8220;Rabbana atina fid-donya hasanatan wa fil- akhirati hasanatan wa qina adhaban-nar&#8221;.</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally, the best advice we can give you is that you follow the Book of Allah and the <i>sunnah</i><b><i> </i></b>of His Messenger (peace be on him) in all what you do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Obey Allah and the Messenger in order that you may receive mercy.&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><b>VIOLATIONS OF ISLAM</b></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Brother and sister Muslim, you must be aware that there are matters which nullify your Islam. We will mention here the ten most common violations. Please be mindful of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The First</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Associating partners with Allah (shirk). Allah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>Truly, if anyone associates partners with Allah, Allah will forbid him the garden and his abode will be the Fire; the wrongdoers will have no helpers</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Calling upon the dead, asking their help, or offering them gifts or sacrifices are all forms of <i>shirk.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Second</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Setting up intermediaries between oneself and Allah, making supplication to them, asking their intercession with Allah, and placing one&#8217;s trust in them is unbelief (kufr).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Third</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who does not consider polytheists <i>(mushrikeen)</i> to be unbelievers, or who has doubts concerning their unbelief, or considers their way to be correct, is himself an unbeliever (kafir).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Fourth</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who believes any guidance other than the Prophet&#8217;s guidance to be more perfect, or a decision other than the Prophet&#8217;s decision to be better, is an unbeliever. This applies to those who prefer the rule of <i>Evil (Taghout) </i>to the Prophet&#8217;s rule. Some examples of this are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) To believe that systems and laws made by human beings are better than the <i>Shari&#8217;ah </i>of Islam; for example,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that the Islamic system is not suitable for the twentieth century.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that Islam is the cause of the backwardness of Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or that Islam is a relationship between Allah and the Muslim. It should not interfere in other aspects of life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) To say that enforcing the punishments prescribed by Allah, such as cutting off the hand of a thief or stoning an adulterer, is not suitable in this day and age.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(c) To believe that it is permissible to give a rule from that which Allah did not reveal in Islamic transactions or matters of law, punishments or other affairs. Although one may not believe such rulings to be superior to the <i>Shari&#8217;ah </i>he in effect affirms such a stand by declaring a thing which Allah has totally prohibited, such as adultery, drinking alcohol or usury, to be permissible. According to the consensus of Muslims, one who declares such things to be permissible is an unbeliever (kafir).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Fifth</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who hates any part of what the Messenger of Allah (may peace and blessings of Allah be on him) has declared to be lawful has nullified his lslam, even though he may act in accordance with it. Allah the Most High, says: &#8220;<strong>Because they disliked what Allah has revealed. their deeds are brought to nothing</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Sixth</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who ridicules any aspect of the religion of the Messenger of Allah (peace be on him), or any of its rewards or punishments, becomes an unbeliever. Allah. the Most High, says: &#8220;<strong>Say: Do you ridicule Allah, His revelations and His Messenger? Make no excuse; you have disbelieved after your (profession of) faith&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>The Seventh</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The practice of magic included in this is causing a rift between a husband and wife by turning his love for her into hatred, or tempting a person to do things he dislikes by using black arts. One who engages in such a thing or is pleased with it is outside the pale of Islam. Allah the Most High, says, &#8220;<strong>The two (angels, Harut and Marut) did not teach anyone (magic) without warning them, &#8216;Indeed. we are a trial; then do not disbelieve.</strong>&#8220;&#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The <i>Eighth</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Supporting and aiding polytheists against the Muslims. Allah the Most High, says: &#8220;<strong>The one from among you who supports them belongs to them. Truly. Allah does not guide the people who do wrong</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>The Ninth</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who believes that some people are permitted to deviate from the <i>Shari&#8217;ah of </i>Muhammad (peace be on him) is an unbeliever by the word of Allah, the Most High: &#8220;<strong>If anyone seeks a religion other than al-Islam it will not be accepted from him, and in the Hereafter he will by among the losers&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>The Tenth</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To turn completely away from the religion of Allah, neither learning its precepts nor acting upon it. Allah the Most High, says: &#8220;<strong>Who does greater wrong than the one who is reminded of the revelations of his Lord and turns away from them. Truly, We shall recompense the guilty</strong>,&#8221; and He also says: &#8220;<strong>But those who disbelieve turn away from that about which they are warned</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It makes no difference whether such violations are committed as a joke, in seriousness or out of fear, except when they are done under compulsion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We seek refuge in Allah from such deeds as entail His wrath and severe punishment.<b> </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>How to perform HaJJ and &#8216;Umrah, and to visit the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Brother and sister Muslims:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are three ways of performing the hajj:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Hajj </i>al-tamatt&#8217;u (interrupted)<br />
<i>Haii </i>al-qiran (combined)<br />
<i>Haii al- ifrad </i>(single)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><i>Hajj al-Tamatt&#8217;u</i></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means entering into ihram for the &#8216;umrah during the months of <i>Haji, </i>i.e., the months of Shawwal, Dhul-Q&#8217;idah and the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah; to take off ihram after performing the &#8216;umrah; and then to take ihram again for the hajj from Makkah on the 8th day of Dhul-Hijjah during the same year in which the &#8216;umrah was performed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><i>Hajj al-Qiran</i></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This denotes entering into ihram for both the &#8216;umrah and the hajj at the same time, not taking off the ihram until the Day of Sacrifice (the 10th of Dhul-Hijjah). Alternatively, one may first enter into <i>ihram </i>for the <i>&#8216;umrah, </i>and before beginning one&#8217;s tawaf may make the intention of <i>ihram </i>for the <i>hajj </i>as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><i>Hajj al-lfrad</i></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This signifies donning <i>ihram</i> for the <i>hajj </i>either from the prescribed Station of <i>lhram (al-miqat), </i>from Makka if one resides there, or from a place in between al-migat and Makkah in the event that one has brought a sacrificial animal with him, and to remain in <i>ihram </i>until the Day of Sacrifice. If one has not brought an animal for sacrifice, he is required to come out of <i>ihram </i>after performing <i>&#8216;umrah; </i>that is, he makes the (Sa&#8217;ye)&#8221;around the K&#8217;abah (tawaf), performs the (Sa&#8217;ye) the running between Safa and Marwah. cuts some of his hair and then comes out of <i>ihram, </i>resuming his usual clothing and state. This is what the, Prophet (peace be on him) prescribed for those people who had entered into <i>ihram</i> for the hajj without bringing a sacrificial animal; they then re-entered into ihram on the 8th of Dhul-Hijjah. The same applies to a person who is performing hajj al-qiran in the event that he has not brought with him an animal to sacrifice; it is required that he comes out of ihram after the &#8216;umrah, as described above.<b> </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE PERFORMANCE OF &#8216;UMRAH</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. When you reach the prescribed Station (<b>al-miqat</b>), make ghusl (a shower or full washing of the whole body), use perfume if available, and then put on the two-piece garment of <b>ihram </b>( izar and rida ), which preferably should be of white cloth. This applies to men only. A woman also makes ghusl but she does not use make up, and she may wear any clothes she has available as long as they do not display her adornments; she should be completely covered except for her face and hands. Then make your <b>intention</b> to perform &#8216;Umrah by saying; Labbayka &#8216;Umrah, or: Labbayk Allahumma Umrah, as follows:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><i>Labbayk, Allahumma. Labbayk</i></td>
<td>Here I am at Your service. O Lord, here I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>Labbayk. La shareeka laka. Labbayk.</i></td>
<td>Here I am. No partner do You have. Here I am,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>lnnal-hamda wan-n &#8216;imata laka wal- mulk.</i></td>
<td>Truly, the praise and the favor is Yours, and the dominion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>La shareeka lak&#8217;</i></td>
<td>No partner do You have</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Men should utter this aloud while women should say it silently. Repeat this <b>talbiyyah</b> frequently, and engage in the praise of Allah, in supplications for forgiveness, and in the enjoining of what is good and forbidding of what is evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. When you reach Makkah, make seven circuits <i>(<b>Tawaf</b>) </i>around the K&#8217;abah, beginning at the <b>Black Stone</b> with <b><i>t</i></b><b><i>akbir</i></b> (utterances of <i>&#8220;<b>Allahu akbar&#8217;</b>) </i>and ending each at the same place. While making your <i>(Tawaf) you </i>may praise Allah and make supplications to Him in any words you please. it is preferable to end each with the words.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b><i>&#8220;Rabbana, atina fid-dunya hasanatan wa fil-akhirati hasanstan wa qina adhaban-nar.&#8221;<br />
</i></b>(Our Lord, give us good in this world and good in the Hereafter. and save us from the punishment of the Fire.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After completing the seventh cirucit, pray <b>two <i>rak&#8217;ats</i></b> behind the <b>Station of Ibraheem <i>(Maqam lbraheem)</i></b><i> if </i>It is possible, even though you may be a little far from it. Otherwise at any other place within the Sacred Mosque.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. You then go to <b>as-safa</b> and climb on it. Facing the K&#8217;abah, praise Allah, raising your hands, say <i>takbir (&#8221;Allahu akbar&#8221;) </i>three times. Then make supplication to Allah, repeating your supplication three times as this is the <i>sunnah. </i>Then say</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b><i>&#8220;La ilaha illal- Lah, wahdahu La sharika La. &#8221;<br />
</i></b><em><strong>Lahul-mulk wa Iahul-hamd, wa huwa &#8216;ala kulli Shayin qadeer&#8221;.</strong></em><br />
<b><i>&#8220;La illahe illal-lah, wahdahu. Anjaza wadahu Wanasara abdahu wa hazama alahzab wahdahu. &#8220;</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(There is no deity except Allah, the One without a partner.<br />
His is the dominion and His is the praise. and He is powerful over everything.<br />
There is no deity except Allah, completed His promise, supported His Slave and defeated the parties Alone.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is preferable to utter this supplication three times but there is no harm in saying it less than three times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You then descend from as-Safa and do the sa&#8217;ye of the umrah seven times. Increase your pace between the green posts, but walk at a normal pace before and after them. When you climb on the Marwah, praise Allah and do as you did at as-Safa, repeating your supplications, if you can conveniently do so, three times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are no required formulas or supplications for tawaf and sa&#8217;ye. It is up to the worshipper to praise Allah or supplicate Him in his own words, or he may recite portions of the Our&#8217;an, with due regard to the supplications which the Prophet (peace be on him) recited during the performance of these rites.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. After sa&#8217;ye end your &#8216;umrah by shaving or shortening your hair. After this, the prohibitions pertaining to the state of ihram are lifted and you may now resume your normal life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you are doing hajj al-tamatt&#8217;u the sacrifice of a sheep or the seventh part of a camel or a cow becomes obligatory for you on the Day of Sacrifice (the 10th of Dhul-Hijjah) .If you cannot afford this sacrifice, it is obligatory for you to fast ten days, three of them during the hajj and seven after returning home.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you are performing hajj al-tamatt&#8217;u or hajj al-qiran, it is preferable to fast these three days before the Day of &#8216;Arafat (the 9th of Dhul-Hijjah).<b> </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE PERFORMANCE OF HAJJ</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. If you are performing hajj al-ifrad or hajj al-qiran (i.e., hajj combined with &#8216;umrah), you enter into ihram at the &#8216;station of ihram (al-miqat) through which you pass on your way to Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you do not pass through any Station of ihram on your way to Makkah, you enter into ihram from your residence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you are performing <i>hajj </i>al-tamatt&#8217;u (the interrupted <i>haii), you </i>enter into ihram for hajj from your residence in Makkah on the 8th of Dhul-Hijjah. Perform ghusl (shower or washing of the entire body), perfume yourself if possible, and put on the two garments of ihram. This applies to men. Women likewise perform ghusl but are not to use perfume. They may wear any suitable clothes they have as long as they do not show their adornments and cover every part of their bodies excepting the hands and face. For woman, if she is in the presence of other men who are not her immediate relatives like her husband, father, brother or son then she should cover her face. After putting on ihram make your niyyah (intention) by Saying: <i>Labbayk Hajjan </i>then recite <i>talbiyyah</i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>&#8220;Labbayk, Allahumma. Labbayk.<br />
Labbayk. La shareeka laka. Labbayk.<br />
lnnal-hamda wan-n&#8217;imata laka wal-mulk. La shareeka lak&#8217;.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(Here I am at Your service, O Lord, here I am. No partner do You have. Here Iam. Truly, the praise and the favor is Yours, and the dominion. No partner do You have.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. You then go to Mina, where you pray the Dhuhr, &#8216;Asr, Maghrib, &#8216;Isha and Fajr prayers at their proper times, shortening prayers of four rak&#8217;as to two rak&#8217;as. Do not combine these prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. When the sun has risen on the 9th of Dhul-Hijjah, proceed toward &#8216;Arafat in a dignified manner and without harming your fellow pilgrims. At&#8217;Arafat, pray the Dhuhr and &#8216;Asr prayers, shortened and combined during the time of Dhuhr with one adhan and two iqamahs</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Make sure that you are within the boundaries of &#8216;Arafat. Stay within the boundaries of &#8216;Arafat, except the valley of Oranah, reciting the praise of Allah the Most High, and offering supplications facing qiblah with upraised hands, as was the practice of Prophet Muhammad (may peace and blessings of Allah be on him). Remain at &#8216;Arafat until after sunset.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. When the sun has set, proceed toward Muzdalifah in a peaceful and dignified manner, reciting <i>talbiyyah. </i>Do not harm or cause any discomfort to your fellow Muslims. When you arrive at Muzdalifah, pray the <i>Maghrib </i>and <i>&#8216;lsha </i>prayers combined, shortening <i>&#8216;Isha </i>to two <i>rak&#8217;ats. </i>Stay at Muzdalifah until you have prayed the <i>Fair </i>prayer. Then wait until the brightness of the morning is wide spread, supplicate facing <i>qiblah </i>with upraised hands, following the practice of the Prophet (peace be on him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For women or weak individuals, it is permissible to proceed to Mina at any time after midnight.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Muzdalifah, pick up only seven pebbles to throw at the Stone Pillar of &#8216;Aqabah. Other pebbles can be picked up at Mina. There is no harm even if the seven pebbles to be thrown at the Stone Pillar of &#8216;Aqabah are also picked up at Mina.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. When you arrive at Mina, do the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) At the Stone Pillar of &#8216;Aqabah (this is the pillar nearest to Makkah) throw the seven pebbles one after the other, saying <i>&#8220;Allahu akbar&#8221; </i>at each throw.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) If you are required to sacrifice, slaughter your sacrificial animal. You are to eat some of its meat and distribute the major part of it to the needy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(c) Shave your head or cut some hair from it. Shaving is preferable for men, while for women the length of hair to be cut is that of a fingertip.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above-mentioned order of doing things is preferred, however, if they are done in some other order, there is no harm in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After you have thrown the pebbles and shaved or cut some of your hair, the prohibitions of <i>ihram </i>are lifted, excepting the prohibition of sexual intercourse with your spouse. This is the first <strong>tahallul</strong>, i.e., returning to one&#8217;s normal state. You are now to wear your usual clothes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. Then you go to Makkah and perform the tawaf al-ifadah (the tawaf which is an essential part of the Hajj). If you are doing hajj al-tamatt&#8217;u, you also perform sa&#8217;ye. If you are performing hajj al- ifrad or hajj al-qiran and you did not perform sa&#8217;ye with tawaf al- qudum (the Tawaf of Arrival), you must do sa&#8217;ye now. After this, the prohibition of marital relations is also lifted and you return to a completely normal life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible to delay the tawaf al-ifadah until the days spent at Mina are over, going to Makkah for this tawaf after all three Pillars have been stoned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. After performing your tawaf al-ifadah on the Day of Sacrifice, return to Mina and spend there the nights preceding the 11th, 12th and 13th days of Dhul-Hijjah (the three days following the Day of Sacrifice which are known as ayyamu-tashreeq. It is however, permissible to spend only two nights in Mina instead of three.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. At any time in the afternoon of each of the two or three days of your stay in Mina, stone each of the three Pillars, starting with the first Pillar( i.e., the one which is farthest from Makkah), followed by the middle Pillar and lastly the Pillar of &#8216;Aqabah. Throw seven pebbles, one by one, at each of these Pillars, saying <i>&#8220;Allahu </i>akbar&#8221; at each throw.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you stay in Mina for only two days, you must leave Mina before the sun sets on the second day. if the sun should set before you are able to depart, remain in Mina for the third night and throw pebbles again the next day. In any case, it is preferable to remain in Mina for three nights.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible for the sick and the weak to appoint a proxy to throw their pebbles. The proxy first throws his own pebbles, followed by the pebbles of the person he represents while at the same pillar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. If you decide to return to your Country after completing the rites of <i>hajj, you </i>perform the Farewell Tawaf (tawaf al-wida &#8216; ) before leaving Makkah. No one is excused from this except women who are menstruating or in the period of discharge following childbirth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>OBLIGATIONS DURING IHRAM</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the state of <i>ihram </i>for <i>hajj </i>or &#8216;Umrah, the following are obligatory;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. To faithfully observe all that Allah has made obligatory, such as the daily prayers at their proper times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. To avoid what Allah has prohibited, such as wrongdoing, quarreling and committing sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. To guard against injuring the Muslims by deed or by word.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. To abstain from what is prohibited during <i>ihram, </i>namely:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) Do not cut your nails or pull out hair. There is no blame on you if these break or come off by themselves without your intending it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) Do not use scent, whether on the clothes or on the body, or in food or drink. There is no harm if the effect of scent applied before putting on ihram remains.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(c) Do not kill, frighten or assist in hunting any land game as long as you are in ihram.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(d) Within the precincts of al-Haram no one, in the state of ihram or not, is allowed to cut trees, pluck vegetables or collect a lost property except for the sake of identifying it for its owner. For the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(e) Do not propose to a woman or contract marriage either for yourself or on behalf of others. Sexual intercourse is prohibited too, so is touching the apposite sex with desire. All these actions are-prohibited during the period of ihram.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All these prohibitions apply equally to men and women alike.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In particular</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man may not put any covering on his head. However, the shade of an umbrella or the roof of a car is permissible. There is no harm in carrying something on the head.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man may not wear a shirt or anything else which is sewn, such as a burnoose, turban, trousers, <i>khuff </i>(short, thin boot), on the whole or a part of his body. However, if an <i>izar </i>(one of the two garments of <i>ihram, </i>worn on the lower part of the body) is not available, trousers may be worn, and if sandals are not available <i>khuff </i>may be worn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is forbidden for a woman to wear gloves on her hands or to cover her face with a face-veil <i>(niqab) </i>or <i>burqa </i>(drape) during the state of <i>ihram. </i>However, if male strangers are around her, she should conceal her face with her head-covering or something similar. These rules apply until she comes out of <i>ihram</i><i>..</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a person wears a sewn garment or covers his head (for men), uses perfume, pulls out some hairs, or cuts his nails through forgetfulness or due to ignorance, there is no <i>fidyah </i>(expiation) for him. He should stop doing such things as soon as he remembers or is reminded of then.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible to wear sandals, a ring, a pair of glasses, a hearing aid, a wrist watch, and a belt or a girdle which protects one&#8217;s money or documents.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible to change one&#8217;s clothes and to wash them, as well as to wash one&#8217;s hair and body, and it does not matter if some hair inadvertently falls out during washing.<b> </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>VISITATION OF THE PROPHET&#8217;S MOSQUE</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Going to Madinah at any time with the intention of visiting the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque is a sunnah, as is performing <i>salah </i>in it, According to a <i>hadith of the Prophet </i>(may peace and blessing of Allah be on him). A salah performed in the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque is better than a thousand salats in any other place excepting the Sacred Mosque (Masjid al-Haram) in Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. There is no <i>ihram</i> nor <i>talbiyah </i>for the visit to the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque, and it should be emphasized that there is no connection whatsoever between this visit and the <i>hajj.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. When you enter the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque, enter with your right foot first, saying the name of Allah the Most High, and invoking blessings on His Prophet (may His peace and blessings be on him), and ask Allah to open the gates of His mercy for you. The recommended words for entering any mosque, including the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque, are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;A&#8217;udhu billahil-adheem wa wajhi hil-kareem wa sultanihil- qadeem mina &#8211; shaytani-rajeem. Allahhumma, iftah li abwaba rahmattk.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(I seek refuge in Allah the Al-mighty, and in His noble countenance and in His eternal power, from Satan the Rejected. 0 Allah, open to me the doors of Your mercy.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Perform two <i>rak&#8217;ats </i>of <i>tahiyyat al-masjid </i>(the <i>salat </i>of &#8220;greeting of the mosque&#8221;) after entering the Mosque, preferably in the <i>Rawdah </i>or otherwise anywhere else in the Mosque.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Then go to the grave of the Prophet (may the peace and blessing of Allah be on him), and standing in front of it and facing it, say in a respectful and hushed voice:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>&#8220;Assalamu &#8216;alaika, ayyuhan-nabiyya wa rahmat al lahi wa barakatuhu. &#8221;<br />
</i><em>(Peace be on you, O Prophet, and the mercy and blessings of Allah), </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and call for the blessings of Allah on him. There is no harm if you add:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8220;Allahumma, atihil-waseelata wal-fadeelata wab-&#8216;athul-maqamal-mahmoudal-ladhee wa-adtahu. Allahumma, ajzih &#8216;an ummatihi afdalal- jaza&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(O Lord, give him the right (of intercession) and the favor, and raise him to the praiseworthy station which you promised to him.O Allah, reward him on behalf of his ummah (people) with the best of rewards.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then move a little to the right to stand before the grave of Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him). Greet him and supplicate Allah to bestow His mercy and forgiveness on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Again move a little to the right to stand before the grave of &#8216;Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), and greet him and make supplication for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. It is sunnah to have (Taharah), and visit the Mosque of Quba and offer salat in it, as the Prophet (peace be on him) prayed there and encouraged others to do the same.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. It is sunnah to visit the graves of al-Baqe&#8217;e cemetery, and the grave of Uthman (May Allah be pleased with him) and the martyrs of &#8216;Uhud, and the grave of Hamzah (May Allah be pleased with them.); to greet them and to pray for the mercy of Allah upon them. The Prophet (peace be upon him) used to visit all these graves and pray for the souls of those who were buried there. He taught his companions when visiting graves to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>&#8220;Assalamu &#8216;alaikum, ahlal-diyar minal-mu&#8217;mineen wal-muslimeen,<br />
wa inna insha-Allah bikum lahiqoon.<br />
Nasalal-laha lans wa lakumul-&#8216;afiyah.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(Peace be on you, O dwellers of this place from among the Believers and the Muslims,<br />
and we <i>will insha-&#8216;Allah </i>join you.<br />
We ask Allah for security (from the Fire of Hell) for ourselves and for you.)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(Reported by Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to the <i>Shari&#8217;ah </i>besides the mosques and other places mentioned above, there are no other mosques or places in Madinah which are to be visited. Therefore, do not burden yourself by visiting places for which there is no reward or for which, in fact, there might be some blame for doing so. And Allah is the source of guidance.<b> </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>ERRORS OFTEN COMMITTED BY PILGRIMS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>First: Errors Related to lhram</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some pilgrims bypass the designated Station of <i>lhram </i>on their route without either being in <i>ihram </i>or entering into <i>ihram </i>there, proceeding until they reach Jeddah or some other place within the precincts of the Stations, at which they enter into <i>ihram. </i>This is against the command of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be on him), which stipulates that every pilgrim should enter into <i>ihram</i> at the Station of <i>ihram </i>which lies on his route.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this happens to someone, he must either go back to the Station of ihram lying on his route and there enter into ihram, or he must make expiation by sacrificing a sheep in Makkah and feeding all its meat to the poor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This applies to all pilgrims regardless of whether one passes the Station of ihram by air, by sea or by land.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one did not pass through one of the five designated Stations of lhram, he should enter into ihram at a point which is nearest to the Station of ihram on his route.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Second: Errors Related to Tawaf</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Starting the tawaf at some point other than the site of the Black Stone, while it is obligatory to begin tawaf from the Black Stone</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Doing one&#8217;s tawaf inside the Hijr of lsma&#8217;il, which means going around a portion of the K&#8217;abah rather than the whole of it since the Hijr of Isma&#8217;il is a part of the K&#8217;abah which would then be left out of tawaf<b>. </b>Such a tawaf is invalid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Doing ramal (i.e., taking quick short steps) during alI seven circuits while ramal is to be done only during the first three of the Tawaf of Arrival (tawaf <i>al-qudum).</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Struggling vehemently to kiss the Black Stone in this process and hitting or pushing people. Such acts, which are injurious to Muslims, are not permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It should be noted that the tawaf remains perfectly valid without kissing the Black Stone. If one does not or cannot kiss the Black Stone. it is sufficient simply to point to it, saying &#8220;Allahu <i>akbar&#8221; when </i>one comes parallel to it, although one may be at a distance from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Wiping one&#8217;s hand over the Black Stone, seeking &#8220;blessings&#8221; <i>(barakah) thereby </i>is an innovation <i>(bid&#8217;a) </i>with no basis in the <i>Shari&#8217;ah </i>of Islam. The <i>sunnah is </i>to touch it or kiss it only when it can be done easily.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. Touching the four corners of K&#8217;abah or its walls, and wiping one&#8217;s hands against them. The Prophet (peace be on him) did not touch any part of K&#8217;abah except the Black Stone and the Yemeni Corner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. Saying specific formulas of supplications reserved for each circuit. The Prophet (peace be on him) did not specify any supplications except to say &#8220;Allahu <i>akbar&#8221; </i><i>when when </i>he reached the Black Stone and, at the end of each circuit between the Yamani Corner and the Black Stone, he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b><i>&#8220;Rabbana, </i>atina&#8217; <i>fid-dunya hasanatan wa fil-akhirati hasana wa qina adhaban-nar. &#8221;<br />
</i></b>(Our Lord, give us good in this world and good in the Hereafter and save us from the punishment of the Fire.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. Raising one&#8217;s voice above the voices of others; whether in following or leading the tawaf as it causes confusion among the worshippers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. Struggling to pray at the Station of lbraheem. This is contrary to the <i>sunnah, </i>besides being injurious to other worshippers. it is sufficient to pray the two <i>rak&#8217;ats of tawaf </i>after completing one&#8217;s tawaf anywhere within the Sacred Mosque.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Third: Errors Related to Sa&#8217;ye</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. When climbing upon Safa and Marwah, some pilgrims face the K&#8217;abah and gesticulate toward it with their hand while saying <i>&#8220;Allahu akbar&#8221; </i>as if they were saying <i>takbir for </i>salat salat. This gesticulating is an error because the Prophet (peace be on him) raised his palms only for supplication. Here you may glorify and magnify Allah the Most High, supplicating Him in any words you wish while facing the direction of the K&#8217;abah. It is preferable to recite the <i>dhikr</i> which the Prophet (peace be on him) recited at Safa and Marwah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Accelerating one&#8217;s pace throughout the entire distance between the two hills. The <i>sunnah </i>is to accelerate one&#8217;s pace only between the two green posts, while walking at normal pace the remainder of the way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Fourth: Errors Related to &#8216;Arafat</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Some pilgrims camp outside the boundaries of &#8216;Arafat and remain there until the sun has set; then they depart for Muzdalifah without standing at &#8216;Arafat properly. This is a serious error which invalidates their hajj since standing in Arafat is the essence of <i>haji, </i>and it is obligatory to be within its boundaries and not outside them, if it is not easy to do that, they may enter before sunset and remain there until sunset. It is quite acceptable to stand in Arafat during the night of sacrifice in particular.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Departing from &#8216;Arafat before the sun has set is not permissible, because the messenger of Allah (peace be on him) stayed at &#8216;Arafat until the sun had set completely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Struggling through crowds in order to climb Mount &#8216;Arafat is not permissible, because it causes much harm and injury to others. The entire Plain of &#8216;Arafat is a place of standing, and neither climbing Mount &#8216;Arafat nor making <i>salah </i>there has been recommended.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Making supplications facing Mount &#8216;Arafat is incorrect because the <i>sunnah </i>is to face <i>qiblah while </i>making supplication.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Making heaps of earth or pebbles: during the day of &#8216;Arafat, at particular places, by some people, has no bases in the <i>Shariah of </i>Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Fifth: Errors Related to Muzdalifah</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some pilgrims start collecting <i>pebbles to </i>throw at the Stone Pillars in Mina as soon as they arrive in Muzdalifah prior to praying the <i>Maghrib and </i>&#8216;lsha prayers. This is not correct. Nor is the practice that ail the pebbles must be collected at Muzdalifah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The correct position is that the pebbles can be collected anywhere within the boundaries of al-Haram (the territory or precincts of Makkah ). It is known that the Prophet (peace be on him) did not ask that the pebbles for Jamratul Aqabah be picked up for him from Muzdalifa. They were picked up for him, in the Morning, after leaving Muzdalifa and on entering Mina. The rest of the pebbles were picked up for him, from Mina too. Some pilgrims wash the pebbles, but this is not recommended.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#993300;">Error Related to Throwing the Pebbles</span><i><br />
</i></b><br />
1. Some pilgrims are under the impression that when they are throwing pebbles at the Stone Pillars, they are actually throwing them at <i>shayateen (devils): </i>hence they hurl them with rage and force. However, the throwing of the pebbles has been merely prescribed as a means of remembering Allah the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Some people throw big stones, shoes or pieces of wood. This is an excess in matters of religion which the Prophet (peace be upon him) prohibited, what is allowed is to throw pebbles the size of good beans.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Crowding and fighting with others at the Pillars while throwing the pebbles is not permissible. What is prescribed is to be gentle and to throw the pebbles without hurting anyone as much as possible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Throwing all the pebbles at one time is an error. Scholars have said that this would be counted as only one throw. The <i>Shari&#8217;ah prescribes </i>throwing the pebbles one by one, saying <b><i>&#8220;Allahu akbar&#8221; </i></b>at each separate throw.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Appointing a proxy to throw the pebbles, simply due to fear of the crowds or of hardship, while one is capable of doing it himself. Only sick or weak individuals are permitted to have a proxy for this act.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Seventh: Errors Related to the Farewell Tawaf (Tawaf -al- Wida)</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. On the day of their departure, some pilgrims go.to Makkah to perform their Farewell Tawaf before throwing the pebbles at the Pillars. Then they return to Mina to throw the pebbles, and depart from Mina for their respective countries. Thus their final rite becomes that of throwing the pebbles at the Pillars and not of the tawaf of K&#8217;abah. This is an error as the Prophet (peace be on him) said, No one should depart without his last visit being to the House (K&#8217;abah) &#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, the Farewell Tawaf must take place after one has completed all the rites of hajj (and before starling his journey for home). After this tawaf one should not stay in Makkah except during the time it takes to prepare to depart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. After finishing the Farewell <i>Tawaf, </i>some people walk backwards, facing the K&#8217;abah, as they exit from the Sacred Mosque, under the impression that this is a veneration of the K&#8217;abah. This act is an innovation <i>(bid&#8217;a) </i>in the religion and is without any basis.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. After finishing the Farewell <i>Tawaf, </i>some pilgrims halt at the door of the Sacred Mosque to make supplications. This is also an innovation with no basis in the <i>Shari&#8217;ah of </i>Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Eighth: Errors Related to the visit of the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Touching and wiping one&#8217;s hands on the walls and iron grilles, tying threads to the gratings, and other acts of this sort while visiting the grave of the Prophet (may peace and blessings of Allah be on him) in order to receive blessings <i>(barakah) </i>are an innovation (bid&#8217;a). Blessings come from following what Allah and His Messenger (peace be on him) have prescribed, and not from following innovations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Going to the caves of Mount Uhud or to the caves of Hira or Thaur near Makkah and hanging pieces of cloth or making supplications there have not been prescribed by Allah. All these are unnecessary hardships, innovations in the religion, and are without any basis in the <i>Shari&#8217;ah.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Likewise, visiting certain sites under the impression that these constitute &#8220;relics&#8221; of the Prophet (peace be on him), as for example the place where his camel sat, the Well of &#8216;Uthman or the Well of the Ring, and gathering soil from these places to obtain &#8220;blessings&#8221;, are all innovations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Calling upon the dead while visiting the graves at the Baqi&#8217; Cemetery or the graves of the martyrs of Uhud, and throwing coins in order to seek the blessings of the place or of the people buried there, is a grievous error indeed. it is <i>shirk </i>(ascribing partners to Allah the Most High), as has been pointed out by scholars. It is clear from the Book of Allah and the <i>sunnah </i>of His Messenger (peace be on him) that all forms of worship are for Allah alone. It is not permissible to call upon, or to offer sacrifice, give vow or any other form of <i>ibadah </i>(worship) except for Allah alone. Allah the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b><i>&#8220;and they were commanded nothing except to worship Allah (only), purifying the religion for Him alone,&#8221;</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and He also says,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>&#8220;<strong>Verily, the places of worship are for Allah (alone), so do not call on anyone else apart from Allah</strong>.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah, the Most High, to improve the condition of the Muslims and to give them understanding of the religion. and to turn all of us away from errors and deviations Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Responding.<b> </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>WHAT IS REQUIRED OF THE PILGRIMS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. To repent sincerely of all sins, and to spend on the hajj or &#8216;umrah out of his lawful earnings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. To guard one&#8217;s tongue from lying, backbiting and slandering.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3, To purify the intention to perform <i>hajj </i>or &#8216;<em>umrah</em> solely to seek the pleasure of Allah the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. To learn what actions are prescribed&#8217;by the Shari&#8217;ah or hajj and &#8216;umrah, and in the event of any difficulty or problem to ask those who know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. When the pilgrim arrives at al-miqat (station of ihram) he is free to choose one of the three types of hajj (ifrad, tamatt&#8217;u or qiran). Tamatt&#8217;u is preferable for a person who has not brought his sacrificial animal with him, while qiran is preferable for one who has his animal with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. If the person entering ihram is afraid he may not be able to complete all the rites because of sickness or fear, he should make the condition: &#8220;I will return to the normal state in case I am obliged to.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. The hajj of children is valid, but it does not fulfill their lslamic obligation of <i>hajj.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. During the state of ihram, one may take bath or wash his head or scratch it if need be.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. A woman may veil her face with her headcovering if she fears that men are looking at her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. Many women wear a headband under the veil to keep it away from the face. This action has no basis.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. It is permissible to wash the ihram garments and to wear them again, or to change into other ihram garments.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. If, during the state of ihram, one should wear a sewn garment, cover his head, or use scent due to forgetfulness or ignorance, no expiation (penalty or redemptive offering) is required of him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. If one is performing hajj al-tamatt&#8217;u or &#8216;umrah, he should stop reciting <i>talbiyyah upon </i>arriving at the K&#8217;abah before beginning his tawaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. Walking with quick, short steps and baring the right shoulder is not permissible during tawaf except during the first three circuits of the Tawaf of Arrival (tawaf <i>al-qudum</i><i>). </i>This<i> </i>applies to men only.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15. If the pilgrim forgets how many circuits he has performed, i.e., whether three or four, he should count them as three (that is, the lesser of the two numbers). The same procedure is to be followed for sa&#8217;ye.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16. In case of large crowds, there is no harm in performing the circuits beyond the Station of lbraheem or even further beyond, as the whole of the Sacred Mosque is a place of tawaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">17. It is prohibited for a woman to make tawaf showing her adornments, using perfume, or not covering properly what the <i>Shari&#8217;ah </i>requires her to be covered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">18. If a woman&#8217;s menses begins or she gives birth after entering into ihram, it is not permissible for her to make tawaf until the flow of blood ceases and she is cleansed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19. A woman may wear any dress for ihram as long as it does not resemble men&#8217;s clothing, show her adornments, or cause temptation to men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">20. To verbalize the intentions for acts of worship other than the hajj or &#8216;umrah is an innovation <i>(bid&#8217;a), and </i>to say it aloud is even more incorrect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">21. If a Muslim has the intention of making <i>hajj or </i>&#8216;<em>umrah</em>, it is forbidden for him to pass by the appointed Station of lhrem (al- miqat) without entering into ihram.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">22. If the pilgrim for <i>hajj or </i>&#8216;<em>umrah</em> is arriving by air, he enters into ihram on the plane when he passes parallel to the Station of ihram on his route. He is to prepare himself, for entering into ihram during the flight before boarding the plane.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">23. If one resides in Makkah, or between Makkah and the Stations of <i>Ihram </i>he need not go anywhere to take <i>ihram. </i>In this case, he is to take his <i>ihram </i>for either <i>hajj </i>or <i>&#8216;umrah </i>at his place of residence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">24. In order to increase the number of their <i>&#8216;umrahs, </i>some people go to al-Tan&#8217;im or al-J&#8217;iranah after the <i>hajj </i>and subsequently return for <i>&#8216;umrah. No </i>support for this practice exists in the <i>Shari&#8217;ah.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">.25. The pilgrim who is performing <i>hajj al-tamatt&#8217;u </i>re-enters <i>ihram</i> on the 8th of Dhul-Hijjah at the place in which he is staying in Makkah. It is not necessary for him to take <i>ihram </i>from any specified place within Makkah (such as al-Mizab), as many people do, nor is there any Farewell <i>Tawaf </i>for going out of Makkah at this time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">26. It is preferable to go to &#8216;Arafat from Mina on the 9th of Dhul- Hijjah after the sun has risen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">27. It is not permissible to depart from &#8216;Arafat on the 9th of Dhul- Hijjah before the sun has set. When the pilgrim departs after sunset, he should do so with ease and dignity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">28, The <i>Maghrib </i>and <i>&#8216;Isha </i>prayers are to be performed after arriving at Muzdalifah, whether at the time of <i>Maghrib </i>or during the period of <i>&#8216;lsha.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">29. It is permissible to gather the pebbles for stoning the Pillars from any place within the boundaries of Makkah <i>(al-Haram), </i>not necessarily from Muzdalifah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">30. It is not recommended to wash the pebbles. No report exists to the effect that the Prophet (peace be on him) or his Companions ever did this. Nor are the used pebbles to be used again.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">31. It is permissible for women, children and weak individuals to proceed to Mina at the end of the night.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">32, When the pilgrim arrives in Mina on the Day of &#8216;Eid (the 10th of Dhul-Hijjah), he should stop reciting <i>talbiyyah. </i>The pebbles are to be thrown successively, one by one, at the Stone Pillar of &#8216;Aqabah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">33. It is not required that the pebbles remain where they are thrown; it is only necessary that they be thrown at the Pillar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">34. According to the opinion of scholars, the period of sacrifice extends to the sunset of the third day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">35. Tawaf <i>al-ifadah or al-ziyarah </i>on the day of &#8216;Eid (the 10th of Dhul-Hijjah) is an essential part of the <i>hajj </i>and <i>hajj </i>is not complete without it. However, it is permissible to delay it until the end of the stay in Mina.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">36. The person making qiran between <i>hajj </i>and <i>&#8216;umrah </i>offers one <i>Sa,ye </i>only. The same is true in the case of ifrad, if the person keeps his <i>ihram </i>until the day of <i>an-Nahr.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">37. On the Day of Sacrifice, it is preferable that the pilgrims do things in the following order: begins by throwing pebbles at the Pillar of &#8216;Aqabah; then Offers his sacrifice; then shaves or clips his hair, he then makes tawaf of the K&#8217;abah followed by sa&#8217;ye Changing this order is, however, permissible<b>.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">38. Returning to full normal state is attained after one has done the following: (a) thrown the pebbles at the Pillar of &#8216;Aqabah; (b) shaved his head or clipped some of his hair; (c) done tawaf al-ifada with sa&#8217;ye.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">39. If the pilgrim decides to shorten his stay in Mina, it is necessary that he departs from Mina before the sunset.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">40. For a child who cannot do the throwing of pebbles, his guardian throws on his behalf after throwing his own pebbles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">41. A person who is not capable of going to the throwing due to old age, illness or pregnancy it is permitted to appoint someone else (his proxy) to do the throwing on his or her behalf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">42. The proxy first throws his own pebbles and thereafter, without leaving the place, throws the pebbles on behalf of the person whom he represents at each of the three Pillars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">43. Except for the residents of the Sacred Mosque, it is obligatory on anyone who is doing <i>hajj a</i> l-tamatt&#8217;u or hajj al-qiran to sacrifice a sheep or to share in the seventh part of a camel or a cow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">44. If the pilgrim is unable to make this sacrifice, he must fast three days during the <i>hajj </i>and seven days after returning home.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">45. It is preferable that these three days of fasting be completed before the Day of &#8216;Arafat so that he is not fasting on that day, or otherwise that he fast on the 11 th, 12th and 13th of Dhul-Hijjah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">46. It is permissible to fast these three days either consecutively or separately, and the same applies to the seven days of fasting at home.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">47. The Farewell <i>Tawaf (tawaf al-wida&#8217;) is </i>obligatory for every pilgrim excepting menstruating or post-partum women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">48. To visit the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque in Madinah is a <i>sunnah, </i>whether it is done before the <i>haii </i>or after it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">49. When you enter the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque, it is <i>sunnah </i>to pray two <i>rak&#8217;ats </i>of tahiyyat <i>al-masjid </i><i>(the (the </i>salah of greeting the mosque). Although you can perform this salah anywhere in the Mosque, it is preferable to perform it in the Rawdah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">50. Visiting the graves of the Prophet (peace be on him) and others is allowed for Males only, and not for females, so that they would not have to travel for such a visit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">51. Rubbing and wiping one&#8217;s hands against the walls of the chamber containing the Prophet&#8217;s tomb, kissing it, or doing circuits around it are all innovations which are prohibited. Such things were not done by our upright ancestors. in particular, making <i>tawaf </i>around the chamber <i>is shirk </i>(ascribing partners to Allah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">52. it is also shirk to call upon the Prophet (peace be upon him) for the fulfilment of a need or to remove a grief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">53. The Prophet&#8217;s life in his grave is in the state at <i>barzakh </i>(the state of existence between death and resurrection on the Day of Judgement) and is in no way similar to his life on earth before his death. The nature and reality of the life of <i>barzakh is </i>known only to Allah the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">54. People who stand in front of the Prophet&#8217;s grave, raising their hands and making supplications, are doing something alien to Islam. This is an innovation in the religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">55. Visiting the grave of the Prophet (peace be on him) is neither obligatory nor a condition for the completion of the <i>hajj, </i>as some people believe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">56. The <i>hadiths </i>cited by some people prescribing visitation of the Prophet&#8217;s grave either have weak authority or are fabricated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Some Supplications Which May Be Recited At &#8216;Arafat, at The Sacred Sites, and at Other Places Of Supplication</strong></span></p>

I ask You for good beginnings, good endings, the totality of goodness, from the first to the last, from within and from without, and I ask of You the highest ranks in the Garden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allah! I ask You to exalt my fame, lighten my burden, purify my heart, keep me chaste, forgive me my sins, and I ask of You a high rank in the Garden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allah! Bless me in my sight, in my hearing, in my soul, In my body, In my conduct; bless me in my life, in my family, in my work; accept my good deeds, and I ask of You a high rank in the Garden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allah! I seek refuge In You against difficulties, calamities, troubles, oppression and the ridicule of enemies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allah! O Controller of the Hearts!; Keep my heart firm in Your religion; keep it contented with Your worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allah! Grant us increase and not decrease, honor and not dishonor; give us Your favors and do not deprive us; prefer us, let not others be preferred to us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allah! Grant us the best of outcomes in all our affairs, and save us from disgrace in this world and from punishment in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allah! Grant us such fear of Your as will come between us and acts of disobedience to You; such obedience to You as will bring us to Your Garden; and such certainty that the calamities of this world will be made easy for us by You. Let us enjoy our hearing, our sight and our faculties as long as You grant us life, and let it be, the last to be taken away from us. Avenge us from those who have wronged us and help us against our enemies. Let no calamity be fall our religion; let not worldly affairs be our greatest care or all about which we know; and Let not those who have no fear of You and who do not show mercy toward us rule over us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allah! I ask You to bestow Your mercy on me, to forgive me, to protect me from every sin, to give me a share of every good, and to grant me the attainment of the Garden and salvation from the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allah! Leave not for us a sin which You have not forgiven, nor a shortcoming which You have not concealed, nor a wary which You have not removed, nor a debt which You have not paid, nor a need from among the needs of this world or the Hereafter, the fulfillment of which is beneficial for us and pleasing to You, which You have not fulfilled, O Most Merciful of all show us mercy!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allah! I ask for a mercy from You by which You will guide my heart, settle my affairs, remove my worries, protect me from what is unseen to me, make my face radiant, purify my deeds, inspire me with wisdom, avert calamities from me, and protect me from every evil,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allah! I ask You for success on the day of judgment, and a life of happiness, and the rank of the martyrs, the companionship of the prophets, and victory over the enemies.O Allah! I ask You for correctness of belief: for a faith which leads to good conduct, for a success which results in eternal felicity: for mercy, health and forgiveness from You, and for Your pleasure.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allah! I ask You for health, for integrity, for good character, and that I may be pleased with my portion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allah! I seek refuge in You from the evil of my self, and from the evil of every creature which You are grasping by its forelock. O my Lord, keep me on the straight path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allah! You hear my words, You behold my situation, You know what is open and what is hidden within me; nothing is hidden from You. It is me alone who is in need, a humble seeker of Your forgiveness. I beseech You with humility in my heart, with trembling and fear, in prostration and utter helplessness. O Allah! Grant me soundness of belief, goodness of character, forgiveness of my sins, and Your eternal pleasure in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah&#8217;s blessings be upon Muhammad and his family and Companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allah alone, and may His peace and blessings be upon His messenger and bondsman our Prophet Mohammed, his family and his companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The objective of this concise pamphlet is to explain how prophet Mohammed (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to perform his prayers. I would like to present this explanation to every male and female Muslim so that they may strive to take up the Prophet&#8217;s manner in performing their prayers as a model for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was narrated by Al Bukhari that Prophet Mohammed (Peace and blessings of Allah be on him) had said: &#8220;Perform your prayers in the same manner you had seen me doing.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, here is the explanation for the Prophet&#8217;s manner of prayer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) To perform completely the ablution, adopting the method commanded by Allah in the Quran: &#8220;O ye who believe, when ye prepare for prayer, wash your faces and your hands (and arms) to the elbows, rub your heads(with water) and (wash) your feet to the ankles.&#8221;(5:6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be on him) said: &#8220;Prayer without ablution is invalid.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) To turn one&#8217;s face and whole body towards the Ka&#8217;aba, The Holy House at Makkah, intending by heart to perform the prayer which he wants to fulfill, whether it is an obligatory prayer or a supererogatory prayer, the worshipper in all cases, should not pronounce his intention openly, because neither the Prophet nor his companions used to utter the intention for prayer. Thus, pronouncing the intention for prayer in audible voice is a heresy and an illicit action. Whether the individual be an Imam or performs his prayer individually, he should make (A Sutra) i.e. a curtain for his prayer. Directing the face towards the Qibla (The Ka&#8217;aba at Makkah) is an imperative condition for every prayer. However, there are few exceptions for this rule explained in authoritative books for whom who wish to refer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) To pronounce &#8220;Takbirat Al Ihram&#8221; that is to say &#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8221; celebrating by that the greatness of Allah and looking meanwhile, downwards to the place where he will prostrate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(4) To raise one&#8217;s hands up to the level of the shoulders or near to the lobes of his ears, while pronouncing &#8220;Takbirat Al‑ Ihram&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(5) To put one&#8217;s right hand over his left hand and left wrist, and put them both over his chest, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(6) It is advisable that the worshipper recite this opening supplication saying: &#8220;Allahumma bald bayni wa bayena khatayaya kama boadta bayena al‑mashriki wal maghribi, Allahumma naqqiniy min khatayaya kama yonaqa al thawbo alabyndo min aldans&#8230; Allahumma igysilniy min khatayaya bilmai wathalgi walbarad.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This supplication means: &#8220;O Allah, separate me from my sins as You have separated the east and west. O Allah, cleanse me of my sins as the white rope is cleansed from dirt. O Allah, wash off my sins with water, snow and hail.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or, may say instead:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Sobhanaka Allahumma wa bihamdika wa~abaraka Ismoka wata&#8217;la jaddoka wala ilaha ghayroka&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Praise and glory be to Allah. Blessed be Your Name, exalted be Your Majesty and Glory. There is no god but You.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or he may say any other supplications which the Prophet, (peace and blessings of Allah be on him) used to say in his prayers. It is better to recite these supplications alternately, the first one in the morning prayer &#8220;Fajr&#8221;, the second in the noon prayer &#8220;Zuhr&#8221;, each one by turn, in conformity with what the Prophet used to do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After reciting the opening supplication, the worshipper says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Aouzo billahi min al‑shaytani‑r‑ragim”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I seek protection of Allah against the accursed Satan.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Bism illahi‑Rahmani Raheem&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;In the name of Allah, the All Merciful, the All Compassionate.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and recites the Fatiha (The opening Sura of the glorious Quran).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Prophet Mohammed, may peace and blessings be upon him, said: &#8220;Prayer without reciting the Fatiha is invalid&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The worshipper should say &#8220;A&#8217;meen&#8221; after reciting the Fatiha loudly if the prayer is said loudly, and whisper it in inaudible prayers. To be in conformity with the traditions of the Prophet, the worshipper‑is advised to recite verses from medium size Suras of the Quran in the Zuhr (noon), Asr (late afternoon), and Isha (night) prayers. As for the Fajr (morning) prayer, the worshipper is advised to recite a passage from the long Suras of the Quran. He has the choice in Maghrib prayer (Evening prayer) either to recite passages from the long Suras or from the short Suras 6 of the Quran.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(7) Then, the worshipper bows in &#8220;Ruku&#8221; raising his hands up to the level of his shoulders or ears while saying &#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8221; &#8220;Allah is Great&#8221; then bends down, making his head and back on one level and putting his hands with the fingers spread on his knees.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The worshipper should feel serenity and tranquillity while bowing, he should say thrice at least:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Subhana Rabbiayl A&#8217;zim&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Glory be to my Lord, the Almighty.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is advisable to say while bowing in addition to that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Subhanak‑Allahumma Rabbana wa bi hamdika, Allahumma Ighfir liy&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Glory be to Thee, O Allah, and I praise Thee, forgive me my sins.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(8) To raise one&#8217;s head up from bowing, raising one&#8217;s hands to the level of his shoulders or ears, saying, in case of being Imam or praying alone:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Sami&#8217;a Allahu liman hamidah&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allah listens to him who praises Him&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While resuming the standing position, he should say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Rabbana wa laka al hamdu hamdan katheera&#8217;n tayyiban mobarakan feehiy mil&#8217;a ssamawati wa mila alardhi wa mil&#8217;a ma baynahoma wa mil&#8217;a ma Shita min shiyin ba&#8217;ad&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This supplication means:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Our Lord, praise be fore Thee only, praises plentiful and blessed as to fill the heavens, the earth, what in between, and fill that which will please Thee besides them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if the worshipper is a follower, and led in his prayer by the Imam he should say when rising up “Rabbana wa lake alhamd&#8230;” etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is advisable for the Imam, the follower, or who prays alone to add also:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;You Allah who deserve all praises and all glory, your praising is the best and most true of whatever Your servant can say, we all are Your servants, Our Lord, no one can ever deprive aught of what You have bestowed and no one can ever give aught of what You have deprived.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The worshipper is advised to put his hands on his chest, as he had done before he bowed. Both Wa&#8217;il Ibn Haggar and Sahl Ibn Sai&#8217;yd reported that this was the manner of the Prophet when he used to raise his head up after bowing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(9) To prostrate saying &#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8221; &#8220;Allah is Great&#8221;. He should touch the ground with his knees before touching it with his hands, if that is possible to him. If not, he is permitted to touch the ground by his hand before his knees. His fingers and toes should be directed towards the Qibla Makkah, and his hands should be stretched, and the fingers close together and not separated. In prostration, the worshipper should use these seven organs: The forehead, the nose, both hands, both knees and the internal parts of the toes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These seven organs should touch the ground. Then the worshipper should say thrice or more:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Subhana Rabbiyal A&#8217;ala&#8221;</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Glorified is my Lord, the Exalted.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is advisable to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Subhanaka Allahuma Rabbana wa bi hamdika, Allahuma Ighfir‑ liy.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Glory be to Thee, Our Lord, and I praise Thee. Our Lord, forgive me my sins.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is recommendable for the worshipper to exceed more and more in supplications and ask for more from his Lord, because the Prophet, may peace and blessings of Allah be on him, said (which means):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;As for bowing &#8220;Ruku&#8221; you should glorify your Lord during performing it, as for prostration, you should do your best to supplicate and ask for more from Him, because your supplications during prostration are more worthy to be accepted.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The worshipper should ask his Lord for prosperity both in this worldly life and in the Hereafter. Whether it is an obligatory prayer or an optional prayer, the worshipper, while prostrating, should neither bring his hands close to his sides, nor stick his abdomen to his thighs, or his thighs to his legs. The worshipper&#8217;s arms should be raised up from the ground because the Prophet, may peace and blessings of Allah be on him, prohibited putting the arms and stretching them on the ground, ordering that &#8220;adjust your prostration, keep straight in it, and stretch not your hands on the ground as dogs do.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(10) He should raise his head from prostration saying: &#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8221; and lays his left foot flat on the ground and sits upon it, keeping his right foot erected, his hands on his thighs and knees, and says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O my Lord, forgive me, have mercy on me, guide me, provide me with your blessings and console me.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The worshipper should feel tranquillity during this pause.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(11) To prostrate again saying &#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8221; and repeating during his prostration what he did and said in the first prostration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(12) Then the worshipper raises his head saying &#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8221; taking a pause similar to the pause between the two prostration; this is called &#8220;the pause for rest.&#8221; It is recommended for the worshipper to do such a pause, but there is no sin if he desists from it. Then the worshipper rises up and stands supporting on his knees, or on the ground if he cannot support himself on the knees, reads the Fatihah (The opening Sura of the glorious Quran) and some other verses of the Quran and do as just as he did in the first Rakaah (unit of prayer). Those who pray behind the Imam should not compete with him in the prayer actions as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said (which means):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Imam is to be followed, if he says: &#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8221; which means &#8220;Allah is Great&#8221; then say the same after him. If he bows in &#8220;Ruku&#8221; bow after him. If he says &#8220;Samia‑l‑lahu liman hamidah&#8221; which means &#8220;Allah hears him who praises Him&#8221;, then say: &#8220;Rabbana wa laka‑l‑hamd&#8221; which means &#8220;Our Lord! All praises are for Thee&#8221;; and if he prostrates, then prostrate after him&#8221;. (Bukhari V:1 P.37)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(13) If the prayer consists of two Rakaat (two units of prayer) as the morning prayer &#8220;Fajr&#8221;, Feast prayer &#8220;Eid&#8221;, or the Friday prayer &#8220;Jumu&#8217;a&#8221;, the worshipper sits after the second prostration, with his right foot erect, sitting on his left foot laid down, putting his right hand on his right thigh, all his fingers close‑fisted save the index finger which he uses to point out as a sign for his monotheistic belief, and his left hand is put on his left thigh. There is nothing in the way, if the worshipper keeps both the little and ring fingers closed, while rounding his thumb and middle finger in a ring‑shape, and uses his index finger to point out as a sign for his monotheistic belief. It has been related that the Prophet, may peace and blessings of Allah be on him, had practiced both of these ways, thus, it is advisable for the worshipper to perform the first way once and the other on the second time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The worshipper reads the Tashahud while sitting and says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Al‑tahiyatu lilahi wasalawatu watayibatu Assalamu alayha ayuha‑n‑nabiyu wa rahmat‑u‑llahi wa barakatuhu. Assalamu alayina wa ala ibadi‑l‑lahi‑s‑salalihiyn. Ashadu ala ilaha ila lahu wa ashadu anna Muhammadan abdoho wa raswuloh. Allahuma salliy ala Muhammad wa ala aali Muhamad, kama salayata ala Ibrahima wa aali Ibrahim. Inaka Hamidon Majid. Wa barik ala Mohammad wa ala aali Muhammad kama barkta ala Ibrahima wa aali Ibrahima. Inaka Hamidon Majid.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Greetings, prayers and the good things of life belong to Allah. Peace, mercy and blessing of Allah be on you, O Prophet. May peace be upon us and on the devout slaves of Allah. I testify that there is no god but Allah and I testify that Mohammed is His slave and messenger. O Allah, bless Mohammed and his family as You blessed Ibrahim and his family. You are the Most‑ Praised, The Most‑glorious. O Allah, bestow Your grace on Mohammed and his family as You bestwoed it on lbrahim and his family. You are the Most‑Praised, The Most‑glorious.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After reciting the Tashahud, the worshipper asks Allah&#8217;s protection from four evils, he should say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;My Lord, I ask your protection from torment of the Hell, torment of the grave the trials in life‑time and after death, and from the impostor Antichrist.&#8221; The worshipper may ask Allah for prosperity in this worldly life and in the Hereafter, supplicate Allah to bestow His favors on his parents and other Muslims. He could do this in both obligatory and optional prayers. It has been reported by Ibn Massoud that the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be on him, taught him how to recite the Tashahud and told him that the worshipper should invoke Allah and ask Him for the more beloved wishes which he likes, or, as it has been related in other wordings, the worshipper should ask Allah for whatever he wishes. In this manner, the servant can ask Allah for all the prosperity of this worldly life and the life to come.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The worshipper terminates his prayer by turning his face to the right saying: &#8220;As‑salamu alai kum wa rahmatu Allah&#8221; and to the left saying this salutation which means &#8220;Peace and mercy of Allah be on you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(14) In case of a three Rakaat prayer (prayer consisting of three units) as that of Maghrib prayer, (evening prayer), or a four Rakaat prayer like that of noon prayer (Zuhr), Asr prayer (late afternoon prayer) or, Isha prayer (night prayer), the worshipper stands up after reciting the Tashahud according to the manner stated before, and raises his hands up to the level of his shoulders saying (Allahu Akbar). The worshipper puts his hands over his chest as it had been explained before, and recites only the Fatiha. There is no objection if he adds to the Fatiha some other verses of the Quran while performing the third or fourth Rakaat (units of prayer) of noon prayer (Zuhr), because this was stated to be one of the manners adopted by the Prophet, may peace and blessings of Allah be on him, according to the tradition reported by Abi Saied.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the third Rakaah of Maghrib prayer (evening prayer), and the fourth Rakaah of Zuhr (noon), Asr (afternoon) and Isha (night) prayers, the worshipper recites the Tashahud and terminates his prayers by saying: &#8220;Assalamu‑alaikum wa rahmatu Allah&#8221; while turning first to the right, and second to the left as it has been explained before.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not an obligatory duty, but it is a recommendable prophetic tradition to invoke Allah after terminating the prayer by asking Him forgiveness thrice and saying before turning one&#8217;s face towards his followers if he is the Imam: &#8220;O Allah, Thou art peace and from Thee is peace, Thou art blessed, O possessor of Glory and Honour.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is advisable for the worshipper to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There is no god but Allah. He is the One. He has no partner. His is the dominion and to Him alone is the praise. He has power over all things. O Lord, none may withhold what You have given and none may give what You have withheld and the riches cannot avail a wealthy person with Thee. There is no might or power except by the support of Allah, There is no god but Allah and we do not worship but Him alone. To Him alone belong all bounties, to Him alone belong all grace, and to Him worthy praise is accorded. There is no god but Allah, to Whom we are sincere in devotion, even though the unbelievers may detest it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also advisable to the worshipper to extol Allah 33 times by saying (Subhana Allah). Praise Him by saying (Al Hamdu El‑Allah) 33 times also by saying &#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8221; and the worshipper completes his supplications to be one hundred by saying once: &#8220;There is no god but Allah. He is the One. He has no partner. His is the dominion and to Him alone is the praise. He has power over all things.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The worshipper adds to that the recitation of the verse of the Throne &#8220;Ayat Al‑ Kursiy&#8221;, Surat Al‑Ikhlas, Surat El‑Falaq, and Surat Al‑Nas. It is recommendable to recite these Suras thrice after the Fajr prayer (Morning prayer), and the Maghrib prayer (evening prayer) because this was reported to be one of the traditions of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be on him. As it had been stated before, all these after‑prayer supplications are optional and not obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every Muslim, whether be male or female, is recommended to pray 12 Rakaat of supererogatory prayers every day: four of these Rakaat (units of prayers) are before noon prayer, two after it, two after Maghrib prayer, two after Isha (night) prayer and two before the morning prayer ‑ These supererogatory prayers are called (Rawatib) which means: &#8220;Certain supererogatory exercises of optional prayers.&#8221; The Prophet peace and blessings of Allah be on him, preserved the performance of these optional prayers wherever he settled. During his travels, he used to practice the two optional Rakaat before the morning prayer and also the Witr prayer (after the Isha prayer).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no objection to perform these optional prayers in the mosque, but it is better to perform it at home, because the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be on him, said &#8220;The best of the prayers are those which are furfilled at one&#8217;s own home, with exception to obligatory prayers which should be performed in congregation at the mosque.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Observance of fulfilling these optional prayers is a means for gaining admission to paradise. The Prophet, may peace and blessings of Allah be on him, said (which means): &#8220;Whoever prays optionally twelve Rakoat every one day and night, Allah will reward him by an established dwelling in the paradise. &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also advisable to the Muslim to pray four optional Rakaat before Asr prayer (afternoon prayer), two before Maghrib prayer (evening prayer), and two before Isha prayer (night prayer), because this manner was reported to be one of the traditions of the Prophet. Allah, the Almighty says: &#8220;Ye have indeed in the Messenger of Allah an excellent exemplar&#8221; (33:21).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (May the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said (which means): &#8220;Perform your prayer in the same manner as you had seen me doing.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah is He Who is Able to render us success and prosperity, and may Allah give His blessings and peace to our Prophet Mohammed son of Abdullah, his family, his companions and whoever follows his way till doomsday.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Since the time of Prophet Muhammad those who disbelieved in his message have always diligently tried to put out the light of Allaah and to this day they have not ceased in trying to destroy Islam with every means, whether it be through the media, through war, occupation of Muslim countries and much more. We also witness how many Muslims fall subject to the traps of the disbelievers even at the hands of the Muslims themselves. One of the most prominent scholars of our time by the name of Shaykh Saalih bin Fawzan addresses these issues in a Friday sermon entitled; “The Response of the Muslims during trials”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He addresses how the Muslims should counter the plots and objectives of the disbelievers during these times. Recently the kuffaar have produced movies, illustrations and evil ideas about Prophet Muhammad and the religion of Islaam. They have plotted cleverly against the Muslims in ways that are not apparent to many. Along with this they continue to spread western ideologies amongst the Muslims which shaykh Fawzan may Allaah preserve him has shed light on.</p>

<p>Shaykh Salih Fawzaan (hafidhahullaah):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The meaning of jealously is the hoping in the removal of the blessing from the one who is envied. When he sees his brother blessed with what Allaah has given him, then he hopes that this blessing disappears from him for no other reason except because of his hatred and when he hated him (he therefore) envied him. Jealousy is an ancient disease, and the first to envy was Satan, (May Allaah’s curse be upon him) when he envied our father Adam for the virtues that Allah gave him. He created Adam by His hands, taught him the names of everything, made the Angels prostrate to him and let him live in His Paradise&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A beautiful and comprehensive explanation delivered by <em>Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Ramzaan al-Haajiree</em> (May <strong>Allah</strong> Preserve Him) expounding on the guidance of the Companions in dealing with the people of innovation. Herein the <em>Shaykh</em> presents some lofty benefits and salient points of contemplation from the <em>hadith</em> of <em>Ibn Mas’ood</em> and the people in <em>dhikr</em> circles, thus clarifying the approach of <em>Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah</em> regarding the people of innovation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This treatise was translated and compiled by <em>Abu Afnaan Muhammad ‘Abdullah</em> (May <strong>Allah</strong> Preserve him) with the explicit permission and approval of <em>Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Ramzaan al-Haajiree.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>An excerpt taken from the chapter:</strong> <em>The Person of Innovation in The Religion is Not Granted The Success To Repent</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Can a person of <i>bid’ah</i> come back? (The answer is) he sees himself as being upon the truth and the correct position, and believes that he is getting closer to Allah by practicing these forms of <i>bid’ah</i>. For this reason, the person of <i>bid’ah</i> is not granted success to make repentance.Why is this? This is because he does not consider himself as being wrong in the first place, unlike the person who engages in sins. Because the latter, even while he is engaging in sins or acts of disobedience, he knows within himself that he is doing something wrong, he wants to make repentance. However, the person who is upon <i>bid’ah </i>believes that he is doing a righteous action (bringing him closer to Allah), so how can he make repentance?&#8221;</p>

<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Read e-Book :</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following Ebook was transcribed from a tele-lecture by <em>ash-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Rabee’ al-Madkhalee (<span dir="RTL">حفظه الله</span>) </em>hosted by <em>Muwahhideen</em> Publications on 9<sup>th</sup> August 2012 entitled, &#8220;The Virtue and Excellence of the Last Ten Nights of <em>Ramadhaan.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Herein, the <em>Shaykh</em> discusses pertinent matters related to <em>Taraweeh, Laylatul Qadr, </em>the last ten night of <em>Ramadhaan</em> in general and other salient points of benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>~ An excerpt taken from the Ebook ~</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Dear brothers, this is going to be the last part of this phone lecture and we really need more action than statements. From the wisdom of <strong>Allah</strong> <span dir="RTL">سبحانه وتعالى</span>, is that He has hidden the Night of Decree from us and we do not know exactly when it is going to be in the last ten in the month of <em>Ramadhaan.</em> And He <span dir="RTL">سبحانه وتعالى</span> told His Prophet <span dir="RTL">صلّى اللَّهُ عليه وسلّم</span> exactly when it would be and when the Prophet <span dir="RTL">صلّى اللَّهُ عليه وسلّم</span> went out to his Companions to tell them exactly when the Night of Decree will be, he found two of the <em>Muslims</em> arguing with one another, asking him to judge between them so he became busy with their affair and was made to forget exactly which night is the Night of Decree in the last ten of <em>Ramadhaan.</em> This in itself indicates and shows us how bad it is to disagree with one another and how bad it is to fight amongst the <em>Muslims,</em> so much so that <strong>Allah</strong><span dir="RTL">سبحانه وتعالى</span>took away the knowledge of the exact day of <em>Laylatul Qadr</em> in the last ten. That is one way of looking at it.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">The Status of Jesus in Islam  &#8211; by Shaykh Rabee bin Hadee Al-Madkhalee</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a short essay <b>“Makaanatu ‘Eesaa fil-Islaam”</b> (The Status of Jesus in Islaam) written by Dr. Rabee’ bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee, a Muslim religious scholar from Saudi Arabia. The source used for this translation was the on-line version of the book, which can be found on <a href="http://www.rabee.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.rabee.net</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since the book, for the most part, is geared towards non-Muslim readers, particularly Christians, names of prophets and other righteous believers of the past are presented here in their standard English version, even though, they are pronounced differently in Arabic by Muslims. This was done to make it easier for the non-Muslim audience, who are not accustomed to the Arabic versions of these names, to read the treatise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, in many instances, the word “Allaah” was translated as God, in order to assist non-Muslim readers understand the subject at hand more clearly. However, the proper name of God, Allaah, was left as is in other parts where deemed appropriate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is hoped that this treatise may serve as a means to invite and call the Christian community to develop an understanding of how Jesus is viewed in the eyes of the Muslims and what we believe concerning him, as revealed to us by Allaah in the Qur’aan and the teachings of Prophet Muhammad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The story of Mary begins with this great connection of mentioning those whom God chose over mankind, which included the family of ‘Imraan, who were the parents of Mary. This is done in order to make it clear that Mary came from a righteous and noble family, and that she was part of the offspring of chosen prophets, and that her mother was a pious woman. An example of her piety and righteousness was that she vowed to offer what was in her womb to the services of God. She was hoping that it would be a boy, but instead she gave birth to a girl. So she returned this matter back to God, seeking His pardon and asking Him to protect her daughter and her offspring from the outcast Devil. So her Lord answered her supplication and warmly accepted Mary, causing her to be raised in a good manner and placing a righteous and merciful prophet, Zachariah, in charge of caring for her. This shows that the mother of Jesus had a tremendous upbringing.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“God is not in need of begetting a son. Attributing a child to Him is from the greatest forms of disbelief and misguidance, since it constitutes the highest level of insult and deficiency being ascribed to His Honor, Greatness and Lordship. This is since everything apart from God (the Creator) can only be one of His creations, and all of His creations submit themselves to His Honor and Grandness and are mandated to worship Him, whereas God is divine and free of begetting a child. This is why Allaah says to those who ascribe a child to Him, and His speech is the truth: <b>‘You have indeed brought forth something very terrible (i.e. an evil statement) – due to which the heavens are ready to tear apart, the earth split asunder, and the mountains fall in ruins. It is that they ascribe a child to the Most Merciful (i.e. God). However, it is not befitting for the (Majesty of the) Most Merciful that he should beget a child. There is none in the heavens and the earth except that he comes unto the Most Merciful as a servant. Verily, He knows each one of them, and has counted them a full counting. And each one of them will come to Him on the Day of Resurrection alone (and without any helpers).’</b>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<b>6.</b> In Chapter 21 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 46, it states: <b>‘But when they tried to arrest him, they feared the multitudes, since they held him to be a prophet.’</b>There is proof in this verse that the masses of people who believed in God and in Jesus were monotheists with pure and sincere faith, and that they believed that Jesus was a messenger and a prophet. This proves that their prophet, Jesus, had taught them this and cultivated them to believe in that. So they did not used to believe that he was God or the son of God, since he would not teach the people these things.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Has not the time come for the Christians, after hearing all of this, to hasten and rush to Islaam, especially the intellectual, educated and free thinking ones amongst them? We call them again to stand up before God in pairs and individually, then to reflect on this tremendous matter – of which there is no matter greater than it – with firm determination and impartiality and earnestly seeking to attain the truth and the reality, for it is indeed a crucial matter, which can either lead one to Paradise, the size of which spans the heavens and the earth, or to the Hellfire, whose fuel will be men and stones and which is prepared for those who disbelieve to reside therein forever. This is a matter that all of the messengers agreed on and which is contained in their revealed books, including Jesus, the servant and messenger of God. At this point, it is appropriate for us to honestly tell you: <b>‘O People of the Scripture! Come to a word that is just between us and you – that we worship none but God alone and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take others as lords besides God.’ Then if they turn away, say: ‘Bear witness that we are Muslims.’</b>”</p>
