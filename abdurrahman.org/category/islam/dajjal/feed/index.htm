<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And to have eemaan in al-Maseehud-Dajjaal (the False Messiah).</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the fundamentals of the Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah is to have eemaan in al-Maseehud-Dajjaal. And he is a man from the descendants of Aadam who will emerge amongst the Jews, and the Jews will follow him. And he is the Mahdee who the Jews are awaiting, because everyone lays claim to the Mahdee (this awaited Messiah). <strong>The Jews</strong> lay claim to him, and their Messiah is the al-Maseehud-Dajjaal. <strong>The Shee`ah</strong> are awaiting for the Mahdee who is hidden in the cave, as they say, who is from the descendants of al-Husayn <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>. Whereas the <strong>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah</strong>, they are waiting for the Mahdee whom the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam foretold about in the authentic ahaadeeth which are mutawaatir (reported in huge numbers) in meaning. And he will be a man from the family of the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> from the family of al-Hasan ibn `Alee. He will emerge at the end of time and the Muslims will give him pledge (bay `ah). And he will fight jihaad in Allaah’s cause. And he will fill the earth with justice. And he will lead the Muslims in Prayer. And whilst they are in that condition, al-Maseehud-Dajjaal will emerge. So the Muslims will continue to suffer from him until `Eesaa ibn Maryam `alayhis-salaam descends. So there are two Messiahs:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Messiah of misguidance and he is the Dajjaal, and</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Messiah of right guidance, and he is `Eesaa ibn Maryam <em>`alayhissalaatu was-salaam</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And al-Maseehud-Dajjaal, he is called al-Maseeh because of how quickly he can travel across the earth, because Allaah will make for him means that enable him to proceed quickly upon the earth to cause harm and to bring about evil and tribulations. And he is called ad-Dajjaal which is from the word ad-dajal which means falsehood, because the Dajjaal is the one who is extreme in ad-dajal, falsehood, because he is a great liar to the extent that he will claim that he is Allaah. And the people will be put to trial on account of him except for whomever Allaah makes firm. And there will be with him a garden and a fire. And he will work ‘miracles’, but they are supernatural events of devils; they are not karaamaat (miracles granted for righteous people), they are just supernatural events of the devils. Allaah will cause them to occur at his hand as a trial and as a test for the servants. So his danger is great; and therefore the Prophets warned against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the one who warned most against him is our Prophet Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And he commanded that we should seek refuge from his trial in our prayers in the last tashahhud when we seek refuge with Allaah from four: from the punishment of Hellfire and from the punishment of the grave and from the trials of life and death and from the trial of al-Maseehud-Dajjaal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his trial will be the greatest trial to occur upon the face of the earth, and Allaah’s refuge is sought. This is al-Maseehud-Dajjaal. And whilst he is like that, and he will have caused hardship to the Muslims and harmed them and put them to trial, then the Messiah `Eesaa ibn Maryam will descend from heaven. And he will chase the Dajjaal and he will kill him and relieve the Muslims from him. And he will take charge of the affair, and he will bring about justice upon the earth. And he will break the cross and kill the pigs and no religion will remain except for the religion of Islaam. Judaism, Christianity and the religions of the disbelievers will be abolished and nothing will remain except for Islaam. And he will judge with the sharee `ah, revealed law, given to Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. And he will be a follower of him, because there is no Prophet after Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. So the Messiah will descend as a follower of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and as one who judges by his revealed law, the sharee `ah of Islaam. This is what will occur with regard to the emergence of the Dajjaal and the descent of the Messiah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And `Eesaa is called Maseeh (Messiah), it is said, because he would wipe upon a person suffering an ailment and he would be cured by the permission of Allaah. And this was from his miracles `alayhis-salaatu was-salaam, that he would wipe with his hand upon the blind and the leper and a person born blind and his illness would pass away by his wiping upon him `alayhis-salaatu was-salaam. So therefore he was called al-Maseeh with the meaning of one who wipes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim (بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Book 041, Number 7028:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Fatimah bint Qais رضي الله عنها</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">.. So I set out towards that mosque and observed prayer along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and I was in the row of the women which was near the row of men. When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) had finished his prayer, he sat on the pulpit smiling and said: Every worshipper should keep sitting at his place. He then said: Do you know why I had asked you to assemble? They said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He said: By Allah. I have not made you assemble for exhortation or for a warning, but I have detained you here, for <strong>Tamim Dari</strong>, a Christian, who came and accepted Islam, told me something, which agrees with what I was telling, you about the Dajjal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He narrated to me that he had sailed in a ship along with thirty men of Bani Lakhm and Bani Judham and had been tossed by waves in the ocean for a month. Then these (waves) took them (near) the land within the ocean (island) at the time of sunset. They sat in a small side-boat and entered that Island. There was a beast with long thick hair (and because of these) they could not distinguish his face from his back. They said: Woe to you, who can you be? Thereupon it said: I am <strong>al-Jassasa</strong>. They said: What is al-Jassasa? And it said: O people, go to this person in the monastery as he is very much eager to know about you. He (the narrator) said: When it named a person for us we were afraid of it lest it should be a Devil. Then we hurriedly went on till we came to that monastery and found a well-built person there with his hands tied to his neck and having iron shackles between his two legs up to the ankles. We said: Woe be upon thee, who are you? And he said: You would soon come to know about me. but tell me who are you. We said: We are people from Arabia and we embarked upon a boat but the sea-waves had been driving us for one month and they brought as near this island. We got Into the side-boats and entered this island and here a beast met us with profusely thick hair and because of the thickness of his hair his face could not be distinguished from his back. We said: Woe be to thee, who are you? It said: I am al- Jassasa. We said: What is al-Jassasa? And it said: You go to this very person in the monastery for he is eagerly waiting for you to know about you. So we came to you in hot haste fearing that that might be the Devil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (that chained person) said: Tell me about the <strong>date-palm trees of Baisan</strong>. We Said: About what aspect of theirs do you seek information? He said: I ask you whether these trees bear fruit or not.We said: Yes Thereupon he said: I think these would not bear fruits. He said: Inform me about the <strong>lake of Tabariyya</strong>? We said: Which aspect of it do you want to know? He said: Is there water in it? They said: There is abundance of water in it. Thereupon he said: I think it would soon become dry. He again said: Inform me about the <strong>spring of Zughar</strong>. They said: Which aspect of it you want to know? He (the chained person) said: Is there water in it and does it irrigate (the land)? We said to him: Yes, there is abundance of water in it and the inhabitants (of Medina) irrigate (land) with the help of it, He said: Inform me about the <strong>unlettered Prophet</strong>; what has he done? We said: He has come out from Mecca and has settled In Yathrib (Medina). He said: Do the Arabs fight against him? We said: Yes. He said: How did he deal with him? We informed him that he had overcome those in his neighbourhood and they had submitted themselves before him. Thereupon he said to us: Had it actually happened? We said: Yes. Thereupon he said: If it is so that is better for them that they should show obedience to him. I am going to tell you about myself and I am Dajjal and would be soon permitted to get out and so I shall get out and travel in the land, and will not spare any town where I would not stay for forty nights except Mecca and Medina as these two (places) are prohibited (areas) for me and I would not make an attempt to enter any one of these two. An angel with a sword in his hand would confront me and would bar my way and there would be angels to guard every passage leading to it;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) striking the pulpit with the help of the end of his staff said: This implies <strong>Taiba</strong> meaning Medina. Have I not, told you an account (of the Dajjal) like this? &#8216;The people said: Yes, and this account narrated by Tamim Dari was liked by me for it corroborates the account which I gave to you in regard to him (Dajjal) at Medina and Mecca. Behold he (Dajjal) is in the Syrian sea (Mediterranian) or the Yemen sea (Arabian sea). Nay, on the contrary, he is in the east, he is in the east, he is in the east, and he pointed with his hand towards the east.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Fatima bint Qais) said: I preserved It In my mind (this narration from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>

Ahadith about Dajjal and Portents of the Hour</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1808.</b> An-Nawwas bin Sam`an (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: One morning the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) made a mention of Dajjal, and he described him to be insignificant and at the same time described him so significant that we thought he was on the date-palm trees (i.e., nearby). When we went to him (the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) in the evening, he perceived the sign of fear on our faces. He said, &#8220;What is the matter with you?&#8221; We said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, you talked about Dajjal this morning raising your voice and lowering it until we thought he was hiding in the palm-trees grove: He said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Something other than Dajjal make worry about you. If he appears while I am with you, I will defend you against him. But if he appears after I die, then everyone of you is his own defender. Allah is the One Who remains after me to guide every Muslim. Dajjal will be a young man with very curly hair with one eye protruding (with which he cannot see). I compare (his appearance) to that of Al-`Uzza bin Qatan. He who amongst you survives to see him, should recite over him the opening Ayat of Surat Al-Kahf (i.e., Surat 18: Verses 1-8). He will appear on the way between Syria and Iraq and will spread mischief right and left. O slaves of Allah! Remain adhered to the truth</span>.&#8221; We asked: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! How long will he stay on the earth?&#8221; He said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">For forty days. One day will be like a year, one day like a month, one day like a week and the rest of the days will be like your days</span>.&#8221; We said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Will one day&#8217;s Salat (prayer) suffice for the Salat of that day which will be equal to one year?&#8221; Thereupon he said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">No, but you must make an estimate of time and then offer Salat</span>.&#8221; We said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! How quickly will he walk upon the earth?&#8221; Thereupon he said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Like cloud driven by the wind (i.e., very quickly). He will come to the people and call them to his obedience and they will affirm their faith in him and respond to him. He will then give command to the sky and it will send its rain upon the earth and he will then send his command to the earth and it will grow vegetation. Then in the evening their pasturing animals will come to them with their humps very high and their udders full of milk and their flanks stretched. He will then come to another people and invite them, but they will reject him and he will leave them, in barren lands and without any goods and chattels! He would then walk through the waste land and say to it: `Bring forth your treasures&#8217;, and the treasures will come out and follow him like swarms of bees. He will then call a person brimming with youth and strike him with the sword and cut him into two pieces and make these pieces lie at a distance, which is generally between the archer and his target. He will then call that young man and he will come forward, laughing, with his face gleaming out of joy; and it will be at this very time that Allah will send `Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary) who will descend at the white minaret in the eastern side of Damascus, wearing two garments lightly dyed and placing his hands on the wings of two angels. When he will lower his head, there would fall drops of water from his head, and when he will raise it up, drops like pearls would scatter from it. Every disbeliever who will find his (i.e., `Isa&#8217;s) smell will die and his smell will reach as far as he will be able to see. He will then search for Dajjal until he will catch hold of him at the gate of Ludd (village near Jerusalem), and will kill him. Then the people, whom Allah will have protected, will come to `Isa son of Maryam, and he will wipe their faces and will inform them of their ranks in Jannah, and it will be under such conditions that Allah will reveal to `Isa these words: `I have brought forth from amongst my slaves such people against whom none will be able to fight, so take these people safely to the mountain.&#8217; And then Allah will send Ya&#8217;juj and Ma&#8217;juj (Gog and Magog people) and they will sworn down from every slope. The first of them will pass the Lake Tabariyah (near the Dead Sea in Palestine) and drink all its water. And when the last of them will pass, he will say: `There was once water there.&#8217; Prophet `Isa (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and his companions will then be so much hard-pressed that the head of an ox will be dearer to them than one hundred dinar, and `Isa along with his companions, will make supplication to Allah, Who will send insects which will attack their (Ya&#8217;juj and Ma&#8217;juj people) neck until they all will perish like a single person. Prophet, `¦sa and his companions will then come down and they will not find in the earth as much space as a single span which would not be filled with their corpses and their stench. Prophet `Isa and his companions will then again beseech Allah, Who will send birds whose necks will be like those of Bactrian camels, and they will carry them and throw them where Allah will desire. Then Allah will send down rain which will spare no house in the city or in the countryside. It would wash away the earth until it appears like a mirror. Then the earth will be told to bring forth its fruit and restore its blessings; and as a result of this, there will grow such a big pomegranate that a group of people will eat from it and seek shelter under its skin. Milk will be so blessed that the milk of one she-camel will suffice for a large company and the cow will give so much milk, that it will suffice for a whole tribe. The sheep will give so much milk that the whole family will be able to drink out of that, and at that time Allah will send a pleasant wind which will soothe people even under their armpits, and will take the life of every Muslim and true believer, and only the wicked will survive. They will commit adultery in public like asses and the Resurrection Day will be held</span>.&#8221;<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1809.</b> Rib`i bin Hirash (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I accompanied Abu Mas`ud Al-Ansari to Hudaifah bin Al-Yaman (May Allah be pleased with them). Abu Mas`ud said to him: &#8220;Tell us what you heard from the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) about Dajjal (the Antichrist).&#8221; Hudaifah said: He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Dajjal will appear, and with him will be water and fire. That which people consider to be water will in fact be a burning fire, and that which people will consider to be fire will in fact be cool and sweet water. He who from amongst you happens to face him, should jump into that which he sees as fire for that will be nice and sweet water.</span>&#8221; Abu Mas`ud said: &#8220;I have also heard this from the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam).&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1810.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Dajjal (the Antichrist) will appear in my Ummah and he will stay in the world for forty. I do not know whether this will be forty days or forty months or forty years. Allah will then send (Prophet) `Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary). `Isa will pursue him and slaughter him. Then people will survive for seven years (i.e., after the demise of `Isa) in the state that there will be no rancour between two persons. Then Allah will send a cool breeze from the side of Ash-Sham. None will remain upon the face of the earth having the smallest particle of good or Faith in him but he will die, so much so that even if someone amongst you will enter the innermost part of a mountain, this breeze will reach that place also and will cause him to die. Only the wicked people will survive and they will be as fast as birds (i.e., to commit evil) and as ferocious towards one another as wild beasts. They will never appreciate the good, nor condemn evil. Then Shaitan (Satan) will come to them in the garb of a man and will say: `Will you not obey me?&#8217; They will say: `What do you order us to do?&#8217; He will command them to worship idols. They will have abundance of sustenance and will lead comfortable lives. Then the Trumpet will be blown. Every one hearing it, will turn his neck towards it and will raise it. The first one to hear that Trumpet will be a man who will be busy repairing the basin for his camels. He will become unconscious. Allah will send, or will cause to send, rain which will be like dew and there will grow out of it (like wild growth) the bodies of the people. Then the second Trumpet will be blown and they will stand up and begin to look around. Then it will be said: `O people! Go to your Rubb.&#8217; Then there will be a command: `Make them stand there.&#8217; After it they will be called to account. Then it will be said: `Separate from them the share of the Fire.&#8217; It will be asked: `How much?&#8217; It will be said: `Nine hundred and ninety-nine out of every thousand.&#8217; That will be the Day which will make children hoary-headed men because of its terror and that will be the Day when the Shin will be uncovered</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1811.</b> Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">There will be no land which will not be trampled by Dajjal (the Antichrist) but Makkah and Al-Madinah; and there will be no passage leading to them which will not be guarded by the angels, arranged in rows. Dajjal will appear in a barren place adjacent to Al-Madinah and the city will be shaken three times. Allah will expel from it every disbeliever and hypocrite.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1812.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Dajjal (the Antichrist) will be followed by seventy thousand Jews of Isfahan and will be dressed in robes of green coloured satin</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1813.</b> Umm Sharik (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: I heard the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">People will run away from Dajjal (the Antichrist) seeking shelter in the mountains.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1814.</b> `Imran bin Hussain (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Between time of the creation of Adam and the Resurrection Day, there is nothing greater than the mischief of Dajjal (the Antichrist).</span>&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1815.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Dajjal (the Antichrist) will come forth and a person from amongst the believers will go towards him and the armed watchmen of Dajjal will meet him and they will say to him: `Where do you intend to go?&#8217; He will say: `I intend to go to this one who has appeared.&#8217; They will say to him: `Don&#8217;t you believe in our lord (meaning Dajjal)?&#8217; He will say: `There (i.e., we know Him to be Allah, Alone, without any partners) is nothing hidden about our Rubb.&#8217; Some of them will say: `Let us kill him&#8217;, but some others will say: `Has your lord (Dajjal) not forbidden you to kill anyone without his consent?&#8217; So they will take him to Dajjal. When the believer will see him, he will say: `O people! This is Dajjal about whom the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) has informed us.&#8217; Dajjal will have him laid on his stomach and have his head. He will be struck on his back and on his stomach. Dajjal will ask him: `Don&#8217;t you believe in me?&#8217; He will say: `You are the false Messiah.&#8217; He will then give his order to have him sawn with a saw into two from the parting of his hair up to his legs. After that Dajjal will walk between the two halves and will say to him: `Stand up&#8217;, and he will stand on his feet. He will then say to him: `Don&#8217;t you believe in me?&#8217; The person will say: `It has added to my insight that you are Dajjal&#8217;. He will add: `O people! He will not be able to behave with anyone amongst people in such a manner after me.&#8217; Dajjal will try to kill him. The space between his neck and collarbone will turn into copper and he will find no way to kill him. So he will catch hold of him by his hand and feet and throw him into (what appears to be the fire). The people will think that he has been thrown into the fire whereas he will be thrown into Jannah.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) added, &#8220;He will be the most eminent amongst the people with regard to martyrdom near the Rubb of the worlds</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1816.</b> Al-Mughirah bin Shu`bah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: No one asked the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) more about Dajjal than I asked him. He said to me, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He will not harm you</span>.&#8221; I said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, it is reported that he will have with him a mountain of bread and a river full of water.&#8221; Thereupon he said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He (Dajjal) is far too worthless and insignificant near Allah (to let him deceive the believers).</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1817.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">There has not been a Prophet who has not warned his Ummah of that one-eyed liar (Dajjal). Behold, he is blind in one eye and your Rubb (Allah) is not blind. On his forehead are the letters: (K.F.R.) (meaning Kafir- disbeliever</span>).&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1818.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Let me tell you something about Dajjal (the Antichrist) which no Prophet had told his people. He is blind (in one eye) and will bring with him something like Jannah and Hell; but what he calls Jannah will be in fact Hell</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1819.</b> `Abdullah bin `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) said: One day the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) mentioned Al-Masih Dajjal (the Antichrist) in the presence of the people and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Verily, Allah is not one-eyed but Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal is blind in the right eye which looks like a swollen grape</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1820.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah(sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The Last Hour will not come until the Muslims fight against the Jews, until a Jew will hide himself behind a stone or a tree, and the stone or the tree will say: `O Muslim, there is a Jew behind me. Come and kill him,&#8217; but Al-Gharqad tree will not say so, for it is the tree of the Jews.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1821.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, the world will not come to an end until a man passes by a grave and will lie over it saying, `Would that I were in this grave (i.e., dead)!&#8217; Not he will say so because of religious reasons but because of widespread mischief and severe trials of this world</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1822.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The Hour will not come to pass before the River Euphrates dries up to unveil the mountain of gold, for which people will fight. Ninety-nine out of one hundred will die (in the fighting) and every man amongst them will say: `Perhaps I may be the only one to remain alive</span>.&#8221;&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The time is near when the River Euphrates will dry up to unveil a treasure of gold. Whosoever may be alive at that time, should not take anything of it</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1823.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">People will desert Al-Madinah in spite of it being in better condition except for wild beasts and birds. The Last Hour will happen upon two shepherds of the tribe of Muzainah. They will enter Al-Madinah driving their sheep but will find it full of wild beasts and would turn away. When they will arrive at the hill named Thaniyyat-ul-Wada` they will fall on their faces.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1824.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">From your caliphs there will be one in the Last Days who will distribute wealth without counting it</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1825.</b> Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">A time will come when a man will go about with alms from his gold and will not find anyone to receive it. One man will be seen being followed by forty women dependant upon him on account of the scarcity of men and excess of women.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1826.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">A man bought a piece of land from another man, and the buyer found a jar filled with gold in the land. The buyer said to the seller: `Take your gold, as I bought only the land from you and not the gold.&#8217; The owner of the land said: `I sold you the land with everything in it.&#8217; So both of them took their case before a third man who asked: `Have you any children?&#8217; One of them said: `I have a boy.&#8217; The other said, `I have a girl.&#8217; The man said: `Marry the girl to the boy and spend the money on them; and whatever remains give it in charity.</span>&#8221;&#8217;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1827.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">There were two women, each had her child with her. A wolf came and took away the child of one of them. One woman said to her companion: `The wolf has taken your son.&#8217; The other said: `It has taken your son.&#8217; So both of them took the dispute to Prophet Dawud (David) (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) who judged that the boy should be given to the older lady. Then they went to Prophet Sulaiman (Solomon) (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) son of Dawud and put the case before him. Prophet Sulaiman said: `Give me a knife so that I may cut the child into two and give one half to each of you.&#8217; The younger woman said: `Do not do so; may Allah bless you! He is her child.&#8217; On that Prophet Sulaiman decided the case in favour of the younger woman.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1828.</b> Mirdas Al-Aslami (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The pious men will depart one after another, the dregs of people, like the sediment of barley or dates will remain; Allah will not raise them in value and esteem.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1829.</b> Rifa`ah bin Rafi` Az-Zuraqi (May Allah be pleased with him) said: Jibril (<span style="color:#800000;">Gabriel</span>) came to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and asked him: &#8220;How do you estimate among you those who participated in the battle of Badr?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">They were the best of Muslims&#8221;</span> (or he may have said something similar to that). Jibril said: &#8220;The same is the case with the angels who were at Badr.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1830.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">If Allah afflicts punishment upon a nation, it befalls the whole population indiscriminately and then they will be resurrected and judged according to their deeds.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1831.</b> Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">There was a trunk of a date-palm tree upon which the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to recline while delivering Khutbah (sermon). When a pulpit was placed in the mosque, we heard the trunk crying out like a pregnant she-camel. the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) came down from the pulpit and put his hand on the trunk and it became quiet.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to stand by a tree or a date-palm on Friday (to give the Khutbah). Then an Ansari woman or man said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Shall we make a pulpit for you?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">If you wish</span>.&#8221; So they made a pulpit for him and when it was Friday, the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) sat on the pulpit [to deliver the Khutbah (sermon)] and the trunk of the date-palm on which he used to recline cried out as if it would split asunder.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Another narration is: It cried like a child and the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) descended (from the pulpit) and embraced it while it continued moaning like a child being quietened. The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">It was crying for (missing) what it used to hear of Dhikr near it</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1832.</b> Abu Tha`labah Al-Khushani (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allah, the Exalted, has laid down certain duties which you should not neglect, and has put certain limits which you should not transgress, and has kept silent about other matters out of mercy for you and not out of forgetfulness, so do not seek to investigate them.</span>&#8221;<br />

You are Messenger of Allah and His Word (i.e., &#8220;Be&#8221;-and he was) which he bestowed on Maryam (Mary) and a spirit created by Him; and you talked to the people while you were in the cradle. Please intercede for us with your Rubb. Do you not see our (miserable) condition?&#8217; `¦sa will say: `Today my Rubb has become so angry as He has never been before, nor will He ever be like this hereafter.&#8217; `Isa will not mention any sin, but will say: `I am worried about myself. Go to someone else. Go to Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam).</span>&#8221;&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Another narration is: The Messenger of Allah said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">They will come to me and say: `O Muhammad! You are the Messenger of Allah and the Last of Prophets, and Allah has forgiven your past and future sins. Please intercede for us with your Rubb. Do you not see our (miserable) condition?&#8221;&#8217; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) added, &#8220;Then I will proceed under Allah&#8217;s Throne and fall down in prostration before my Rubb. Then, He will bestow upon me knowledge of such praises and glorification to Him as He has never bestowed upon anybody else before me. Then I will be addressed: `O Muhammad! Raise your head. Ask, and your request will be granted. Intercede, and your intercession will be accepted.&#8217; So I will raise my head and say: `My followers, O my Rubb! My followers, O my Rubb! My followers, O my Rubb!&#8217; It will be said: `O Muhammad! Admit into Jannah such people as are not subjected to reckoning through the right gate of Jannah.&#8217; The rest of them will be admitted along with the rest of mankind through the various gates of Jannah.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) further said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is! The distance between every two sides of the gates of Jannah is like the distance between Makkah and Hajar, or that between Makkah and Busra (Syria).</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1867.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Ibrahim (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) brought his wife and her son Isma`il (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka`bah under a tree on the spot of Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. In those days, there was no human being in Makkah, nor was there any water. So he made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Isma`il&#8217;s mother followed him saying: &#8220;O Ibrahim! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?&#8221; She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her. Then she asked him: &#8220;Has Allah commanded you to do so?&#8221; He said: &#8220;Yes.&#8221; She said: &#8220;Then He will not neglect us.&#8221; She returned while Ibrahim proceeded onwards. Having reached the Thaniya, where they could not see him, he faced Ka`bah, raised his both hands and supplicated: &#8220;<span style="color:#ff0000;">O our Rubb! I have made some of my offspring to dwell in an uncultivable valley by Your Sacred House (the Ka`bah at Makkah) in order, O our Rubb, that they may perform As-Salat (Iqamat-as-Salat). So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits so that they may give thanks.</span>&#8221; (14:37).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Isma`il&#8217;s mother went on suckling Isma`il and drinking from the water which she had. When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at Isma`il, tossing in agony. She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of As-Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from As-Safa, and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble till she crossed the valley and reached Al-Marwah mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between As-Safa and Al-Marwah) seven times.&#8221; Ibn `Abbas further related: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">This is the source of the tradition of the Sa`y &#8211; i.e., the going of people between the two mountains. When she reached Al-Marwah (for the last time), she heard a voice and she exclaimed: `Shshs!&#8217; (Silencing herself) and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said: `O (whoever you may be) You have made me hear your voice; have you any succour for me?&#8217; And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or with his wing), till water flowed out from that place. She started to make something like of a basin around it, using her hands in this way and began to fill her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out until she had scooped some of it</span>.&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) further said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">May Allah bestow mercy on Isma&#8217;il&#8217;s mother! Had she let the Zamzam flow without trying to control it (or had she not scooped in that water) while filling her water-skin, Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth</span>.&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) further added, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her: `Do not be afraid of being neglected, for this is the site on which the House of Allah will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah will never let neglected His people.&#8217; The House of Allah (the Ka`bah) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She continued living in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum passed by her and her child. As they were coming from through the way of Kada`, in the lower part of Makkah where they saw a bird that had a habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said: `This bird must be flying over water, though we know that there is no water in this valley.&#8217; They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came towards the water</span>.&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) added, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Isma`il&#8217;s mother was sitting near the water. They asked her: `Do you allow us to stay with you?&#8217; She replied: `Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water.&#8217; They agreed to that</span>.&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) further said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Isma`il&#8217;s mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them. The child (i.e., Isma`il) grew up and learnt Arabic from them (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty, they gave him one of their daughters in marriage. After Isma`il&#8217;s mother had died, Ibrahim came after Isma`il&#8217;s marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Isma`il there. When he asked Isma`il&#8217;s wife about him, she replied: `He has gone in search of our livelihood.&#8217; Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied complaining to him: `We are living in hardship, misery and destitution.&#8217; He said: `When your husband returns, convey my salutations to him and tell him to change the threshold of the door of his house.&#8217; When Isma`il came, he seemed to have perceived something unusual. He asked his wife: `Did anyone visit you?&#8217; She replied: `Yes, an old man of such and such description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and, I told him that we were living in hardship and poverty.&#8217; Thereupon Isma`il said: `Did he advise you anything?&#8217; She replied: `Yes, he told me to convey his salutations to you and to change the threshold of your door.&#8217; Isma`il said: `That was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family.&#8217; So Isma`il divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (Jurhum). Then Ibrahim stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them again but did not find Isma`il. So he came to Isma`il&#8217;s wife and asked her about him. She said: `He has gone in search of our livelihood.&#8217; Ibrahim asked her about their sustenance and living: `How are you getting on?&#8217; She replied: `We are prosperous and well off.&#8217; Then she praised Allah, the Exalted. Ibrahim asked: `What kind of food do you eat?&#8217; She said: `Meat.&#8217; He said: `What do you drink?&#8217; She said: `Water.&#8217; He said, `O Allah! Bless their meat and water!</span>&#8221;&#8217; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) added, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it</span>.&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) further said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected because these things do not suit him unless he lives in Makkah</span>.&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) added, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Then Ibrahim said to Isma`il&#8217;s wife, `When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his door.&#8217; When Isma`il came back, he asked his wife: `Did anyone call on you?&#8217; She replied: `Yes, a good looking old man came to me.&#8217; She praised him and added: `He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in good condition.&#8217; Isma`il asked her: `Did he give you a piece of advice?&#8217; She said: `Yes, he told me to convey his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your door.&#8217; On that Isma`il said: `He was my father and you are the threshold of the door. He has ordered me to keep you with me.&#8217; Then Ibrahim stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them afterwards. He saw Isma`il under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Ibrahim, he rose up to welcome him, and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father. Ibrahim said: `O Isma`il! Allah has given me an order.&#8217; Isma`il said: `Do what your Rubb has commanded you to do.&#8217; Ibrahim asked: `Will you help me?&#8217; Isma`il said: `I will help you.&#8217; Ibrahim said: `Allah has ordered me to build a house here, pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it</span>.&#8221;&#8217; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) added, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e., Ka`bah). Isma`il brought the stones and Ibrahim was building (the house). When the walls became high, Isma`il brought stone and placed it for Ibrahim who stood over it and carried on building the House, while Isma`il was handing over the stones to him, both of them prayed: `O our Rubb! Accept this service from us! Verily, You are the All-Hearer and the All-Knower</span>.&#8221;&#8217;<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1868.</b>  Sa`id bin Zaid (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Truffle (edible fungus) is a species of Al-Manna and their water cures eye diseases</span>.&#8221;<br />
