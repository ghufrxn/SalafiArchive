<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 62 : Point 107</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>He who limits himself to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa salam</em>) and that which his Companions and the Jamaa’ah were upon is successful and triumphs over all the people of innovation and his body is relaxed and his religion is safe, if Allah wills, since the Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said, “<span style="color:#800000;">My Ummah will split…</span>” and the Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) told us which would be the saved sect, saying, “<span style="color:#800000;">That which I and my Companions are upon</span>” </strong></span>[1]<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>. This is the cure, the explanation, the clear affair and the straight and distinct road. The Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said, “Beware of going to extremes and harshness. Beware of exaggeration and cling to the ancient religion” </strong></span>[2].</p>
<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Reported by at-Tirmidhee (no.2643) and others and it is hasan, as has preceded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] This is not a hadeeth of the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>), but is a saying of Ibn Mas’ood (<em>radiallaahu anhu</em>) as reported by ad-Daarimee in his Sunan (1/50/nos.144. 145), ‘Abdur-Razzaaq in his Musannaf (10/252) and Ibn Nasr in as-Sunnah (no.85) and others and is saheeh as such.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Abbaas (<em>radiallaahu anhu</em>) reports that the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said, <strong>“Beware of exaggeration in the religion for, indeed, those before you were destroyed due to exaggeration in the religion.”</strong> Reported by Ahmad, an-Nasaa’ee and Ibn Maajah and it is saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas’ood (<em>radiallaahu anhu</em>) reports that the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said, <strong>“ Those who go to extremes are destroyed.”</strong> Reported by Ahmad, Muslim and Abu Daawood (Eng. trans. 3/1294/no.4591) and it is saheeh</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And cling together to the rope of Allaah and do not separate. </strong></span>(Soorah Aali-Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>103)</p>
<p><strong>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ فَرَّقُوا دِينَهُمْ وَكَانُوا شِيَعًا لَّسْتَ مِنْهُمْ فِي شَيْءٍ ۚ إِنَّمَا أَمْرُهُمْ إِلَى اللَّهِ ثُمَّ يُنَبِّئُهُم بِمَا كَانُوا يَفْعَلُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Those who split up their religion and become sects, you have nothing to do with them. Their affair is just with Allaah. Then He will inform them of what they used to do. </strong>(</span>Sooratul An`aam (6), <em>aayah </em>159)</p>
<p><strong>وَلَا تَكُونُوا كَالَّذِينَ تَفَرَّقُوا وَاخْتَلَفُوا مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَهُمُ الْبَيِّنَاتُ ۚ وَأُولَٰئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And do not be like those who split and differed after the clear signs have come to them. And they are the ones for whom will be a tremendous punishment. </strong></span>(Soorah Aali-Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>105)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He forbade us from splitting and He commanded us with uniting and with clinging on to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger. So He said:</p>
<p><strong>وَأَنَّ هَٰذَا صِرَاطِي مُسْتَقِيمًا فَاتَّبِعُوهُ ۖ وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا السُّبُلَ فَتَفَرَّقَ بِكُمْ عَن سَبِيلِهِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And this is my straight way so follow it and do not follow the divergent paths for they will split you and lead you away from His path.</span> </strong>(Sooratul An`aam (6), <em>aayah </em>153)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not permissible to split and differ on account of desires or on account of <em>taqleed</em> (blindly following) fathers and forefathers or as a result of blindly following the Jews and the Christians. Differing is not permissible in the matters of `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) and in the fundamentals of the religion. Rather, it is obligatory to agree and to be united with regard to it. As for differing in issues of <em>fiqh</em> then this occurs. However, it is obligatory to return and refer back to those sayings which the proof establishes. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>فَإِن تَنَازَعْتُمْ فِي شَيْءٍ فَرُدُّوهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَالرَّسُولِ إِن كُنتُمْ تُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ وَأَحْسَنُ تَأْوِيلًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So if you dispute about anything then refer it back to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger if you truly believe in Allaah and in the Last Day. That is better and finer in its outcome.</span> </strong>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), <em>aayah </em>59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore <em>ikhtilaaf</em> (differing) in `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) is not permissible because `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) is <em>tawqeefeeyah</em> (reliant upon text). It is not a place for <em>ijtihaad</em> (scholarly deduction). But as for the issues of <em>fiqh</em> and <em>istinbaat</em> (deduction of rulings) then in that case, each one of the People of Knowledge in that matter who are suitable to promote <em>ijtihaad</em> can strive to deduce rulings and they may differ in their outlooks. However, they should not just remain upon their differing. Rather, they should refer back to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger. So, whoever has proof then they should follow him and take his saying and leave their own opinions. This is the position of the people of the Sunnah and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em> and this is what the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> directed us to. As for our saying, leave the people and let everyone have his own opinion and the differing of the nation is a mercy as they say then we say <em>haathaa baatil </em>(this is false and futile). Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَلَا يَزَالُونَ مُخْتَلِفِينَ</strong><br />
<strong>إِلَّا مَن رَّحِمَ رَبُّكَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they will continue to disagree except for those who your Lord has mercy upon.</span> </strong>(Soorah Hood (11), <em>aayah </em>118-119)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying, <strong>“Except for those who your Lord has mercy upon,” </strong>indicates that those whom Allaah has mercy upon do not differ and that differing is a punishment (<em>a<u>th</u>aab)</em> and is not a mercy (a <em>ra<u>h</u>mah)</em>. Mercy is for those who do not differ and if they do differ then they refer back to the Book and the Sunnah and they take what is correct and they leave what is wrong. This is the way of <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for each one remaining upon his own opinion and what so and so said and so and so then this is not the way of the Muslims. This is the way of the <em>Ahlul-Ahwaa</em> (innovated sects) and the People of <em>Shahawaat</em> (followers of desires). They search for whatever saying will conform to their desires and whatever will conform to what they want and whatever differs with their desires, they abandon it even if the Imaam whom they say that they take his saying says it. Meaning, they do not accept from the sayings of the Imaams and the scholars except what is in accordance with their desires. As for what contradicts their desires then they reject it. So, this is a proof that they are just following their own desires, whatever conforms with their desires they accept it and whatever is contrary to their desires they abandon it. <em>Wa laa <u>h</u>awla wa laa quwatta illaa billaah</em> (and there is no movement and no ability except with the aid of Allaah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is what is called to nowadays in the newspapers and magazines and meetings and conferences mostly and upon the channels. They promote disagreement and they say we are just making things open and easy for the people. With what are we making things open and easy for the people? With abandonment of the Book and the Sunnah and with going along with sayings whose people are not secure from error; those who make errors sometimes and are correct sometimes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whereas they; meaning the Imaams of the past, they forbade us from taking their sayings except what accords with the proof. They forbade us from taking their sayings, which are in contrary to the proof. So, this is a matter, which it is obligatory to be aware of because the people today have been put to trial on account of those people who confuse things for the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So his saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And you should know that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said, my nation will split into 73 sects, all of them will be in the Fire except one,” </strong></span>This <u>h</u>adeeth is authentic, when its chains of narration are gathered and its many narrations and the Imaams reported in their works and speak in praise of it and actual circumstances testify to its truth. So he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed that this nation of Muhammad will split into 73 sects and these are the major fundamental sects and there are actually more than these sects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said all of them will be in the Fire, meaning the 72, all of them will be in the Fire except for one and it is the 73<sup>rd</sup> one, which is that which is upon the like of what the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his companions were upon. So it is what will be saved from the Fire. And therefore, they are called <strong><em>al-Firqatun Naajiyah</em></strong> (the saved sect) and they are called <strong><em>Ahl-us-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em></strong> (the People of the Sunnah and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>); the united body upon the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whatever is beside them then they are opposers to the truth under the threat of the Hellfire. So from them will be those who enter the Fire on account of disbelief (<em>kufr)</em> and from them will be those who enter the Fire on account of <em>fisq</em> (evil doing) and from them will be those who enter the Fire on account of <em>ma`<u>s</u>iyyah</em> (sin, disobedience). They are not all the same with regard to entering the Fire. So it is not to be taken from this <u>h</u>adeeth that these sects, all of them are disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“</span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And it is the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>; the united body,”</span> </strong><em>Al-Jamaa`ah</em> (united body) is whoever is upon the truth even if it is a single person. This is the <em>Jamaa`ah</em> (the united body). As for <em>Al-Kathrah</em> (being numerous on its own); a group being numerous then this on its own does not indicate the truth. He, the Most High said:</p>
<p><strong>وَإِن تُطِعْ أَكْثَرَ مَن فِي الْأَرْضِ يُضِلُّوكَ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And if you were to obey most of those upon the earth, they will lead you astray from the path of Allaah.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-An`aam (6), <em>aayah </em>116)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا أَكْثَرُ النَّاسِ وَلَوْ حَرَصْتَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And most of mankind even if you eagerly wish will not be believers.</span> </strong>(Soorah Yoosuf (12), <em>aayah </em>103)</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا وَجَدْنَا لِأَكْثَرِهِم مِّنْ عَهْدٍ ۖ وَإِن وَجَدْنَا أَكْثَرَهُمْ لَفَاسِقِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We have not found most of them to be true to their covenant, We have found most of them to be disobedient ones. </strong></span>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>102)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So being numerous is not what is counted. What is counted is those who are upon the truth even if they are few in number, even if it is a single person then he will be the <em>Jamaa`ah</em> (the body upon the truth).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“<strong>It was said, “Who are they O Messenger of Allaah? He said, “That which is upon that which I and my companions are upon today.” </strong></span>This is the correct path, those who are upon that which the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his companions were upon, they are the <em>Jamaa</em>`<em>ah</em> (the united body upon the truth).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari said:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I entered Makkah and I saw the gathering of Hamid Faqeeh. I saw that he was strong in Salafi Tawheed, so I sat there until the Adhan of Isha. Then when I was alone with him I asked him: ‘<strong>O Shaykh how did you learn Tawheed?</strong>’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: your question is excellent.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he narrated the famous story to me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari also said:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I met with Shaykh Hamid Faqeeh once and I said to him: Salafiyoon are a rarity in Egypt, and you are a Salafi, so how did Salafeeyah come to you?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘I had graduated from the university of Cairo or Azhar, and while I was travelling back to my village carrying my university certificate I passed by a farm and I saw an old Shaykh sitting there and I gave him Salam, so he said to me what is that in your hands?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: ‘A graduation certificate.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Next to the Shaykh was the book ‘Kitab al-Tawheed’ with its explanation of ‘Fath al-Majeed’ the Shaykh stood up and walked off to take care of something and he was away for sometime. I picked up the book to read, then later on the Shaykh returned, I asked him about this book, and I told him that I was amazed by it. He began explaining the ‘Aqeedah of the Salaf to me. He said: ‘O my son it is upon you to spread Tawheed and the ‘Aqeedah of the Salaf, because indeed you did not learn that in the university from where you graduated.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from then on I began calling to the ‘Aqeedah of the Salaf, and this Shaykh was a farmer in that farm.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Imam Allaama Shaykh Rabee bin Hadi al-Madkhali -hafidhullaah- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;We advise the Salafis to have harmony/solidarity and to adhere to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To have brotherhood upon what is contained in the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam of Aqeedah, worship and actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having brotherhood for the sake of Allaah Azza wa Jal and to have Eemaan in these principles and these foundations and to love each other for the sake of Allaah Azza wa Jal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">If a person makes a mistake whether it is a minor one or a major one, advice is given with wisdom and good admonition.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There are people who make a claim of Salafeeyah, they are hard and forceful with falsehood, with slander and oppression. They are harsh and hard when being harsh is not required and they have no wisdom whatsoever, nor mercy or any of these things!</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">With sadness some people accuse the established Salafis with this exaggeration! This is extreme oppression.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I swear by Allaah we wage war against this harshness, the harshness of the Khawarij, we criticize these people who are extreme and delve too deeply and also the harsh ones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We criticize those who water-down, belittle and wage war against the principles of Islaam who originate, derive and produce false, unintelligent principles and statements to protect the people of Bida.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We criticize this extremist and we call to the straight path and to that what the Salaf as-Salih were upon of beliefs, actions and manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are extremists in watering-down, belittling and warring against the principles of Islam and the others are extremists in declaring people innovators and making Takfeer of people, so both of these types deviate from the straight path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allaah ordered us to have moderation and justice and to be steadfast upon the straight path.&#8217;</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Advice to the Salafiyyoon</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brothers, use <strong>beneficial knowledge</strong> and <strong>solid proof</strong> and <strong>beneficial wisdom</strong> in your <em>Dawa’</em>. You should have all the noble and <strong>beautiful manners</strong> encouraged by the Book and the Messenger of guidance; indeed they are causes for victory and causes for success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You have to believe that the Companions did not spread Islaam or enter it into the hearts except with their <strong>wisdom</strong> and their <strong>knowledge</strong> more so than with their swords.  However, whoever enters into Islaam under the sword might not be firm, but whoever enters Islaam by way of knowledge, proof and evidence then this is what makes his Eemaan firm by Allaah’s permission and His assistance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is upon you to have these good methods and also to be serious about knowledge.  You have to be serious about <em>Dawa’</em> to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now – O brothers – I advise you with two issues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: Brotherhood between all of <em>Ahl -ul-Sunnah</em>; So O you Salafees, disseminate the soul of love and brotherhood between yourselves.  Put into effect what the Messenger of Allaah <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> informed us of regarding the believers: ‘Like a building, some of its parts supporting others.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that they are: ‘<strong>Like a single body if one limb complains then the rest of the body suffers with fever and insomnia</strong>.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is how you should be O brothers: distance yourselves from the causes of splitting, I swear by Allaah indeed it is a dangerous evil and a disastrous disease.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: distance yourselves from the causes which lead to enmity, hatred, splitting up and dissension.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Keep away from these things; because this has become predominant nowadays at the hands of people, about whom only Allaah knows their condition and intent.  It has become predominant and has torn apart the youth in this country – whether in the university or other than it – or in the other parts of the <em>Duniya</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why?! Because those who are not from its people – neither in knowledge nor in understanding – entered into the arena of giving <em>Dawa’</em> to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is possible that the enemies could have entered someone into the midst of the<em>Salafeeyeen</em> to tear them apart and split them up, and this issue is not unlikely, rather it can truly happen <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Strive to have brotherhood.  If any dissension has occurred between you, then both parties should make themselves forget what is past and start with a clean slate now.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say to the brothers: whoever falls short it is not allowed to debase him, nor destroy the one who is deficient.  Whoever makes a mistake amongst us we do not destroy him. <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em> – but we cure him with gentleness, wisdom and face him with love and friendship and all the rest of the righteous manners, along with the correct <em>Dawa’</em> until he repents.  And if there remains a weakness in him then we are not hasty with him, or otherwise, I swear by Allaah no one will remain, no one will remain!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are some people now who chase after the Salafis so much so that they reached the scholars and called them those who water things down <em>(Mumaya’een)</em>!! There is hardly any scholar in the arena of <em>Dawa’</em> today except that he has been falsely attacked with this claim about him!  Of course this is the way of the Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen and the way of <em>Ahl-ul-Bida’</em> since, from the weapons of the <em>Ahl ul-Bid</em>a’ is that they begin by overthrowing the scholars, rather it is the Jewish Masonic way: that if you wanted to discredit an idea, then discredit their scholars or their personalities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So keep away from this rotten legacy and have respect for the scholars.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>The following is posted from : <strong><a title="Magnificent Points of Advice for those who have turned to the Way of the Salaf – Ahmad Ash-Shihhee" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2014/10/01/magnificent-points-of-advice-for-those-who-have-turned-to-the-way-of-the-salaf-ahmad-ash-shihhee/">Magnificent Points of Advice for those who have turned to the Way of the Salaf </a></strong>– Abu ‘Abdillaah Ahmad bin Muhammad Ash-Shihhee. This book was read to Allaamaah Rabee’ al-Madkhalee who gave some good instructions regarding it.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The First Advice: Praise and Thank Allaah for Granting you this Blessing</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is since it is indeed a tremendous blessing, which Allaah bestows on whom He wills from His servants. So act well in showing thanks for it and in using it. And remember:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How many people are there that are submerged in misconceptions? One misconception drives him to the east while another drives him to the west – he doesn’t know how to free himself from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And how many people are there that are immersed in vain desires, being imprisoned by them and not knowing when he will be set free?</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So give thanks to Allaah, O repentant one, and know that this blessing comes from Allaah alone. You had no will or might in the matter, except due to Allaah, the Most Kind, the All Aware.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was the One who was kind to you and guided you and did not cause you to die while you were immersed in misconceptions and vain desires. So to Him belongs the Praise in this world and in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He was the One who directed you and facilitated for you the way to those who directed you towards the methodology of the Salaf as-Saalih. So how numerous are the blessings He has bestowed upon you and me. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“And if you were to count the blessings of Allaah, you would never be able to account for all of them.”</span></strong> [Surah Ibraaheem: 34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So beware, beware, O my brother who has repented, of falling into self-amazement and self-delusion, or of considering yourself above Allaah’s blessing. Allaah says:<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> “You were the same before, until Allaah bestowed His blessing on you.”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 94]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And beware, beware of ridiculing or mocking others, such as those who are afflicted with that which Allaah freed you from. Instead, praise Allaah that He saved you and did not test you with what He is testing them. And when you see one of these people who are afflicted (with misconceptions and vain desires) say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“All praise be to Allaah who saved me from what you are being afflicted by and who blessed me over many of those whom He created.”</span></strong> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Show compassion for them and be merciful to them. And present to them what Allaah has given you from good and guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And know, may Allaah grant you success, that you must follow the means that will ensure the correctness of your repentance with seriousness, eagerness, honesty and sincerity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808080;">[4] Reported by At-Tirmidhee in his Jaami&#8217; from the narration of Abu Hurairah, radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu. In its chain of narration is found ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Umar al-&#8216;Umaree, who is weak. However, the hadeeth has supporting witnesses (from other narrations), which strengthen it to the grade of “hasan, due to other narrations.</span></em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><em>[You may want to read <a title="Most Distinguished Qualities of the Saved Group – Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2015/01/09/most-distinguished-qualities-of-the-saved-group-shaykh-ibn-uthaymeen/"><strong>Most Distinguished Qualities of the Saved Group – Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen</strong></a> before reading the below]</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 55</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Is there something you want to add concerning the qualities of the saved sect?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong> The truth of the matter is that there isn’t anything to add, since the four fundamental matters that we have mentioned are clear and sufficient. However, it might need some details with respect to the matter of manners. So, the most important aspect of manners is unity and agreement on the truth, the thing that Allaah (Azza wa Jal) has enjoined on us:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Your Rabb (Allaah) prescribed for Noah, and that which We revealed to you –[O Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)], and that which He prescribed for Ibraaheem, Moosaa, ‘Eesaa–that you should establish the Religion, acting upon what is prescribed, and not split into sects regarding it.</em></span> [Qur’aan, soorat ash-Shooraa (42): 13].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (Allaah Azza wa Jal) informed us that those who split their Religion into sects, Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is clear of them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, those who divided their religion and break up into sects, you Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) have no concern of them in the least.</span></em> [Qur’aan, soorat al-An’aam (6): 159].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So agreement and unity of the hearts are from the most distinguished qualities of the saved group, ahlus-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah. In case disagreement amongst them occurs due to Ijtihaad,[74] in matters where Ijtihaad is applicable, then they do not hold enmity, hatred or hostility against each other. Rather, they believe that they are brothers even if this kind of disagreement takes place amongst them. This is true to the extent that each of them would pray behind the Imaam believing that the latter is not in a state of Wudoo´ whilst the Imaam believes he does have his Wudoo’. An example for this is that each of them would pray behind someone who ate camel meat believing that it nullifies the prayer whilst this Imaam believes that it does not. Thus each of them consider that the prayer behind this Imaam is correct, even though if he would have prayed the same prayer [after eating camel meat] by himself, he would have consider it incorrect. All of this is because they consider that the difference in opinion arising from Ijtihaad, in cases where Ijtihaad is permissible, is, in reality, not a disagreement. Since each one of the disputants follows what is incumbent upon both for them to follow from the evidence that is impermissible for either one to relinquish. They see that if their brother disagrees with them regarding a certain action and does this in compliance with the evidence, then in reality he is in agreement with them. This is because they themselves call for the following of the proof wherever it may be. So if he disagrees with them based upon his conformance with what he regards as valid proof, then in reality he is in agreement with them, since he is in conformity with that which they call for and aim to, from judging by the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is well known to many scholars what took place between the companions with regard to similar matters of disagreement, even during the time of their Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم). He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not harshly denounce anyone of them. When he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) returned from the battle of al-Ahzaab, Jibreel came to him and directed him to set out for Banee Quraydhah who broke the covenant with the Muslims. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) then ordered his companions and said: “None of you should pray ‘Asr except at Banee Quraydhah.” [75] So, they left Madeenah for Banee Qurayadhah, and when the time for ‘Asr prayer arrived some of them delayed their prayer until they reached Banee Qurayadhah and therefore prayed it outside of its time. They did not pray until after sun set, since the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: “None of you should pray ‘Asr except at Banee Quraydhah.” Others prayed on time and said that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) intention was for them to make haste in setting off. [76]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those were the ones who were correct in their understanding. In spite of this, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not blame anyone of them, and none of them held any enmity or hatred against each other because of their disagreement in understanding this text. That is why I believe that it is a binding duty upon the Muslims who belong to the Sunnah that they should be one nation, and that factionalism should not occur amongst them–a person belongs to this group and another belongs to another group, and the third belongs to a third group and so on. In such a manner, they fight amongst each other with the spears of their tongues. They hate each other and take enemies out of each other because of a disagreement whose ruling is permissible to deduce by way of Ijtihaad. There is no need for me to specifically mention each group. But the sensible person would understand and the matter would be clear to him. So, I believe that it is incumbent upon ahlus-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah to unite even though they may dispute in that wherein they have been differing as a result of their understanding of what is necessitated by the texts. All praise is due to Allaah, for this is a matter in which there is ample scope for accommodation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is important is agreement and unity of the hearts. And there is no doubt that the enemies of Islaam love that the Muslims are divided, regardless whether they are enemies who openly express their hostility, or enemies who pretend to be friends of Muslims or Islaam, while in reality they are not. So, the obligatory thing is that we should be distinguished with this distinctive mark and that is we are from the saved sect that agrees to unity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Characteristics of the Saved Group</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 53: <span style="color:#993300;">What is the most distinguished qualities of the saved group?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong> The most distinguishing quality of the saved group is the adherence to that upon which the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was upon in matters of ‘<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Aqeedah (creed), ‘Ibaadah (worship), manners, and transactions</strong></span>. You find the saved group distinguished in these four matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With respect to ‘Aqeedah, you find it holding on to that which is proven by the Qur’aan and Sunnah from pure <strong>Tawheed</strong> pertaining to the <em><strong>Ruboobiyyah</strong></em>, <em><strong>Uloohiyyah</strong></em>, and <em><strong>al-Asmaa’ was-Sifaat</strong></em> (Names and Attributes).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding worship, you find it distinguished in its perfect adherence to that which the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was upon in matters of worship and in its execution of them– as regard their types, manners, timing, places, and causes. So you don’t find them innovating in the Religion of Allaah. Rather, they are in an utmost degree of good manners with Allaah and His Messenger. They do not introduce any kind of worship, which Allaah did not approve, in advance, before Allaah and His Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You also find them distinguished from others in their <strong>good manners</strong>, love of good to the Muslims, openness of their hearts, cheerful faces, eloquence, and so forth, from the noble and beautiful aspects of manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And with regards to <strong>transactions</strong>, you find them treating others with truthfulness and clarity, and which the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) alluded to in his saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“The seller and the buyer have the right to keep or return goods as long as they have not parted or till they part; and if both spoke the truth and described the defects and qualities (of the goods), then they will be blessed in their transaction, and if they told lies or hid something, then the blessings of their transaction would be lost.”</span> </em>[73]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this is the distinction and the distinguishing mark for ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, the saved group, which follows that which the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 54</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Is it necessary that the characteristics in the four matters: ‘Aqeedah, worship, manners and transaction be totally or completely present without diminution? And in case anything of it is gets diminished, does this take the person out of the folds of the saved group or it doesn&#8217;t ?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong> Diminution in these matters does not disqualify the person as being from the saved group unless he fails to fulfill the aspect of Tawheed or that of Bida’. The matter is just as Allaah, The Most High, Said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And for all there will be degrees (or ranks) according to what they did&#8221;</span></em><br />
[Qur’aan, soorat al-An’aam (6): 132].</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Failing to fulfill the part of Tawheed and that of Bida’, may take the person out of the saved sect. Similarly, with respect to Ikhlaas (pure intention). However, as far as the matters of manners and transactions, then failing to fulfill them does not take the person out of this saved sect, though he is sinful for this.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center">By the  <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Why the ascription of Salafeeyah? Is it a call to <em>Hizbeeyah</em>?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani (d.1420A.H) <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Why the ascription of Salafeeyah? Is it a call to <em>Hizbeeyah</em>, or a sect, or <em>Madhab</em>, or is it a new group in Islaam?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed the word ‘<em>as-Salaf</em>’ is well known in the Arabic language, and in the <em>Sharia’</em>, and what is important to us here is the research from the <em>Sharia’</em> point of view.  It has been authentically reported from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> that he said to Sayyidah Fatima <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> during the illness from which he died:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">فاتقي الله واصبري، ونعم السلف أنا لك</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Fear Allaah and be patient, for indeed I am a blessed <em>Salaf</em> (Predecessor) for you.[1]’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars used this word ‘<em>as-Salaf</em>’ a lot, and it has been used so much more than can be enumerated, it is sufficient for us to use one example, and that is what we need to fight against <em>Bida’</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">كل خير في اتباع من سلف** وكل شر في ابتداع من خلف</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Every good is in the following of the Salaf * and every evil is in the innovations of the Khalaf</strong><strong>[2]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, there are those who claim to have knowledge who reject this ascription, claiming that it does not have any foundation, so they say: it is not allowed for a Muslim to say I am a Salafi.  Its as if they say: it is not allowed for a Muslim to say: I follow the Salaf as-Salih of what they are upon from ‘<em>Aqeedah</em>, worship and manners!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that this type of rejection – if this is what they mean – necessitates being free from the correct Islaam which our Salaf as-Salih were upon, and at the head of them is the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>as is indicated in the <em>Mutawatir</em>hadeeth which is in Bukhari, Muslim and in other books, from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">خير الناس قرني، ثم الذين يلونهم ، ثم الذين يلونهم</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The best people are my generation then those who will come after them and then those after them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore it is not allowed for the Muslim to free himself from the ascription to the Salaf as-Salih, whereas if a Muslim freed himself from any other ascription, then it would not be possible for anyone from the people of knowledge to ascribe them to <em>Kufr</em>(disbelief) or <em>Fasooq</em> (openly sinning).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this person who rejects this ascription, don’t you see that he himself ascribes to a<em>Madhab</em> from the <em>Madhahib</em> (plural: <em>Madhab</em>)?! Whether this <em>Madhab</em> was connected to ‘<em>Aqeedah</em> or with <em>Fiqh</em>?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he is either an <em>Ashari</em> or a <em>Matroodi</em>, or either he is from the <em>Ahl-ul-Hadeeth</em>, or<em>Hanafi</em>, or <em>Shafia’i</em>, or <em>Maliki</em>, or <em>Hanbali</em> from those who enter into the title of <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal Jammah</em>. Even though he who ascribes to the <em>Ashari</em> <em>Madhab</em> or to the four<em>Madhahib</em> then he ascribes to people who are without doubt not infallible, even though there from those scholars who are correct, I wish he had only rejected the likes of these ascriptions to individuals not infallible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who ascribes to the Salaf as-Salih, then he ascribes to that which is in general infallible, and indeed the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> mentioned that from the signs of the <em>Firqat an-Najeeha</em> (the saved sect) that they adhere to that which the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> was upon and what the Companions were upon, so who ever adhered to it is with certainty upon guidance from his Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Without doubt the clear, manifest, distinguished, evident evidence of this title is to say: I am a Muslim upon the Book and the Sunnah and upon the methodology of our Salaf as-Salih, and that is to summarize it by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">أنا سلفي</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">I am a Salafi.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From ‘al-Asaalah’ Magazine No. 9 p. 86-87, &amp; an-Nabthaa al-Waafi fee wajoob al-Intessab ila Salafeeyah p.26-29]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">Compiled by Zakareeyah bin Ghulam Qadir</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by    Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Allaah Ta’ala gave proofs in His Noble Book concerning the excellence of the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em>, and following their way, Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;And the first to embrace Islaam of the <em>Muhajirun</em> and the <em>Ansar</em> and also those who followed them exactly. Allaah is well pleased with them, as they are well pleased with Him. He has prepared for them Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise), to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme success.&gt;&gt;   [Tawbah: 100]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn Mas’ood that the Prophet  said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The best people are my generation then those who will come after them and then those after them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari &amp; Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the Companions are the example and they are the ones to follow. It is obligatory upon every Muslim to follow them in what they understood from the evidences of the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, because they were the most knowledgeable of the people and they had the most correct understanding of the <em>Sharia’</em> texts out of all the people.  Consequently, if a Muslim takes other than their understanding then he will deviate away from the straight path, since the Companions stood with insight, and they viewed everything with their perceptive knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abu Zayed al-Qayrawani said in his book ‘al-Jaama’ (117):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Submission to the <em>Sunnan</em> (plural of <em>Sunnah</em>) cannot be opposed with opinion, nor is it repelled with <em>Qiyas</em> (analogy).  As for the interpretation of the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em> then that is how we interpret, and what they acted upon is which we act upon, what they left off is what we leave.  It is sufficient to adhere to what they adhered to, and that we follow them in that what they clarified.  We take them as an example in what they extracted and viewed from the hadeeth. We do not rebel against the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em> in what they differed or what they interpreted, and everything that we have just mentioned is the stance of the <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah</em> and the Imams of the people in <em>Fiqh</em> and hadeeth.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Sama’ani said in ‘Sown al-Mantiq’ (158):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed we have been ordered to follow and been encouraged to do so.  And we have been prohibited from innovating and we have been rebuked concerning <em>Bida’</em>. The flag/sign of the <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah</em> is their following the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em>, and them leaving everything that is innovated and heresy.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The supporter of the <em>Sunnah</em> al-Asbhaani said in his book ‘al-Hujjah Fee Bayaan al-Muhajjah’ (2/437-440):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Knowledge is not having lots of narrations; rather it is following and using those narrations. It is to take the Companions and the <em>Ta’abieen</em> (the Successors of the Companions) as exemplary, even if it means having a little knowledge.  Whoever opposes the Companions and the <em>Ta’abieen</em> then he is misguided, even if he has a lot of knowledge.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Asbhaani continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And that is to clarify for the people the matter of their <em>Deen</em>, so it is upon us to follow the Companions because indeed the <em>Deen</em> came from Allaah Ta’ala and it did not come from the intellects and opinions of men, but rather the Messenger  clarified the <em>Sunnah</em>for his <em>Ummah</em>. And he explained it to his Companions.  Therefore, whoever opposed the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah  in anything from the <em>Deen</em> then he has become misguided.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Rajab said in the book ‘Fadl Ilm as-Salaf ‘ala Ilm al-Khalaf’ (72):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The beneficial knowledge from these sciences, are all precisely connected to the texts with the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, the understanding of the meaning of these sciences and their restrictions are with what has been narrated from the Companions and the Successors and those who followed them, regarding the meanings of the Qur’aan and the hadeeth.  Likewise, what has been mentioned from them of what they said regarding issues of <em>Halaal</em> and <em>Haraam</em>, as well as <em>Zuhd</em>, softening of the heart and knowledge and other issues.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymeeyah said in ‘Kitab al-Eemaan’ (p.114):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘To understand this principle of <em>al-Eemaan</em> the Murjia’ turned away from the explanation of the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, and the statements of the Companions, and the Successors who followed them in goodness. The Murjia’ relied upon their own opinions and they interpreted this principle with their own understanding of Arabic language.  This is the way of the people of <em>Bida’</em>. This is why Imam Ahmad said: ‘The people mainly make mistakes regarding interpretation and analogy.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why we find the Mu’tazilah[1], Murjia’[2], Rafidah[3] and other than them from the <em>Ahl-ul-Bida’</em> explain the Qur’aan with their own intellect, as well as what they interpreted with Arabic language.  This is why you find them not relying upon the Ahadeeth of the Prophet , the Companions, and the <em>Ta’abieen</em> and the Imams of the Muslims.  So the <em>Ahl-ul-Bida’</em> do not rely upon the Sunnah, or upon the consensus of the <em>Salaf</em> or their <em>Aathaar</em>, rather they rely upon the intellect and language, and we find that they do not rely upon the books of <em>Tafseer</em> based upon narrations, and upon hadeeth and <em>Aathaar</em> of the <em>Salaf</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Ibn Taymeeyah also said in ‘Majmoo Fatawa’ (10/362):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘So knowledge which has been legislated and the rituals of worship which have been legislated are taken from the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah , as for what came from those after them, then it is not befitting that we take that as a foundation even though they are excused for their mistakes, rather they will be rewarded for their<em>Ijtihad</em> (exertion in deriving a ruling) or due to <em>Taqleed</em> (blind acceptance).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, whoever establishes speech regarding the science of <em>Usool</em> (principles) and its branches upon the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em> and the <em>Athaar</em> narrated from the previous generations then he has achieved the Prophetic way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, whoever establishes his purpose, worship, good deeds and an understanding connected to the principles of righteous actions and its branches of circumstances of the heart and physical actions upon <em>al-Eeman</em> and the <em>Sunnah</em> and the guidance, which Muhammad  and his Companions were upon, then he has achieved the Prophetic way. And this is the way of the Imams of guidance; you find that Imam Ahmad would say when the principles of the Sunnah were mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The principles of the Sunnah are adhering to what the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah  were upon and the books of <em>Tafseer</em> which have narrations from the Prophet  and the Companions and the successors. This is what is relied upon in its knowledge based principles and its branches………………..’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, regarding <em>Zuhd</em>, <em>Raqaaiq</em> (softening of the heart) and matters of the heart since its knowledge is relied upon the book of <em>Zuhd</em> which has narrations about the Prophets <em>-salawaatAllaah alaihim-</em> from Adam to Muhammad, then upon the way of the Companions and successors and those after them were not mentioned.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">By  Dr. Muhammad Deeya ar-Rahman al-Azamee</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> Translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam said: ‘We do not mean to limit <em>Ahl-ul-Hadeeth</em> just to those who convey hadeeth, write them or narrate them but we mean by them: everyone who rightfully memorises the hadeeth, knowing them and understanding their apparent and hidden meanings and following them in what is apparent and hidden, and also the people of al-Qur’aan.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The least of their traits is: love of the Qur’aan and hadeeth, researching them, seeking their meanings and practising that which they know is binding upon them.  The <em>Fuqaha</em> of hadeeth are better informed about the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> than <em>Fuqaha</em> other than them.’[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He mentions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<em>Ahl-ul-Hadeeth</em> are those about whom the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘What I am upon and my Companions.’  And in another narration: ‘It is the <em>Jamaah</em>, The Hand of Allaah is over the <em>Jamaah</em>.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Ahl-ul-Hadeeth</em> are the best people of the <em>Duniya</em>, as Hafs bin Ghayaath said.[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shafi’ee said: ‘If I see a companion of Hadeeth then it is as if I see a man from the Companions of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> he is of that status.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘May Allaah reward them with goodness on our behalf, they preserved the foundation for us so they have an excellence over us.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Alee bin al-Madini said: ‘There are no people better than the companions of Hadeeth.  The rest of the people were in search of the <em>Duniya</em> while they were establishing the <em>Deen</em>.’[5] i.e. the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hafidh Ibn Rajab said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<em>Ahl-ul-Hadeeth</em> are an authority in knowing hadeeth and knowing the authentic from the weak hadeeth.’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> supplicated for illumination of the one who busies himself with the knowledge of hadeeth, memorizing it, conveying it and understanding it.  He <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘May Allaah illuminate the person who hears a hadeeth from me and memorizes it until he conveys it.  Perhaps a person who carries <em>Fiqh</em>conveys it to someone with more <em>Fiqh</em> than that person and perhaps the carrier of this <em>Fiqh</em> is not a <em>Faqihi</em>.’[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hafidh Abu Bakr Ahmad bin ‘Alee al-Khateeb al-Bagdadispecifically authored a book which he called ‘Sharf Ashaabul-hadeeth’ (the nobility of the companions of hadeeth).  In it mentions Ahadeeth and <em>Athaar</em> from the Companions, <em>Ta’bieen</em>, kings,ministers and others from those who followed them about the excellence of knowledge of hadeeth, being busy with it and the nobility of its people over those of <em>Ahl-ul-Bida’</em> and those of misguidance from the <em>Zinaadiqa</em> (heretics) who concerned themselves with the knowledge of rhetoric and philosophy.  This book is a masterpiece in this subject.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Imaam Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translated transcription of a lecture delivered by Imaam Al-Albaanee (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) that was recorded and distributed under the title <b><i>“Hadhihi Da’watunaa”</i></b><i></i> (This is Our Call). The present translation was translated directly from the Arabic audio.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this lecture, Imaam Al-Albaanee explains the basis of the Salafee Manhaj, which is following the way, understanding and practical application of the Salaf, who were namely the first three generations of Muslims: The Sahaabah, Taabi’een and Atbaa’ at-Taabi’een. They are the ones referred to in the Prophet’s saying: <b>“The best of mankind is my generation, then those that come after them, then those that come after them.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the basis that distinguishes the true call to Islaam from all other false and erroneous calls, regardless if they claim to be “upon the Qur’aan and the Sunnah.” Al-Albaanee goes into depth discussing this fact, that one cannot truly understand and apply the Qur’aan and Sunnah unless he follows the understanding and application of the Salaf. We ask Allaah to accept this effort and benefit the Muslims with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So here we have given the answer from the ayah and the two hadeeth, we just mentioned. Follow the way of the Believers! The way of those believers from present times? The answer is no, we mean the Believers from the past &#8211; the first era &#8211; the era of the Companions &#8211; the Salaf As-Saalih (pious predecessors). These are the people whom we should take as our example and as the ones whom we follow. And there is absolutely no one equal to them on the face of the earth. Therefore, the essence of our call is based on three pillars &#8211; on the (1) Qur&#8217;aan, the (2) Sunnah and (3) Following the Salaf As-Saalih (pious predecessors).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So everyone claims to follow the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah, and how often have we heard this kind of talk from the youth who are in confusion, when they say: ‘Ya akhee, these people claim to follow the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah and those people claim to follow the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah.’ So what is the clear and decisive distinction? It is the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah and the Methodology of the Salaf As-Saalih. So whoever follows the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah without following the Salaf As-Saalih, he in fact has not followed the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah, rather he has only followed his intellect, if not his desire.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“After making clear this important condition of &#8220;upon the methodology of the Salaf As-Saalih&#8221;, I must give you some examples. In the past, the Muslims split up into many sects. You hear about the Mu&#8217;tazilah, you hear about the Murji&#8217;ah, you hear about the Khawaarij, you hear about the Zaidiyyah, not to mention the Shi&#8217;a and the Raafidah and so on. There is no one amongst these groups, no matter how deep in misguidance they are, that does not share the same saying as the rest of the Muslims, which is that: &#8220;We are on the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah.&#8221; No one amongst them says: &#8220;We don’t follow the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah.&#8221; And if one of them were to say that, he would completely leave the fold of Islaam. So then why did they split up so long as all of them rely on the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah &#8211; and I bear witness that they do rely on the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah for support. But how is this relying done? It is done without relying on the third foundation, which is what the Salaf As-Saalih were upon.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Al-Haafidh Ibn Rajab Al-Hanbalee<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This book is a translation of a short treatise entitled “<i>Kashf-ul-Kurbah fee wasfi Haali Ahlil-Ghurbah</i>”<b>[Alleviating Grievances in Describing the Condition of the Strangers]</b> written by the great Imaam, Al-Haafidh Zayn-ud-Deen Ibn Rajab Al-Hanbalee, may Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this treatise, Ibn Rajab discusses the topic of the “Strangers”, listing the many <i>ahaadeeth</i> of the Prophet reported about them. They are given this name because they will be strange during the Last Days, due to their adherence to the Sunnah and to the Way of the first Muslims, the Salaf As-Saalih. So just as those who first accepted Islaam at the hands of Muhammad were considered strangers to their families and close ones, then indeed, those who adhere to the Sunnah in the last Days, when innovations and misguidance are rampant and widespread, will also be considered strangers to their families and close ones, not to mention the disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It must be noted that Ibn Rajab uses several weak ahaadeeth in this treatise, which have been pointed out. Also, towards the end of his treatise, he begins to divert from the topic by going deep into the issue of inner strangeness, sometimes focusing on aspects that have no basis in Islaam, such as talk about <i>wajd</i>, <i>khulwah</i> and so on. These were Sufi concepts that were prevalent during his time. Consequently, the last pages of the treatise, which included several quotes and lines of poetry, were left out from this translation. However, the omission of this last part of the book does not detract from the overall meaning and intended theme of the treatise, and Allaah knows best. For the most part, the treatise is of great importance and is often referenced by the scholars, and that is what we hope to convey to the readers. All footnotes were added by the translator based on research and the use of several sources. We ask Allaah to accept this work as a sincere act and that He place it in our scale of good deeds on the Day of Judgement. And we ask that He benefit all the Muslims generally with it</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b><br />
“So when the Prophet was sent forth and began calling to Islaam, his call was not answered at first instance except by a few from each tribe. And those that did accept his call feared from their tribes and families lest they should be subjected to extreme punishment. And they would suffer while being patient with that for the sake of Allaah. Due to their weakness, the (first) Muslims would be frightened by every opposing force and they would flee for the sake of their Religion to far-off lands as was shown when they migrated twice to the land of Abysinnia, and then when they migrated to Madeenah. And there was from among them, he who was tortured for the sake of Allaah and he who was killed. <b>So those who entered into the fold of Islaam, back in those days – they were the strangers. </b>Then Islaam spread after the Hijrah to Madeenah and its followers became victorious over every group. After that, the people entered into the Religion of Allaah in multitudes. And Allaah perfected the Religion for them and completed His favor upon them. Then the Messenger of Allaah died, and the Muslims were upon the utmost level due to their firm adherence to their Religion. They were powerful and dominant, and they continued to be upon this condition during the times (i.e. <i>khilaafah</i>) of Abu Bakr and ‘Umar. Then the Devil unleashed his evil plot upon the Muslims and discord fell between them. And the trials of <b>Doubts</b> (<i>Shubuhaat</i>) and <b>Desires</b>(<i>Shahawaat</i>) became widespread. These two evils did not stop increasing at all until the plan of the Devil was established and the majority of the creation obeyed him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Concerning the statement of the Prophet: <b>‘Islaam began as something strange and will return to being strange, as it began’</b>, Imaam Al-Awzaa’ee (rahimahullaah) said: ‘As for this, then it does not mean that Islaam will go away, rather it means that Ahlus-Sunnah will go away, up to the point that there will not remain any from them in a land except one person.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Based on this understanding, there can be found much praise in the statements of the Salaf for the Sunnah and their describing it as being strange, and describing its adherents and followers as being few. Al-Hasan Al-Basree (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) used to say to his companions: ‘Oh Ahlus-Sunnah! Be gentle with one another, and may Allaah have mercy on you, for indeed, you are from amongst the fewest of people.’ Yoonus bin ‘Ubayd (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said: ‘There is not a thing more strange than the Sunnah. But what is stranger than it, is the one who knows it.’ Sufyaan Ath-Thawree (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said: ‘Treat Ahlus-Sunnah kindly, for verily, they are strangers.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And from the words of Ahmad bin ‘Aasim Al-Andaakee, who was one of the biggest scholars at the time of Sulaymaan Ad-Daaraanee, was: ‘Indeed, I have reached from all the times, a time when Islaam has returned to being strange as it began. In it, the description of truth has returned to being strange as it began. If you were to turn to the scholar, you would find him being tested with the love of this worldly life and the love for honor and authority. And if you were to turn to the worshipper, you would find him ignorant in his worship, deceived and fallen victim to his enemy Iblees (i.e. the Devil). He has mounted to the highest levels of worship while being ignorant of how to perform them so how can he be at that level? And the rest of the people are from among the ignorant followers, simple-minded and quick to follow a way, as if he were a wolf looking to steal a sheep, or a hungry lion, or a fox on the prowl. This is the description of the people of your time from the carriers of knowledge and the Qur’aan and the callers of wisdom.’ This was the description of the people of his time. So how much has the situation increased and the crisis become greater after it. Indeed, it has reached a point that would have never been thought of nor imagined!”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Chapter One: The Meaning of the Word “Salaf”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Linguistic Meaning:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mandhoor said: “The words Salaf, Saleef and Salafah all refer to the unified group of the past.” [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abus-Sa’adaat Ibn-ul-Atheer said: “It is said that the Salaf amongst people are those who died previously, such as one’s forefathers and relatives. This is why the first generation, such as the Taabi’een, were called the Salaf as-Saalih (pious predecessors).” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abdul-Kareem As-Sam’aanee said: “The word ‘Salafee’ with an ‘a’ after the S and L and ending with an F is an ascription to the Salaf and an attribution to their beliefs.” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After quoting these words from As-Sam’aanee, Abul-Hasan Ibnul-Atheer Al-Jazree said: “A group of people were known by this ascription.” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Religious Meaning:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam As-Safaareenee said: “What is meant by the <i>madh-hab </i>(belief) of the Salaf is that which the Companions, may Allaah be pleased with them, adhered to, as well as the distinguished ones who followed them upon goodness, their successors and the Imaams of the Religion – those who received testimony as to their leadership, were known for their great status in the Religion and whose words are taken by the people after the Salaf, apart from those who are accused of innovation or renowned for unacceptable ascriptions such as the Khawaarij, Rawaafid, Qadariyyah, Murji’ah, Jabariyyah, Jahmiyyah, Mu’atazilah, Karaamiyyah and those similar to them.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Permanent Committee (for Research and Verdicts) was asked: “What is Salafiyyah, and what is your opinion concerning it?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they replied: “Salafiyyah is an ascription to the Salaf. The word ‘Salaf’ refers to the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) and the Imaams of guidance from the first three generations of whom the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) testified for as to their superiority when he said: <b>‘The best of mankind is my generation, then those who come after them, then those who come after them. Then there will come a people who will bear witness before taking an oath, and take an oath before bearing witness.’</b> [Reported by Imaam Ahmad in his Musnad, Al-Bukharee and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word Salafiyoon is the plural of Salafee, and it is an ascription to the Salaf. The meaning of the word Salaf has already been mentioned. Furthermore, it also refers to those who follow the methodology of the Salaf, which entails following the Book and the Sunnah, calling the people to them and acting upon them. So as a result of this, they become the adherents of the Sunnah and the unified body (Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah).” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our teacher, Muhammad Amaan bin ‘Alee Al-Jaamee, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “When we use the word ‘Salaf’ generally, from a religious standpoint, we mean by it: The Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) – i.e. those who were present during his lifetime and accepted the Religion from him directly…those who also fall under this term are the ones who followed them – those who inherited their knowledge before a long time had passed and those who fall under the testimony and praise of Allaah’s Messenger for them that they were the best of mankind, when he (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>‘The best of mankind is my generation, then those who come after them, then those who come after them.’ </b>This term (Salaf) also includes the successors of the Taabi’een.” [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our teacher, Saalih bin ‘Abdillaah Al-‘Abood, said: “What is intended by the term ‘Salafiyyah’ is: Following the way of the Pious Predecessors (Salaf as-Saalih) of this Muslim ummah, who are in fact Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah. This means uniting oneself and gathering others upon the following of the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>), in hidden and in open, and following the way of the first and foremost from the Muhaajireen and Ansaar, who followed them in goodness.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Bakr bin ‘Abdillaah Abu Zaid said: “If it is said: the Salaf or the Salafees or their efforts, Salafiyyah, then these are all ascriptions to the Salaf as-Saalih (righteous predecessors), which includes all of the Companions, may Allaah be pleased with them, as well as those who followed them in goodness, excluding those who were driven by vain desires. Those who remained firm upon the methodology of the prophets (after them) were ascribed to their righteous predecessors because of that. And so they were called: Salaf, Salafees, and their ascription would be: Salafee. So based on this, the term Salaf means the righteous predecessors. When used generally, this term means: Everyone that strives to follow the Companions, even if they are in our time, and so on. This is what the scholars all agree on. So it is an ascription, which can be traced back to the Book and the Sunnah, and it is an ascription that cannot be separated for even a moment from the first generation (i.e. Salaf), rather it was from them and returns to them. As for the one who opposed them by using a different name or ascription, then no (he is not from them), even if he lived amongst them and was their contemporary. This is why the Companions were free from the Qadariyyah and the Murji’ah.” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said: “Be a Salafee upon earnestness, following the way of the pious predecessors , as well as those after them, who followed their footsteps in all aspects of the Religion, such as Tawheed, acts of worship and so on…” [10]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Al-Fataawaa al-Jaliyyah ‘anil-Manaahij Ad-Da’wiyyah (pg. 56-57) compiled by Hasan Ibn Mahmood Ibn Mansoor ad-Daghreeri<br />
Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Salafee Manhaj</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. We worship Allaah by way of Tawheed. So we do not supplicate to anyone besides Allaah nor do we seek refuge in anyone besides Him in matters of bringing about good or repelling some harm. We perform worship by having hatred and enmity for the polytheists. However, we are obligated to call them to Tawheed first and clarify to them that there is no Islaam without Tawheed and that whoever calls unto other than Allaah has committed disbelief. So whoever persists after that, then at that point we are obligated to distance ourselves from him and hate him for the sake of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The Creed of the Salaf is established upon the principle that <b>&#8220;Allaah is described with what He has described himself with in His Book and upon the tongue of His Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>), without resorting to tahreef, tamtheel, tashbeeh, ta’teel or ta’weel.&#8221;</b> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. We affirm for Allaah the best of Names, which He has affirmed for Himself and which He has praised Himself with, whether they are mentioned in the Qur’aan or the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. We believe that there is no path towards achieving Allaah’s contentment, or a way towards Paradise, except through the Way of Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>). And whoever seeks a way towards gaining Allaah’s contentment through other than the Way of Allaah’s Messenger, then he has gone astray and been blinded from the truth. And he has lost in this world and the next.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. We believe that the Legislation of Allaah is what has been brought down through the two revelations: The Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>). This is what our Lord has indicated in his saying: <b>&#8220;Then we placed you on a Sharee&#8217;ah (Legislated System) based on Our Command, so follow it, and do not follow the desires of those who have no knowledge.&#8221;</b> [Surah Al-Jaathiyah: 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. We believe that the Qur’aan is the Speech of Allaah, which was revealed and not created, and that the Sunnah is what explains and clarifies it. The Qur’aan is interpreted by the Sunnah and by the interpretations of the Sahaabah (Companions) and those who followed them in goodness. So the interpretation of the Qur’aan is by way of the narration, meaning by way of the Sahaabah, the Taabi’een and the Ahaadeeth concerning it. And the books that contain these interpretations are the ones we are obligated to acquire and read, such as the Tafseer of Ibn Jareer, the Tafseer of Ibn Katheer, the Tafseer of Al-Baghawee, the Tafseer<i>&#8220;Ad-Durr Al-Manthoor&#8221;</i> of As-Suyootee and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. We are obligated to take the Sunnah according to the way of the Muhadditheen &#8211; in terms of their authenticity or weakness. So we take what is found to be authentic and leave off what is weak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. We worship Allaah by obeying the rulers, as long as they are Muslims who seek judgement through Allaah’s Legislation and who establish the prescribed punishments, and as long as they establish the prayer. Obeying them is an obligation even if they commit oppression. And whoever says something contrary to this and makes it permissible to revolt against the Muslim leader, even if he may be oppressive, then he is an innovator and a deviant. And it is obligatory on the Muslim scholars to refute this statement of his and to expose his deviance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. We hold that it is not permissible to spread the faults of the leaders, because doing this influences and brings about trials and afflictions (fitan), and causes them to spread.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. We are obligated to worship Allaah through the Sunnah, by following it and by loathing innovations and the innovators. This is based on the Prophet’s saying: <b>&#8220;Whoever does a deed, which is not in accordance to our affair (i.e. the Sunnah) is rejected.&#8221;</b> And in another narration: <b>&#8220;Whoever introduces into our affair (Sunnah) that which isn’t part of it is rejected.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a summary and some brief words on the Creed of the Salaf, which we are obligated to accept and follow if we truly want salvation and the truth. And we must renounce those opinions of men, which cannot be traced back to any source of evidence, since men are known by way of the truth and the truth is not known by way of men. Lastly, we must beg and implore Allaah to show us the truth as true and enable us to follow it, and to show us the falsehood as false and enable us to avoid it. Indeed Allaah is Responsible for that and Able to make it happen. And may the peace and blessings of Allaah be on Muhammad &#8211; the best, most dutiful, most pious and purest of creation &#8211; and on his family and his Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b class="Marker">Footnotes:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="Footnotes">[1] <b>Translator’s Note:</b> These are forbidden acts committed against Allaah’s Names and Attributes. Tahreef means to change or distort the wording of Allaah’s name or attribute. Tamtheel and tashbeeh means to give a like resemblance to a name or an attribute.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Tariq bin Shihab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Jew said to &#8216;Umar, &#8220;O Chief of the Believers, if this verse: &#8216;This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favors upon you, and have chosen for you, Islam as your religion.&#8217; (5.3) had been revealed upon us, we would have taken that day as an &#8216;Id (festival) day.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I know definitely on what day this Verse was revealed; it was revealed on the day of &#8216;Arafat, on a Friday.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 374:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">That he heard &#8216;Umar speaking while standing on the pulpit of the Prophet in the morning (following the death of the Prophet), when the people had sworn allegiance to Abu Bakr. He said the Tashah-hud before Abu Bakr, and said, &#8220;Amma Ba&#8217;du (then after) Allah has chosen for his Apostle what is with Him (Paradise) rather than what is with you (the world). This is that Book (Quran) with which Allah guided your Apostle, so stick to it, for then you will be guided on the right path as Allah guided His Apostle with it.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 375:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah Bin &#8216;Umar wrote to &#8216;Abdul Malik bin Marwan, swearing allegiance to him: &#8216;I swear allegiance to you in that I will listen and obey what is in accordance with the Laws of Allah and the Tradition of His Apostle as much as I can.&#8217;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 378:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said bin Al-Musaiyab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Huraira said that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;I have been sent with &#8216;Jawami-al-Kalim &#8216; (the shortest expression with the widest meaning) and have been made victorious with awe (cast in my enemy&#8217;s hearts), and while I was sleeping, I saw that the keys of the treasures of the world were placed in my hand.&#8221; Abu Huraira added: Allah&#8217;s Apostle has gone, and you people are utilizing those treasures, or digging those treasures out.&#8221; or said a similar sentence.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 379:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;There was no prophet among the prophets but was given miracles because of which people had security or had belief, but what I was given was the Divine Inspiration which Allah revealed to me. So I hope that my followers will be more than those of any other prophet on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 380:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Wail:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I sat with Shaiba in this Mosque (Al-Masjid-Al-Haram), and he said, &#8220;&#8216;Umar once sat beside me here as you are now sitting, and said, &#8216;I feel like distributing all the gold and silver that are in it (i.e., the Ka&#8217;ba) among the Muslims&#8217;. I said, &#8216;You cannot do that.&#8217; &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;Why?&#8217; I said, &#8216;Your two (previous) companions (the Prophet and Abu Bakr) did not do it. &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;They are the two persons whom one must follow.'&#8221; (See Hadith No. 664, Vol. 2)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 381:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hudhaifa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to us, &#8220;Honesty descended from the Heavens and settled in the roots of the hearts of men (faithful believers), and then the Quran was revealed and the people read the Quran, (and learnt it from it) and also learnt it from the Sunna.&#8221; Both Quran and Sunna strengthened their (the faithful believers&#8217;) honesty. (See Hadith No. 208)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 382:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The best talk (speech) is Allah&#8217;s Book &#8216;Quran), and the best way is the way of Muhammad, and the worst matters are the heresies (those new things which are introduced into the religion); and whatever you have been promised will surely come to pass, and you cannot escape (it).</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 383:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira and Zaid bin Khalid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were with the Prophet when he said (to two men), &#8220;I shall judge between you according to Allah&#8217;s Book (Laws).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 384:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;All my followers will enter Paradise except those who refuse.&#8221; They said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Who will refuse?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Whoever obeys me will enter Paradise, and whoever disobeys me is the one who refuses (to enter it).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 385:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some angels came to the Prophet while he was sleeping. Some of them said, &#8220;He is sleeping.&#8221; Others said, &#8220;His eyes are sleeping but his heart is awake.&#8221; Then they said, &#8220;There is an example for this companion of yours.&#8221; One of them said, &#8220;Then set forth an example for him.&#8221; Some of them said, &#8220;He is sleeping.&#8221; The others said, &#8220;His eyes are sleeping but his heart is awake.&#8221; Then they said, &#8220;His example is that of a man who has built a house and then offered therein a banquet and sent an inviter (messenger) to invite the people. So whoever accepted the invitation of the inviter, entered the house and ate of the banquet, and whoever did not accept the invitation of the inviter, did not enter the house, nor did he eat of the banquet.&#8221; Then the angels said, &#8220;Interpret this example to him so that he may understand it.&#8221; Some of them said, &#8220;He is sleeping.&#8221; The others said, &#8220;His eyes are sleeping but his heart is awake.&#8221; And then they said, &#8220;The houses stands for Paradise and the call maker is Muhammad; and whoever obeys Muhammad, obeys Allah; and whoever disobeys Muhammad, disobeys Allah. Muhammad separated the people (i.e., through his message, the good is distinguished from the bad, and the believers from the disbelievers).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 386:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hammam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hudhaifa said, &#8220;O the Group of Al-Qurra! Follow the straight path, for then you have taken a great lead (and will be the leaders), but if you divert right or left, then you will go astray far away.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 387:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;My example and the example of what I have been sent with is that of a man who came to some people and said, &#8216;O people! I have seen the enemy&#8217;s army with my own eyes, and I am the naked warner; so protect yourselves!&#8217; Then a group of his people obeyed him and fled at night proceeding stealthily till they were safe, while another group of them disbelieved him and stayed at their places till morning when the army came upon them, and killed and ruined them completely So this is the example of that person who obeys me and follows what I have brought (the Quran and the Sunna), and the example of the one who disobeys me and disbelieves the truth I have brought.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 388:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah&#8217;s Apostle died and Abu Bakr was elected as a Caliph after him, some of the Arabs reverted to disbelief, &#8216;Umar said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;How dare you fight the people while Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, I have been ordered to fight the people till they say &#8216;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah&#8217; And whoever says: None has the right to be worshipped but Allah.&#8217; waves his wealth and his life from me unless he deserves a legal punishment lusty, and his account will be with Allah! Abu Bakr said, &#8220;By Allah, I will fight him who discriminates between Zakat and prayers, for Zakat is the Compulsory right to be taken from the wealth By Allah, if they refuse to give me even a tying rope which they use to give to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, I would fight them for withholding it.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;By Allah, It was nothing, except I saw that Allah had opened the chest of Abu Bakr to the fight, and I came to know for certain that was the truth.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 389:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Uyaina bin Hisn bin Hudhaifa bin Badr came and stayed (at Medina) with his nephew Al-Hurr bin Qais bin Hisn who has one of those whom &#8216;Umar used to keep near him, as the Qurra&#8217; (learned men knowing Quran by heart) were the people of Umar&#8217;s meetings and his advisors whether they were old or young. &#8216;Uyaina said to his nephew, &#8220;O my nephew! Have you an approach to this chief so as to get for me the permission to see him?&#8221; His nephew said, &#8220;I will get the permission for you to see him.&#8221; (Ibn &#8216;Abbas added: ) So he took the permission for &#8216;Uyaina, and when the latter entered, he said, &#8220;O the son of Al-Khattab! By Allah, you neither give us sufficient provision nor judge among us with justice.&#8221; On that &#8216;Umar became so furious that he intended to harm him. Al-Hurr, said, &#8220;O Chief of the Believers!&#8221; Allah said to His Apostle &#8216;Hold to forgiveness, command what is good (right), and leave the foolish (i.e. do not punish them).&#8217; (7.199) and this person is among the foolish.&#8221; By Allah, &#8216;Umar did not overlook that Verse when Al-Hurr recited it before him, and &#8216;Umar said to observe (the orders of) Allah&#8217;s Book strictly.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 166, Vol. 6)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 390:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Asma&#8217; bint Abu Bakr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I came to &#8216;Aisha during the solar eclipse. The people were standing (offering prayer) and she too, was standing and offering prayer. I asked, &#8220;What is wrong with the people?&#8221; She pointed towards the sky with her hand and said, Subhan Allah!&#8221; I asked her, &#8220;Is there a sign?&#8221; She nodded with her head meaning, yes. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle finished (the prayer), he glorified and praised Allah and said, &#8220;There is not anything that I have not seen before but I have seen now at this place of mine, even Paradise and Hell. It has been revealed to me that you people will be put to trial nearly like the trial of Ad-Dajjal, in your graves. As for the true believer or a Muslim (the sub-narrator is not sure as to which of the two (words Asma&#8217; had said) he will say, &#8216;Muhammad came with clear signs from Allah, and we responded to him (accepted his teachings) and believed (what he said)&#8217; It will be said (to him) &#8216;Sleep in peace; we have known that you were a true believer who believed with certainty.&#8217; As for a hypocrite or a doubtful person, (the sub-narrator is not sure as to which word Asma&#8217; said) he will say, &#8216;I do not know, but I heard the people saying something and so I said the same.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The most sinful person among the Muslims is the one who asked about something which had not been prohibited, but was prohibited because of his asking.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 393:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Thabit:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet took a room made of date palm leaves mats in the mosque. Allah&#8217;s Apostle prayed in it for a few nights till the people gathered (to pray the night prayer (Tarawih) (behind him.) Then on the 4th night the people did not hear his voice and they thought he had slept, so some of them started humming in order that he might come out. The Prophet then said, &#8220;You continued doing what I saw you doing till I was afraid that this (Tarawih prayer) might be enjoined on you, and if it were enjoined on you, you would not continue performing it. Therefore, O people! Perform your prayers at your homes, for the best prayer of a person is what is performed at his home except the compulsory congregational) prayer.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 229,Vol. 3) (See Hadith No. 134, Vol. 8)</p>

Inform us bout the spirit.&#8221; The Prophet stood up for a while, waiting. I realized that he was being Divinely Inspired, so I kept away from him till the inspiration was over. Then the Prophet said, &#8220;(O Muhammad) they ask you regarding the spirit, Say: The spirit its knowledge is with my Lord (i.e., nobody has its knowledge except Allah)&#8221; (17.85) (This is a miracle of the Qur&#8217;an that all the scientists up till now do not know about the spirit, i.e, how life comes to a body and how it goes away at its death) (See Hadith No. 245, Vol. 6)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ali addressed us while he was standing on a brick pulpit and carrying a sword from which was hanging a scroll He said &#8220;By Allah, we have no book to read except Allah&#8217;s Book and whatever is on this scroll,&#8221; And then he unrolled it, and behold, in it was written what sort of camels were to be given as blood money, and there was also written in it: &#8216;Medina is a sanctuary form &#8216;Air (mountain) to such and such place so whoever innovates in it an heresy or commits a sin therein, he will incur the curse of Allah, the angles, and all the people and Allah will not accept his compulsory or optional good deeds.&#8217; There was also written in it: &#8216;The asylum (pledge of protection) granted by any Muslims is one and the same, (even a Muslim of the lowest status is to be secured and respected by all the other Muslims, and whoever betrays a Muslim in this respect (by violating the pledge) will incur the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people, and Allah will not accept his compulsory or optional good deeds.&#8217; There was also written in it: &#8216;Whoever (freed slave) befriends (takes as masters) other than his real masters (manumitters) without their permission will incur the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people, and Allah will not accept his compulsory or optional good deeds. &#8216; (See Hadith No. 94, Vol. 3)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet did something as it was allowed from the religious point of view but some people refrained from it.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abi Mulaika:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once the two righteous men, i.e., Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar were on the verge of destruction (and that was because): When the delegate of Bani Tamim came to the Prophet, one of them (either Abu Bakr or &#8216;Umar) recommended Al-Aqra&#8217; bin Habis At-Tamimi Al-Hanzali, the brother of Bani Majashi (to be appointed as their chief), while the other recommended somebody else. Abu Bakr said to &#8216;Umar, &#8220;You intended only to oppose me.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I did not intend to oppose you!&#8221; Then their voices grew louder in front of the Prophet whereupon there was revealed: &#8216;O you who believe! Do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet..a great reward.&#8217; (49.2-3) Ibn Az-Zubair said, &#8216;Thence forward when &#8216;Umar talked to the Prophet, he would talk like one who whispered a secret and would even fail to make the Prophet hear him, in which case the Prophet would ask him (to repeat his words).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(the mother of believers) Allah&#8217;s Apostle during his fatal ailment said, &#8220;Order Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer.&#8221; I said, &#8220;If Abu Bakr stood at your place (in prayers, the people will not be able to hear him because of his weeping, so order &#8216;Umar to lead the people in prayer.&#8221; He again said, &#8220;Order Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer &#8221; Then I said to Hafsa, &#8220;Will you say (to the Prophet), &#8216;If Abu Bakr stood at your place, the people will not be able to hear him be cause of his weeping, so order &#8216;Umar to lead the people in prayer?&#8221; Hafsa did so, whereupon Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;You are like the companions of Joseph (See Qur&#8217;an, 12:30-32). Order Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer.&#8221; Hafsa then said to me, &#8220;I have never received any good from you!&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 407:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sahl bin Sa&#8217;d As-Sa&#8217;idi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Uwaimir Al-&#8216;Ajlani came to &#8216;Asim bin &#8216;Adi and said, &#8220;If a man found another man with his wife and killed him, would you sentence the husband to death (in Qisas,) i.e., equality in punishment)? O &#8216;Asim! Please ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle about this matter on my behalf.&#8221; &#8216;Asim asked the Prophet but the Prophet disliked the question and disapproved of it. &#8216;Asim returned and informed &#8216;Uwaimir that the Prophet disliked that type of question. &#8216;Uwaimir said, &#8220;By Allah, I will go (personally) to the Prophet.&#8221; &#8216;Uwaimir came to the Prophet when Allah had already revealed Qur&#8217;anic Verses (in that respect), after &#8216;Asim had left (the Prophet ). So the Prophet said to &#8216;Uwaimir, &#8220;Allah has revealed Qur&#8217;anic Verses regarding you and your wife.&#8221; The Prophet then called for them, and they came and carried out the order of Lian.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then &#8216;Uwaimir said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Now if I kept her with me, I would be accused of telling a lie.&#8221; So &#8216;Uwaimir divorced her although the Prophet did not order him to do so. Later on this practice of divorcing became the tradition of couples involved in a case of Li&#8217;an. The Prophet said (to the people). &#8220;Wait for her! If she delivers a red short (small) child like a Wahra (a short red animal). then I will be of the opinion that he (&#8216;Uwaimir) has told a lie but if she delivered a black big-eyed one with big buttocks, then I will be of the opinion that he has told the truth about her.&#8221; &#8216;Ultimately she gave birth to a child that proved the accusation.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 408:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Malik bin Aus An-Nasri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I proceeded till I entered upon &#8216;Umar (and while I was sitting there), his gate-keeper Yarfa came to him and said, &#8221; &#8216;Uthman, &#8216;Abdur-Rahman, Az-Zubair and Sa&#8217;d ask your permission to come in.&#8221; &#8216;Umar allowed them. So they entered, greeted, and sat down. (After a while the gatekeeper came) and said, &#8220;Shall I admit &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas?&#8221; &#8216;Umar allowed them to enter. Al-&#8216;Abbas said &#8220;O Chief of the believers! Judge between me and the oppressor (&#8216;Ali).&#8221; Then there was a dispute (regarding the property of Bani Nadir) between them (&#8216;Abbas and &#8216;Ali). &#8216;Uthman and his companions said, &#8220;O Chief of the Believers! Judge between them and relieve one from the other.&#8221; Umar said, &#8220;Be patient! beseech you by Allah, with Whose permission the Heaven and the Earth Exist! Do you know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Our property is not to be inherited, and whatever we leave is to be given in charity,&#8217; and by this Allah&#8217;s Apostle meant himself?&#8221; On that the group said, &#8220;He verily said so.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then faced &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas and said, &#8220;I beseech you both by Allah, do you both know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said so?&#8221; They both replied, &#8220;Yes&#8221;. &#8216;Umar then said, &#8220;Now I am talking to you about this matter (in detail) . Allah favored Allah&#8217;s Apostle with some of this wealth which He did not give to anybody else, as Allah said: &#8216;What Allah bestowed as Fai (Booty on His Apostle for which you made no expedition&#8230; &#8216; (59.6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So that property was totally meant for Allah&#8217;s Apostle, yet he did not collect it and ignore you, nor did he withhold it with your exclusion, but he gave it to you and distributed it among you till this much of it was left behind, and the Prophet, used to spend of this as the yearly expenditures of his family and then take what remained of it and spent it as he did with (other) Allah&#8217;s wealth. The Prophet did so during all his lifetime, and I beseech you by Allah, do you know that?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then addressed &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas, saying, &#8220;I beseech you both by Allah, do you know that?&#8221; Both of them replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;Then Allah took His Apostle unto Him. Abu Bakr then said &#8216;I am the successor of Allah&#8217;s Apostle&#8217; and took over all the Prophet&#8217;s property and disposed of it in the same way as Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to do, and you were present then.&#8221; Then he turned to &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas and said, &#8220;You both claim that Abu Bakr did so-and-so in managing the property, but Allah knows that Abu Bakr was honest, righteous, intelligent, and a follower of what is right in managing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah took Abu Bakr unto Him, &#8216;I said: I am the successor of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr.&#8217; So I took over the property for two years and managed it in the same way as Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and Abu Bakr used to do. Then you both (&#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas) came to me and asked for the same thing! (O &#8216;Abbas! You came to me to ask me for your share from nephew&#8217;s property; and this (&#8216;Ali) came to me asking for his wives share from her father&#8217;s property, and I said to you both, &#8216;If you wish, I will place it in your custody on condition that you both will manage it in the same way as Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr did and as I have been doing since I took charge of managing it; otherwise, do not speak to me anymore about it.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then you both said, &#8216;Give it to us on that (condition).&#8217; So I gave it to you on that condition. Now I beseech you by Allah, did I not give it to them on that condition?&#8221; The group (whom he had been addressing) replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then addressed &#8216;Abbas and &#8216;Ali saying, &#8220;I beseech you both by Allah, didn&#8217;t I give you all that property on that condition?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then said, &#8220;Are you now seeking a verdict from me other than that? By Him with Whose Permission the Heaven and the Earth exists I will not give any verdict other than that till the Hour is established; and if you both are unable to manage this property, then you can hand it back to me, and I will be sufficient for it on your behalf.&#8221; (See, Hadith No. 326, Vol. 4)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbas was asked, &#8220;Did you offer the Id prayer with the Prophet?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, had it not been for my close relation to the Prophet, I would not have performed it (with him) because of my being too young The Prophet came to the mark which is near the home of Kathir bin As-Salt and offered the Id prayer and then delivered the sermon. I do not remember if any Adhan or Iqama were pronounced for the prayer. Then the Prophet ordered (the women) to give alms, and they started stretching out their hands towards their ears and throats (giving their ornaments in charity), and the Prophet ordered Bilal to go to them (to collect the alms), and then Bilal returned to the Prophet</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Huraira said, &#8220;You people claim that Abu Huraira narrates many narrations of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. (Anyhow) with Allah will be our appointment. I was a poor man, and used to stick to Allah&#8217;s Apostle contented with what will fill my stomach, and the Muhajirin (emigrants) used to be busy trading in the markets, and the Ansar used to be busy looking after their properties. One-day I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;Who will spread his Rida&#8217; (a garment covering the upper part of the body) till I finished my speech and then fold it, (i.e. wrap it over your body), in which case he will never forget anything he had heard from me.&#8221; So I spread my garment which I was wearing; and by Him Who sent Muhammad with the Truth, ever since, I have never forgotten whatever I heard from him (the Prophet)&#8221; (See, Hadith No. 119, Vol. 1)</p>

I said to Jabir, &#8220;How can you swear by Allah?&#8221; Jabir said, &#8220;I have heard &#8216;Umar swearing by Allah regarding this matter in the presence of the Prophet and the Prophet did not disapprove of it.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 454:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Horses may be used for three purposes: For a man they may be a source of reward (in the Hereafter); for another, a means of protection; and for another, a source of sin. The man for whom they are a source of reward, is the one who keeps them for Allah&#8217;s Cause and ties them with long ropes and lets them graze in a pasture or garden. Whatever those long ropes allow them to eat of that pasture or garden, will be written as good deeds for him and if they break their ropes and run one or two rounds, then all their footsteps and dung will be written as good deeds for him, and if they pass a river and drink from it though he has had no intention of watering them, even then, that will be written as good deeds for him. So such horses are a source of reward for that man. For the man who keeps horses for his livelihood in order not to ask others for help or beg his bread, and at the same time he does not forget Allah&#8217;s right of what he earns through them and of their backs (that he presents it to be used in Allah&#8217;s Cause), such horses are a shelter for him (from poverty). For the man who keeps them just out of pride and for showing off, they are a source of sin.&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle was asked about donkeys. He said, &#8220;Allah has not revealed anything to me regarding them except this comprehensive Verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Then anyone who has done good, equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant) shall see it, and any one who has done evil, equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant) shall see it.&#8221; (99.7-8)</p>

The Prophet then asked for a meal (mastigures etc. to be put) and it was eaten over his table cloth, but the Prophet did not eat of it, as he had aversion to it. But if it had been illegal to eat, it would not have been eaten over his table cloth nor would he have ordered that (mastigures meat) to be eaten</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever has eaten garlic or onion, should keep away from us, or should keep away from our mosque and should stay at home.&#8221; Ibn Wahb said, &#8220;Once a plate full of cooked vegetables was brought to the Prophet at Badr. Detecting a bad smell from it, he asked about the dish and was informed of the kinds of vegetables in contained. He then said, &#8220;Bring it near,&#8221; and so it was brought near to one of his companions who was with him. When the Prophet saw it, he disliked eating it and said (to his companion), &#8220;Eat, for I talk in secret to ones whom you do not talk to.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ubaidullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Why do you ask the people of the scripture about anything while your Book (Quran) which has been revealed to Allah&#8217;s Apostle is newer and the latest? You read it pure, undistorted and unchanged, and Allah has told you that the people of the scripture (Jews and Christians) changed their scripture and distorted it, and wrote the scripture with their own hands and said, &#8216;It is from Allah,&#8217; to sell it for a little gain. Does not the knowledge which has come to you prevent you from asking them about anything? No, by Allah, we have never seen any man from them asking you regarding what has been revealed to you!&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">After the slanderers had given a forged statement against her, Allah&#8217;s Apostle called &#8216;Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration was delayed. He wanted to ask them and consult them about the question of divorcing me. Usama gave his evidence that was based on what he knew about my innocence, but &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;Allah has not put restrictions on you and there are many women other than her. Furthermore you may ask the slave girl who will tell you the truth.&#8221; So the Prophet asked Barira (my salve girl), &#8220;Have you seen anything that may arouse your suspicion?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;I have not seen anything more than that she is a little girl who sleeps, leaving the dough of her family (unguarded) that the domestic goats come and eat it.&#8221; Then the Prophet stood on the pulpit and said, &#8220;O Muslims! Who will help me against the man who has harmed me by slandering my wife? By Allah, I know nothing about my family except good.&#8221; The narrator added: Then the Prophet mentioned the innocence of &#8216;Aisha. (See Hadith No. 274, Vol. 6)</p>

Will you allow me to go to my parents&#8217; home?&#8221; He allowed her and sent a slave along with her. An Ansari man said, &#8220;Subhanaka! It is not right for us to speak about this. Subhanaka!

<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah in a gathering saying, &#8220;We, the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle assumed the state of Ihram to perform only Hajj without &#8216;Umra.&#8221; Jabir added, &#8220;The Prophet arrived (at Mecca) on the fourth of Dhul-Hijja. And when we arrived (in Mecca) the Prophet ordered us to finish the state of Ihram, saying, &#8220;Finish your lhram and go to your wives (for sexual relation).&#8221; Jabir added, &#8220;The Prophet did not oblige us (to go to our wives) but he only made that legal for us. Then he heard that we were saying, &#8220;When there remains only five days between us and the Day of Arafat he orders us to finish our Ihram by sleeping with our wives in which case we will proceed to &#8216;Arafat with our male organs dribbling with semen?&#8217; (Jabir pointed out with his hand illustrating what he was saying). Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up and said, &#8216;You (People) know that I am the most Allah-fearing, the most truthful and the best doer of good deeds (pious) from among you. If I had not brought the Hadi with me, I would have finished my Ihram as you will do, so finish your Ihram. If I had formerly known what I came to know lately, I would not have brought the Hadi with me.&#8217; So we finished our Ihram and listened to the Prophet and obeyed him.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 713, Vol. 2)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 465:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah Al Muzam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Perform (an optional) prayer before Maghrib prayer.&#8221; (He repeated it thrice) and the third time he said, &#8220;Whoever wants to offer it can do so,&#8221; lest the people should take it as a Sunna (tradition). (See Hadith No. 277, Vol. 2)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 466:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jundab bin &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Recite (and study) the Quran as long as you are in agreement as to its interpretation and meanings, but when you have differences regarding its interpretation and meanings, then you should stop reciting it (for the time being.) (See Hadith No 581, Vol. 6)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 467:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jundab bin &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Recite (and study) the Qur&#8217;an as long as your hearts are in agreement as to its meanings, but if you have differences as regards its meaning, stop reading it then.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 468:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the time of the death of the Prophet approached while there were some men in the house, and among them was &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khatttab, the Prophet said, &#8220;Come near let me write for you a writing after which you will never go astray.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;The Prophet is seriously ill, and you have the Quran, so Allah&#8217;s Book is sufficient for us.&#8221; The people in the house differed and disputed. Some of them said, &#8220;Come near so that Allah&#8217;s Apostle may write for you a writing after which you will not go astray,&#8221; while some of them said what &#8216;Umar said. When they made much noise and differed greatly before the Prophet, he said to them, &#8220;Go away and leave me.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas used to say, &#8220;It was a great disaster that their difference and noise prevented Allah&#8217;s Apostle from writing that writing for them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-align:justify;line-height:1.5em;">All praises belong to Allaah, may prayers and salutations be upon the Messenger of Allaah, his family, companions and those who follow his guidance. As to what follows:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Certainly Allaah has distinguished the ummah of Islaam over the other nations, because<strong><span style="color:#993300;"> we enjoin what is right and we forbid what is wrong</span>.</strong> Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;">“You are the best nation brought out of the people (because) you enjoin what is right and you forbid what is wrong.”</span> (3:110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (may peace be upon him said): <span style="color:#008000;">“Whoever of you sees an evil then let him change it with his hand, if he is not able then with his tongue, if he is not able then with his heart and that is the weakest of faith.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Lord has imposed on us that we are from those people who establish justice. As Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;">“Oh you who believe, be from those who establish justice and be witnesses for Allaah even if it is against yourselves, parents or kinfolk.”</span> (4:135)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also ordered us to cooperate upon righteousness and piety and not sin and transgression. As Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;">“And cooperate upon righteousness and piety and do not cooperate upon sin and transgression, and have taqwa of Allaah; certainly Allaah is strong in punishment.”</span> (5:2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Allaah ordered us with jihad, as a means for spreading the religion and defending it</strong></span>. We were ordered to make jihad with the sword and with the tongue. We were ordered with the jihad of clarifying, (establishing) evidences, and proofs. And this is the jihad of the prophets (may peace be upon them all).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Allaah ordered (us) with truthfulness</strong></span> and what comes along with it, and forbade us from lying and what comes along with it. The Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">“Upon you is to be truthful, for truthfulness guides to goodness and goodness guides to paradise. A man will continue to be truthful and he is lead to that, until it is written with Allaah that he is truthful. And beware of lying, for lying leads to wickedness and wickedness leads to the fire. A man will continue lying and he is lead to that until it is written with Allaah that he is a liar.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (may peace be upon him)<span style="color:#993300;"><strong> warned us from false suspicion</strong></span> when he said: “Beware of suspicion, for suspicion is the worst of false tales.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">He ordered us with brotherhood</span></strong> and being diligent upon coming together as brothers. The Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">“The Muslim is a brother to another Muslim, he does not deceive him nor desert him. The Muslim’s honor, wealth and blood are sacred.”</span> (Then he said) “Piety is here,” (pointing to his chest three times) and he said, <span style="color:#008000;">“It is sufficient enough evil for a person to hold his Muslim brother in contempt.”</span> (Narrated by at-Tirmidhi who said the hadeeth is hasan)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (may peace be upon him) (also) said: “Do not envy one another, do not hate one another, do not turn away from one another, do not inflate prices on one another, but be, (oh) servants of Allaah, brothers (to one another).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>He ordered us with (giving) advice</strong></span>. He said: “The religion is advice.” So we said, “To whom, oh Messenger of Allaah?” He said: “To Allaah, to His Book, to His Messenger, to the leaders of the Muslims and to the common folk.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">He ordered us with helping the oppressed and the oppressor</span></strong>. He said: “Help your brother if he is an oppressor or oppressed.” A man then said: “Oh Messenger of Allaah, I (can see) helping him if he is being oppressed. But if I see that he is the oppressor how can I help him?!” He said: “Hold him and prevent him from oppression and this is (your) helping him.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah informed us that oppression will be darkness on the Day of Judgment. Allaah says: “Indeed, Allaah does not do injustice, [even] as much as an atom&#8217;s weight; while if there is a good deed, He multiplies it and gives from Himself a great reward.” (4:4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (may peace be upon him) said (that Allaah says) in a Hadeeth al-Qudsi [1]: “Oh my servants, surely I have made oppression forbidden upon Myself and I have made it forbidden amongst you, therefore do not oppress (one another).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Allaah has made excessiveness and extremism forbidden in the religion</strong></span>. Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;">“Oh People of the Scripture, do not commit excess in your religion or say about Allaah except the truth.”</span>(4:171)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">“Beware of excessiveness, for certainly the people before you were destroyed because of their excessiveness in the religion.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said: <span style="color:#008000;">“Do not exaggerate with me as the Christians exaggerated with (Jesus) the son of Mary.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>He (Allaah) made forbidden partisanship and tribalism</strong></span>, as the Messenger of Allaah (may peace be upon him) said:<span style="color:#008000;"> “Whoever is killed under the banner of a people whose cause is not clear and calls to fanatical partisanship or tribalism or supports it and is killed, he dies in a state of jaahiliyyah</span> [2].”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">It is not correct for those who educate to make the people into parties or groups and to make enmity and hatred between them. Rather they should be as brothers, cooperating upon righteousness and piety.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">As Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;">“And cooperate upon righteousness and piety and do not cooperate upon sin and transgression, and have taqwa of Allaah, certainly Allaah is strong in punishment.”</span> (5:2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">It is not (correct) for anyone to take a vow to be in agreement with everything that someone wants, and to support those whom he supports and to become an enemy to those he is an enemy to. Rather whoever does this, he is from the likes of Genghis Khan [3] and those similar to him. They are the ones who make those in agreement with them their supporting friends and they make those who oppose them their hated enemies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">What is binding upon them and their followers is the covenant of Allaah and His Messenger (may peace be upon him). So they must obey Allaah and His Messenger and work by what Allaah and His Messenger ordered. They must make forbidden that which Allaah and His Messenger made forbidden. They must take care of the rights of those (scholars and students) who educate people as Allaah and His Messenger have ordered. So if a teacher (scholar or student) is the one being oppressed, then he aids him and if a teacher is the oppressor, then he does not aid him in his oppression, rather he prevents him from it. As what has been authentically reported is that the Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: “Help your brother if he is an oppressor or oppressed.” A man then said: “Oh Messenger of Allaah, I (can see) helping him if he is being oppressed. But if I see that he is the oppressor how can I help him?!” He said: “Hold him and prevent him from oppression and this is (your) helping him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(End of Ibn Taymiyyah’s quote)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>It is obligatory for this ummah to establish these affairs of great benefits and upright principles. And (the ummah) must have a concern for this with a true care, whether it be an individual, group, tribe, or government, and specifically the scholars and the students of knowledge. This applies more specifically to those who ascribe themselves to the people of Sunnah and the Jamaa’ah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>So if there is (any) exceeding of the limits of these affairs or anything from them, great corruption will appear in the world and the religion, and this leads to the destruction of these great guideposts. In this is a dangerous evil and great corruption.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>And from that of which there is no doubt for the one who has intellect, there has occurred great exceeding of the limits and harmful oppression for the one who speaks the truth. He is rebutted for what is with him of the truth, belittled and insulted, and this is something extremely bad. It coming from a disbeliever (is one thing) but how much more coming from a Muslim?</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Therefore it is upon the Muslim ummah, specifically the youth who are its pillars, to honor and respect the truth and magnify it. It is upon them to despise falsehood and its people, whoever they may be. Allaah will honor them, give them might and elevate their affairs because of this. The opposite of this only brings misguidance, trials, and displeasure from Allaah. This will (lead) to punishments in the life of this world. From these punishments is that the enemies will have authority over them until they return to their true religion and adhere to it.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah give us all success in what pleases Him.</p>

<h2>About This Publication</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In these times of great division and media saturation, this treatise is an essential read to help mankind in general, and Muslims specifically, discern between what is correct and authentic knowledge, from what is misleading.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this publication, the Shaykh begins by explaining to the readers the reasons why Knowledge of the Qur’aan and the Sunnah is a necessity in our lives.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He further elaborates on the fundamental importance of evidence and proof in the study of Islam and the responsibility we have in staying away from blind following.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, in seeking the correct understanding of Islam, he makes clear the status of the Companions when he says, ‘No matter how much an individual excels in intelligence, aptitude and cleverness, he cannot do without the understanding of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even great Scholars like Shaafi’ee, Malik, Ahmed, Abu Haneefa and others were in great need of referring back to the illustrious companions (may Allah be pleased with them). Ash- Shaafi’ee said: ‘The companions are superior to us in all aspects of knowledge, intelligence and understanding.’’</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"> As-Salafiyyah in the Arabic Language Means: Ascription to he who has preceeded; meaning passed by.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In its legislative usage, it is: All those who have passed after the Prophet Peace be upon him (following) his tracks; from the companions, the Imaams amongst the Taabi’oon (successors of the companions), and those after them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know, may Allaah bless you, that no one from the human beings in any time or place founded Salafiyyah. So Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab along with his brother Imaam Muhammad ibn Sa’ood were not the founders of Salafiyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nor was anyone before them from the people of knowledge and the Imaams of the religion and the true callers to this monotheistic religion its founder; such as Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyah and his students, and those who were before him; such as the four Imaams and those who we have named from the Imaams; nor from the Taabi’oon, nor from the companions of Muhammad nor was Muhammad. Nor was it anyone who came before him from the Prophets and Messengers, upon all of them be prayers and peace. Rather, it is from Allaah. The Prophets and Messengers brought it. They conveyed that which He wished from the worship legislatively; as did those who came after them from their companions and followers. So whoever came after them were callers to Allaah in conformity with this Salafiyyah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Compiled by The Eminent Shaykh, the Muhaddith, Rabee’ ibn Haadee al-Madkhalee<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the place which is enlightened by the Book and the Sunnah in the Islaamic world is the place of the People of Hadeeth, as-Salafiyoon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the place which is darkened in the Islaamic world is the place of the People of Bida’ and misguidance, those who oppose the people of Hadeeth and wage war against them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the present day political groups – who have among them Ikhwaan Muslimoon and their likes – and the deviant sects – who have among them Jamaat Tabligh – want this darkness to remain in dominance over the Islaamic world and to cover it, they do not even move against it. They have no intention of eliminating it and they have no Manhaj (methodology) to direct them to its removal or to establish Tawheed and the light of the Book and the Sunnah, taking its place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they guard this darkness &#8211; especially the darkness of the Rafidah and Soofeeyah- with the justification that they are combating the enemies of Islaam, although they definitely do not do this. Their justification is that they say, ‘We cooperate in what we agree upon and overlook what we differ upon,’ which they justify further with their claim that they gather the Muslims together along with the Rawafidah and the extreme Soofees in order to confront the enemies of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, they wage war against the people of Hadeeth, placing different obstacles and hindrances in front of them which then prevent the people from being enlightened by that which the People of Hadeeth have of the light of Tawheed and the light of the Book, the Sunnah and the Manhaj of the Salaf-as-Saalih.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How long will the defence of this darkness subjected upon the Ummah continue?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When will the Muslims see this light?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qayyim -Rahimullaah- said, quoting as-Samaanee -Rahimullaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Every sect from the people of Bida’ claims that they adhere to the Sharia’ of Islaam and that the truth the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- established is what they believe in and profess. However, Allah has denied them that as the truth and correct ‘Aqeedah will only be with the People of Hadeeth and Athaar because they successively took their Deen and beliefs with from those who preceded them, generation by generation, until they reached the Tabi’een.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Tabi’een took it from the Companions of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam and the Companions took it from the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no way of knowing what the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- called the people to, of the straight path, except by way of what the People of Hadeeth followed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What shows that the People of Hadeeth are upon the truth is that if you were to research all the books authored by them, from the first to the last, the oldest to the newest, you would find &#8211; despite the fact that they are from different countries and time periods with vast distances between their lands, each of them living in their own regions- that in the matter of belief they are on one path, they flow in one direction following that path and they do not diverge from it, nor do they deviate from it. Their hearts are one heart; you do not see any differing in what they narrated nor any divisions or differing in any issue, no matter how small it may be.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, if everything they uttered with their tongues and what they narrated from the Salaf were gathered you would find it as though it had come from one heart and spoken by one tongue. So is there any evidence clearer than this to show the truth?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Do they not then consider the Qur’aan carefully? Had it been from other than Allaah, they would surely have found therein much contradiction. &gt;&gt; [Nisa:82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And hold fast, all of you together, to the Rope of Allaah (i.e. this Qur’aan), and be not divided among yourselves, and remember Allaah’s Favour on you, for you were enemies one to another but He joined your hearts together, so that, by His Grace, you became brethren (in Islaamic Faith)&gt;&gt; [Aali-Imraan: 103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason that the people of Hadeeth are united is because they take their Deen and method of narration from the Book and the Sunnah and so, they inherit unity and harmony.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of Bida’ took the Deen from their intellects so they inherited separation and differences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed conveying and narrating from trustworthy, precise narrators ensures that differences are rare and if there were a difference it would be in a single word or the wording of a narration. This differing does not harm the Deen, not does it belittle it. As for following intellects and desires, ideas and opinions, they rarely bring unity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have seen that the Companions of Hadeeth, past and present, are those who travelled for these Aathaar. They sought them and took from their sources, they memorized them and became delighted by them, they called to following these narrations and they rebuked those who opposed them. They had numerous narrations between them such that they became famous due to them, just as a craftsman becomes famous because of his skill and what he produces.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then we saw a people who became disconnected from their memorization and knowledge and deviated from following the well-known, authentic narrations. They absolved themselves from the companionship of its people and attacked the narrations and their people. These people abandoned the rights due to this knowledge, they ascribed evil examples to it and to the people of hadeeth, giving them the vilest of descriptions. So, they called them Nawasib (haters of the family of the Prophet), Mushabiha (those who compare Allaah to the creation), Hashaweeyah (those who busy themselves with things of no benefit) or Mujjassama (those who ascribe a physical body to Allaah). So we came to know, from the correct proofs and supporting evidences, that the people of hadeeth have more right to it (i.e. the knowledge of hadeeth/narrations) than the rest of the sects.’ [Mukhtasir as-Sawaaiq pg 423-429]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The new opponents of the People of Hadeeth continually repeat the attacks that the communist, laymen and Baaith party (a political party with strong socialist tendencies) use against their opponents from amongst the Muslims and other than them, attacking with such statements as, ‘they are spies,’ ‘working for America,’ ‘ scholars of the royal courts’ or ‘scholars who want meals.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah for guidance that everyone returns to the truth, turning away from falsehood and departing from the darkness of Bida’.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah Magazine, Issue No.4 &#8211; Jumâdal-Awwal 1417H / November 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>KNOWING THE STRAIGHT PATH</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullaah ibn Mas&#8217;ood <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> said:<br />
<i>The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam drew a line for us and said. &#8220;This is Allaah&#8217;s Straight Path.&#8221; Then he drew lines to its right and left and then said. &#8220;These ore other paths. Upon every one of them there is a devil calling towards it.&#8221; Then he recited:</i> <b>&#8220;Indeed this is My Straight Path, so follow it, and do not follow other paths that will separate you from His Path.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:153].&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, that which is necessary for the Muslims &#8211; both individuals and groups in order to prepare for the mighty task and to achieve the lofty goal, is to truly know the Straight Path, its People, their <i>&#8216;aqeedah</i> (belief) and their <i>manhaj</i> (methodology), knowing also the innovations and evils which cause one to separate from this way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The wisdom in learning about the evil is taken from the hadeeth of Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamaan radiallaahu &#8216;anhu where he said. &#8220;The people used to ask the Messenger of Allaah <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> about the good, but I used to ask him about the evil for fear that it would overtake me &#8230;&#8221;2 And may Allaah have mercy upon the one who said in poetic wisdom:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I learnt what was evil, not for itself, but to avoid it. He who does not know evil from good, falls into it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>CLINGING TO THE ORIGINAL STATE OF AFFAIRS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul-&#8216;Aaliyah (d.90H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; who said:<br />
&#8220;Learn Islaam. Then when you have learnt Islaam, do not turn away from it to the right nor the left. But be upon the Straight Path and upon the Sunnah of your Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and that which his Companions were upon &#8230; and beware of these innovations because they cause enmity and hatred amongst you. But stick to the original state of affairs which was there before they divided.&#8221; So &#8216;Aasim said: I related this to al-Hasan al-Basree so he said. &#8220;He has given you sincere advice and has told you the truth.&#8221;3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is known that this original state of affairs, had as its pure and sweet spring, the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah, built upon the understanding of the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> (the Pious Predecessors) &#8211; the Companions, the <i>Taabi&#8217;een</i> and those that followed them &#8211; about whom the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said. <i>&#8220;The best of mankind is my generation, then those who follow them, then those who follow them.&#8221;</i>4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Aaishah <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhaa</i> said:<br />
A man come to the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and said. Who is the most excellent of mankind? So the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;The generation of those that I am in, then the second, then the third.&#8221;</i>5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this principle &#8211; the obligation of adhering to the Qur&#8217;aan and the authentic Sunnah upon the understanding of the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> &#8211; is the cornerstone principle of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Abu Haneefah (d.150H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;Stick to the narrations and the way of the Salaf and beware of newly invented matters, for all of it is innovation.&#8221;6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Awzaa&#8217;ee (d.157H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said.<br />
&#8220;Patiently restrict yourself to the Sunnah and pause where the people paused, say what they said and avoid what they avoided. Take to the path of your Salafus-Saalih, for indeed, what was sufficient for them, is sufficient for you.&#8221;7</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal (d.241H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;The fundamentals of the Sunnah with us are: Clinging to that which the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> were upon, taking them as our examples to be followed; avoiding innovations, for every innovation is misguidance.&#8221;8</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abdul-Haadee (d.748H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;It is not permissible to invent on interpretation about a verse or a Sunnah which was not there in the time of the Salaf (the Pious Predecessors), nor did they have any knowledge concerning it, nor explain it to the Ummah. Since this would imply that the Salaf were ignorant of the truth in this matter and failed to reach it. Whereas the late-coming opponent is somehow guided to the truth!&#8221;9</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim (d.751H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;Inventing on explanation with regards to the Book of Allaah &#8211; which the Salaf and the Scholars are in opposition to &#8211; necessitates one of two things: Either the explanation itself is a mistake. Or that the sayings of the Salaf &#8211; which differs with such a saying &#8211; are in error! And no one who possess even an ounce of intellect would doubt that the one whose saying is in opposition to that of the Salaf, then he is the one who is in error.&#8221;10</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>SOFTENING THE HEARTS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Along with seeking to understand the correct Islaamic <i>&#8216;aqeedah</i> (beliefs) and <i>fiqh</i> (jurisprudence), <i>tafseer</i> (Qur&#8217;aanic explanation), and <i>hadeeth</i>, on essential part of the way of the Salaf includes understanding matters relating to <i>aadaab</i> and <i>akhlaaq</i> (manners and etiquettes) and <i>tazkiyatun-nufoos</i> (purification of the souls) and reflecting upon the lives of the Salafus-Saaliheen. Since this &#8211; it is hoped &#8211; will enable hearts to cultivate mildness and humility in the worship of Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; and also strengthen the determination to strive to making His Religion uppermost in the hearts of the people and upon the face of this earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn al-Jawzee (d.597H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;I feel that occupying oneself with jurisprudence and acquiring the narrations is hardly enough to correct the heart, unless he adds to that the study of <i>raqaa&#8217;iq</i> (heart-melting narrations) and the study of the lives of the Salaf us-Saaliheen (the Pious Predecessors). Since they attained what is desirous from the narrations and took from the outer actions what is ordered and what is wanted from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I do not inform you of this except after personal trial and experience. Since I have found that the majority of the narrators and the students of Hadeeth are concerned chiefly with attaining the briefest <i>isnaad</i> (chain of narration) and increase in the number of narrations. And the majority of the Jurisprudents are concerned with dialectics and how to win arguments. So how can the hearts be softened with these things? Previously a group of the Salaf would visit a pious servant to see his conduct and manners, not to take from his knowledge. This was because the fruit of his knowledge was his manners and conduct, so understand this. Thus, along with the study of <i>fiqh</i> and Hadeeth, study the lives of the Salaf and those who were <i>zaahid</i> (abstainers) with regards to the world, so that this may be a cause of softness in your hearts.&#8221;11</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yoonus ibn &#8216;Ubayd (d.139H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> -said:<br />
&#8220;With good manners you understand the knowledge. With the knowledge your actions are corrected. With actions wisdom is obtained. With wisdom you understand <i>zuhd</i> (abstinence) and are granted its benefits. With <i>zuhd</i> comes abandoning the world. With abandoning the world comes desire for the Hereafter. With desire for the Hereafter the pleasure of Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; is obtained.&#8221;12</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE FOUNDATIONS FOR UNITY</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said:<br />
<i>&#8220;This knowledge will be carried by the trustworthy ones of every generation. They will expel from it the alteration made by those going beyond bounds; the false claims of the liars and the false interpretations of the ignorant ones.&#8221;</i>13</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is our hope in Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect- that He adorns us with the correct knowledge bequeathed to us by our Salafus-Saalih, and that He aids us in learning their <i>&#8216;aqeedah</i>, so that hearts may embrace it; learning their <i>manhaj</i>, so that people may follow it and learning also their manners and behaviour, so that souls may be cultivated upon it, seeking to convey this to others with the wisdom, patience and forebearance that this pure and sublime message demands. So herein lies the excellence and of the one who reaches it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Rajab (d.795H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;So the beneficial knowledge from amongst all the types of knowledge is to take possession of the texts of the Book and the Sunnah and to understand their meanings, and to limit oneself in that to what is reported from the Companions, the <i>Taabi&#8217;een</i> and their Successors &#8211; with regards to the meaning of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Hadeeth, and what is reported from them as regard to the <i>halaal</i> (lawful) and <i>haraam</i> (prohibited), and <i>zuhd</i>, <i>raqaa&#8217;iq</i>, the accounts (of previous nations and Prophets), and other than that. Striving firstly, to distinguish what is authentic and what is weak; and then secondly, striving to understand and comprehend it. And there is enough in that for the intelligent one, and enough to occupy one who busies himself with beneficial knowledge. And he who stops at that and makes his intention purely for the Face of Allaah and seeks His help &#8211; then Allaah will help him, guide him and grant him success, satisfaction, understanding and inspiration. Then such a person will take the benefits of this knowledge &#8211; which ore found through it alone &#8211; and that is fear of Allaah, as Allaah &#8211; the Exalted and Majestic &#8211; says: <b>&#8220;Indeed, it is only those who have knowledge, amongst His slaves, that truly tear Allaah.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Faatir 35:10].&#8221;14</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Awaa&#8217;ee (d.157H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;Hold fast to the narrations of the Salaf, even if people were to abandon you. And beware of the opinions of the people, no matter how much they beautify it with their speech.&#8221;15</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan al-Basree (d.110H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;If there was a man who reached the first Salaf, then he (this man) was raised up today, he would not recognise anything of Islaam.&#8221; The narrator said: Al-Hasan put his hand on his cheek and said. &#8220;Except for this Prayer.&#8221; Then he said. &#8220;So &#8211; by Allaah &#8211; how is it for the one who lives in this bad time, not having reached the Salafus-Saalih. So he sees on innovator calling to his innovation, and a worldly person calling to the world, but Allaah protects him from that and makes his heart lean towards those Salafus-Saalih, asking about their way, seeking their narrations and following their path. Allaah will recompense him with a greet reward. So be like that &#8211; if Allaah wills.&#8221;16</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em> Shaykh Muhammad Nasir Uddin al-Albani / </em><em> Source: Al-Asaalah, Issue 9 </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why use the name Salafee? Is it a call towards a party or a group or a madh-hab (school of thought)? Or is it a new sect in Islaam ?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, the word Salaf is well known in the Arabic language as well as in the religious terminology. But what concerns us here, is its discussion from the religious standpoint. Thus, it has authentically been reported on the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, that during the sickness from which he died from, he said to Faatimah, radyAllaahu &#8216;anhaa: <strong> &#8220;…So fear Allaah and have patience. And I am the best Salaf (predecessor) for you.&#8221;</strong> 20</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the scholars have used this word “Salaf” many times, such that it would be too abundant to number and take into account. Sufficient for us, is one example, and it was that which they have used in their battle against innovations: <em> &#8220;And every good lies in following he who has preceded (man salaf) while every evil lies in the innovating of he who came after (man khalaf).&#8221; </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>  </em>However, there are from those who claim to have knowledge, some people who reject this ascription, claiming that there is no basis for it! And so they say: &#8220;It is not permissible for a Muslim to say: &#8216;I am Salafee.&#8217;” So it is as if he is saying that it is not permissible for a Muslim to say: &#8220;I am following the <em> Salaf As-Saalih </em> (the Pious Predecessors) in what they were upon from beliefs, worship and methodology&#8221;! There is no doubt that such a rejection – if that is what he intended – necessitates that one free himself from the correct Islaam, which the righteous predecessors were upon, at the head of whom was the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216; alayhi wa sallam. This is as is indicated in the <em> mutawaatir </em> hadeeth found in the two <em> Saheehs </em> and other than them, that he, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, said: <strong> &#8220;The best of mankind is my generation, then those that come after them, then those that come after them.&#8221; </strong> So it is not permissible for a Muslim to absolve himself from this ascription to the righteous predecessors, whereas, if he were to absolve himself from any other ascription, the scholars would not be able to ascribe him with disbelief or sinfulness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who rejects this name from himself, will you not see him ascribing himself to one of the <em> madh-hab</em> s?! Regardless of whether this <em> madh-hab </em> is related to &#8216;Aqeedah (Creed) or Fiqh (Jurisprudence)? So he is either Ash&#8217;aree or Matureedee. Or perhaps he is from the people of Hadeeth or Hanafee, or Shaafi&#8217;ee or Maalikee or Hanbalee or whatever else enters into the title of &#8220;Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah.&#8221; But in spite of this, the one who ascribes himself to the Ash&#8217;aree <em> madh-hab </em> or to one of the four <em> madh-habs </em> is in fact ascribing himself to individuals that are not infallible, without a doubt, even if there were scholars among them who were correct (in their verdicts). I wish I knew – why doesn&#8217;t he reject the likes of these ascriptions to individuals who are not free from error? But as for the one who ascribes himself to the <em> Salaf As-Saalih </em> (righteous predecessors), then he indeed ascribes himself to infallibility <em> (&#8216;isma</em> h), in the general sense. The Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, has mentioned that one of the signs of the Saved Sect is that they will cling tightly onto what the Messenger of Allaah, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, was upon and what his Companions were upon. So whosoever holds tightly onto them, then he is certainly upon the guidance from his Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And furthermore, it is an ascription that brings honor to the one that ascribes himself to it, and one that facilitates for him the way of the Saved Sect. And these matters do not apply to anyone that ascribes himself to any other ascription, since they are not free from one of two things. Either it is an ascription to a specific individual that is not infallible or it is an ascription to a group of people who follow the methodology of this individual who is not infallible. So there is no infallibility (in their ascriptions) either way. On the opposite of this, there is the infallibility of the Companions of the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, (as a whole). And it is that which we have been commanded to hold tightly onto, from his Sunnah and the Sunnah of his Companions after him. And we must persist and strongly emphasize that our understanding of Allaah&#8217;s Book and the Sunnah of His Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, must be in accordance with the methodology of his, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, Companions. This is so that we can be upon infallibility, as opposed to inclining away towards the right or the left, or deviating with an understanding that comes solely from ourselves, of which there is not found in the Book of Allaah or the Sunnah of His Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, that which provides evidence for it. Furthermore, why is it not sufficient for us to ascribe ourselves to (just) the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah? The reason goes back to two matters, the first of which is related to <strong> the religious texts </strong> , and the second of which is due to <strong> the existence of numerous Islaamic groups </strong> .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to the first reason, then we find in the religious texts, a command to obey something else in connection with the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah, as is found in Allaah&#8217;s saying: <strong> &#8220;O you who believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger and those in authority amongst you.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>  </strong>So if there were someone in authority, who was given the oath of allegiance by the Muslims, it would be obligatory to obey him just as it would be obligatory to obey the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah. So even if he or those around him commit errors, it would be obligatory to obey him in order to repel the harm of differences of opinions. But this is with the well-known condition: <strong> &#8220;There is no obedience to a creation (if it involves) disobeying the Creator.&#8221;</strong> 21</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, may He be Exalted, says: <strong> &#8220;And whosoever opposes the Messenger after the guidance has been clearly explained to him, and follows a way other than the Way of the Believers, We will turn him to what he has chosen </strong><strong>and burn him in Hell – what an evil destination.&#8221; </strong> [Surah An-Nisaa: 115]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, Allaah, Mighty and Sublime, is free and far removed from all imperfections and defects. And there is no doubt or uncertainty that His mentioning of <strong> &#8220;the Way of the Believers&#8221; </strong> here, is only due to an immense and comprehensive wisdom and benefit. So it indicates that there is an important obligation – and it is that our following of the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, <strong><em> must be </em></strong> in accordance with what the first Muslims were upon. And they are the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, then those who came after them, then those who came after them. And this is what the <em> da&#8217;wat-us-salafiyyah </em> (The Salafee Call) invites and calls to. And it is that which is its main priority in the foundation of its call and the methodology of its educating process.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, the Salafee Call truly unites the ummah, while any other call only causes division to the ummah. Allaah, Mighty and Sublime, says: <strong> &#8220;O you who believe, fear Allaah, and be with the truthful.&#8221; </strong> [Surah At-Tawbah: 119]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So anyone that distinguishes between the Book and the Sunnah on one side and the <em> Salaf As-Saalih </em> (Righteous Predecessors) on the other side, then he can never be truthful. As for with regard to the second reason, then the groups and parties of today do not direct at all towards the following of <strong> “the Way of the Believers </strong> ”, which has been mentioned in the ayah. And there are some ahaadeeth, which further confirm and support that ayah, such as the hadeeth of the seventy-three sects. All of them will be in the Hellfire except one. The Messenger of Allaah, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, described them as: <strong> &#8220;The one which is upon the same thing that I and my companions are upon today.&#8221;</strong> 22</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth resembles that ayah which mentions the <strong> “Way of the Believers</strong> ”. Also, there is the hadeeth of Al-&#8216;Irbaad Ibn Saariyah, radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu, in which he, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, said: <strong> &#8220;So stick to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly-guided Khaleefahs after me.&#8221; </strong> 23</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, there are two Sunnahs: The Sunnah of the Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, and the Sunnah of the righteous Khaleefahs. So there is no doubt that we – who come in a later time – must return back to the Qur&#8217;aan, the Sunnah and <strong> &#8220;the Way of the Believers.&#8221; </strong> And it is not permissible for us to say: &#8220;We can understand the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah by themselves, without turning towards what the righteous predecessors were upon.&#8221; And there must be an ascription in this time that distinguishes and is detailed. So it is not sufficient for us to say, &#8220;I am a Muslim&#8221; only! Or &#8220;My <em> madh-hab </em> is Islaam&#8221;! For every sect says that! – the Raafidee, the Ibaadee, the Qadyianee, as well as other sectarians!! So what is it that distinguishes you from them?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if you were to say, &#8220;I am a Muslim who is upon the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah&#8221;, this would also not be sufficient. This is because, the members of these sects – of the Ash&#8217;arees and the Matureedees and the Hizbees – they all claim to follow these two sources also. So there is no doubt that the clear, plain, distinctive and decisive classification is to say, &#8220;I am a Muslim who is upon the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah and upon the methodology of the <em> Salaf As-Saalih </em> (Pious Predecessors). And that can be said in short by saying, &#8220;I am a Salafee.&#8221; So based on this, indeed the truth which is unavoidable, is that it is not enough to rely on the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah without the methodology of the <em> Sala</em> f, for it explains these two with regard to understanding and concept, knowledge and action, and da&#8217;wah (calling) and Jihaad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we know that they (the Sahaabah), may Allaah be pleased with them, did not used to fanatically cling onto one specific <em> madh-hab </em> or to one specific individual. So there was not found amongst them he who was Bakree (a follower of Abu Bakr), or &#8216;Umaree (a follower of &#8216;Umar), or &#8216;Uthmaanee (a follower of &#8216;Uthmaan) or &#8216;Alawee (a follower of &#8216;Alee). Rather, if it were more easy for one of them to ask Abu Bakr or &#8216;Umar or Abu Hurairah, he would ask any of them. This is because they believed that it was not permissible to have total and unrestricted devotion in following, except to one individual. Indeed, he was the Messenger of Allaah sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, the one who did not speak from his own desire, rather it was only revelation revealed to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if we were to submit to these criticizers, for the sake of argument, that we would name ourselves &#8220;Muslims&#8221; only, without ascribing ourselves to the <em> Salaf </em> – in spite of it being an honorable and correct ascription. Would they abandon classifying themselves with the names of their parties or their <em> madh-habs </em> or their ways – based on the fact that they are not prescribed in the Religion nor are they correct? <em> &#8220;So this contrast between us is enough for you And every container becomes wet due to what is in it.&#8221;</em> And Allaah is the Guide to the Right Path. And He, free is He from all defects, is the One in whom we seek assistance.</p>

A short reminder of the obligation of holding on to the way of the Salaf (telelink with brothers in Singapore and Sri Lanka) &#8211; Aboo Sufyaan Uthmaan Beecher hafidhahullaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Hadith</em> of Irbaad ibn Saariyah, may Allaah the Most High be pleased with him, who said, “The Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم gave us a sermon which frightened the hearts and caused the eyes to shed tears. So we said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah! [it is as if it is a farewell sermon] so advise us.’ He said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘I advise you to fear Allaah and to hear and obey even if an Abyssinian slave were to rule over you. For surely, he who lives from amongst you will see much differing, so it is upon you to be upon my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Caliphs. Bite on to it with your back molar teeth and beware of newly invented matters, for verily, every newly invented matter is an innovation, and all innovation is misguidance.’” </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Related by Aboo Daawood (no. 4607) and by at-Tirmidthee (no. 2676). It was authenticated by Shaykh al-Albaanee in Irwaa’ul-Ghaleel (no. 2455).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh</em><em>Doctor</em> <em>Ahmad</em> <em>Bazmool</em> <em>(hafidhahullaah)</em> is from amongst the well known scholars of <em>Makkah</em>, <em>Saudi</em><em>Arabia</em>. He teaches the Science of <em>Hadeeth</em> at <em>Umm</em> <em>ul-Qura</em> University and has studied under some of the great scholars of our time, including <em>Ash-Shaykh, the &#8216;Allaamah, Doctor Rabee’ Ibn Hadi al-Madhkhalee</em>, and his own brother <em>Ash-Shaykh Muhammad bin &#8216;Umar Baazmool</em>. He has gotten <em>ijazaahs</em> from many scholars throughout the <em>Islaamic</em> World including <em>Ash-Shaykh Muhammad Abdullaah as-Soomalee</em>, <em>Ash-Shaykh Ahmad bin Yahya an-Najmee</em>, <em>Ash-Shaykh Abdullaah Ada ash-Shanqeetee</em> , <em>Ash-Shaykh Rabee&#8217; bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee</em> , <em>Ash-Shaykh Muhammad bin Abdullaah as-Sabeel, Ash-Shaykh Yahyaa bin Uthmaan al-Mudarris, </em>and<em> Ash-Shaykh Abdullaah bin Abdul Azeez al-Aqeel</em>. The <em>Shaykh</em> has also been highly praised and recommend by <em>al-Kibaar ul-‘Ulamah</em> for his beneficial works.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As an admonition to <em>Ahlus Sunnah</em> in The Bahamas (a small island southeast of the United States and has a population of less than 400,000 people of which less than 300 are <em>Muslim</em>), and the wider nation of <em>Muslims</em> as well, our <em>Shaykh</em> will enlighten us with some much needed points of advice and wise admonition concerning this blessed <em>da’wah</em>. It is of paramount importance that we truly understand and are upon yaqeen concerning our call which must be done with knowledge. Even more so in these lands of kufr where the vast majority of people are upon <em>shirk</em>, <em>kufr</em> and other grave sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask <strong>Allaah</strong> to grant us beneficial knowledge, guide us to implement that which we have learnt, call the people to The Truth and have patience upon this.</p>

<td style="text-align:justify;">The Da&#8217;wah Sharee&#8217;ah [1] has its basis in the Book and the Sunnah, and its starting point is love for Allaah and desire for His Jannah (Paradise) and fear of His (Hell)Fire, and the way which the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and his Companions (radiAllaahu anhuma) were upon. Its end result is with Allaah, <em>&#8220;Verily, you do not guide those whom you love, but Allaah guides whomever He wills.&#8221;</em> [2]</td>
<td style="text-align:justify;">The da&#8217;wah Siyaasiyyah (the political da&#8217;wah) [3] has its basis in politics, its starting point is ideological, and its means are the party and the organization and the jamaa&#8217;ah, and its end result is planned and designed.</td>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah as-Siyaasiyyah seeks to struggle for the promotion of parties (ahzaab) in the Muslim country to secure for itself a seat amongst the ranks of the [other] parties of the state. And they read the saying of Al-Haqq [Allaah], the Exalted: &#8220;And be not like those who divided and differed among themselves after the clear proofs had come to them. It is they for whom there is a terrible punishment.&#8221; [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, Exalted is He:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;But they have broken their religion into sects, each group rejoicing in what it has.&#8221;</em> [6]</p>

I will give you an example to make clear the difference between the true flags of al-Haqq (the truth) and other than them:So al-`Allaamah Naasiruddeen al-Albaanee, verily love of him is fixed firmly in the hearts of al-`Aalaameen, and his leadership in `uloomud-Deen (the sciences of the Religion) is firmly established through his strength and steadfastness in sharee&#8217; (legislated) knowledge. And there was no charity to publish his books, and no committee to pay for his expenses, no organization to sponsor his residency visa, and no hizb which promotes his efforts, nor media to publish his essays and show his pictures. On the contrary, his establishment in knowledge was his sign, so he was able to face the nations and the people with his knowledge and understanding, without any organization or leader, and no support except through the Tawfeeq of Allaah. Therefore it was his knowledge which made his leadership a duty upon him in all areas. Noble reader, the saying goes:&#8221;And with its opposite, things are made known.&#8221;</td>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[TN]: The narrations that show that the way of Ahlus-Sunnah is not asking the people for their filth (their sadaqaat) are many and clear. So those who ascribe themselves to the way of the Salaf and want to call to the Haqq, they do not establish their da&#8217;wah upon asking for the peoples money. Rather they establish their da&#8217;wah upon hard work and spending upon their da&#8217;wah from their own pockets. And Shaykh Ahmad as-Subay&#8217;ee explains, you will not find even one athar (narration) from the Companions, nor the Taabi&#8217;een, nor the Atbaa&#8217;ut-Taabi&#8217; een, nor those who followed after them where they stood up in the masjid to ask the people for their sadaqaat ý not one! And if this had been their way and their guidance, they would have done it. And from those matters which distinguish the Da&#8217;watus-Salafiyyah from all the other da&#8217;waat is that we take the understanding of the Book and the Sunnah from these aathaar (narrations) from the Salaf of this Ummah, contrary to the political groups and parties.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] Ahmad (4/126), Ibn Maajah (43), and al-Haakim (1/96). Al-`Allamah al-Albaanee declared it Saheeh in Saheeh al-Jaami&#8217; (4369).<br />

<p style="text-align:center;">Class of Thursday, May 17, 2012</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Explanation of the Creed (<strong>Sharhus-Sunnah</strong>) by Imaam Abu Muhammad al-Hasan <strong>al-Barbahaaree</strong> from the book of our noble <strong>Sheikh Saaleh al-Fawzaan</strong>, hafidhahullah, entitled: إتحاف القاري بالتعليقات على شرح السنة</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s talk we begin with point 5 (in the english translation, though it is still 4 in the arabic).</p>
<p><strong>Adhering to the Understanding of the Companions</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">May Allaah have mercy upon you. Know that the Religion is what came from Allaah, the Blessed and Most High. It is not something left to the intellect and opinions of men. Knowledge it is what comes from Allaah and His Messenger, so do not follow anything based upon your desires and so deviate away from the Religion and leave Islaam. There will be no excuse for you since Allaah&#8217;s Messenger explained the Sunnah to his Ummah and made it clear to his Companions and they are the Jamaa&#8217;ah, and they are the Main Body (as-Sawaad ul-A&#8217;dham), and the Main Body is the truth and its followers.So he who contradicts the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallallahu alaihiwasallam in any of the affairs of the Religion, then he has fallen into disbelief.</span></p>

Amma-ba&#8217;d</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Call is to Correct What People Have Corrupted<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>, by Shaykh Muhammad al-Anjaree (hafidhahullaah Ta&#8217;aala)</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">[The following are notes &#8211; not verbatim &#8211; from this highly beneficial Scholarly Lesson and Advice]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">After beginning with the name of Allaah, and praising Allaah, and asking Allaah to send His peace and security upon the noblest of His Messengers, our Prophet Muhammad, then Shaikh Al-Anjaree greeted the Muslims with the greeting of Islaam &#8211; as-salamu &#8216;alaykum wa rahmatullaahi wa baarakatu &#8211; before beginning:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Allaah said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:x-large;color:#000000;">كُنْتُمْ خَيْرَ أُمَّةٍ أُخْرِجَتْ لِلنَّاسِ تَأْمُرُونَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَتَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ الْمُنكَرِ وَتُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>You [true believers in Tawheed, and real followers of Prophet Muhammad, and his Sunnah] are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind; you enjoin Al-Ma&#8217;roof (Tawheed and all that Islaam has ordained) and forbid Al-Munkar (polytheism, disbelief and all that Islaam has forbidden), and you believe in Allaah&#8230;</strong> (Aali &#8216;Imran, ayah 110)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Allaah, Ta&#8217;aala, said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:x-large;color:#000000;">وَلْتَكُنْ مِنْكُمْ أُمَّة ٌ يَدْعُونَ إِلَى الْخَيْرِ وَيَأْمُرُونَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ وَأُوْلَائِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Let there arise out of you a group of people inviting to all that is good (Islaam), enjoining Al-Ma&#8217;roof (Tawheed and all that Islaam orders one to do) and forbidding Al-Munkar (polytheism and disbelief and all that Islaam has forbidden). And it is they who are the successful.</strong> (Aali &#8216;Imran, ayah 104)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Allaah, Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;aala, has made the goodness of this nation in its commanding of the good and forbidding of the evil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Commanding the good means commanding with the Religion, with Tawheed &#8211; that Allaah be singled out with worship &#8211; and the correct Manhaj and the Sunnah. And forbidding the evil means that they forbid Shirk, Bid&#8217;ah, and sins, and whatever is contrary to this Religion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">So the good comes about with enjoining of the good and forbidding the evil. And this is what Allaah, Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;aala, commanded us with. So this Ummah is commanded to enjoin the good, and this was the duty carried out by the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and the Sahaba (radiallaahu Ta&#8217;aala &#8216;anhum), who called to good and called to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The Sahaaba called to good, and they likewise forbade all evil, all that the Religion prohibits, such as Shirk, Bid&#8217;ah, and the rest of the evil &#8211; everything that runs contrary to this Deen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The flag-bearers, banner-carriers of the Sunnah are the carriers of this Religion, and they are those who command with the Sunnah and forbid Bid&#8217;ah, and the sahaaba (radiallaahu Ta&#8217;aala &#8216;anhum) carried out this role and were the carriers of this banner, and this is clear from their narrations.*</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">It is reported that Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (radiallaahu &#8216;anhumma) said: <strong>&#8220;By Allaah, I do not think that anyone will be more pleased with my death than Shaytaan.&#8221;</strong> It was said, &#8220;How is that?&#8221; He replied, <strong>&#8220;An innovation is invented in the East or the West, and a man brings it to me. When it reaches me, I crush it with the Sunnah.&#8221; </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">They [the Sahaaba] called to revival of the Sunnah, and from forbidding evil is to demolish innovations (heresies).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">So when it reached &#8216;Umar ibn al-Khattab (radiallaahu &#8216;anhu) that Sabeegh ibn &#8216;Asl had come up with some tafseer of the Qur`an off the top of his head, from Soorat an-Nazi&#8217;at, &#8216;Umar told him: <strong>If you were <em>MuHaliqqa</em> (bold-headed, like the Khawaarij), I would have cut off your neck.</strong> Meaning (he would have done that) to preserve the religion, the Sunnah, the methodology of Prophethood. This was their eager concern.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Ordering the good &#8211; the Sunnah &#8211; and forbidding evil &#8211; bid&#8217;ah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) described these people of truth, these people of strangeness in his saying: <strong>Glad tidings is for the strangers. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">He was asked: Who are the strangers? He (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>They are a righteous people amongst many evil people. Those who disobey them will be more than those who obey them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">So these are the strangers. The sahaba (radiallaahu &#8216;anhum) were like this. As was indicated by the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) in his saying: <strong>Islaam began as strange, and it will return strange as it began. So glad tidings to the strangers.</strong> [Saheeh Muslim, no. 145] He was asked: Who are the strangers? He (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>They are a righteous people amongst many evil people. Those who disobey them will be more than those who obey them. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Obey them in what?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Meaning those who obey them in their call to the Sunnah and clarifying the truth and seeking to kill off &#8211; refute &#8211; bid&#8217;ah and falsehood.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>Whoever revives a Sunnah from my Sunnah, and the people act upon it, then for him will be the reward for all those who act on it.</strong> [Ibn Majah]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">This is the Sunni who commands the Sunnah &#8211; commands the good &#8211; and forbids the evil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Whoever revives a Sunnah &#8211; from the Prophet&#8217;s Manhaj, his path &#8211; and calls to the Sunnah, and the people act on it, so he receives the reward of all those who act on it without their reward reducing. This Sunni is the one who enjoins the good and forbids the evil. And this is a bounty from Allaah, Who bestows this upon whomever He wishes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">And opposite to this: <strong>Whoever calls to bid&#8217;ah, he will incur the sin of all those who act on it, without their sins reducing.</strong> So therefore, it is a right upon the people of the Sunnah &#8211; callers to the truth &#8211; to carry out this role, and call to the Sunnah, and strive to uproot innovation (heresies).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The true person of the Sunnah strives to uproot bid&#8217;ah. A person truly upon the Sunnah calls to the revival of the Sunnah. A person of bid&#8217;ah calls to revival of bid&#8217;ah. The Sunni encourages people upon the Sunnah and upon crushing bid&#8217;ah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">It has been reported that the Mesenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said about the strangers: <strong>They will be a people who rectify what the people have corrupted from my Sunnah after me.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Imam at-Tirmidhi said it is hasan-saheeh. [Although some scholars of hadeeth have said it is not authentic,] the meaning of this is correct. The strangers are those who rectify what people have corrupted from the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) after his passing. So, this is the description of the strangers, that they rectify what the people have corrupted. <em>Fasad</em> (corruption) comes about as a result of bid&#8217;ah &#8211; no doubt. Bid&#8217;ah results in corruption &#8211; no doubt!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">A person upon the Sunnah calls to the Sunnah, and seeks to benefit the people with what is beneficial in their beliefs, sayings, actions, and methodologies, and strives to rectify what people have corrupted.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">So these are <em>Al-Ghuraabah</em> (the strangers). They are the people of the Sunnah, those who revive the Sunnah of the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and who revive the Prophet&#8217;s Methdology, and bring back to life what has been killed from his Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Because in the hadeeth, the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>Whoever revives a Sunnah from my Sunnah.</strong>.. This being the opposite of killing off a Sunnah.** Then the Sunni comes and he revives it, brings it back to life (after learning it, he practices it, becomes firm upon it, and teaches it to others). This is their role.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">And this is why Imam Ahmad (rahimahullaah Ta&#8217;aala) said about them (those who call to the Sunnah and its revival) in the introduction of his book <strong><em>Ar-Rad &#8216;alal Jahmiyyah</em></strong> (The Refutation upon the Jahmiyyah):</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;<strong>All praise is for Allaah, Who leaves a group after the Messengers from amongst the people of knowledge who negate the changes, distortions of those who go to the extreme. And the changes of those who are ignorant. [This group] is those who call people from misguidance to guidance, and are patient upon harm. How many are they who have gone astray whom they helped bring back to guidance? How many are those [whose eeman] have been killed by Iblees whom they have helped give life to again? How beautiful is their effect upon the people, and how ugly and vile is the effect of the people upon them?</strong>&#8220;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Imam Ahmad described these callers to the Sunnah by saying about them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>How beautiful is their effect upon the people, and how ugly and vile is the effect of the people upon them?  </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">How ugly is the effect of those who raise the banner of bid&#8217;ah upon the people of the Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The people of the Sunnah are the strangers, those who repel the false distortions, the false tafseer, and refute the changes. The strangers correctly interpret and understand the Qur`an and Sunnah, and the Names and Attributes of Allaah.</strong> <strong>Those who carry this duty are the Awliyya` of Allaah, the beloved and obedient servants of Allaah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah Ta&#8217;aala) said: &#8220;<strong>Those who establish the duty of preserving what was inherited from the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) &#8211; and safeguard it from any addition or deletion &#8211; <span style="font-size:medium;">are from the greatest of the awliyya` of Allaah</span>; they are of the beloved servants of Allaah and His party.</strong>&#8220;</span></p>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif;color:#000000;">Pay attention to what Ibn Taymeeyah said: &#8220;<strong>Those who establish the duty of preserving what was inherited from the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) &#8211; and safeguard it from any addition or deletion &#8211; <span style="font-size:medium;">are from the greatest of the awliyya` of Allaah</span>; they are of the beloved servants of Allaah and His party.</strong>&#8220;</span></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">So this is the duty and role of Ahlus-Sunnah, who revive what Ahlul-Bid&#8217;ah have killed off.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">If a Sunni is asked: what do you call to?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">He [the Sunni] says: I call to the religion of the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) &#8211; reviving it and reviving the Prophet&#8217;s Sunnah &#8211; and to crushing Bid&#8217;ah so as to make the truth clear from innovations (bid&#8217;ah), distortions and false interpretations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Allaah, The Most High, consoled His Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam):</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:x-large;color:#000000;">وَلَقَدْ كُذِّبَتْ رُسُل ٌ مِنْ قَبْلِكَ فَصَبَرُوا عَلَى مَا كُذِّبُو</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Verily, (many) Messengers were denied before you (O Muhammad), but with patience they bore the denial&#8230;</strong> (Al-An&#8217;aam, ayah 34)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">This shows us that this path that the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and his companioions proceeded upon is a path that requires patience. So, oh person who carries the banner of the Sunnah, you need to remember this and that you are a stranger.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">You will have to bear harm, just as Imam Ahmad (rahimahullaah) said: <strong>How beautiful is their effect upon the people, and how ugly and vile is the effect of the people upon them?  </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The person upon this path needs sabr. <em>The people need from you that you have sabr.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Imam Ibnul Qayyim (rahimahullaah) said: &#8220;<strong>Whoever proceeds upon the Straight Path that the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and his companions were upon, let him make himself get used to trouble from the ignoramuses and Ahlul-Bid&#8217;ah, such as them belittling him, attacking him, warning against him</strong>.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">This is the path of the <em>ghuraba</em>, the strangers, Ahlus-Sunnah, those who want to revive what the people kill off from the Manhaj of Ahlus-Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">So you need to have <em>sabr</em> upon that. You will receive attacks from Ahlul Bid&#8217;ah, which is normal that it will happen, just as Imam Ahmad, Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibnul Qayyim (rahimahumullaah) said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>Ahead of you there lie days of patience, during which being patient will be like grasping a hot coal&#8230; </strong>***</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Meaning the one who clings to the Sunnah, the methodology of the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and his companions (radiallaahu &#8216;anhum).</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>From the </strong><strong>Noble </strong><strong>Qur’aan</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>Subhanahu wa Ta’ala</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَٱلسَّٰبِقُونَ ٱلۡأَوَّلُونَ مِنَ ٱلۡمُهَٰجِرِينَ وَٱلۡأَنصَارِ وَٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّبَعُوهُم بِإِحۡسَٰنٖ رَّضِيَ ٱللَّهُ عَنۡهُمۡ وَرَضُواْ عَنۡهُ وَأَعَدَّ لَهُمۡ جَنَّٰتٖ تَجۡرِي تَحۡتَهَا ٱلۡأَنۡهَٰرُ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَدٗاۚ ذَٰلِكَ ٱلۡفَوۡزُ ٱلۡعَظِيمُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>&lt;&lt;</strong> And the first to embrace Islam of the <em>Muhajirun</em> (those who migrated from Makkah to Al-Madinah) and the <em>Ansar</em> (the citizens of Al-Madinah who helped and gave aid to the <em>Muhajiroon</em>) and also those who followed them exactly (in Faith). Allaah is well pleased with them, as they are well pleased with Him. He has prepared for them Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise), to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme success.  <strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘’</strong><strong>Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani (d.1420A.H) </strong><strong><em>-Rahimullaah- </em></strong><strong>said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed this noble <em>Ayaah</em> is the foundation from where it is necessary for every Muslim to spring forward from to get to know the <em>Dawa’</em> which some of the scholars, past and present have defined as the ‘<em>Dawatus</em>&#8211;<em>Salafeeyah’</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever truly wants to return to the Book and the Sunnah then it is necessary for that person to return to what the Companions of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>were upon, and the <em>Ta’abeen</em> (the successors of the Companions) and the successors of the <em>Ta’abeen</em>.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>Subhanahu</em> <em>wa</em> <em>Ta’ala</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَمَن يُشَاقِقِ ٱلرَّسُولَ مِنۢ بَعۡدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ ٱلۡهُدَىٰ وَيَتَّبِعۡ غَيۡرَ سَبِيلِ ٱلۡمُؤۡمِنِينَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"> نُوَلِّهِۦ مَا تَوَلَّىٰ وَنُصۡلِهِۦ جَهَنَّمَۖ وَسَآءَتۡ مَصِيرًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>&lt;&lt;</strong> And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him <strong>and follows other than the way of the believers</strong> &#8211; We will give him what he has taken and drive him into Hell, and evil it is as a destination. <strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘’</strong><strong>Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani (d.1420A.H) </strong><strong><em>-Rahimullaah- </em></strong><strong>commented saying</strong><strong>: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Anybody who intends to be from the <em>Firqat</em> <em>an</em>&#8211;<em>Najjeeyha</em> (the saved sect)[4] then it is necessary for that person to ascribe himself to the actions of what these people were upon, the Companions and the <em>Ta’abeen</em> and they are the <em>Salaf</em> <em>as</em>&#8211;<em>Salih</em> whom we follow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This issue, which is the obligation of following the <em>Salaf</em> <em>as</em>&#8211;<em>Salih</em> is not an innovated, new matter but rather this is an obligatory matter which has been indicated to, rather it has been mentioned clearly for example in the statement of Allaah – <em>Tabarak</em> <em>wa</em> <em>Ta’ala</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَمَن يُشَاقِقِ ٱلرَّسُولَ مِنۢ بَعۡدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ ٱلۡهُدَىٰ وَيَتَّبِعۡ غَيۡرَ سَبِيلِ ٱلۡمُؤۡمِنِينَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"> نُوَلِّهِۦ مَا تَوَلَّىٰ وَنُصۡلِهِۦ جَهَنَّمَۖ وَسَآءَتۡ مَصِيرًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>&lt;&lt;</strong> And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him <strong>and follows other than the way of the believers</strong> &#8211; We will give him what he has taken and drive him into Hell, and evil it is as a destination. <strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Allaah mentioned in this <em>Ayaah</em> a severe warning against opposing the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>and contending with him then Allaah linked that by saying: <strong>&lt;&lt;</strong> and follows other than the way of the believers<strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> and there is no doubt that the believers here, are those about whom Allaah –<em>Tabaraka</em> <em>wa</em> <em>Ta’ala</em>&#8211; warns the people from amongst the Muslims from opposing the path of the believers, there is no doubt that the believers are those whom were mentioned in the previous <em>Ayaah</em> from the <em>Muhajreen</em> and <em>Ansaar</em>, and those who followed them in goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Allaah was pleased with them and they were pleased with their Lord. That path of the believers is the scale and measurement which distinguishes between the Muslim who ascribes himself by speech to the Book and the Sunnah, and then perhaps he opposes the Book and the Sunnah by not returning to that perfection, which prevents opposing the Book and the Sunnah and that is none other than adhering to what the Companions of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> were upon.’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>Who were the <em>Salaf</em>?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘’</strong><strong>Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani (d.1420A.H) </strong><strong><em>-Rahimullaah-</em></strong><strong> said: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The <em>Salaf</em> <em>as</em>&#8211;<em>Salih</em> includes the three generations about whom the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>testified regarding their goodness in a Hadeeth whose authenticity is agreed upon.  Rather this Hadeeth has reached the level of <em>Mutawwatir</em> due its many chains in the <em>Saheeh</em> of Muslim and other than them from a great deal of the Companions, that the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said:</p>
<p dir="RTL" style="text-align:justify;" align="center">خير الناس قرني ثم الذين يلونهم ثم الذين يلونهم ثم الذين يلونهم .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The best people are my generation then those who will come after them and then those after them&#8230;&#8230;.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the three generations whose goodness has been testified are the ones who are intended by being the <em>Salaf</em> <em>as</em>&#8211;<em>Salih</em>.’[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘’Al-Qalshaani said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The <em>Salaf</em> <em>as</em>&#8211;<em>Salih</em> were the first generations deeply rooted upon knowledge, guided with the guidance of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, preservers of his Sunnah, Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> chose them for the companionship of his Prophet. Allaah selected them to establish His <em>Deen</em> and was pleased with them to be the Imams of the <em>Ummah</em>, and they rightfully fought <em>Jihad </em>in the path of Allaah, they exerted themselves in advising the <em>Ummah </em>and benefiting them and they sacrificed themselves for the pleasure of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah praised them in His Book by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">مُّحَمَّدٞ رَّسُولُ ٱللَّهِۚ وَٱلَّذِينَ مَعَهُۥٓ أَشِدَّآءُ عَلَى ٱلۡكُفَّارِ رُحَمَآءُ بَيۡنَهُمۡۖ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&lt;&lt;</strong> Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah; and those with him are forceful against the disbelievers, merciful among themselves. &gt;&gt;[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">لِلۡفُقَرَآءِ ٱلۡمُهَٰجِرِينَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُخۡرِجُواْ مِن دِيَٰرِهِمۡ وَأَمۡوَٰلِهِمۡ يَبۡتَغُونَ فَضۡلٗا مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَرِضۡوَٰنٗا وَيَنصُرُونَ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥٓۚ أُوْلَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلصَّٰدِقُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&lt;&lt;</strong> For the poor emigrants who were expelled from their homes and their properties, seeking bounty from Allaah and [His] approval and supporting Allaah and His Messenger, [there is also a share]. Those are the truthful. &gt;&gt; [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> mentioned the <em>Muhajirun</em> and the <em>Ansar</em> in the <em>Ayaat</em>, then he praised their followers, and He was pleased with those who came after them for following them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah promised those who opposed the <em>Salaf</em> and those who followed other than their way with punishment, Allaah said:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘’As-Safaarini (d. 1188 A.H) said: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The meaning of the <em>Madhab</em> of the <em>Salaf</em> is that which the noble Companions <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhum</em><em>&#8211;</em> were upon and the eminent ones from the <em>Taba’een</em> who followed the Companions in goodness, and those that followed them, and the Imams of the <em>Deen</em> from those who were testified as being Imams. Their great status was known from the <em>Deen</em>, and the people have accepted their speech generation after generation, without them having been accused of <em>Bida’</em>, or having become famous with a title which is not acceptable, the likes of the <em>Khawarij</em>, <em>Rawafid</em>, <em>Qadareeyah</em>, <em>Murji’ah</em>, <em>Jabareeyah</em>, <em>Jahmaeeyah</em>, <em>Mu’atazilah</em>, <em>Karameeyah</em> and those similar to them.’[13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘’Muhammad bin Ahmad as-Safaarini (d. 1188 A.H) also said: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The indication to the <em>Madhab</em> of the <em>Salaf</em> and a clarification of its reality, and that the <em>Madhab</em> of the <em>Salaf</em> is safer out of the other <em>Madhahib</em>[14], it is more knowledgeable and wiser, and they are the first to embrace Islam of the <em>Muhajirun</em> (those who migrated from Makkah to Al-Madinah) and the <em>Ansar</em> (the citizens of Al-Madinah who helped and gave aid to the <em>Muhajirun</em>). Likewise the rest of the Companions of the chosen Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>and those who followed them in goodness, and the Imams of guidance, they are those upon whom the Muslims agree regarding their guidance, their understanding, and their precedence, and taking them as an example and to follow them, and follow their way, and take the same methodology as them. Indeed Allaah –<em>Subhana</em> <em>wa</em> <em>Ta’ala</em>&#8211; sent His Prophet, His beloved and His Messenger Muhammad <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> with guidance and the true <em>Deen</em>, to take the people out of darkness to light by the permission of their Lord to the praiseworthy, noble path. Allaah testified for him that He Himself sent the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> as a caller to Allaah with His permission and a guiding light and with His command, Allaah said:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>The Necessity of the Title ‘<em>Salafeeyah’</em> to Distinguish from <em>Ahl</em>&#8211;<em>ul</em>&#8211;<em>Bida’</em>   </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘’</strong><strong>Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani (d.1420A.H) </strong><strong><em>-Rahimullaah- </em></strong><strong>said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed all the sects, no matter how close or how far they are from the Book and the Sunnah, it is not possible for any one of them to say, ‘I am upon the <em>Manhaj</em> of the <em>Salaf</em>  -due to an excellence from Allaah – <em>Azza</em> <em>wa</em> <em>Jal</em> – except for those who embody the <em>Manhaj</em> of the <em>Salaf</em> <em>as</em>&#8211;<em>Salih</em> in their <em>Dawa’</em>, <em>Manhaj</em> and manners. . .’[26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘’</strong><strong>Ubayd bin Abdullaah al- Jabiree said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘So you do not find a <em>Khalafee</em> (one who opposes <em>Salafeeyah</em>), especially from those who ascribe themselves to the modern day <em>Dawa’</em> groups, except that he hates the ascription to <em>Salafeeyah</em>.  Because <em>Salafeeyah</em> is not just an ascription, rather <em>Salafeeyah</em> is singling out pure sincerity for Allaah and singling out following the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.’[27]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘’</strong><strong>Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani (d.1420A.H) </strong><strong><em>-Rahimullaah- </em></strong><strong>was asked:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Why don’t the <em>Salafeeyoon</em> leave these titles?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> ‘’</strong><strong>Al-Albaani </strong><strong><em>-Rahimullaah- </em></strong><strong>answered:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If you leave off the ascription to so and so <em>Hizb</em> (party), and to such and such <em>Hizb</em>, and leave off the ascription to such and such <em>Madhab</em> (school of thought) then at that time we can say we are Muslims.  As for these names then they exemplify divisions in this <em>Ummah</em> due to current ideologies and biasness to <em>Madhahib</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, there is nothing wrong, if we say: we will gather all these ascriptions into one ascription and this is not possible for anyone from those people (those who follow <em>Madhahib</em> and <em>Ahazaab</em>[28]) – if they have knowledge of the truth that they can dispute whether that the <em>Dawat</em>&#8211;<em>us</em>&#8211;<em>Salafeeyah</em> is the true <em>Dawa’</em> or not, and as proof for this we use the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَمَن يُشَاقِقِ ٱلرَّسُولَ مِنۢ بَعۡدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ ٱلۡهُدَىٰ وَيَتَّبِعۡ غَيۡرَ سَبِيلِ ٱلۡمُؤۡمِنِينَ</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>Is Not Using the Title ‘<em>Salafeeyah</em>’ Praising Oneself?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘’</strong><strong>Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani (d.1420A.H) </strong><strong><em>-Rahimullaah- </em></strong><strong>said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘He does not understand the meaning of ‘<em>Salafeeyah</em>’ the one who says that this is praising oneself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Salafeeyah</em> means the correct Islaam, so the one who says: ‘I am a Muslim’ or ‘my <em>Deen</em> is Islaam’ is just like the one who says: ‘I am a <em>Salafi</em>&#8230;.’[31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘’</strong><strong>Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani (d.1420A.H) </strong><strong><em>-Rahimullaah- </em></strong><strong>said:</strong> <strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<em>Dawatu</em>&#8211; <em>Salafeeyah</em> wages war against <em>al</em>&#8211;<em>Hizbeeyah</em> (partisanship) in all its different forms.  The reason is very clear, <em>Dawatus</em> – <em>Salafeeyah</em> affiliates to a infallible individual, and he is the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>, therefore, whosoever deviates away from these people (The <em>Salaf</em>) then we do not call him a <em>Salafi</em>.’[32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘’Muhammad bin Salih al-Uthaymeen (d.1421 A.H.) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Is it possible to be upon <em>Salafeeyah</em> in our modern times? Yes it is possible, we say that it is <em>Salafeeyah</em> in <em>Aqeedah</em>, even though it is not <em>Salafeeyah</em> as a time period, because the <em>Salaf</em> have preceded in time, however <em>Salafeeyah</em> are those who are upon the <em>Salafeeyah</em> ‘<em>Aqeedah</em>, ‘<em>Aqeedah</em> and action in the current time, and they are in respect to those after them, the <em>Salaf</em>.’[33]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>Why the Ascription of <em>Salafeeyah</em>? Is it a call to <em>Hizbeeyah</em>?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘’</strong><strong>Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani (d.1420A.H) </strong><strong><em>-Rahimullaah- </em></strong><strong>was </strong><strong>asked: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Why the ascription of <em>Salafeeyah</em>? Is it a call to <em>Hizbeeyah</em>, or a sect, or <em>Madhab</em>, or is it a new group in Islaam?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed the word ‘<em>as-Salaf’</em> is well known in the Arabic language, and in the <em>Sharia’</em>, and what is important to us here is the research from the <em>Sharia’</em> point of view.  It has been authentically reported from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> that he said to Sayyidah Fatima <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> during the illness from which he died:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">فاتقي الله ، واصبري ، فإنه نعم السلف أنا لك</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Fear Allaah and be patient, for indeed <strong>I am a blessed <em>Salaf</em> for you</strong>.[34]’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars have used this word ‘<em>as</em>&#8211;<em>Salaf’</em> a lot, and it has been used so much more than can be enumerated, it is sufficient for us to use one example, and that is what we need to fight against <em>Bida’</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">كل خير في إتباع  من  سلف  وكل  شر في إتباع  من  خلف</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Every good is in the following of the <em>Salaf</em> * and every evil is in the innovations of the <em>Khalaf</em></strong><strong>[35]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, there are those who claim to have knowledge who reject this ascription, claiming that it does not have any foundation, so they say: it is not allowed for a Muslim to say ‘I am a <em>Salafi’</em>.  It is as if they say: it is not allowed for a Muslim to say: ‘I follow the <em>Salaf</em> <em>as</em>&#8211;<em>Salih</em> of what they are upon of ‘<em>Aqeedah</em>, worship and manners!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that this type of rejection – if this is what they mean – necessitates being free from the correct Islaam which our <em>Salaf</em> <em>as</em>&#8211;<em>Salih</em> were upon, and at the head of them is the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>as is indicated in the <em>Mutawatir</em> Hadeeth which is in Bukhari, Muslim and in other books, from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The best people are my generation then those who will come after them and then those after them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore <strong>it is not allowed for the Muslim to free himself from the ascription to the <em>Salaf</em> <em>as</em>&#8211;<em>Salih</em></strong>, whereas if a Muslim freed himself from any other ascription, then it would not be possible for anyone from the people of knowledge to ascribe them to <em>Kufr</em> or <em>Fasooq</em> (openly sinning)[36].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this person who rejects this ascription, don’t you see that he himself ascribes to a <em>Madhab</em> from the <em>Madhahib</em>?! Whether this <em>Madhab</em> was connected to ‘<em>Aqeedah</em> or to <em>Fiqh</em>?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he is either an <em>Ashaari</em> or a <em>Matroodi</em>, or either he is from the <em>Ahl</em>&#8211;<em>ul</em>&#8211;<em>Hadeeth</em>, or <em>Hanafi</em>, or <em>Shafia’i</em>, or <em>Maliki</em>, or <em>Hanbali</em> from those who enter into the title of <em>Ahl</em>&#8211;<em>ul</em>&#8211;<em>Sunnah</em> <em>wal</em> <em>Jammah</em>. Even though he who ascribes to the <em>Ashaari</em> <em>Madhab</em> or to the four <em>Madhahib</em> then he ascribes to people who are without doubt not infallible, even though there are some from those scholars who are probably on the correct way, however I wish they had rejected the likes of these ascriptions to individuals who are not infallible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who ascribes to the <em>Salaf</em> <em>as</em>&#8211;<em>Salih</em>, then he ascribes to that which is in general infallible, and indeed the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> mentioned that from the signs of the ‘<em>Firqat</em> <em>an</em>&#8211;<em>Najeeha’</em> is that they adhere to that which the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> was upon and what the Companions were upon, so whoever adhered to it is with certainty upon guidance from his Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Without doubt the clear, manifest, distinguished, evident proof of this title and ascription, which is to say: I am a Muslim upon the Book and the Sunnah and upon the methodology of our <em>Salaf</em> <em>as</em>&#8211;<em>Salih</em>, and that is to summarise it by saying: ‘I am a <em>Salafi’</em>.’[37]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>The Ascription to Other <em>Jamaa’aat</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ascription to Naqshbandeeyah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This <em>Tareeqa</em> (way) ascribes itself to Muhammad Baha-uddeen Shah Naqshband.  The ascription for this <em>Tareeqa</em>[38] is <strong>from his name</strong> <strong>and it has became known with that</strong>. He was born in the village of Bukhara (717 – 791 A.H)’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘He was given the title of Naqshband because of a print of the word ‘Allaah’ engraved upon the front of his heart, due to a lot of remembrance of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been said he was called Naqshband, because the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> placed his noble palm on the heart of shaykh Muhammad Baha-uddeen al-Awaysee Naqshband, so it became engraved on his heart.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Ahmad al-Farooqi as-Sarhindi (1034 A.H.) revived and spread the <em>Tareeqa</em> in India.’[39]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The definition of ‘Dar al-Uloom ad-Deobandeeyah’ according to them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Dar al-Uloom is Muslim in their religion, of the <em>Ahl</em>&#8211;<em>ul</em>&#8211;<em>Sunnah</em> <em>wal</em> <em>Jammah</em> sect, of a Hanafi <em>Madhab</em>, drinking hole is Soofeeyah, Matroodeeyah Ashaareeyah in philosophy, Chishteeyah in methodology, rather it gathers all the different succession of groups, Wali al-illaheyya in thought, Qasameeyah in principle, Rasheedeeyah as a subdivision, Deobandeeyah in ascription’[40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘’Sayyid Taalib ar-Rahman said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘ad-Deobandeeyah is a group from the Hanafis in the Indian Sub-continent and other places.  They follow the path of the Deoband University and <strong>their ascription is to this University</strong>, and that was to distinguish from their brothers ‘the Brailaweeyah’ one of the sects of the Hanafis, who ascribe to a <em>Imam</em> of <em>Bida’</em>, Ahmad Rida Khan al-Brialweeyah, who was born in the city of ‘Brieelee’ a city in the state of Uttra Pardesh in India in the year 1272 A.H. and died in the year 1340 A.H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Deoband’ is a town in the state of Uttra Pardesh it achieved its fame due to the famous Islamic University called ‘Dar al-Uloom’ which was founded in 1283 A.H. and this University without doubt is regarded as a pride and honour for that town.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fundamental aim of establishing this University was to support the Hanafi <em>Madhab</em> (School of thought) and spreading it, <strong>and to subjugate the Prophetic Sunnah and to make the Sunnah follow the Hanafi <em>Fiqh</em></strong>, and there is no exaggeration in the reality of this point, since even the senior scholars of Deoband have acknowledged this.’[41]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘’Muhammad Yusuf al-Banoori one of the leaders of the Deoband said explaining the way of the Deoband and their <em>Madhab</em>:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The way of the Deoband which their senior scholars are upon is the affirmation of the leadership of the <em>Faqeeh</em> of the <em>Ummah</em>, the Imam Abu Hanifah with respect to his <em>Fiqh</em> and his <em>Ijtihad</em> which has a lofty status in the pure <em>Sharia’</em> after the noble Prophetic Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is necessary to have the sciences of Soofeeyah and sciences of purification of the hearts which is transmitted by its people, and it needs to be blended with the <em>Sharia’</em> in a correct way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They acknowledge the magnificence of Ibn Taymeeyah’s[42] status but at the same time they acknowledge the greatest Shaykh Muhiddeen ibn Arabi[43] with his book ‘Kamallat’.  So we have <em>Taqleed</em> of the Imam Abu Hanifah, and follow the Prophetic Ahadeeth along with the sciences of the Soofeeyah, and what is made up of this blend of three is the magnificent <em>Madhab</em>[44], which is none other than the <em>Madhab</em> of the sect Deobandeeyah.’[45]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ascription to Jama’at Tableegh</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Founder of Jama’at Tableegh</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘’Abdullaah bin Mubarak al-Qahtani said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Muhammad Ilyaas al-Kandalawi is regarded as the founder of the Tableeghi sect and he was the one who made the fundamental principles for the sect. Muhammad Ilyaas took it in turn and acquired it from Sa’eed an-Nursi who was called Badeea’ az-Zaman an-Nursi[46] (1293 A.H. – 1379 A.H.) in Turkey. So the foundation of the ideology was from Turkey, and it grew and was brought up and implemented and propelled from India.’[47] [48]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ascription to Soofeeyah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘’Salih bin Fawzan al-Fawzan was asked: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘What is the ruling of ascribing to the Soofi <em>Madhab</em>, and do we make <em>Takfeer</em> (excommunication) of the Soofeeyah?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It is not allowed to ascribe to an innovated <em>Madhab</em> of the Soofeeyah, or other than the Soofeeyah. It is not allowed for the Muslim to follow the <em>Mubtadia’</em> (the innovators) whether from the Soofeeyah or other than the Soofeeyah, but rather he has to follow the <em>Madhab</em> of the <em>Ahl</em>&#8211;<em>ul</em>&#8211;<em>Sunnah</em>.  It is not possible for the Muslim to follow the <em>Madhab</em> of <em>Ahl</em>&#8211;<em>ul</em>&#8211;<em>Sunnah</em> except if he learns and knows the <em>Madhab</em> of <em>Ahl</em>&#8211;<em>ul</em>&#8211;<em>Sunnah</em> and knows the <em>Madhaahib</em> of the <em>Mubtadia’</em>, and this is not possible except with knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the ignorant person, then it is not possible for him to keep away from the <em>Madhaahib</em> of the <em>Mubtadia’</em> because he does not know who they are, and perhaps he deems them as being appropriate and thinks that they are good, <strong>therefore ignorance is corruption and an illness.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Soofeeyah are not all of the same grades, there are those from them who reach to the level of Shirk, and from them are those who are only <em>Mubtadia’</em>, and from them there is the one who is a <em>Mushrik</em>, who makes <em>Dua’</em> to the dead rather than to Allaah, and who seeks aid from graves, and who makes <em>Dua’</em> to his Shaykhs and believes that they can benefit him or harm him, and that they control the universe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Soofeeyah are of different types, they are not just one type.  Some of them are just <em>Mubtadia’</em>, and some of them are <em>Mushrikoon</em>.  Some of them are apostates, and they are the <em>Ahl</em>&#8211;<em>ul</em>&#8211;<em>Wahdatul</em>&#8211;<em>Wajood</em> (those who believe in unity of existence) those who are upon the <em>Madhab</em> of al-Hallaj, Ibn Arabi, Ibn Saba’een and Talmasaani, and they are the ones who are extremists in their <em>Kufr</em> (disbelief) of the people on this earth the people of <em>Wahdatul</em>&#8211;<em>Wajood</em> (those who believe in unity of existence). Likewise are the <em>Mushrikoon</em> who supplicate to other than Allaah, were they supplicate to their Shaykhs and their chiefs, they also supplicate to the dead, and they turn for help to graves, and this is <em>Shirk</em>.’[49]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>The Stance of the Scholars of <em>Ahl</em>&#8211;<em>ul</em>&#8211;<em>Sunnah</em> against the Ascription to the <em>Soofi</em> paths</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Fatwa</em> of ‘Lajna Daeema lilbahooth al-Ilmeeyah wal-Iftaa’[50]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The question:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a (Soofee path) way which is ascribed to Shaykh Abdul Qadir and Abul-Hasan ash-Shaadhlee, is there a problem if a person joins it and ascribes himself to it and is it <em>Sunnah</em> or <em>Bida’</em>?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Hadeeth collected by Abu Dawood and other than him from the collectors of the <em>Sunnan</em> from Al-Irbadh bin Sariah who said: the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> gave us a sermon by which our hearts were filled with fear and tears came to our eyes. We said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah, it is as though this is a farewell sermon, so advise us.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">أوصيكم بتقوى الله ، والسمع والطاعة ، وإن تأمّر عليكم عبد ؛ فإنه من يعش منكم فسيرى اختلافا كثيرا ، فعليكم بسنتي وسنة الخلفاء الراشدين المهديين ، عضّوا عليها بالنواجذ ، وإياكم ومحدثات الأمور ، فإن كل بدعة ضلالة</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I advise you to fear Allaah and to hear and obey even if a slave becomes your leader. Verily he among you who lives [long] will see great differences, so you must keep to my Sunnah and to the Sunnah of the rightly-guided <em>Khulafah</em> &#8211; cling to them stubbornly. Beware of newly invented matters, for every invented matter is an innovation and every innovation is a going astray.’[51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> mentioned that there will occur many differences in his <em>Ummah</em>, and they will branch off into paths and methodologies, and there will occur many <em>Bida’</em> and superstitions amongst them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> ordered the Muslims to adhere to the Book of Allaah and to hold onto his Sunnah and to bite onto it with the molar teeth, and warn them against dividing up and differences, and following <em>Bida’</em> and superstitions because it is misguidance and straying which causes the one who follows these paths to separate away from the Path of Allaah, so Allaah advised them with what He advised His slaves with the saying of Allaah <em>Subhanahu</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَٱعۡتَصِمُواْ بِحَبۡلِ ٱللَّهِ جَمِيعٗا وَلَا تَفَرَّقُواْۚ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> &lt;&lt; And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided. &gt;&gt;[52]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and the saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَأَنَّ هَٰذَا صِرَٰطِي مُسۡتَقِيمٗا فَٱتَّبِعُوهُۖ وَلَا تَتَّبِعُواْ ٱلسُّبُلَ<br />
فَتَفَرَّقَ بِكُمۡ عَن سَبِيلِهِۦۚ ذَٰلِكُمۡ وَصَّىٰكُم بِهِۦ لَعَلَّكُمۡ تَتَّقُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <strong>&lt;&lt;</strong> And verily, this is my Straight Path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His Path. This He has ordained for you that you may become <em>Al-Muttaqun</em> (the pious)&gt;&gt;[53].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we advise you with the advice of Allaah and the advice of His Messenger, and we advise you to adhere to the <em>Manhaj</em> of <em>Ahl</em>&#8211;<em>ul</em>&#8211;<em>Sunnah</em> <em>wal</em>&#8211;<em>Jama’</em>, and we warn you against what the people of these <em>Soofi</em> paths who innovated <em>Soofeeyah</em> and innovated supplications and remembrance which is not legislated and supplications which contain Shirk with Allaah or that which leads towards Shirk, like seeking refuge with other than Allaah, remembering Allaah with single names (i.e. like saying ‘<em>Allaah</em> <em>hu’</em> etc.), and remembering Allaah using the word ‘<em>Aah’</em> which is not from His –<em>Subhanahu</em>– Names, and how they seek closeness to their Shaykhs by making <em>Dua’</em> through them, and they believe that their Shaykhs are spies of the hearts and they know what will occur in the future. Their remembrance of Allaah as a collective remembrance with one unison voice in gatherings while swaying &amp; dancing around with <em>An</em>&#8211;<em>Nasheed</em> (musical songs), along with other things which are not known from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.’[54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his Family, his Companions and all those who  follow his guidance</strong></p>

<p>[42] This is their claim but in reality they oppose Ibn Taymeeyah’s Aqeedah, Manhaj &amp; his works.</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>[43] Some statements about Ibn Arabi:</p>
<p>Shaykh ul-Islaam Ahmad bin AbdulHaleem Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>said:</p>
<p>‘…these Philosophers perhaps thought that [Angel] Jibra’eel is an imaginary thought which formed itself in the Prophet’s <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> soul, and imagination follows the intellect. Then came along the Mulahidah ([Atheists] &#8211; Those who either reject the existence of Allaah or reject the resurrection), who associated and participated with these Mulahidah al-Mutafalsifah ([Atheistic philosophers] – those who combine the Sharia’ with Greek Philosophy), and they claimed that they were the ‘Awaliyaa (Friends) of Allaah, and that the ‘Awaliyaa of Allaah are better than the Prophets of Allaah, and that they take from Allaah without having an intermediary [like Angel Jibra’eel] like Ibn ‘Arabi…. Indeed Ibn ‘Arabi and his likes, even if they claim to be from the Soofeeyah, but they are from the Soofeeyah Mulahidah al-Mutafalsifah and they are not from the Soofeeyah people of knowledge, let alone being from the Mushaykh of the people of the Book and the Sunnah…’ [Fatawa 11/232]</p>
<p>Ibn Taymeeyah also said:</p>
<p>‘… and the issue with the Mulahidah al-Mutasoweefah  ([Atheistic Soofees] &#8211; Those who either reject the existence of Allaah or reject the resurrection) like Ibn ‘Arabi and his likes – was such that they reached to the level were they regarded everything in existence as one. So they regarded the existence of the Creator is the actual existence of the creation [i.e. the Creator and the creation are one and the same thing], and this is cancelling out the Creator.’ [Dura Ta’arad 5/4]</p>
<p>Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Uthmaan ad-Dhahabi (d.748 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p>‘Indeed the one who ponders over the statements of Ibn ‘Arabi in his book ‘Fasoos’ is one of two people; either from the al-Iteehaadeeyah (those who believe that Allaah is a part of His creation, in union with His creation) inwardly, or from those who truly believe in Allaah and regard [Ibn ‘Arabi &amp; his likes] this sect to be from the most extreme in disbelief.’ [Meezan al-I’tidaal 3/659]</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Shaykh Saalih ibn Abdul-Azeez Aal us-Shaykh<br />
</strong><strong>Shaykh Saalih bin Fawzaan al-Fawzaan</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="715" height="403" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XiqNApZ2AHM?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1) Shaykh Saalih ibn Abdul-Azeez Aal us-Shaykh:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">So <em>Ahlus-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah</em>, this word was coined at the end of the second generation after <em>Hijri</em> by the followers of the narrations [<em>Aathaar</em>], and the opponents to the various sects that left the way of the companions [<em>Sahaabah</em>] and their students [<em>Taabi&#8217;een</em>].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">And the first to use it [terminology] were some of the teachers of Al Bukharee – <em>rahimahumuAllaah</em> – and they joined the two words <strong>as-Sunnah</strong> and <strong>al-Jamaa’ah</strong> because there are those who call towards following <em>Sunnah</em> but they might not be with the <em>Jamaa’ah</em>. And there are those who call towards <em>Jamaa’ah</em> without following the <em>Sunnah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">So the differentiation of the way of the people of <em>Hadeeth</em> and narrations [<em>Athar</em>] and the followers of the pious predecessors [<em>Salaf-us-Saalih</em>] is based upon two things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><em>“Following the Sunnah and the Jamaa’ah”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">And each from both of these is bound to the other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">So following the <em>Sunnah</em> is following the <em>Jamaa’ah</em> and following the <em>Jamaa’ah</em> is following the <em>Sunnah</em>; because it has been authentically reported from the Prophet – <em>sall-Allaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em> – the narration which is in the <em>‘Sunan’</em>, that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>“And this nation will split into seventy three sects. All of them are in the hell fire except one and that is the Jamaa’ah.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">And [speech unclear] sects in the hell fire – meaning – that are promised with entering into the hell fire, and the victorious is only one sect and that is the <em>Jamaa’ah</em>. And they are the followers of the <em>Sunnah</em>, exemplifying the saying of the Prophet – <em>sall-Allaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>“Upon you is my Sunnah and Sunnah of the rightly guided Caliphs, those who guide to righteousness, after me. Hold on to it and bite upon it with your molars”</strong> – The Hadeeth</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">(Translation source: <a href="http://www.islaam.ae" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.islaam.ae</a>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <strong>2) Shaykh Saalih bin Fawzaan al-Fawzaan</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><em>Question:</em> Is Salafiyyah a hizb (party) amongst the parties? And is ascribing to them (the Salafis) a blameworthy thing?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><em>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan:</em> As-Salafiyyah is the Saved Sect and they are Ahl us-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah. It is not a hizb (party) from amongst the various parties, those which are called parties today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">Rather they are the Jamaa’ah, the Jamaa’ah upon the Sunnah and upon the Deen (Religion). They are Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">The Prophet – Sallallaahu alayhe wa sallam – said, “There will not cease to be a group from my Ummah (nation) manifest and upon the truth, not being harmed by those who forsake them neither by those who oppose them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">And he – Sallallaahu alayhe wa sallam – also said, “And this Ummah will split into seventy-three sects, all of them in the Hell-Fire except one.” They said, “Which one is this O Messenger of Allaah?” He replied, “They are those who are upon what I and my companions are upon today.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">Hence, Salafiyyah is a group of people (the Salafis) upon the madhab of the Salaf, upon what the Messenger – Sallallaahu alayhe wa sallam – and his companions were upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">And it is not a hizb from amongst the contemporary groups present today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">Rather it is the very old Jamaa’ah, from the time of the Messenger – Sallallaahu alayhe wa sallam – which inherits (this way) and continues, and which never ceases to be upon the manifest truth until the establishment of the Hour, as he (Sallallaahu alayhe wa sallam) has informed us.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Scholar</strong>: Imâm Muhammad Nâsir-ud-Dîn al-Albânî<br />
<strong>Source:</strong> Silsilat-ul-Hudâ wan-Nûr (280)<br />
aFatwa.com</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What do you think of Salafiyyûn going out with Jamâ’at-ut-Tablîgh in order to improve their way of thinking and to teach Tawhîd and spread the Sunnah among them. Especially since they have noticed that they have changed when they have gone out with them.</span></p>
<p><strong>Shaykh al-Albânî:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That which I know about this group via some of our brothers who have been with them on their trips and outings, is that they do not accept their call towards the Qur’ân and the Sunnah. They are just as all other groups in this matter, as I have earlier indicated. They say, and awful is what they say:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><em>“Your Da’wah splits the people.”</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We agree. Our call is a true call and it differentiates between truth, falsehood, the one who is right and the one who is wrong. That is why it is no wonder that one of the names of the prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) is “al-Mufarriq” (the divider). This is something these so-called Islamic ‘callers’ are ignorant about. If these people (were to) hear this name, they would be confused. This is because they do not understand Islâm. The only purpose of the prophets and messengers and scriptures is to distinguish the truth from falsehood so that the Muslims are with the truth against the falsehood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a result thereof it is completely natural that the various Da’wahs (calls) today, which do not agree with this true methodology, do not accept an individual’s call since it will mislead them from their methodology and call that are based upon something other than the Qur’ân, Sunnah and the methodology of the Salaf as-Sâlih (pious predecessors). This is what we know of them or at least knew of them. It is possible that they have progressed a bit, which was implied in the question, when they realised that they go out for Allâh’s sake entirely confused. They are as the jews and christians who merely understand a little bit of their religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If these people are aware of their ignorance in the religion and that there is a group of Muslims who are called as Salafiyyûn, Ansâr-us-Sunnah, or Ahl-ul-Hadîth, depending upon the country even if they all have the same belief, who can teach them, then it is possible [I.e. to go out with them]. If they agree to discard their former negative methodology and accept that some Salafiyyûn participate in their trips and outings and allow them to call these confused people to the Qur’ân and Sunnah, then I deem it to be obligatory upon individual Salafiyyûn to go out with them. This however, provided that they are the ones who maintain the call and that it is a Salafî-Islâmic call and not a Salafî-Sûfî-Tablîghî-call, which has been mentioned earlier. It should namely be pure Salafiyyah. If then Jamâ’at-ut-Tablîgh, al-Ikhwân al-Muslimûn, Hizb-ut-Tahrîr and any other group accepts that Salafiyyûn call to their methodology in a clear and explicit way without any limitations or conditions, then I deem it to be obligatory upon individual Salafiyyûn to mingle with them. However, they should first remind them that they will not agree to go out with them for three days, forty days or in accordance with some other arrangement they have invented and which lacks basis in the Qur’ân and Sunnah.</p>

Translated by afatwa.com</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">Why are all of those who call towards Tawhîd called as “Wahhâbiyyah” ever since Shaykh Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhâb (rahimahullâh)? This word scares off many people from those who call towards Tawhîd.</span></p>
<p><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No, it doesn’t scare off at all. We are proud of the fact that the one who calls towards Tawhîd is called as “Wahhâbî” and all praise is due to Allâh. What is the one who calls towards Shirk (idolatry, polytheism) called then? What is he called? Jâhilî!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are proud of it. Let them then say “Wahhâbî”. They are thusly themselves witnessing that the call of Wahhâbiyyah is a call towards Tawhîd. The author of “al-Lanjah” (rahimahullâh) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“If the one who follows Ahmad is a Wahhâbî, then let the humans and Jinns witness that I am a Wahhâbî.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad here is the messenger (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam);</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“If the one who follows Ahmad is a Wahhâbî, then let the humans and Jinns witness that I am a Wahhâbî.”</em></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Scholar</strong>: Imâm Muhammad Nâsir-ud-Dîn al-Albânî<br />
<strong>Source</strong>: Silsilat-ul-Hudâ wan-Nûr (320)<br />
<strong>Reference</strong>: Darulhadith.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">They say that the call of Salafiyyah is based upon speech about the creed and Tawhîd and (it) forgets, or ignores, theoretically or practically, governance (Hâkimiyyah) and human Tawâghît who constitute their own laws next to Allâh. What do you say about this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Albânî</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We agree with this to some extent. However, we do not agree with them on removing the Tawâghît, as they call them, without first having removed the Tawâghît of their souls.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This type of speech springs from the methodology of this group. They accuse us with this accusation. We deem that it is not time for this action (I.e. to overthrow rulers). We do not deny that it is obligatory to condemn each and every one who rules by something other than that which Allâh revealed. Is there some Islâmic group today that is ready to confront the rulers who do not rule by that which Allâh revealed without having prepared with the preparation we always speak about, namely spiritual and material preparation? They are in a hurry. They think that raising the voice against these rulers is enough in order to support Islâm. However, true victory is to make them understand true Islâm and practice it as good as they can.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I consider that history repeats itself. The first Muslims only cared about understanding the call of Islâm from its source, namely Allah’s messenger (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam). They didn’t care about confronting the disbelievers and polytheists. The only exception is perhaps occasional, individual cases. But collectively, it first took place after the emigration of the prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) from Makah to al-Madînah. This type of speech is thusly known to us from far back. We have experienced this in several Islâmic countries when they declared war against the disbelieving leader who does not rule by that which Allâh revealed. This was done without the spiritual and material preparation. It only ended with setbacks in the Islâmic call in several Islâmic countries.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Scholar</strong>: Imâm Muhammad bin Sâlih bin ´Uthaymîn<br />
<strong>Source</strong>: Fatâwâ al-Haram al-Madanî (53)<br />
<strong>Reference:</strong> Darulhadith.com, Sweden<br />

<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling on ascribing to the Salaf as-Sâlih and saying that one is Salafî in ‘Aqîdah (creed)?</span></p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymîn:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory to subscribe to the Salaf since they followed that which the prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) followed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for calling oneself “Salafî” intending to establish a sect or subscribe to a sect, then we fight against the sects. We deem that the Islâmic Ummah should be one single group in accordance with the way of the prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and his companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if he means by the word “Salafi” that he is following the Salaf without intending to establish a sect that accuses dissidents to be deviant, <strong>then this is correct</strong>. We’re all Salafiyyûn! We all ask Allâh to allow us to die upon the way of the Salaf. We ask Allâh for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To establish <strong>a sect</strong> by the name “Salafî”, or some other by the name “Ikhwânî”, or a third by the name “Tablîghî” and so on is not something I deem to be allowed. Did the companions divide in this way? No. The one who says the opposite has to prove it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p><strong>The question</strong>:</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">When this person begins Ruqiyah (reciting Qur’aan upon a person as a form of treatment)  he says: ‘I am a Sunni and I am not a Salafi.’</span></p>
<p><strong>The Shaykh Answered</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for the saying: ‘I am a Sunni and I am not a Salafi.’ Then this statement is contradictory!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sunni &#8211; O you Miskeen (impoverished person), is the Salafi, and the Salafi is the Sunni. Whoever distinguishes between the two then he has distinguished between two things which resemble each other; so the Salaf are the Ahl-ul-Sunnah and the Salafeeyoon are the followers of the Sunnah, and whoever absolves himself from that then he is not a Sunni nor a Salafi!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just because some of the people claim Salafeeyah and they do not actually exemplify it, then this does not allow you to free yourself from Salafeeyah, rather it is obligatory upon you to honour yourself by ascribing yourself to the Salaf and to the Manhaj of the Salaf, since indeed ascription to that is obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahl-ul-Sunnah, the Salaf, the followers of the Salaf, the Firqat an-Najjeeyah, the Taifat-ul-Mansoorah, the Jamaa’ah, the Salafi and the Sunni, all of these mean one title: and they are the Jamaa’ah, and they are similar to those whom were upon what the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and his Companions were upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So be a serious Salafi – be a serious Salafi, just like the Salaf used to say – a Salafi ascribing to the Manhaj of the Salaf in sayings, actions and belief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I believe that whoever brags with this type of talk (‘I am a Sunni and I am not a Salafi.’) is very far from the Manhaj of the Sunni which is the Manhaj of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah give everyone the capability to obtain beneficial knowledge and righteous actions. May Allaah send prayers, peace and blessings upon our Prophet Muhammad, his Family and all his Companions.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from the Shaykh’s lesson from the ‘Explanation of ‘an-Nasihah al-Waladeeyah liAbee al-Waleed al-Bajee <em>Rahimullaah-</em>’ end of tape one.]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">الشيخ محمد بن صالح العثيمين</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhmmad ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen affirms that the Salafis are following the Hizb of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh explains that the Salafis who follow the truth, the way of the Salaf, without tahazzub (partisanship), are the party of Allaah in truth, and that it is obligatory for everyone to associate himself with it. The Shaykh also explains that none can be from this party of Allaah (of Salafiyyah) unless they actually follow the way of the Salaf in reality.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Note: The Shaykh praised the refutations of Shaykh Rabee&#8217; bin Haadee and his defending the manhaj of calling to Allaah. These matters are well-recorded and known. Thus, when the Shaykh is warning from tahazzub as occurs in other statements of his, even if it be in the name of &#8220;Salafiyyah&#8221;, then that applies to those deviants who followed other methodologies (like those of the Ikhwanis) whilst claiming to be &#8220;Salafis&#8221; and declaring others to be astray unless they join their group. This behaviour was manifest in the way of Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq and his so-called &#8220;Scientific Salafiyyah&#8221; movement, he reviled some of the major Scholars, and brought destructive false principles under the banner of Salafiyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No matter how hard people have tried to malign the Salafis who follow the way of the Salaf in aqidah and manhaj, following the scholars in that, all their attempts to use the various statements of Shaykh Ibn Uthaymin in which he warns, correctly, from falling into tahazzub in the name of Salafiyyah, have failed. This is because the very issues around which the Salafis based their criticism and warning against the opposers, were similarly spoken of and outlined by Shaykh Ibn Uthaymin by the time he passed away (rahimahullaah) and they include matters pertaining to Sayyid Qutb, Takfir of the rulers, rebellion, multiplicity of groups (jamaa&#8217;aat), false methodologies in calling to Allaah, and calling to Tawhid, demonstrations and so on. Further, Shaykh Ibn Uthaymin praised Shaykh Rabee on many occasions and explained that the only reason the opposers attack him because he spoke of some of their figureheads.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the truth is clear and only those are blind who choose to be blind, despite the matters being as clear as daylight.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Reply given by Ibn Baz to written questions posed by a Shaykh from outside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Abdul-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz to my esteemed brother, may Allah guide you to useful knowledge and to act upon it! Amen. Peace be upon you! I have received your letter dated 2/3/1394 A.H. May Allah guide you and grant you success! It included three questions about Wahhabism. Following is my answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q 1: <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>You asked about Wahhabism and whether it is a fifth Madh-hab (School of Jurisprudence) or follows one of the four Madh-habs.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The term Wahhabism is used by many people to refer to the call initiated by Imam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhab ibn Sulayman Al-Tamimy Al-Hanbaly (may Allah be merciful to him). He is called along with his followers &#8216;Wahhabis&#8217;. Every knowledgeable person must have heard about Shaykh Muhammad ibn `Abdul-Wahhab&#8217;s movement (may Allah be merciful to him). He called for pure Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah) and warned people against all forms of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship), such as supplicating to the dead, trees, rocks or the like. He (may Allah be merciful to him) followed in creedal matters the Madh-hab (School of Jurisprudence) of the Salaf (righteous predecessors) while in subsidiary matters he followed the Madh-hab of Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal Al-Shaybany (may Allah be merciful to him). This is clear in the books and Fatwas (legal opinions) of Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhab and in the books of his followers and offspring which are published. Imam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhab appeared at a time when Islam was alienated, the Arabian Peninsula and other areas were engulfed in ignorance and worshiping idols was widespread. So the Shaykh took it upon himself to strive and struggle, and devoted himself to destroying all means of misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He employed all the possible ways leading to the spread of Tawhid free from any kind of superstition. Allah, out of His Bounty, made Imam Muhammad ibn Su`ud, Prince of Al-Dir‘iyyah at that time, accept the call. Thus, the Prince, his sons, those under his authority and his followers supported the Imam, may Allah reward them, forgive them and grant their offspring success to all that pleases Him and to what sets right the affairs of His Servants! All regions of the Arabian Peninsula have lived under this righteous call to the present day. Thus, Imam Ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhab’s call was in accordance with the Qur’an and Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">Wahhabism is not a fifth Madh-hab as some ignorant and prejudiced people claim; rather, it is a call to the ‘Aqidah (creed) of Salafiyyah (those following the way of the righteous predecessors) and a way of reviving the main aspects of Islam and Tawhid which was forgotten in the Arabian Peninsula.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tirmidhi #76 records on the authority of Nawwas ibn Sam&#8217;an that the messenger of Allah (sallallahu alyhi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;Allah has set forth the following as a parable:</span></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">There is a road that leads straight to the destination. On either side of the road there is a wall in which there are open doors with curtains hanging on them. From the remote end of the road, a voice calls, &#8216;proceed straight and do not turn aside&#8217;. Whenever someone intends to lift a curtain from the door another voice calls from above. &#8216;Beware! Do not lift the curtain; otherwise you will be lured inside&#8217;. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The prophet (sallallahu alyhi wa sallaam) explained the parable by saying that the straight path is Islam. the walls are the limits imposed by Allah, the open doors are the things that He has prohibited, the voice which calls from the end of the road is the Quran and the voice which calls from above is Allah&#8217;s monitor in the heart of every believer&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was declared Hasan Gharib by Tirmidhee and sahih by Hakim #245 with Dhahabi agreeing and Al-Albani , Sahih al-Jami&#8217; #3887</p>
