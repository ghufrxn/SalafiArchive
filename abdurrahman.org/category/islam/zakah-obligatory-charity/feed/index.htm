<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 49: Point 83</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And the Zakaat is due upon gold, silver, dates, grain and cattle in accordance with what was stated by Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. S</em>o if he distributes it then that is permissible and if he hands it over to the ruler then that is permissible and Allaah knows best. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F385907090&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-obligation-of-giving-the-zakaat" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third pillar from the pillars of Islaam is the <em>Zakaat</em> and it is the constant companion of the <em>Salaat</em> (prayer) in many of the <em>aayahs</em> of the Qur&#8217;aan. And the Zakaat is a known due amount from the wealth of the rich to be given to the poor. And the types of wealth upon which the Zakaat is due are  four types:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>An-Naqdaan</strong> (the two forms of currency); gold and silver and that which can take their place with regard to paper currency.</li>
<li><strong>Baheematul An-`Aam</strong> (cattle); camels and cows and sheep.</li>
<li><strong>Al-Khaarij minal-Ard</strong> (that which grows from the earth) with regard to grains and fruits.</li>
<li><strong>Urood ut-Tijaarah</strong> (merchandise); goods which are traded in and it is merchandise, which is offered for buying and selling.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the types of wealth upon which Zakaat is due. As for everything besides these four types of wealth, then if a person wants to give in charity from it and to donate from it then that is up to him. The door to giving in charity and donation is open wide.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“<strong>So if he distributes it (the Zakaat himself) then that is permissible and if he hands it over to the ruler then that is permissible,”</strong></span> it is obligatory upon him to pay the Zakaat because of His saying, He, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَأَقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَآتُوا الزَّكَاةَ  </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And establish the prayer and give the Zakaah</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>43)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Aatu</em>; meaning give it, hand it over. So it is obligatory upon the person possessing wealth that he hands it over and he is the one responsible for it. So if the ruler requests it so that he can take charge of it then it becomes obligatory to hand it over to him because obedience to him is obligatory and in order to free the one who gives it from responsibility because the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> used to send out collectors to take the Zakaat from the owners of wealth and to distribute it to those who were deserving of it. And those who are in authority take the place of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in that regard after him. And as for if the rulers don’t demand it then the responsibility is upon the person having the wealth.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> [2]</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> As for the explanation of <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> then he said: “The Zakaat, which is due upon gold and silver is 1/40<sup>th</sup> i.e 2.5%.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>ni<u>s</u>aab</em> (limit) (if you have that limit then it’s payable); for silver is 595 grams. As for the <em>ni<u>s</u>aab</em> (limit) for gold then it is 20 <em>mithqaals</em> and a <em>mithqaal</em> is 4.23 grams. (Translator’s side point: In other words, for gold &#8211; it works out at 85 grams; if you have 85 grams or more then you have to pay Zakaat upon it).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And dates and what has their meaning such as grapes; their <em>ni<u>s</u>aab</em> is 5 <em>wasaq</em> (loads).(Translator’s side point: They mention that as being something like 653 kg).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise cereal crops such as wheat and barley and corn and millet and rice, the <em>ni<u>s</u>aab</em> for each of these is also 5 loads and 1 <em>wasaq</em>(load) is 60 <em>sa`as</em>; (60 prophetic <em>sa`as)</em>, <em>Allaahu A`lam.</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the cattle then the limits for them are well-known.</p>
<p>[2] <strong>Translator&#8217;s Sidepoint</strong> regarding the Zakah on merchandise, goods for trade</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to the 4<sup>th</sup> category of wealth i.e merchandise, goods for trade &#8211; Shaykh Fowzaan mentions here that is the view of the great majority of the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al Fowzaan</strong> said in his book <em>Al-Mulakha<u>s</u> al-Fiqhee</em>, “More than one have quoted consensus (<em>Ijmaa`)</em> of the People of Knowledge that upon goods which are traded; Zakaat is obligatory upon them, if a year has passed over them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh ul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah</strong> said: The four Imaams and the rest of the nation except for some isolated ones are agreed that it is obligatory to pay it upon the goods for trade. And you can find the rest of the speech of Shaykh ul Islaam in <em>Majmoo` al- Fataawa</em> volume 25, page 15.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the same point <strong>Imaam Ash-Shawkaanee</strong> in his book <em>Nayl al-Aw<u>t</u>aar</em>, he mentioned the same view that it’s obligatory to pay Zakaat upon the goods for trade. Then later on he changed his view in other books <em>Al-Sayl al-Jarraar</em> and <em>Ad-Daraaree al-Mu<u>d</u>iyyah</em> that he mentioned something different (changed the view and said it’s not obligatory) because trade used to occur in his time (<em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) in all the forms of that which was traded in and it is not reported from him anything, which would necessitate this. And Imam Shawkaanee said : &#8220;Ibn ul-Mundhir claimed that there is <em>Ijmaa</em>` consensus upon Zakaat being upon trade but this quote is not correct. So the first of those who disagreed with that are the <u>Dh</u>aahirees and they are a group from the groups of Islaam.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, finally <strong>Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy</strong> mentioned in <em>Tamaam ul-Minnaah</em> that his view was, he said, “<strong>What is the truth is that the saying that Zakaat is not obligatory upon the goods for trade is what is correct because there is no proof for it from the Book or the authentic Sunnah</strong>.” And then he mentioned this saying that it being not obligatory was the saying of some of the scholars before and some of the scholars such as Ataa Abee Rabaa<u>h</u> from the <em>Taabi`een</em> and Ibn <u>H</u>azm and <u>S</u>iddeeq <u>H</u>assan Khaan from the later scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Side point: And likewise, Ibn Qudaamah mentioned in <em>Al-Mughnee</em> this as being the saying of Daawood A<u>dh</u>&#8211;<u>Dh</u>aahiree and also related from Imaam Maalik as one saying, <em>W`Allaahu A`lam</em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Any person who possesses gold or silver and does not pay what is due on it (i.e., the Zakat); on the Day of Resurrection, sheets of silver and gold would be heated for him in the fire of Hell and with them his flank, forehead and back will be branded. When they cool down, they will be heated again and the same process will be repeated during the day the measure whereof will be fifty thousand years. (This would go on) until Judgement is pronounced among (Allah’s) slaves, and he will be shown his final abode, either to Jannah or to Hell</strong></span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was asked, “How about someone who owns camels and does not pay what is due on him (i.e., their Zakat)?” He (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) replied, “In the same way the owner of camels who does not discharge what is due in respect of them (their due includes their milking on the day when they are taken to water) will be thrown on his face or on his back in a vast desert plain on the Day of Resurrection and they will trample upon him with their hoofs and bite him with their teeth. As often as the first of them passes him, the last of them will be made to return during a day the measure whereof will be fifty thousand years, until Judgement is pronounced among (Allah’s) slaves, he will be shown his final abode either to Jannah or to Hell.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was (again) asked: “O Messenger of Allah, what about cows (cattle) and sheep?” He (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, “If anyone who possesses cattle and sheep and does not pay what is due on them (i.e., their Zakat); on the Day of Resurrection, he will be thrown on his face in a vast plain desert. He will find none of the animals missing with twisted horns, without horns or with a broken horn, and they will gore him with their horns and trample upon him with their hoofs. As often as the first of them passes him, the last of them will be made to return to him during a day the measure whereof will be fifty thousand years, until Judgement is pronounced among (Allah’s) slaves; and he will be shown his final abode either to Jannah or to Hell.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was asked: “O Messenger of Allah, what about the horses?” Upon this he (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, “The horses are of three types. One, which is a burden for the owner; another which is a shield, and another one which makes its owner entitled to reward. The one for whom these are a burden is the person who rears them for show or for pride or for causing injury to the sentiments of the Muslims. They will be a cause of torment for their owners. The one for whom these are a shield is the person who rears them for the sake of Allah but does not forget the Right of Allah concerning their backs and their necks (i.e., he lets a needy ride on them), and so they are a shield for him. Those which bring reward to the one who rears them in pastures and gardens are the ones that are used in the Cause of Allah (Jihad) by the Muslims. Whatever they eat from the meadows and the gardens will be recorded on his behalf as good deeds so much so that their droppings and urine will be counted for an equal number of good deeds for him. Even when they break their tying rope and every height from which they climb and every hoofprint which they leave will be counted as a good deed on behalf of the owner. When their owner leads them through a stream from which they drink, though he does not intend to quench their thirst, yet Allah would record for him the quantity (of water) of what they would drink on his behalf as good deeds.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was asked: “O Messenger of Allah, what about the donkeys?” Upon this he (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, “Nothing has been revealed to me in regard to the donkeys in particular except this one Verse of a comprehensive nature: “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So whosoever does good equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant) shall see it. And whosoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant) shall see it</strong></span>.”’ (99: 8,9).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Q: It is known that the scholars disagree as to whether it is obligatory to pay Zakah (obligatory charity) on jewelry that is worn, intended to be worn, or borrowed.What is Your Eminence’s opinion on this issue? Supposing that it is obligatory to pay Zakah on them, is there a Nisab (the minimum amount on which Zakah is due) for this? If there is a Nisab, it seems from the Hadith that indicate the obligation of giving Zakah on jewelry &#8211; where the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) warned against the punishment of Fire awaiting those who do not pay the Zakah &#8211; that there is no Nisab. How is this resolved? [1]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: There is a famous controversy among the scholars as to whether it is obligatory to pay Zakah on gold and silver jewelry that is worn, intended to be worn, or borrowed. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The preponderant opinion is that it is obligatory, according to the general evidence on the obligation of Zakah on gold and silver</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was also authentically reported that `Abdullah ibn `Amr ibn Al-`As (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: <span style="color:#008000;">A woman came to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) with her daughter, on whose hand were two heavy bangles of gold. He (peace be upon him) asked, “Do you pay Zakah on these?” She said, “No.” He (peace be upon him) said, “Would it please you if Allah were to encircle you on the Day of Resurrection with two bracelets of Fire because of them?” She threw them down and said, &#8220;They are (I have given them away) for the sake of Allah and His Messenger.&#8221;</span> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was also authentically <span style="color:#008000;">reported from Um Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she was wearing some gold ornaments, so she asked, “O Messenger of Allah! Is this Kanz (hoarded wealth, the Zakah of which has not been paid)?” He (peace be upon him) said, “Anything that reaches the amount at which Zakah is payable and its Zakah is paid is not considered Kanz.”</span> [3] The Prophet (peace be upon him) did not tell her that there is no Zakah on jewelry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All these Hadith refer to jewelry that reach the Nisab, when they are combined with other evidence, as Hadith explain one another just as Qur’anic Ayahs (verses) explain one another, and also Hadith explain Ayahs and make their generality specific and their absoluteness limited, because all of them are revelation from Allah (Glorified be He). Whatever comes from Allah is not contradictory; in fact they confirm and explain one another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is necessary that a Hawl (one lunar year calculated from the time a property reaches the minimum amount upon which Zakah is due) must be completed (on jewelry) as is the case with other categories of Zakah wealth, such as money, commercial commodities, and livestock. May Allah grant us success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Q. 359. <strong>Is it correct for a person who is in debt to give charity? And what legal obligations are lifted from the debtor? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. Charity is a form of spending which is commanded by the Islamic Law, and it is a form of Ihsan towards Allah&#8217;s worshippers, if it is given where it is needed. A person will be rewarded for his charity, and every man will be in the shade of his charity on the Day of Resurrection and it is accepted whether a person is in debt or not, as long as the conditions for its acceptance are met.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These conditions are that it is given <strong>purely and sincerely for Allah</strong>, the Almighty, the All-Powerful&#8217;s sake, that it is from <strong>honest earnings</strong>, and it is given <strong>where it is needed</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If these conditions are fulfilled, then the charity is accepted, according to the legal evidences; and it is not a condition that a person be free of debt. <strong>But if the debt covers all that he has, then it is not wise, nor is it logical that he should give charity while charity is recommended, not obligatory and that he should leave the debt which is an obligation on him. He should begin first with the obligation, then give charity</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Scholars have disagreed regarding the situation if a person gives charity when he has a debt covering all of his wealth: Some of them say that it is not permissible because it harms his creditor, and it causes this obligatory debt to remain unpaid. Some of them say that it is permissible, but that it contradicts what is more worthy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In any case, it is not fitting for a person whose debt covers all that he has, to give charity until he has settled his debt, because an obligation takes precedence over a voluntary act of worship.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the legal obligations that are lifted from one who is indebted until such time as he pays it, they include Hajj, because Hajj is not incumbent upon a person who is in debt until he has paid it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>As for Zakah</strong>, scholars have differed regarding whether its obligation is lifted from the debtor until such lime as he pays the debt or not.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Among the scholars are those who say that the obligation of Zakah is lifted on the amount which is equivalent to the debt, whether the wealth is evident or not.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Among them are those who say that the obligation to pay Zakah is not lifted on the amount which is equivalent to the debt; rather he must pay Zakah on the whole amount which he possesses. If there is a debt incumbent on him, the Nisab is decreased.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There are those among them who discriminate, saying that if the wealth is concealed, wealth which is not seen and is not perceptible, such as money and trading merchandise, then the obligation to pay Zakah is lifted on the amount which is equivalent to the debt, while if the wealth is in the form of perceptible things, such livestock and the produce of the earth, then the obligation to pay Zakah is not lifted.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">The correct view in my opinion is that the obligation to pay it is not lifted, regardless of whether the wealth is perceptible or not, and that every person who has wealth in his hand upon which Zakah is payable must pay his Zakah, even if he is in debt. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because Zakah is incumbent upon wealth, according to the Words of Allah, the Most High:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Take Sadaqah (alms) from their wealth in order to purify them and sanctify them with it, and invoke Allah for them. Verily your invocations are a source of security for them; and Allah is All- Hearer, All-Knower&#8221;</strong></span> [At-Tawbah 9:103]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the words of the Prophet to Mu&#8217;ath bin Jabal, may Allah be pleased with him, when he sent him to Yemen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Inform them that Allah has made incumbent upon them the payment of Zakah on their wealth; it is taken from the wealthy among them and distributed among their poor.&#8221;</strong> </span>[2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hadith is in Sahih Al-Bukhari with this wording. By this evidence from the Book (of Allah) and the Sunnah, the two things are separate, and there is no conflict between Zakah and a debt, because a debt remains an obligation and Zakah is incumbent upon wealth. So, each of them is incumbent in a place wherein the other is not incumbent, so there is no conflict between them, and no contradiction, and thus a <strong>debt remains the responsibility of its owner and Zakah remains incumbent on wealth</strong>, and he must pay it from the wealth in all circumstances.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[2] Reported by Al-Bukhari in the Book of Zakah, in the Chapter: The Obligation of Zakah ( 1 395 ); and by Muslim in the Book of Faith, in the Chapter: Calling to the Shahadatan and the Laws of Islam (19).</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fatwa : 19665</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q : Should the <strong>Hawl</strong> (<span style="color:#808080;">one lunar year calculated from the time a property reaches the minimum amount upon which Zakah is due</span>) for the Zakah (obligatory charity) on money and commercial commodities be considered according to the Hijri (lunar) year or the Gregorian solar year, as there is a <strong>difference of 11 days</strong> between both? Ifthe calculation of Zakah is made according to the Hijri year, what is the solution for organizations that issue their budgets and calculate their Zakah according to the solar year. Is it permissible to delay paying the due Zakah on commercial commodities beyond the Hijri year, as several contracting organizations delay the issuance of budgets six months after the passing of the year of Zakah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A : <strong>Zakah is due on property after the passing of 12 months according to the Hijri calendar</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">They ask you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) about the new moons. Say: These are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage</span>. [Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 189]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is impermissible to delay the payment of Zakah beyond the fixed time unless a legal excuse preventing the payment is verified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8230;pay the due thereof (its Zakât, according to Allâh’s Orders 1/10th or 1/20th) on the day of its harvest</span> [Surah Al-An`am, 6: 141]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8230;and perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât), and give Zakât</span>.[Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This command indicates immediate response.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q. 381. Is every person who extends his hand for Zakah deserving of it?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. Not every person who extends his hand for Zakah is deserving of it, because there are those among mankind who extend their hands for money while they are wealthy. This type of person will come on the Day of Resurrection while his face will not have a bit of flesh on it, [1] may Allah protect us from that. He will come on the Day of Resurrection, on the Day when the witnesses will stand and the bones of his face will be visible, may Allah protect us from that, and the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;He who begs the riches of others to increase his own wealth is asking only for burning coals (in the Hereafter), so let him ask a little or much.&#8221;</strong></span> [2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I would like to take this opportunity to warn those people who ask people in an importune manner when they are in possession of wealth. Indeed, I warn everyone who accepts Zakah when he is not entitled to receive it. I say to him: If you took Zakah to which you are not entitled, you are only consuming ill-gotten gains, may Allah protect us from that, and a person should fear Allah, for the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Whoever tries to make himself self-sufficient, Allah will make him self-sufficient; and whoever abstains from asking others, Allah will make him content&#8221;</strong></span> [3]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if a man extends his hand to you, and you believe it is most likely that he is entitled to it, and you gave him, then the Zakah will be counted, and you will have discharged your obligation, even if it became apparent after that that he was not entitled to it. There is no need to think that you have to pay the Zakah again (to someone else).</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The evidence for this is the story of the man who gave money in charity, and he gave charity first to a <strong>prostitute</strong> and the people began to talk, saying: &#8220;Have you given money tonight to a prostitute?&#8221; He said: &#8220;All praise and thanks are to Allah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he gave charity on the second night and it fell into the hands of a <strong>thief</strong> and the people began to talk, saying: &#8220;Have you given money tonight to a thief?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he gave charity on the third night to a <strong>rich man</strong> and the people began to talk, saying: &#8220;Have you given money tonight to a rich man?&#8221; He said: &#8220;All praise and thanks are to Allah for the prostitute, the thief and the rich man.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then it was said to him (by an angel): &#8220;Your charity has been accepted; as for the prostitute, haply (i.e perhaps) she may content herself with what you have given her and it may prevent her from committing illegal sexual intercourse, while as for the thief, haply he may content himself with what you have given him and he may refrain from stealing, while as for the rich man, haply, he may reflect and give charity&#8221; [4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, my brother, look at the honest intention, what is its effect: Therefore, if you gave the person who asked you, and then it became apparent that he was wealthy and you had given him something, believing that he was poor, it is not necessary for you to repay the Zakah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Ruling on paying Zakah for building Masjids</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the ruling on paying Zakah (obligatory charity) money for helping to build a Masjid (mosque) whose construction was halted due to lack of financial resources?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>A: </b>According to the opinion of the majority of Muslim scholars and the Ijma` (consensus) of our Salaf (righteous predecessors), <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Zakah is not to be paid for constructing Masjids, buying books, etc</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, Zakah must be spent on the eight categories which are mentioned in the Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse) of Surah Al-Tawbah, i.e. the poor, the needy, those employed to collect (the funds), to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined (towards Islâm), to free captives, for those in debt, in the cause of Allah, and for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from everything).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is worth mentioning that scholars are of the view that the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>category of &#8220;in the cause of Allah&#8221; refers only to Jihad (fighting/striving in the Cause of Allah)</strong></span> and this does not include constructing Masjids, schools, roads, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">As-salamu ‘alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah’s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Please advise me by giving me a Fatwa (legal opinion issued by a qualified Muslim scholar) as to whether it is permissible to pay Zakah (obligatory charity) outside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to the known categories of Zakah recipients, in the same way as it is done inside the Kingdom. We appreciate your assistance and may Allah protect you. Wa‘alaykum as-salam warahmatullah wabarakatuh (And may Allah’s Peace and Blessings be upon you!)</p>
<p><strong>A question asked to His Eminence. He replied on 3/9/1410 A.H.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible for the Zakah payer to send Zakah to a country other than where they are living, <strong>if this is for a Shar‘y (Islamically lawful) benefit</strong>, according to the more correct of the two opinions held by the scholars, <strong>such as </strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">sending it to the Mujahidun (strivers/fighters in the Cause of Allah),</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">to the poor who are in greater need than those in their country, or</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">for being their relatives, as this combines maintaining the ties of kinship and Zakah.</li>
</ul>
<p>May Allah guide everyone to that which pleases Him.</p>
<p>As-salamu ‘alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">A lecture entitled, &#8220;<strong>Zakah: Its status in Islam</strong>&#8220;, which His Eminence gave in<br />
Al-Jami Al-Kabir, Riyadh<b><br />
</b></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>In the Name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allah, the Lord of all creation. May Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings be upon His Slave, Messenger, Khalil (beloved, close elect) and truthful conveyer of the Divine Revelation, our Prophet, Imam and Master Muhammad ibn `Abdullah, his family, and Companions and whosoever follows his example and seeks his guidance until the Day of Resurrection. To continue:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The topic of the lecture as the presenter said is (<strong>Status of Zakah in Islam</strong>). Every Muslim individual who possesses the least knowledge of Islam knows that Zakah, being the third pillar of Islam, holds a great status in Islam. Zakah has been mentioned in connection with Salah (Prayer) in many places of the Qur&#8217;an. The Prophet (peace be upon him) also mentioned Zakah next to Salah in numerous Hadiths.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;And perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât), and give Zakât and bow down (or submit yourselves with obedience to Allâh) along with those who bow down (in prayer)&#8221;  </strong>[</span>Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 43]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) also says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;And perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât), and give Zakât and obey the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) that you may receive mercy (from Allâh)&#8221; </span></strong><span style="color:#000000;">[</span><span style="color:#000000;">Surah Al-Nur, 24: 56]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another place, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;But if they repent, perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât) and give Zakât, then they are your brethren in religion&#8221; </strong>[Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 11]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In yet another place, Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allâh, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him), and perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât) and give Zakât, and that is the right religion&#8221; </strong></span>[Surah Al-Bayyinah, 98: 5]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e., Al-Bukhari and Muslim) on the authority of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Abdullah ibn `Umar ibn Al-Khattab</span>(may Allah be pleased with them both) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"><span style="background-color:#d5d5d5;">I</span>slam was based on five pillars: testimony that there is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; performing Salah (prayers), giving Zakah; fasting Ramadan; and performing Hajj (pilgrimage).</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="webkit-html-attribute-value" style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Book on faith, Chapter on Islam is based on five things, no. 8; Muslim, Book on faith, Chapter on Islam is founded on five (fundaments), no. 16; and Al-Tirmidhy, Book on faith, Chapter on Islam is based on five things, no. 2609, and the wording is his]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another version, the Hadith reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Islam was based on five pillars: worshipping Allah Alone and disbelieving that there is any other Gods, performing Salah (Prayers), giving Zakah&#8230;</strong></span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Muslim, Chapter on Islam is founded on five (fundaments), no. 16]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates the great position which Zakah holds in Islam. It is mentioned next to Salah both in the Qur&#8217;an and Hadiths of the Prophet (peace be upon him). Salah is considered the cornerstone of Islam and the second greatest pillar next to only the Shahadah (testimony of faith).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says regarding Salah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:#000000;" title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 238" target="_blank" name="Guardstrictly(fiveobligatory)" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>Guard strictly (five obligatory) As-Salawât (the prayers) especially the middle Salât (i.e. the best prayer &#8211; ‘Asr ). And stand before Allâh with obedience [and do not speak to others during the Salât (prayers)]. </span></strong><span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 238]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) is also reported to have said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#000000;">That which differentiates us from the disbelievers and hypocrites is our performance of Salah. He who abandons it, becomes a disbeliever. </span></span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">[</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Narrated by Al-Tirmidhy, Book on faith, Chapter on abandoning Salah, no. 2621.]</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another Hadith, the Prophet (peace be upon him) is reported to have said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> <span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">What makes one a disbeliever and a polytheist is abandoning prayers.</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Muslim, Book on faith, Chapter on calling one who neglects Salah a disbeliever, no. 82]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Zakah is the sister pillar of Salah</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Salah is a physical act of worship in which the Muslim stands before Allah supplicating to Him, mentioning His Name and reciting Ayahs of the Qur&#8217;an. It has such a great effect on hearts. If performed properly, Salah will restrain one from committing indecent acts and will serve as a means to attaining happiness, safety and salvation. It will also set their heart aright and bless their deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One day the Prophet (peace be upon him) was speaking to his Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) about Salah and he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Whoever observes it regularly, it will be a source of light, authoritative proof and a means of salvation on the Day of Resurrection, and whoever does not observe it regularly, it will not be a source of light, authoritative proof and a means of salvation and on the Day of Resurrection he will join the company of Fir`aun (Pharaoh), Haman, Qarun (Korah), and Ubay ibn Khalaf.</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Imam Ahmad, Section on the Hadiths narrated by the Companions who narrated a large number of Hadiths, Section on the Hadiths narrated by `Abdullah ibn `Amar ibn Al-`As, no. 6540.&#8217;]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Imam Ahmad and others with a good Sanad (chain of narrators).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Commenting on the above Hadith, some scholars said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;On the Day of Resurrection one who abandons Salah will join the company of Pharaoh, Haman Qarun, and Ubayy ibn Khalaf on account of his imitating them.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">The reason is that if he abandons it for the sake of holding a prestigious position, he will be behaving like<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Fir`aun (Pharaoh) </span>who, being an enemy to Musa (Moses, peace be upon him), transgressed and behaved arrogantly taking advantage of his royal position. T</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">he same is true with<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Haman, </span>Pharaoh&#8217;s minister,<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> </span>who, taking advantage of his position, behaved arrogantly and refused to follow Musa (Moses, peace be upon him). Therefore, one will dwell in Hellfire with<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Haman, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Pharaoh&#8217;s </span>minister, because of being occupied with his prestigious position and getting distracted from obeying Allah.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">One who abandons it for the sake of collecting wealth will join the company of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Qarun (Korah) </span>who was addicted<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> </span>to the collection of wealth and lusting after his desires. He behaved arrogantly and disobeyed Prophet Musa. Thus, Allah caused the earth to swallow him up together with his dwelling. He was destined to enter Hellfire.<span style="line-height:1.5;">Those who behave after the manner of Qarun will enter Hellfire with him. We seek refuge in Allah from this. </span></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="line-height:1.5;">One who abandons Salah on account of being busy, conducting buying and selling transactions will be behaving after the manner of</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="line-height:1.5;"> Ubay ibn Khalaf, </span><span style="line-height:1.5;">the Makkan merchant,</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="line-height:1.5;"> </span><span style="line-height:1.5;">and will thus join his company in Hellfire. We seek refuge in Allah.</span></span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Zakah and Salah are equally important.</strong> Those who abstain from paying it on account of miserliness and greed for wealth will join the company of Allah&#8217;s enemy who preferred collecting wealth to showing obedience to Allah and His Messenger. It is reported that <a name="WhentheProphet(peacebeupon"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="112839" class="tip"></span>when the Prophet (peace be upon him) sent Mu`adh to Yemen, he said: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Invite them to bear witness that there is no God but Allah and that I am the Messenger of Allah. Should they accept your invitation, then tell them that Allah has prescribed upon them to offer five Prayers a day. Should they obey you, tell them that Allah has prescribed upon them to pay Zakah which is collected from the rich among them and given to the poor.&#8221;</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Imam Ahmad, Section on Banu Hashim, the beginning of the Section on the Hadiths narrated by `Abdullah ibn `Abbas, no. 2072; Al-Bukhari, Book on Zakah, Chapter on taking Sadaqah from the rich and giving it to the poor&#8230;, no. 1496; and Muslim, Book on faith, Chapter on calling people to the testimony of faith&#8230;, no. 19.&#8217;]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates that Zakah was prescribed as an act of sympathy and kindness to the poor. It is an obligation due from one&#8217;s wealth which they are obliged to ensure its delivery to those who deserve it. This is based on the Hadith of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Ibn `Umar </span>(may Allah be pleased with them both) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> <a name="Ihavebeencommandedtofight"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="112840" class="tip"></span><span style="color:#000000;">I have been commanded to fight against people until they testify that there is no God but Allah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, perform the Prayer, and pay Zakah. If they do that, their blood and property are guaranteed protection on my behalf except when justified by law, and their affairs rest with Allah.</span></span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Book on faith, Chapter on Allah&#8217;s Saying: &#8220;If they turn in repentance and establish the prayer&#8221;, no. 25; and Muslim, Book on faith, Chapter on the command to fight people until they profess that there is no God but Allah, no. 22.&#8217;]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This and other similar Hadiths indicate the lawfulness to fight those whose miserliness makes them abstain from paying Zakah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>During Abu Bakr&#8217;s lifetime, war was waged against those who refused to pay Zakah.</strong></span> This is because the blood of a Muslim is protected against being shed only when they establish Salah and pay Zakah. That is why when some Arabs refrained from paying Zakah following the Prophet&#8217;s demise, the Sahabah engaged in fighting against them so that they could pay it off. After the Prophet&#8217;s demise, some Muslims apostatized from Islam. Some of them said that had Muhammad been truly a Prophet of Allah, he would not have passed away. They forgot the fact that all prophets preceding him had also passed away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some others refused to pay Zakah. At this point<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Abu Bakr </span>(may Allah be pleased with him) delivered a sermon encouraging the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) to fight the apostates until they came back to Islam.<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Umar </span>argued with him saying: &#8220;How will you fight those who bear witness that there is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah?&#8221;<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Abu Bakr </span>replied: &#8220;We have been commanded to fight against people until they testify that there is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. If they do that, their blood and property are guaranteed protection on our behalf except when justified by law.&#8221; Then Abu Bakr went on to say: &#8220;Is not Zakah one of Allah&#8217;s Rights? By Allah, I will keep fighting those who differentiate between Salah and Zakah. By Allah, if they refuse to give me as much as a she-kid which they used to give during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah, I will fight them on its account. Then<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Umar </span>said: &#8220;It was nothing but Allah Who had guided<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Abu Bakr </span>to fight and I came to realize that he was right.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sahabah unanimously agreed on fighting the Murtads (apostates). They fought against them vigorously until they came back to the fold of Islam. Only those among them who were destined to die as Murtads were killed at the hands of Muslims. We seek refuge in Allah from this. The ones killed included <span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><strong>Musaylimah Al-Kadhab</strong> (the head of the apostates who claimed himself a Prophet after the death of Prophet Muhammad), </span>some of his followers, some people from<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Banu Asad, </span>and others. As they refused to come back to Islam, Muslims continued to fight them until they were killed. Other Murtads were guided back to Islam by the Will of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>To sum it up: Zakah is of great importance in Islam. It is the third greatest pillar next to Salah and Shahadah. Muslims are duty bound to deliver it to those who deserve it. If the Muslim ruler orders that Zakah be paid off to him to undertake the process of distributing it, his order must be executed. If he does not demand that, the believer has to distribute it to the poor and other people who deserve it. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah has defined the categories of Zakah recipientsin the Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse) where He (Glorified be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> &#8220;As-Sadaqât (here it means Zakât) are only for the Fuqarâ’ (poor), and the Masâkin (needy) and those employed to collect (the funds), and to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined (towards Islâm), and to free the captives, and for those in debt, and for Allâh’s Cause, and for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from everything); a duty imposed by Allâh. And Allâh is All-Knower, All-Wise. </strong></span><span style="color:#808080;">[Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 60]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first and second categories of Zakah recipients include <strong>Faqirs</strong> (the poor) and the <strong>Miskins</strong> (the needy): These two have been defined as people who do not possess enough money. The Faqir is the person who does not have sufficient wealth to fulfill his needs or the needs of his dependents, such as food, drink, clothing and housing. The Miskin may be someone whose standard of living is better than the Faqir. However, their ruling is the same in all matters. They should be given an amount of Zakah which covers their basic needs for one whole year.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third category of Zakah recipients includes <strong>those employed to collect Zakah</strong>: Collectors of Zakah include the people who travel around to collect it, or those who are responsible for maintaining it, or the scribes who record it in its register. Such people are given an amount from Zakah according to the effort they exert in collecting and maintaining it. The Muslim ruler can estimate the amount given to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth category includes <strong>the hearts that are newly inclined to Islam</strong>, This category includes chiefs, masters and men of high standing whose word is listened to by their people. When they enter Islam, their people are expected to follow in their footsteps. When they refuse to accept Islam, the same will be the attitude of their people. They are given a portion of Zakah with the purpose of strengthening their Iman (faith), or winning the hearts of their counterparts, or seeking their help in defending Islam against its enemies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fifth category includes the <strong>freeing of slaves and captives of war</strong>: Zakah is to be given to slaves so that they can set themselves free from the bondage of slavery. In this regard, Zakah is given to the type of slaves known as <strong>Mukatabs</strong> (slaves with an agreement to buy their freedom). According to the correct view, one who delivers Zakah may buy slaves with the money of Zakah for the purpose of freeing them. It is also permissible that he uses the money of Zakah in buying Muslims who have fallen captive to the Kafirs (disbelievers). Thus Zakah is delivered to the Kafirs as a ransom to release the Muslim captives.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sixth category includes <strong>those in debt</strong>: These are the people who borrow money from others to provide the basic needs of their dependents or to reconcile between Muslims. They offer to pay the money in order to bring about reconciliation between Muslims who are at enmity with each other. One who offers to pay money for that purpose should be given an amount of the Zakah even if he is rich. Zakah is also given to insolvent debtors who are incapable of paying off their debts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The seventh category includes paying Zakah <strong>in the cause of Allah</strong>: in this category Zakah is given to equip Mujahidun (persons fighting in the Cause of Allah) with necessary weapons and cavalry if Bayt-ul-Mal (Muslim treasury) is short of providing them with this. Therefore, they are given a portion of Zakah which enables them to fight against the enemies of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eighth category includes the <strong>wayfarers</strong>: wayfarers are people who move from one country to another. They may happen to run out of provisions due to the long distances they travel when journeying or being attacked by highway robbers or due to any other reason. They must be given a portion of Zakah which enables them to return home safely even if they are naturally rich people. They must be given an amount of Zakah that helps them return to their country.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zakah has such a great effect when delivered to those eight categories of recipients. It helps them perform the duties of Allah and relieves them of their sufferings like paying off their debts if they are in debt or freeing themselves from the bondage of slavery if they are slaves or fighting in the cause of Allah if they are Mujahidun or assisting the wayfarers.It is out of Allah&#8217;s mercy that He makes His poor and rich Slaves co-operate with one another in righteousness and piety.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Payment of Zakah is a way of giving thanks to Allah</strong> because of the blessings He bestows upon them. Allah is the true Bestower of favors and blessings. It is the duty of every Muslim to pay out their Zakah as an act of showing gratitude to Allah. A Muslim should thank Allah for making him a deliverer and not a recipient of Zakah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The upper hand is better than the lower one&#8230;</strong></span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Book on Zakah, Chapter on Sadaqah should only be given by the wealthy, no. 1428; and Muslim, Book on Zakah, Chapter on the statement that the upper hand (that which gives) is better than the lower hand (that which receives), no. 1034]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The upper hand is the one that delivers Zakah while the lower hand is the one which receives it. The Muslim should thank Allah for providing them with wealth which they are duty bound to give a portion of to Allah&#8217;s Slaves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Zakah also purges the soul of the deliverer and purifies his wealth as well</strong>. Allah (Glorified be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:#000000;" title="Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 103" target="_blank" name="TakeSadaqah(alms)fromtheir" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>Take Sadaqah (alms) from their wealth in order to purify them and sanctify them with it&#8221;</span> </strong><span style="color:#808080;">[Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 103]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>You will be rewarded on account of paying Zakah both in this life and the Hereafter. </strong>Your money is purified and preserved when you pay it out.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>It is also a means of purifying the soul</strong>. This has been referred to in the above Ayah which reads: &#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 103" target="_blank" name="TakeSadaqah(alms)fromtheir" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>Take Sadaqah (alms) from their wealth in order to purify them and sanctify them with it&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Muslim gives their fellow poor Muslims from the wealth that Allah has bestowed on them, they will be abundantly rewarded by Allah for relieving them of their distresses.This act of yours will make them hold you in high esteem. It may be that they will make Du`a&#8217; (supplication) for you which may be a reason for your happiness and salvation in this life and the Hereafter. A Muslim is not harmed when they pay only a little amount of the many bounties that Allah has bestowed on them. They give these amounts to the children, old people and poor ones. The Muslim will receive great rewards from Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Allah has threatened those who refuse to pay Zakah out of miserliness.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And those who hoard up gold and silver [Al-Kanz: the money, the Zakât of which has not been paid] and spend them not in the Way of Allâh, announce unto them a painful torment</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 35" target="_blank" name="OntheDaywhenthat(Al-Kanz:" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>On the Day when that (Al-Kanz: money, gold and silver the Zakât of which has not been paid) will be heated in the Fire of Hell and with it will be branded their foreheads, their flanks, and their backs, (and it will be said unto them): <strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;This is the treasure which you hoarded for yourselves. Now taste of what you used to hoard.&#8221;</span> </strong><span style="color:#808080;">[Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 34-35]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the evil consequence of those who withhold payment of Zakah. They will be thrown into Hellfire where the wealth they amassed and refused to pay its Zakah will be a source of their agony on the Day of Resurrection. This will be a fitting retribution for their refusal to fulfill the right of Allah. While the wealth which a person does not give its due Zakah is labeled as &#8220;<strong>hoarded wealth</strong>&#8220;, that money whose due Zakah is paid is free of blame.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> <a style="color:#000000;" name="Whateverreachesaquantityon"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="112843" class="tip"></span>Whatever reaches a quantity on which Zakah is payable is not a treasure (kanz) when Zakah is paid</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Abu Dawud, Book on Zakah, Chapter on what is Kanz and Zakah on jewelry, no. 1564]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever you pay the Zakah due from the wealth in your possession, it will not be labeled as hoarded wealth and vice versa.If you refuse to pay Zakah due from it, it will be a source of your agony on the Day of Resurrection. It is authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><a name="Anypersonwhopossessesgoldor"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="112844" class="tip"></span><span style="color:#000000;">Any person who possesses gold or silver and does not pay what is due from them (in another narration their Zakah); on the Day of Resurrection, plates of silver and gold would be heated for him in the fire of Hell and with them his flank, forehead, and back will be branded during a day the extent of which will be fifty thousand years. Then he will be shown his final abode, either to Paradise or to Hell. </span></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">He who possesses camels and does not pay what is due from him regarding them, will be thrown on his face or on his back in a vast desert plain (on the Day of Resurrection) and they will trample him with their hoofs and bite him with their teeth.

And he would be shown his last abode either to Paradise or to Hell. </span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">He who possesses cows and sheep and does not pay their Zakah (in another wording of the Hadith what is due on him regarding them) will be thrown on the Day of Judgment in a vast desert plain and they will trample him with their hoofs and gore him with their horns. As often as the last of them passes him the first of them would be made to return to him again during a day the extent of which would be fifty thousand years. Then he would be shown his last abode either to Paradise or to Hell.</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Muslim, Book on Zakah, Chapter on sin of one who does not pay Zakah, no. 987.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Hadith indicates how severe the punishment is of one who refuses to pay Zakah out of miserliness. On the Day of Resurrection, their wealth will be a source of their grief and agony whether it be money, food, fruit, camels, cattle or sheep. They will be used as tools of punishment on the Day of Resurrection. The Prophet indicated how they will be punished with their own wealth. The same is true with regard to gold and silver and other things of the sort. We ask Allah to grant us safety and protection from this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>It is our duty and the duty of all Muslims to enjoin one another to pay Zakah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are duty bound to enjoin one another to fulfill Allah&#8217;s Rights, strive hard to do that and remind those who are negligent of paying Zakah. Reminding people of this benefits the believers. Zakah, Salah and fasting are all obligatory duties, yet one may be heedless of that because of the gravity of his sins which darken their heart and cause them to continually disobey Allah. Satan and his helpers also make their deeds fair-seeming to them until they become completely unmindful of Allah and the Hereafter. They fall victim to the worship of Satan and start to accompany evil people. Their hearts become obsessed with the love of wealth and lustful desires. They refuse to befriend righteous people and prefer to follow the path of deviant fellows. Therefore, it is the duty of all Muslims to remind those heedless Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:#000000;" title="Surah Al-Dhariyat, 51: 55" target="_blank" name="Andremind(bypreachingtheQur%E2%80%99%C3%A2n," rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>And remind (by preaching the Qur’ân, O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), for verily, the reminding profits the believers</span> </strong><span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Al-Dhariyat, 51: 55]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) also says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So remind them (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) &#8211; you are only one who reminds </strong></span><span style="color:#808080;"> [Surah Al-Ghashiyah, 88: 21]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A believer should remind his fellow believing brother. He should not assume that their fellow brothers are well aware of the consequences of refraining from paying Zakah. Whenever they see that their brothers have started to be neglectful of Allah&#8217;s duties, they must start advising them and reminding them of Allah through the use of kind words and gentle preaching. They should seem to beworried about them and concerned with their salvation and happiness. A true Muslim brother is one who keeps advising, reminding and directing you to the straight path. He never keeps himself away from you nor flatters you. Rather, he gives you counsel and admonishes you. He reminds you to be mindful of Allah. He shows you the path of salvation so that you can follow it and warns you of treading the path of perdition so that you can steer clear of it. You should never give up hope of advising him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;&#8230;and never give up hope of Allâh’s Mercy&#8221; </strong></span><span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Yusuf, 12: 87]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) also says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Despair not of the Mercy of Allâh&#8221;</strong></span> <span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Al-Zumar, 39: 53]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reality proves that there have been many disobedient Muslims who continued to be heedless of Allah&#8217;s Commandments for years. Then, the time came when they were guided back to the straight path at the hands of righteous Muslims who kept encouraging them to perform deeds of righteousness. They started to awaken from their heedlessness and pray to Allah for the sake of those who guided them. As Allah shows them true guidance, they return to the path of truth and repent to Him of all their past sins. In this way, Allah forgives them and atones their previous misdeeds. So, I advise you, my dear brothers, not to give up hope.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Someone has told me just after Maghrib (Sunset) Prayer that he had come from<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Masjid Al-Nusiry </span>and<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Masjid Al-Turky </span>while the marketplaces there were filled with people who did not offer Salah and were busy conducting buying and selling transactions. He started to weep and said: &#8220;This is intolerable.&#8221; Therefore, I see that we are in need of advising and co-operating with one another. It should not be said that authorities in charge would undertake this duty. It is true that these authorities shoulder great responsibility and that they have to be held accountable if they ever fail to play their role properly. We ask Allah to grant them help and success.Muslim rulers shoulder great responsibility in this regard. Every Muslim whether educated, scholar, or judge shares their prescribed responsibility of disapproving evil acts and enjoining good ones. The more Muslims co-operate with one another and enjoin one another to hold fast to the truth, the less evil will spread. Marketplaces are filled with many Muslims who neglect offering Salah (Prayer) and sit outside Masjids (mosques) while their fellow Muslims are in the process of offering it. These people must be reminded of their negligence of Salah and passers-by must disapprove of this heinous act of theirs. They may be warned in such words as &#8220;Do you not fear Allah? How come you are sitting like this while your Muslim brothers are offering Salah.&#8221; One should join their fellow Muslims in Salah even if they are on a journey.</p>
<blockquote>

<p style="text-align:justify;">He ordered him to join Salah with other Muslims even after he had already prayed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">After the Prophet had offered the Fajr (Dawn) Prayer in Mina in the year of the Farewell Hajj, some people said to him: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Here are two people who have not offered the Fajr Prayer with us.&#8221; He asked that they be brought to him. They came trembling with fear. The Prophet (peace be upon him) inquired: &#8220;What prevented you from offering Salah with us?&#8221; They said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! We offered it in our camp&#8221;. The Prophet said: &#8220;Never do this again.If you have prayed in your houses and then you come to the Masjid (mosque), then pray with the congregation. It will be regarded as supererogatory Prayer for you&#8221;.</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Imam Ahmad, Section on the Hadiths narrated by Levanters narrators, the Hadith narrated by Yazid ibn Al-Aswad, no. 17020; and Al-Tirmidhy, Book on Salah, Chapter on a man offers Salah alone and then joins the congregation, no. 219]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If someone, who has already offered an Obligatory Prayer alone, goes to the Masjid and sees that the Congregational Prayer is not yet finished, they have to join the Muslims. If they happen to join the Imam in the first Rak`ah (unit of Prayer), then they will make Taslim (salutation of peace ending the Prayer) with him. If they miss some Rak`ahs, they have to make up for them after Taslim. When the Prophet was asked about some Muslim rulers who delay offering Salah until later times, he said to the questioner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Observe the prayer at its proper time and if you can, do it along with them, and do not say that you have already observed prayer for it would be a supererogatory prayer for you.</span></strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslims should reprimand those who sit in the streets at prayer time. Should one of them argue that he has already offered Salah, he must be ordered not to sit near the Masjid and to hide from people or join them in Prayer which will be regarded as supererogatory for him. He must be ordered to do this in order not to discourage people from offering Salah.He must be told to hasten to offer it with his fellow Muslims. It will be regarded as supererogatory Prayer if he has already offered it alone. The Imams at different Masjids should spend equal or similar times in offering Salah so that those who abandon Salah might not claim that they have prayed at such and such Masjid. Muslims are duty bound to co-operate in righteousness and piety and enjoin one another to hold steadfastly to the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah describes those of His servants who are winners that they enjoin one another to hold to the path of truth and to endure it patiently. Allah (Glorified be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) informs us that this type of people are the real winners who will attain happiness on account of their possession of the following four characteristics. Firstly, they have sincere belief in Allah and His Messenger. Secondly, they work deeds of righteousness which means that their Iman is fruitful. Iman is not just what resides firmly in the heart as it has to be confirmed by deeds. For example, it is not just enough to believe in the obligatory nature of Salah while neglecting to offer it, or to believe in the obligatory nature of Zakah while refusing to pay it, or to believe in the obligatory nature of fasting while abstaining from it. Iman has to be demonstrated both in words and in deeds. The real winners are those who combine between true Iman, righteous deeds and enjoining one another to do good and to remain steadfast. These are the real winners as they have firm belief in Allah and His Messenger. They declare the Oneness of Allah and His Messenger. They also believe in the Truth revealed by Allah and conveyed by His Messenger. Then, they practiced that really after their belief undertaking the obligations that Allah ordained and leaving the Prohibitions that He forbade. They also advised one another to hold fast to the truth without negligence or weakness, enjoining each other to the truth and cooperating with one another in righteousness and benevolent acts. They preached Islam, enjoined what is right and forbade what is wrong patiently as these matters cannot be attained without observing patience. Whoever seeks these merits has to keep patient and seek the help of Allah; beseeching Allah for His Help, thank Him, do the best in doing His Commandments, advising for His Sake, enjoining the right and forbidding the wrong, reminding people of Allah forbearingly. Undoubtedly, you have to bear troubles as it is the way of Paradise that is surrounded with troubling hardships. The Prophet (peace be upon him) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"><strong>Paradise is surrounded by hardships and Hell-Fire is surrounded by temptations.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Muslim, Book on Paradise, description of its boon and inhabitants, first chapter, no. 2823]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">There are many obstacles lying in the way to Jannah (Paradise). These obstacles have to be overcome with patience. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The greatest of these obstacles include following desires of the self, surrendering to the temptations of Shaytan (devil) and keeping company with evil friends. While the Shaytan makes bad deeds fair-seeming to the doer, his soul is naturally prone to evil and the evil company he keeps corrupts his manners.This evil company brings harm to him by causing him to deviate from the right path. Therefore, one should patiently endure breaking their relationship with them. One should also develop a kind of steadfast adherence to obeying the Commands of Allah and disobeying the incitements of Shaytan. One should have firm determination that helps them not to fall victim to their whims and desires which lead to eternal dwelling in Hellfire. Therefore, you will realize the true meaning of felicity by following the commands of Allah, refusing to follow your whims and desires and holding fast to the path of guidance and steadfastness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every Muslim man or woman is duty bound to hasten to performing congregational Salah (Prayer) at its appointed time. They should put aside everything that distracts them from offering Salah like work or sleep. Undoubtedly, some Muslims find this difficult to do. However, once one starts to tame themselves by exercising <strong>self-restraint</strong>, they will sense a feeling of pleasure overwhelming their hearts each time they offer Salah. Self-restraint will help make their souls amenable to them. Thus, the heart is revived each time the Prayer time becomes due. One will also sense a feeling of comfort upon offering Salah to which they will hasten with pleasure. They will sense the same feelings when doing other good deeds. However, if one neglects offering Salah surrendering themselves to whims and desires, Satan will play tricks on them and their heart will become weak to the point that they will feel that Salah is burdensome,because the heart becomes weak due to its submission to desires, devil, and tempting ways of laziness and harmful neglect when a servant argues, in his defense of his falsehood, saying, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, the Most-Merciful.. Allah is All-Forgiving and All-Generous while he forgets that Allah (Exalted be He) also says:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Declare (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) unto My slaves, that truly, I am the Oft-Forgiving, the Most-Merciful. &#8220;And that My Torment is indeed the most painful torment. </strong></span><span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Al-Hijr, 15: 49-50]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also forgets that Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">The Forgiver of sin, the Acceptor of repentance, the Severe in punishment, the Bestower (of favours). Lâ ilâha illâ Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), to Him is the final return.</span> </strong><span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Ghafir, 40: 3]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah forgives and is merciful to those who turn to Him in repentance, yet He inflicts severe punishment on those who neglect His Rights.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant all Muslims success and guidance. May He guide us and you to that which pleases Him. May He also guide us to His Straight Path, teach us what is beneficial to us, and assist us in obeying Him and fulfilling His Rights. May Allah make us all among those who co-operate in righteousness and piety and those who enjoin one another to hold steadfastly to the truth. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) is Most Generous and Most Gracious. May Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

Then I came to know that he was asking about Islam.

By Allah I will fight them even to secure the piece of rope which they used to give to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam).&#8221; `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) said: &#8220;I realized that Allah opened the heart of Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) for fighting those who refused to pay Zakat, and I fully recognized that Abu Bakr ¨(May Allah be pleased with him) was right.</span><span style="font-size:small;">&#8221; [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</span></p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:small;"><b>1214.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-size:small;">Any person who possesses gold or silver and does not pay what is due on it (i.e., the Zakat); on the Day of Resurrection, sheets of silver and gold would be heated for him in the fire of Hell and with them his flank, forehead and back will be branded. When they cool down, they will be heated again and the same process will be repeated during the day the measure whereof will be fifty thousand years. (This would go on) until Judgement is pronounced among (Allah&#8217;s) slaves, and he will be shown his final abode, either to Jannah or to Hell</span><span style="font-size:small;">.&#8221; It was asked, &#8220;How about someone who owns camels and does not pay what is due on him (i.e., their Zakat)?&#8221; He (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-size:small;">In the same way the owner of camels who does not discharge what is due in respect of them (their due includes their milking on the day when they are taken to water) will be thrown on his face or on his back in a vast desert plain on the Day of Resurrection and they will trample upon him with their hoofs and bite him with their teeth. As often as the first of them passes him, the last of them will be made to return during a day the measure whereof will be fifty thousand years, until Judgement is pronounced among (Allah&#8217;s) slaves, he will be shown his final abode either to Jannah or to Hell</span><span style="font-size:small;">.&#8221; It was (again) asked: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, what about cows (cattle) and sheep?&#8221; He (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-size:small;">If anyone who possesses cattle and sheep and does not pay what is due on them (i.e., their Zakat); on the Day of Resurrection, he will be thrown on his face in a vast plain desert. He will find none of the animals missing with twisted horns, without horns or with a broken horn, and they will gore him with their horns and trample upon him with their hoofs. As often as the first of them passes him, the last of them will be made to return to him during a day the measure whereof will be fifty thousand years, until Judgement is pronounced among (Allah&#8217;s) slaves; and he will be shown his final abode either to Jannah or to Hell.</span><span style="font-size:small;">&#8221; It was asked: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, what about the horses?&#8221; Upon this he (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-size:small;">The horses are of three types. One, which is a burden for the owner; another which is a shield, and another one which makes its owner entitled to reward. The one for whom these are a burden is the person who rears them for show or for pride or for causing injury to the sentiments of the Muslims. They will be a cause of torment for their owners. The one for whom these are a shield is the person who rears them for the sake of Allah but does not forget the Right of Allah concerning their backs and their necks (i.e., he lets a needy ride on them), and so they are a shield for him. Those which bring reward to the one who rears them in pastures and gardens are the ones that are used in the Cause of Allah (Jihad) by the Muslims. Whatever they eat from the meadows and the gardens will be recorded on his behalf as good deeds so much so that their droppings and urine will be counted for an equal number of good deeds for him. Even when they break their tying rope and every height from which they climb and every hoofprint which they leave will be counted as a good deed on behalf of the owner.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Taken from Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">by The <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ </em>Muhammad Naasiruddeen al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 1046 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There are three things, whoever does them then he has tasted the flavour of <em>Eemaan</em>: whoever worshipped Allaah Alone, and there is none worthy of worship except Allaah<strong><em>,</em></strong> and whoever gives of his wealth as a means of goodness from himself being concerned to give it every year, not giving (from livestock) which is old and decrepit, mangy or sick or an animal that is small and unpleasant which is stingy with its milk, but rather he gives from the average of his wealth as indeed Allaah does not ask you for the best of it and He does not order the worst of it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Al-Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘In the narrations of Tabarani and al-Bayhaqi an extra wording mentions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And he purified his soul. So a man said: ‘and what is purifying the soul?’ He said: ‘That he knows that Allaah –Azza wa Jal – is with him wherever he is.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This chain is authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Benefit</strong><strong>:</strong> the saying of the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- :</em>‘that Allaah –Azza wa Jal – is with himwherever he is.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Imaam Muhammad bin Yahya ad-Dhuhali said: ‘He meant that Allaah’s Knowledge is in every place, whilst Allaah is upon His <em>‘Arsh</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was quoted by Hafidh Dhahabi in his book ‘al-Uloo’ No. 73, with my research and summary. As for the saying of the common folk and many of thenotable people that Allaah is present in every place or in everything that exists, by which they mean His physical presence, then this is misguidance. Ratherit (this saying) is taken from the statement<em>‘Wahdatul Wajood’</em> (Unity of existence) propagatedby the extreme Soofis, those who do not differentiate between The Creator and the creationwho believe, as one of their senior ones said: ‘everything that you see with your eyes is Allaah!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah be exalted far and high above what they say about Him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his Family, his Companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AUTHOR: Imaam Muhammad bin Saalih Al-&#8216;Uthaimeen<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p><strong>About the Book: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a complete translation of the booklet Fusool fis-Siyaam war-Taraweeh waz-Zakaat (Lessons on Fasting, Taraaweeh and Zakaat) written by Imaam Muhammad bin Saalih Al Uthaimeen, may Allaah have mercy on him. The source used for this on-line publication was the version of the book available on binothaimeen.org.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this treatise, Imaam Ibn Al-Uthaimeen discusses various topics concerning Ramadaan, such as fasting, the Taraaweeh prayer and Zakaat-ul-Fitr. He also includes two sections on Zakaat and those who are entitled to receive it since it is the custom of many people to give out their yearly Zakaat during this blessed month of Ramadaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author presents the material broken down into eight short lessons, including proofs and evidences for his points. At times, he goes into detail regarding some issues and gives the correct scholarly opinion with regard to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We hope that this treatise can benefit the English speaking Muslims as we are now well into the month of Ramadaan for this year.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/lessons-on-fasting-taraweeh-and-zakaat-shaykh-uthaymeen-al-ibaanah-com.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>Download PDF eBook Here</strong></a>]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 align="Center"><a href="#">Imam Al-Nawawi&#8217;s Riyad-us-Saliheen</a><br />
Chapter 216<br />
The Excellence and Obligation of the Payment of Zakat</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>And perform Salat (Iqamat-as-Salat), and give Zakat.</b></span><b>&#8221; (2:43</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>)</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allah, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him), and perform As-Salat (Iqamat-as-Salat) and give Zakat, and that is the right religion.</b></span><b>&#8221; (98:5)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Take Sadaqah (alms) from their wealth in order to purify them and sanctify them with it</b></span><b>.&#8221; (9:103)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1206.</b>  Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">(The structure of) Islam is built on five (pillars): Testification of `La ilaha illallah&#8217; (none has the right to be worshipped but Allah), that Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) is his slave and Messenger, the establishment of Salat, the payment of Zakat, the pilgrimage to the House of Allah (Ka`bah), and Saum during the month of Ramadan</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1207.</b>  Talhah bin `Ubaidullah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A person with dishevelled hair, one of the people of Najd, came to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). We heard the humming of his voice but could not fully understand what he was saying, till he approached close to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). Then I came to know that he was asking about Islam. The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">There are five (obligatory) Salat during the day and the night.</span>&#8221; He said: &#8220;Am I obliged to perform any other (Salat) besides these?&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">No, but whatever you observe voluntarily</span>.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) added, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">There is the Saum of Ramadan</span>.&#8221; The inquirer asked: &#8220;Am I obliged to do anything besides this?&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">No, but whatever you do out of your own free will. You may observe voluntary fasting</span>.&#8221; And the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) told him about the Zakat (obligatory charity). The inquirer asked: &#8220;Am I obliged to pay anything besides this?&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">No, but whatever you pay voluntarily out of your own free will</span>.&#8221; That man turned back saying: &#8220;By Allah! I will neither make any addition to this nor will I decrease anything from it.&#8221; (Upon hearing this) the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) remarked, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He is successful if he proves truthful (to what he is saying</span>).&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1208.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) appointed Mu`adh (May Allah be pleased with him) as governor of Yemen, and at the time of his departure, he instructed him thus: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">First of all, call the people to testify `La ilaha illallah&#8217; (there is no true god except Allah) and that I (Muhammad) am the Messenger of Allah, and if they accept this (declaration of Faith), then tell them that Allah has enjoined upon them five Salat during the day and night; and if they obey you, tell them that Allah has made the payment of Zakat obligatory upon them. It should be collected from their rich and distributed among their poor</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1209.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">I have been commanded to fight people till they testify `La ilaha illallah&#8217; (there is no true god except Allah) that Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) is his slave and Messenger, and they establish Salat, and pay Zakat; and if they do this, their blood (life) and property are secured except when justified by law, and it is for Allah to call them to account</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1210.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> When the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) passed away, Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) was appointed as his successor (caliph). Amongst the Arabs some men apostatised. Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) resolved to fight them. `Umar bin Al-Khattab (May Allah be pleased with him) said to Abu Bakr: &#8220;How can you fight them when the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) has declared: `I have been commanded to fight people till they testify La ilaha illallah (there is no true god except Allah); and if they do it, their blood (life) and property are secured except when justified by law, and it is for Allah to call them to account.&#8221; Upon this Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) said: &#8220;By Allah, I would definitely fight him who makes distinction between Salat and the Zakat, because it is an obligation upon the rich to pay Zakat. By Allah I will fight them even to secure the piece of rope which they used to give to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam).&#8221; `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) said: &#8220;I realized that Allah opened the heart of Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) for fighting those who refused to pay Zakat, and I fully recognized that Abu Bakr ¨(May Allah be pleased with him) was right.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1211.</b> Abu Ayyub (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A man said to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam): &#8220;Direct me to a deed which may admit me to Jannah.&#8221; Upon this he (the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Worship Allah and never associate anything with Him in worship, establish Salat, pay Zakat, and strengthen the ties of kinship</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1212.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A bedouin came to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Direct me to a deed by which I may be entitled to enter Jannah.&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Worship Allah, and never associate anything with Him, establish Salat, pay the Zakat which has been enjoined upon you, and observe Saum of Ramadan</span>.&#8221; He (the bedouin) said: &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I will never add anything to these (obligations).&#8221; When he turned his back, the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who wants to see a man from the dwellers of Jannah, let him look at him (bedouin)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1213.</b> Jarir bin `Abdullah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> I pledged allegiance to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) to establish Salat, to pay the Zakat and to have the welfare of every Muslim at heart</span>.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1214.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Any person who possesses gold or silver and does not pay what is due on it (i.e., the Zakat); on the Day of Resurrection, sheets of silver and gold would be heated for him in the fire of Hell and with them his flank, forehead and back will be branded. When they cool down, they will be heated again and the same process will be repeated during the day the measure whereof will be fifty thousand years. (This would go on) until Judgement is pronounced among (Allah&#8217;s) slaves, and he will be shown his final abode, either to Jannah or to Hell</span>.&#8221; It was asked, &#8220;How about someone who owns camels and does not pay what is due on him (i.e., their Zakat)?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">In the same way the owner of camels who does not discharge what is due in respect of them (their due includes their milking on the day when they are taken to water) will be thrown on his face or on his back in a vast desert plain on the Day of Resurrection and they will trample upon him with their hoofs and bite him with their teeth. As often as the first of them passes him, the last of them will be made to return during a day the measure whereof will be fifty thousand years, until Judgement is pronounced among (Allah&#8217;s) slaves, he will be shown his final abode either to Jannah or to Hell</span>.&#8221; It was (again) asked: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, what about cows (cattle) and sheep?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">If anyone who possesses cattle and sheep and does not pay what is due on them (i.e., their Zakat); on the Day of Resurrection, he will be thrown on his face in a vast plain desert. He will find none of the animals missing with twisted horns, without horns or with a broken horn, and they will gore him with their horns and trample upon him with their hoofs. As often as the first of them passes him, the last of them will be made to return to him during a day the measure whereof will be fifty thousand years, until Judgement is pronounced among (Allah&#8217;s) slaves; and he will be shown his final abode either to Jannah or to Hell.</span>&#8221; It was asked: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, what about the horses?&#8221; Upon this he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The horses are of three types. One, which is a burden for the owner; another which is a shield, and another one which makes its owner entitled to reward. The one for whom these are a burden is the person who rears them for show or for pride or for causing injury to the sentiments of the Muslims. They will be a cause of torment for their owners. The one for whom these are a shield is the person who rears them for the sake of Allah but does not forget the Right of Allah concerning their backs and their necks (i.e., he lets a needy ride on them), and so they are a shield for him. Those which bring reward to the one who rears them in pastures and gardens are the ones that are used in the Cause of Allah (Jihad) by the Muslims.

<h3 align="center"><span><em>The Book of Zakat (Kitab Al-Zakat) </em></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Of the five fundamentals of Islam, Zakat occupies the second positioin, the first being prayer (salat). This word is derived from Zakd, which means it (a plant) grew. The second derivative of this word carries the sense of purificatin, e. g. Qad aflaha man zakkaha (he is indeed successful who purified himself). The other word used for zakat both in the Qur&#8217;an and the Hadith is sadaqa which is derived from sidq (the truth). Both these words are highly meaningful. The spending of wealth for the sake of Allah purifies the heart of man of the love of material wealth. The man who spends it offers that as a humble gift before the Lord and thus affirms the truth that nothing is dearer to him in life than the love of Allah and that he is full prepared to sacrifice everything for His sake. Secondly, zakat is the most effective measure to improve the economic condition of the have-nots. It is not, however, a mere tax, but a form of worship whereby a man comes close to his Lord. The Muslims have, therefore, been enjoined to pay zakat with the same sense of earnestness and devotion in which the seeker of the Lord observes the prayer. The primary motive of zakat is religious and spiritual, while the social and economic aspects are subservient to it. Its social significance is that it awakens in man the sense of brotherhood with less fortunate members of society, and stirs his moral conscience to make sacrifice for their sake. From the economic point of view it discourages hoarding and concentration of wealth and helps its steady and constant flow from the rich to the poor. It is in fact a good means of providing purchasing power to the poor, for ameliorating their hard lot and enabling them to stand on their own legs. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It should also be remembered that zakat or sadaqa in Islam is not a voluntary act of charity which a rich man gives to the poor out of his own sweet will, but it is an obligatory act which every Muslim is enjoined upon to perform if he is sincere in his belief in God and the Hereafter. Thus there is no burden of obligation on one who receives zakat, but a sense of thankfulness and gratitude on the part of the giver, since he has been enabled by the recipient to discharge his obligation that he owes to God and society. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>(O Prophet), take sadaqa (zakat) out of their property-thou wouldst cleanse them and purify them thereby (Qur&#8217;an, ix. 103). And away from it (the Hell) shall be kept the most faithful to duty who gives his wealth, purifying himself (xcii. 17-18). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>So much is the importance of zakat in Islam that it has been mentioned at eightytwo places in the Qur&#8217;an in close connection with prayer. The Companions of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) knew its basic importance in Islam. It is a known fact that after the death of the Apostle of Allah (may peace he upon him) when some of the tribes, who believed in the oneness of God and observed prayer, refused to pay zakat, the first Caliph Abu Bakr Siddiq (Allah be pleased with him), in an answer to the advice of Hadrat &#8216;Umar (Allah be pleased with him) to show tolerance towards such people. said in explicit terms, By Allah, I would definitely wage war against them who dissociate prayer from Zakat. Zakat is paid on the surplus of wealth which is left over after the passage of a year. It is thus a payment on the accumulated wealth. Leaving aside animals and agricultural yield, zakat is paid at almost a uniform rate of two and a half %. The minimum standard of surplus wealth over which zakat is charged is known as Nisab. It differs with different kinds of property, the most important being 200 dirhams or 521 tolas (nearly 21 oz.) In case of silver, and 20 mithqals or 71 tolas (nearly 3 oz.) in case of gold. The nisab of cash is the same as that of gold and silver. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>As regards the persons to whom zakat is to be paid, they have been clearly described in the Holy Qur&#8217;an: Alms are only for the poor, the needy, the officials charged with the duty of collection, those whose hearts are inclined to truth, the ransoming of captives, those in debt, in the way of Allah, and the wayfarer (ix 60). </span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Abu Huraira reported Allah&#8217;s Messenger (way peace be upon him) as saying: If any owner of gold or silver does not pay what is due on him, when the Day of Resurrection would come, plates of fire would be beaten out for him; these would then be heated in the fire of Hell and his sides, his forehead and his back would be cauterized with them. Whenever these cool down, (the process is) repeated during a day the extent of which would be fifty thousand years, until judgment is pronounced among servants, and he sees whether his path is to take him to Paradise or to Hell. It was said: Messenger of Allah, what about the camel? He (the Holy Prophet) said: If any owner of the camel does not pay what is due on him, and of his due in that (camel) is (also) to milk it on the day when it comes down to water. When the Day of Resurrection comes a soft sandy plain would be set for him, as extensive as possible, (he will find) that not a single young one is missing, and they will trample him with their hoofs and bite him with their mouths. As often as the first of them passes him, the last of them would be made to return during a day the extent of which would be fifty thousand years, until judgment is pronounced among servants and he sees whether his path is to take him to Paradise or to Hell. It was (again) said: Messenger of Allah, what about cows (cattle) and sheep? He said: It any owner of the cattle and sheep does not pay what is due on them, when the Day of Resurrection comes a soft sandy plain would be spread for them, he will find none of them missing, with twisted horns, without horns or with a broken horn, and they will gore him with their horns and trample him with their hoofs. As often as the first of them passes him the last of them would be made to return to him during a day the extent of which would be fifty thousand years, until judgment would be pronounced among the servants. And he would be shown his path-path leading him to Paradise or to Hell. It was said: Messenger of Allah, what about the horse? Upon this he said: The horses are of three types. To one than (these are) a burden, and to another man (these are) a covering, and still to another man (these are) a source of reward. The one for whom these are a burden is the person who rears them in order to show off, for vainglory and for opposing the Muslims; so they are a burden for him. The one for whom these are a covering is the person who rears them for the sake of Allah but does not forget the right of Allah concerning their backs and their necks, and so they are a covering for him. As for those which bring reward (these refer to) the person who rears them for the sake of Allah to be used for Muslims and he puts them in meadow and field. And whatever thing do these eat from that meadow and field would be recorded on his behalf as good deeds, as would also the amount of their dung and urine. And these would not break their halter and prance a course or two without having got recorded the amount of their hoof marks and their dung as a good deed on his behalf (on behalf of their owner). And their master does not bring them past a river from which they drink, though he did not intend to quench their thirst, but Allah would record for him the amount of what they drink on his behalf as deeds. It was said: Messenger of Allah, what about the asses?, Upon this he said: Nothing has been revealed to me in regard to the asses (in particular) except this one verse of a comprehensive nature:&#8221; He who does an atom&#8217;s weight of good will see it, and he who does an atom&#8217;s weight of evil will see it&#8221; (xcix. 7)</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Abu Huraira reported Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: No owner of the treasure who does not pay Zakat (would be spared) but (his hoards) would be heated in the Fire of Hell and these would be made into plates and with these his sides, his forehead would be cauterised till Allah would pronounce judgment among His servants during a day, the extent of which would be fifty thousand years. He would then see his path, leading either to Paradise or to Hell. And no owner of the camels who does not pay Zakat (would be spared) but a soft sandy plain would be set for him and they (the camels) would be made to pass over him till the last of them would be made to return till Allah would pronounce judgment among His servants during a day the extent of which would be fifty thousand years. He would then see his path leading him to Paradise or leading him to Hell. And no owner of the (cattle and) goats who does not pay Zakat (would be spared) but a soft sandy plain would be set for him, he would find none of them missing, with twisted horns, without horns, or with broken horns, and they will gore him with their horns and trample him with their hoofs and they would be made to pass over him till the last of them would be made to return till Allah would pronounce judgment among His servants, during a day the extent of which would be fdty thousand years, and he would see the paths leading to Paradise or to Hell. Suhail said: I do not know whether he made mention of the cows. They said: Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), what about the horses? He said: The horses have goodness in their foreheads (or he said) or goodness is ingrained in the foreheads of the horses (Suhail said: I am in doubt as to what was actually said) up till the Day of judgement. The horses are of three kinds. They are a source of reward to a person, they are a covering to a person, and they are a burden to a person. As for those which bring reward is that a person would get reward who rears them for the sake of Allah and trains them for Him, and nothing disappears in their stomachs but Allah would record for him a good deed. And if they were to graze in the meadow, they would eat nothing but Allah would record for him a reward. And if they were to drink water from the canal, with every drop that, would disappear in their stomachs there would be reward (for the owner). He went on describing till a reward was mentioned for their urine and dung. And if they pranced a course or two, there would be recorded a reward for every pace that they covered. As for one for whom they are a covering, he is the man who rears them for honour and dignity but does not forget the right of their backs and their stomachs, in plenty and adversity, As regards one for whom they are a burden, he is that who rears them for vainglory and showing off to the people; for him they are, the burden. They said: Messenger of Allah, what about asses? He said: Allah has not revealed to me anything in regards to it except this one comprehensive verse:&#8221; He who does an atom&#8217;s weight of good will see it, and he who does an atom&#8217;s weight of evil will see it&#8221; (xcix. 7).</span></p>

And no owner of the treasure who does not pay its due but his treasure would come on the Day of Resurrection like a bald snake and would pursue him with its mouth open, and when it would come near he would run away from it, and he would be called thus:&#8221; Take your treasure which you concealed, for I do not need it.&#8221; When he would find no way out he would put his hand in its mouth and it would gnaw it like a he-camel.

The Messenger of Allah (way peace by upon him) said: Abu Dharr! I said: Messenger of Allah, I am here at thy beck and call. He said: What I desire is that Uhud be gold with me and three nights should pass and there is left with me any dinar but one coin which I would keep to pay debt. (I love) to spend it among the servants of Allah like this and he pointed in front of him, and on his right side and on his left side. We then proceeded on and he said: Abu Dharr. I said: At thy beck and call, Messenger of Allah. He (the Holy Prophet) said: The rich would be poor on the Day of Resurrection, but he who spent like this and like this and like this, and he pointed as at the first time. We again went on when he said. Abu Dharr, stay where you are till I come back to you. He (the Holy Prophet) then moved on till he disappeared from my sight He (Abu Dharr) said: I heard a sound and I heard a noise. I said (to myself): The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) might have met (mishap or an enemy). I wished to follow him but I remembered his command for not departing till he would come back. So I waited for him, and when he came I made a mention of what I heard. He said: it was Gabriel, who came to me and said:&#8221; He who dies among your Ummah without associating Anything with Allah would enter Paradise. I said: Even if he committed fornication or theft?

I thought that he did not like anyone walking along with him. So I began to walk in the light of the moon. He, however turned his attention to me and saw me and said: Who is this? I said: It is Abu Dharr. Let Allah make me as ransom for you. He said: Abu Dharr, come on. He (Abu Dharr) said: So I walked along with him for some time and he said: The wealthy persons would have little (reward) on the Day of Resurrection, except upon whom Allah conferred goodness (wealth). He dispensed it to his right, left, in front of him and at his back (just as the wind diffuses fragrance) and did good with it (riches). I went along with him for some time when He said: Sit here. And he made me sit at a safe place and there were stones around it, and he said to me: Sit here till I come to you. He went away on the stony ground till I could not see him. He stayed away from me, and he prolonged his stay. Then I heard him as he came back and he was saying: Even if he committed theft and even if he committed fornication. When he came I could not help asking him: Apostle of Allah, let Allah make me ransom for you, whom were you speaking on the stony ground? I heard nobody responding to you. He (the Holy Prophet) said: It was Gabriel who met me by the side of the stony ground and said: Give glad tidings to your Ummah that he who died without associating ought with Allah would go into Paradise.

I saw the sun (shining) on me and I thought that he would send me on an errand for him. So I said: I see it. Upon this he said: Nothing would delight me more than this that I should have gold like it (equal to the bulk of Uhud), and I should spend it all except three dinars. (How sad it is) that they hoard worldly riches, and they know nothing. I said: What about you and your brothers Quraish? You do not go to thein for any need and do not accept anything from them.

Jarir reported on the authority of his father: While we were in the company of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) in the early hours of the morning, some people came there (who) were barefooted, naked, wearing striped woollen clothes, or cloaks, with their swords hung (around their necks). Most of them, nay, all of them, belonged to the tribe of Mudar. The colour of the face of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) underwent a change when he saw them in poverty. He then entered (his house) and came out and commanded Bilal (to pronounce Adhan). He pronounced Adhan and Iqima, and he (the Holy Prophet) observed prayer (along with his Companion) and then addressed (them reciting verses of the Holy Qur&#8217;an): &#8216;&#8221; 0 people, fear your Lord, Who created you from a single being&#8221; to the end of the verse,&#8221; Allah is ever a Watcher over you&#8221; (iv. 1). (He then recited) a verse of Sura Hashr:&#8221; Fear Allah. and let every soul consider that which it sends forth for the morrow and fear Allah&#8221; (lix. 18). (Then the audience began to vie with one another in giving charity.) Some donated a dinar, others a dirham, still others clothes, some donated a sa&#8217; of wheat, some a sa&#8217; of dates; till he (the Holy Prophet) said: (Bring) even if it is half a date. Then a person from among the Ansar came there with a money bag which his hands could scarcely lift; in fact, they could not (lift). Then the people followed continuously, till I saw two heaps of eatables and clothes, and I saw the face of the Messenger (may peace be upon him) glistening, like gold (on account of joy). The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: He who sets a good precedent in Islam, there is a reward for him for this (act of goodness) and reward of that also who acted according to it subsequently, without any deduction from their rewards; and he who sets in Islam an evil precedent, there is upon him the burden of that, and the burden of him also who acted upon it subsequently, without any deduction from their burden.</span></p>

It eats and when its flanks are distended, it faces the sun, it chews the cud, it has dunged and urinated. it returns and eats. This wealth is green and sweet, and he who accepts it and applies it rightly, finds it a good help, but he who takes it wrongfully is like one who eats without being satisfied.</span></p>

A person said: Messenger of Allah, does good produce evil? The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) remained silent. And it was said to him (the man who had asked the question from the Holy Prophet): What Is the matter with you, that you speak with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) but he does not speak with you? We thought as if revelation was descending upon him. He regained himself and wiped the sweat from him and said: He was the inquirer (and his style of expression showed as if he praised him and then added): Verily good does not produce evil. Whatever the spring rainfall causes to grow kills or is about to kill, but that (animal) which feeds on vegetation. It eats till its flanks are filled; it faces the sun and dungs and urinates. and then returns to eat. And this Wealth is a sweet vegetation, and it is a good companion for a Muslim who gives out of it to the needy, to the orphan. to the wayfarer, or something like that as the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: He who takes it without his right is like one who eats but does not feel satisfied, and it would stand witness against him on the Day of judgment.</span></p>

Zaid reported that when the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) conquered Hunain he distributed the booty, and he bestowed upon those whose hearts it was intended to win. It was conveyed to him (the Holy Prophet) that the Ansar cherished a desire that they should be given (that very portion) which the people (of Quraish) had got. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) stood up and, after having praised Allah and lauded Him, addressed them thus: 0 people of Ansar, did I not find you erring and Allah guided you aright through me, and (in the state of) being destitute and Allah made you free from want through me, and in a state of disunity and Allah united you through me, and they (the Ansar) said: Allah and His Messenger are most benevolent. He (again) said: Why do you not answer me? They said: Allah and His Messenger are the most benevolent. He said, If you wish you should say so and so, and the event (should take) such and such course (and in this connection he made a mention) of so many things. &#8216;Amr is under the impressionthat he has not been able to remember them. He (the Holy Prophet) further said: Don&#8217;t you feel happy (over this state of affairs) that the people should go away with goats and camels, and you go to your places along with the Messenger of Allah? The Ansar are inner garments (more close to me) and (other) people are outer garments. Had there not been migration, I would have been a man from among the Ansar. If the people were to tread a valley or a narrow path, I would tread the valley (chosen) by the Ansar or narrow path (trodden) by them. And you would soon find after me preferences (over you in getting material benefits). So you should show patience till you meet me at the Haud (Kauthar).</span></p>

A person among the people then sought permission (from the Holy Prophet) for his murder. According to some, it was Khalid b. Walid who sought the permission.

A person from among his (Prophet&#8217;s) Companions said: We had a better claim to this (wealth) than these (persons). This (remark) reached the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) upon which he said: Will you not trust me, whereas I am a trustee of Him Who is in the heaven? The news come to me from the heaven morning and evening. Then there stood up a person with deep snnken eyes, prominent cheek bones, and elevated forehead, thick beard, shaven head, tucked up loin cloth, and he said: Messenger of Allah, fear Allah. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Woe to thee. do I not deserve most to fear Allah amongst the people of the earth? That man then returned. Khalid b. Walid then said: Messenger of Allah, should I not strike his neck? Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) said: Perhaps he may be observing the prayer. Khalid said: How many observers of prayer are there who profess with their tongue what is not in their heart? Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: I have not been commanded to pierce through the hearts of people, nor to split their bellies (insides). He again looked at him and he was going back. Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) said: There would arise a people from the progeny of this (man) who would recite the Qur&#8217;an glibly, but it would not go beyond their throats; they would (hurriedly) pass through (the teachings of their) religion just as the arrow passes through the prey.

I heard the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) as saying: There would arise at the end of the age a people who would be young in age and immature in thought, but they would talk (in such a manner) as if their words are the best among the creatures. They would recite the Qur&#8217;an, but it would not go beyond their throats, and they would pass through the religion as an arrow goes through the prey. So when you meet them, kill them, for in their killing you would get a reward with Allah on the Day of judgmelat.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Zaid b. Wahb Jahani reported and he was among the squadron which wall under the command of Ali (Allah be pleased with him) and which set out (to curb the activities) of the Khwarij. &#8216;Ali (Allah be pleased with him) said: 0 people, I heard the Messeinger of Allah (may peace be upon him) say: There would arise from my Ummah a people who would recite the Qur&#8217;an, and your recital would seem insignificant as compared with their recital, your prayer as compared with their prayer, arid your fast, as compared with their fast. They would recite the Qur&#8217;an thinking that it sup- ports them, whereas it is an evidence against them. Their prayer does not get beyond their collar bone; they would swerve through Islam just as the arrow passes through the prey. If the squadron which is to encounter them were to know (what great boon) has been assured to them by their Apostle (may peace be upon him) they would completely rely upon this deed (alone and cease to do other good deeds), and their (that of the Khwarij) distinctive mark is that there would be (among them) a person whose wrist would be without the arm, and the end of his wrist would be fleshy like the nipple of the breast on which there would be white hair. You would be marching towards Muawiya and the people of Syria and you would leave them behind among your children and your property (to do harm). By Allah, I believe that these are the people (against whom you have been commanded to fight and get reward) for they have shed forbidden blood, and raided the animals of the people. So go forth in the name of Allah (to fight against them). Salama b. Kuhail mentioned that Zaid b. Wahb made me alight at every stage, till we crossed a bridge. &#8216;Abdullah b. Wahb al-Rasibi was at the head of the Khwarij when we encountered them. He (&#8216;Abdullah) said to his army: Throw the spears and draw out your swords from their sheaths, for I fear that they would attack you as they attacked you on the day of Harura. They went back and threw their spears and drew out their swords, and people fought against them with spears and they were killed one after another. Only two persons were killed among the people (among the army led by Hadrat &#8216;Ali) on that day. &#8216;Ali (Allah be pleased with him) said: Find out from among them (the dead bodies of the Khwarij) (the maimed). They searched but did not find him. &#8216;Ali (Allah be pleased with him) then himself stood up and (walked) till he came to the people who had been killed one after another. He (&#8216;Ali) said: Search them to the last, and then (&#8216;Ali&#8217;s companions) found him (the dead body of the maimed) near the earth. He (Hadrat &#8216;Ali) then pronounced Allah-O-Akbar (Allah is the Greatest) and then said, Allah told the Truth and His Messenger (may peace be upon him) conveyed it. Then there stood before him &#8216;Abida Salmani who said: Commander of the Believers, by Allah, besides Whom there is no god but He, (tell me) whether you heard this hadith from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). He said: Yes, by Allah, besides Whom there is no god but He. He asked him to take an oath thrice and he took the oath.</span></p>

Abu Talib (Allah be pleased with him) they said,&#8221; There is no command but that of Allah.&#8221; Upon this &#8216;Ali said: The statement is true but it is intentionally applied (to support) a wrong (cause). The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him described their characteristics and I found these characteristics in them. They state the truth with their tongue, but it does not go beyond this part of their bodies (and the narrator pointed towards his throat). The most hateful among the creation of Allah us one black man among them (Khwarij). One of his hand is like the teat of a goat or the nipple of the breast. When &#8216;Ali b. Abu Talib (Allah be pleased with him) killed them, he said: Search (for his dead body). They searched for him, but they did not find it (his dead body). Upon this he said: Go (and search for him). By Allah, neither I have spoken a lie nor has the lie been spoken to me. &#8216;Ali said this twice and thrice. They then found him (the dead body) in a rain. They brought (his dead) body till they placed it before him (Hadrat &#8216;Ali). &#8216;Ubaidullah said: And, I was present at (that place) when this happened and when &#8216;Ali said about them.

He then entered (the apartment) and we also went in and he (the Holy Prophet) was on that day (in the house of) Zainab b. jahsh. We urged each (of us) to speak. Then one of us thus spoke: Messenger of Allah, you are the best of humanity and the best to cement the ties of blood-relations. We have reached the-marriageable age. We have come (to you) so that you may appoint us (as collectors) of these sadaqat. and we would pay you just as thin people (other collectors) pay you, and get our share as others get it. He (the Holy Prophet) kept silence for a long time till we wished that we should speak with him (again), and Zainab pointied to us from behind the curtain not to talk (any more). He (the Holy Prophet) said; It does not become the family of Muhammad (to accept) sadaqat for they are the impurities of people. You call to me Mahmiya (and he was in charge of khums, i. e, of the one-fifth part that goes to the treasury out of the spoils of war), and Naufal b. Harith b. &#8216;Abd al-Muttalib.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I passed by a place called Ar-Rabadha and by chance I met  Abu Dhar and asked him, &#8220;What has brought you to this place?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I  was in Sham and differed with Muawiya on the meaning of (the following verses of the  Quran): &#8216;They who hoard up gold and silver and spend them not in the way of Allah.&#8217;  (9.34). Muawiya said, &#8216;This verse is revealed regarding the people of the  scriptures.&#8221; I said, It was revealed regarding us and also the people of the  scriptures.&#8221; So we had a quarrel and Mu&#8217;awiya sent a complaint against me to &#8216;Uthman.  &#8216;Uthman wrote to me to come to Medina, and I came to Medina. Many people came to me as if  they had not seen me before. So I told this to &#8216;Uthman who said to me, &#8220;You may  depart and live nearby if you wish.&#8221; That was the reason for my being here for even  if an Ethiopian had been nominated as my ruler, I would have obeyed him . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was sitting with some people from Quraish, a man  with very rough hair, clothes, and appearance came and stood in front of us, greeted us  and said, &#8220;Inform those who hoard wealth, that a stone will be heated in the  Hell-fire and will be put on the nipples of their breasts till it comes out from the bones  of their shoulders and then put on the bones of their shoulders till it comes through the  nipples of their breasts the stone will be moving and hitting.&#8221; After saying that,  the person retreated and sat by the side of the pillar, I followed him and sat beside him,  and I did not know who he was. I said to him, &#8220;I think the people disliked what you  had said.&#8221; He said, &#8220;These people do not understand anything, although my friend  told me.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;Who is your friend?&#8221; He said, &#8220;The Prophet said  (to me), &#8216;O Abu Dhar! Do you see the mountain of Uhud?&#8217; And on that I (Abu Dhar) started  looking towards the sun to judge how much remained of the day as I thought that Allah&#8217;s  Apostle wanted to send me to do something for him and I said, &#8216;Yes!&#8217; He said, &#8216;I do not  love to have gold equal to the mountain of Uhud unless I spend it all (in Allah&#8217;s cause)  except three Dinars (pounds). These people do not understand and collect worldly wealth.  No, by Allah, Neither I ask them for worldly benefits nor am I in need of their religious  advice till I meet Allah, The Honorable, The Majestic.&#8221; &#8216; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was sitting with Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) two  person came to him; one of them complained about his poverty and the other complained  about the prevalence of robberies. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;As regards stealing and  robberies, there will shortly come a time when a caravan will go to Mecca (from Medina)  without any guard. And regarding poverty, The Hour (Day of Judgment) will not be  established till one of you wanders about with his object of charity and will not find  anybody to accept it And (no doubt) each one of you will stand in front of Allah and there  will be neither a curtain nor an interpreter between him and Allah, and Allah will ask  him, &#8216;Did not I give you wealth?&#8217; He will reply in the affirmative. Allah will further  ask, &#8216;Didn&#8217;t I send a messenger to you?&#8217; And again that person will reply in the  affirmative Then he will look to his right and he will see nothing but Hell-fire, and then  he will look to his left and will see nothing but Hell-fire. And so, any (each one) of you  should save himself from the fire even by giving half of a date-fruit (in charity). And if  you do not find a half date-fruit, then (you can do it through saying) a good pleasant  word (to your brethren). (See Hadith No. 793 Vol. 4). </font></p>

Which charity is the most superior in reward?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;The charity  which you practice while you are healthy, niggardly and afraid of poverty and wish to  become wealthy. Do not delay it to the time of approaching death and then say, &#8216;Give so  much to such and such, and so much to such and such.&#8217; And it has already belonged to such  and such (as it is too late).&#8221; </font></p>

(When Zainab bint Jahsh died first of  all in the caliphate of &#8216;Umar), we came to know that the long hand was a symbol of  practicing charity, so she was the first to follow the Prophet and she used to love to  practice charity.

You need not be afraid of it as there is a closed door  between you and it.&#8217; He asked, &#8216;Will the door be broken or opened?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;No, it  will be broken.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Then, if it is broken, it will never be closed again?&#8217; I  replied, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; &#8221; Then we were afraid to ask what that door was, so we asked Masruq  to inquire, and he asked Hudhaifa regarding it. Hudhaifa said, &#8220;The door was &#8216;Umar.  &#8220;We further asked Hudhaifa whether &#8216;Umar knew what that door meant. Hudhaifa replied  in the affirmative and added, &#8220;He knew it as one knows that there will be a night  before the tomorrow morning.&#8221; </font></p>

These are the orders for compulsory charity (Zakat) which Allah&#8217;s Apostle had made  obligatory for every Muslim, and which Allah had ordered His Apostle to observe: Whoever  amongst the Muslims is asked to pay Zakat accordingly, he should pay it (to the Zakat  collector) and whoever is asked more than that (what is specified in this script) he  should not pay it; for twenty-four camels or less, sheep are to be paid as Zakat; for  every five camels one sheep is to be paid, and if there are between twenty-five to  thirty-five camels, one Bint Makhad is to be paid; and if they are between thirty-six to  forty-five (camels), one Bint Labun is to be paid; and if they are between forty-six to  sixty (camels), one Hiqqa is to be paid; and if the number is between sixty-one to  seventy-five (camels), one Jadh&#8217;a is to be paid; and if the number is between seventy-six  to ninety (camels), two Bint Labuns are to be paid; and if they are from ninety-one to  one-hundred-and twenty (camels), two Hiqqas are to be paid; and if they are over  one-hundred and-twenty (camels), for every forty (over one-hundred-and-twenty) one Bint  Labun is to be paid, and for every fifty camels (over one-hundred-and-twenty) one Hiqqa is  to be paid; and who ever has got only four camels, has to pay nothing as Zakat, but if the  owner of these four camels wants to give something, he can. If the number of camels  increases to five, the owner has to pay one sheep as Zakat. As regards the Zakat for the  (flock) of sheep; if they are between forty and one-hundred-and-twenty sheep, one sheep is  to be paid; and if they are between one-hundred-and-twenty to two hundred (sheep), two  sheep are to be paid; and if they are between two-hundred to three-hundred (sheep), three  sheep are to be paid; and for over three-hundred sheep, for every extra hundred sheep, one  sheep is to be paid as Zakat. And if somebody has got less than forty sheep, no Zakat is  required, but if he wants to give, he can. For silver the Zakat is one-fortieth of the lot  (i.e. 2.5%), and if its value is less than two-hundred Dirhams, Zakat is not required, but  if the owner wants to pay he can.&#8217; </font></p>

Allah, the Blessed, the Superior says: By no means shall you  attain righteousness, unless you spend (in charity) of that which you love. And no doubt,  Bairuha&#8217; garden is the most beloved of all my property to me. So I want to give it in  charity in Allah&#8217;s Cause. I expect its reward from Allah. O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Spend it  where Allah makes you think it feasible.&#8217; On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Bravo! It is  useful property.

Give alms, for I have seen that the majority of the  dwellers of Hell-Fire were you (women).&#8221; The women asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  What is the reason for it?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;O women! You curse frequently, and are  ungrateful to your husbands. I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and  religion than you. O women, some of you can lead a cautious wise man astray.&#8221; Then he  left.

Then she said, &#8220;O Prophet  of Allah! Today you ordered people to give alms and I had an ornament and intended to give  it as alms, but Ibn Masud said that he and his children deserved it more than anybody  else.&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Ibn Masud had spoken the truth. Your husband and  your children had more right to it than anybody else.&#8221; </font></p>

Then he said, &#8220;The things I am afraid of most for your sake (concerning what will  befall you after me) is the pleasures and splendors of the world and its beauties which  will be disclosed to you.&#8221; Somebody said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Can the good bring  forth evil?&#8221; The Prophet remained silent for a while. It was said to that person,  &#8220;What is wrong with you? You are talking to the Prophet (p.b.u.h) while he is not  talking to you.&#8221; Then we noticed that he was being inspired divinely. Then the  Prophet wiped off his sweat and said, &#8220;Where is the questioner?&#8221; It seemed as if  the Prophet liked his question. Then he said, &#8220;Good never brings forth evil. Indeed  it is like what grows on the banks of a water-stream which either kill or make the animals  sick, except if an animal eats its fill the Khadira (a kind of vegetable) and then faces  the sun, and then defecates and urinates and grazes again. No doubt this wealth is sweet  and green. Blessed is the wealth of a Muslim from which he gives to the poor, the orphans  and to needy travelers. (Or the Prophet said something similar to it) No doubt, whoever  takes it illegally will be like the one who eats but is never satisfied, and his wealth  will be a witness against him on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Zainab, the wife of &#8216;Abdullah said, &#8220;I was in the  Mosque and saw the Prophet (p.b.u.h) saying, &#8216;O women ! Give alms even from your  ornaments.&#8217; &#8221; Zainab used to provide for &#8216;Abdullah and those orphans who were under  her protection. So she said to &#8216;Abdullah, &#8220;Will you ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle whether it  will be sufficient for me to spend part of the Zakat on you and the orphans who are under  my protection?&#8221; He replied &#8220;Will you yourself ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221;  (Zainab added): So I went to the Prophet and I saw there an Ansari woman who was standing  at the door (of the Prophet ) with a similar problem as mine. Bilal passed by us and we  asked him, &#8216;Ask the Prophet whether it is permissible for me to spend (the Zakat) on my  husband and the orphans under my protection.&#8217; And we requested Bilal not to inform the  Prophet about us. So Bilal went inside and asked the Prophet regarding our problem. The  Prophet (p.b.u.h) asked, &#8220;Who are those two?&#8221; Bilal replied that she was Zainab.  The Prophet said, &#8220;Which Zainab?&#8221; Bilal said, &#8220;The wife of &#8216;Adullah (bin  Masud).&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes, (it is sufficient for her) and she will receive  a double rewards (for that): One for helping relatives, and the other for giving  Zakat.&#8221; </font></p>

But you are unfair in asking Zakat from Khalid as he is keeping  his armor for Allah&#8217;s Cause (for Jihad). As for Abbas bin &#8216;Abdul Muttalib, he is the uncle  of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) and Zakat is compulsory on him and he should pay it  double.&#8221; </font></p>

This property is like a sweet  fresh fruit; whoever takes it without greediness, he is blessed in it, and whoever takes  it with greediness, he is not blessed in it, and he is like a person who eats but is never  satisfied; and the upper (giving) hand is better than the lower (receiving) hand.&#8221;  Hakim added, &#8220;I said to Allah&#8217;s Apostle , &#8216;By Him (Allah) Who sent you with the  Truth, I shall never accept anything from anybody after you, till I leave this world.&#8217;  &#8221; Then Abu Bakr (during his caliphate) called Hakim to give him his share from the  war booty (like the other companions of the Prophet ), he refused to accept anything. Then  &#8216;Umar (during his caliphate) called him to give him his share but he refused. On that  &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Muslims! I would like you to witness that I offered Hakim his share  from this booty and he refused to take it.&#8221; So Hakim never took anything from anybody  after the Prophet till he died. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We took part in the holy battle of Tabuk in the company of  the Prophet and when we arrived at the Wadi-al-Qura, there was a woman in her garden. The  Prophet asked his companions to estimate the amount of the fruits in the garden, and  Allah&#8217;s Apostle estimated it at ten Awsuq (One Wasaq = 60 Sa&#8217;s) and 1 Sa&#8217;= 3 kg.  approximately). The Prophet said to that lady, &#8220;Check what your garden will  yield.&#8221; When we reached Tabuk, the Prophet said, &#8220;There will be a strong wind  to-night and so no one should stand and whoever has a camel, should fasten it.&#8221; So we  fastened our camels. A strong wind blew at night and a man stood up and he was blown away  to a mountain called Taiy, The King of Aila sent a white mule and a sheet for wearing to  the Prophet as a present, and wrote to the Prophet that his people would stay in their  place (and will pay Jizya taxation.) (1) When the Prophet reached Wadi-al-Qura he asked  that woman how much her garden had yielded. She said, &#8220;Ten Awsuq,&#8221; and that was  what Allah&#8217;s Apostle had estimated. Then the Prophet said, &#8220;I want to reach Medina  quickly, and whoever among you wants to accompany me, should hurry up.&#8221; The  sub-narrator Ibn Bakkar said something which meant: When the Prophet (p.b.u.h) saw Medina  he said, &#8220;This is Taba.&#8221; And when he saw the mountain of Uhud, he said,  &#8220;This mountain loves us and we love it. Shall I tell you of the best amongst the  Ansar?&#8221; They replied in the affirmative. He said, &#8220;The family of Bani-n-Najjar,  and then the family of Bani Sa&#8217;ida or Bani Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj. (The above-mentioned  are the best) but there is goodness in all the families of Ansar.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Some meat was presented to the Prophet (p.b.u.h) and it had  been given to Barira (the freed slave-girl of Aisha) in charity. He said, &#8220;This meat  is a thing of charity for Barira but it is a gift for us.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Ma&#8217;bad,: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(the slave of Ibn Abbas) Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to Muadh when  he sent him to Yemen, &#8220;You will go to the people of the Scripture. So, when you reach  there, invite them to testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and that  Muhammad is His Apostle. And if they obey you in that, tell them that Allah has enjoined  on them five prayers in each day and night. And if they obey you in that tell them that  Allah has made it obligatory on them to pay the Zakat which will be taken from the rich  among them and given to the poor among them. If they obey you in that, then avoid taking  the best of their possessions, and be afraid of the curse of an oppressed person because  there is no screen between his invocation and Allah.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever a person came to the Prophet with his alms, the  Prophet would say, &#8220;O Allah!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;A man from Bani Israel asked  someone from Bani Israel to give him a loan of one thousand Dinars and the later gave it  to him. The debtor went on a voyage (when the time for the payment of the debt became due)  but he did not find a boat, so he took a piece of wood and bored it and put 1000 diners in  it and threw it into the sea. The creditor went out and took the piece of wood to his  family to be used as fire-wood.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 488 B, Vol. 3). And the Prophet  narrated the narration (and said), &#8220;When he sawed the wood, he found his money.&#8221;  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) appointed a man called Ibn  Al-Lutbiya, from the tribe of Al-Asd to collect Zakat from Bani Sulaim. When he returned,  (after collecting the Zakat) the Prophet checked the account with him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Some people from &#8216;Uraina tribe came to Medina and its  climate did not suit them, so Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) allowed them to go to the herd of  camels (given as Zakat) and they drank their milk and urine (as medicine) but they killed  the shepherd and drove away all the camels. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent (men) in their pursuit  to catch them, and they were brought, and he had their hands and feet cut, and their eyes  were branded with heated pieces of iron and they were left in the Harra (a stony place at  Medina) biting the stones. (See Hadith No. 234, Vol. 1) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>took &#8216;Abdullah bin Abu Talha to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to perform  Tahnik for him. (Tahnik was a custom among the Muslims that whenever a child was born they  used to take it to the Prophet who would chew a piece of date and put a part of its juice  in the child&#8217;s mouth). I saw the Prophet and he had an instrument for branding in his  hands and was branding the camels of Zakat. </font></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fatawa on Zakah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Excerpted from Islamic Verdicts on the Pillars of Islam by Sheikh Muhammad Bin Salih Al-‘Uthaimeen, complied and arranged by Fahd Bin Nasir Ibrahim As-Sulaiman</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> What is the ruling on the Zakah of a rented house?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a rented house is rented out for profit, then there is no Zakah payable on the value of the house. The Zakah is only payable on the income that is generated from it if the hawl (passage of one Hijrah hear) is completed upon it from the time of the rental agreement. If the hawl has not been completed from the time of the rental agreement, then there is no Zakah payable upon it either.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, if the person rented out the house for ten thousand riyals, of which he receives five thousand at the time of the agreement which he spends. Then he receives five thousand in the middle of the year, which he spends before the end of the year, there is no Zakah upon him in this case. This is because the hawl has not been completed upon this money.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if he kept the house for sale and waited to receive the profit from it, but said: Since it has not been sold, I will rent it out,’ then in that case, he must pay Zakah for the value of the house because he has kept it for sale; he did not want to keep it and profit from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And everything which is intended for the purpose of trade and profit is liable for Zakah, according to the words of the Prophet (peace be upon him), “Deeds are according to intentions and every person shall have what he intended.” And Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A man has daughters and he gave them jewelry, and all the jewelry combined amounted to the nisab, but the jewelry of each of them did not amount to the nisab. Is all of the jewelry to be taken together for calculation and Zakah paid on it?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he gave this jewelry as a loan, then the jewelry is his property, and he must total it all and if that reaches the nisab, he must pay Zakah. But if he gave his daughters this jewelry with the intention that it was their property, then it is not incumbent upon him to combine the jewelry he gave to each one of them with the jewelry of the other daughters, because each of them owns it independently of the other. Based upon this, if the jewelry of one amounts to the nisab, she must pay Zakah for it, and if it does not, then she does not have to. And Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Is there Zakah payable on one’s personal car?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no Zakah payable on it. Everything a person uses for himself, except gold and silver jewelry, there is no Zakah to be paid on it, whether a car, a camel, a farm implement or anything else, according to a saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him), “<em>There is no Zakah payable by a Muslim on his slave, nor on his horse.</em>”[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Reported by Al-Bukhari in the book of Zakah, in the Chapter: No sadaqah is payable by the Musli for his Slave (1464) ; and by Muslim in the Book of Zakah, in the Chapter: There is no Zakah Incumbent Upon the Muslim for His Slave or His Horse (982).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Az-Zakah is Obligatory on the Wealth of the orphan and the Insane.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question: Is Az-Zakah obligatory on the wealth of the orphan and the insane?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Az-Zakah is obligatory on the wealth of each of them, if the person is a free Muslim who has complete ownership of his wealth. This is due to what Ad-Daraqutni narrated that was reported as a statement of the Prophet (Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam): &#8220;Whoever is made the guardian over the wealth of an orphan, let him do business with it and he should not leave it to be devoured by chrity i.e, Az-Zakah).&#8221; [Ad-Daraqutni 2:109 no. 1951.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is due to what Malik narrated in Al-Muwatta&#8217; from &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Qasim from his father, that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;A&#8217;ishah used to keep me and my brother as two orphans in her appartment, and she used to pay Az-Zakah from our wealth.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The view that Az-Zakah is obligatory upon the wealth of each of them (the orphan and the insane person)was held by &#8216;Ali, Ibn &#8216;Umar, Jabir, A&#8217;shah and Al-Hasan bin &#8216;Ali. Ibn Al-Mundhir related this from them.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Az-Zakah on Wealth that is kept for Marriage 1.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man saved some money for his son over a number of years so that the son can get married. Is he obliged to pay any Zakah on this wealth of his? This is in consideration of the fact that he does not intend anything with this money other than getting his son married.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He must pay Az-Zakah on all of the money that he saved if it was in his possesion for a year, even if he intended to use this money to get his son married. This is because as long as the money was with him and it was considered his possession, and he must pay its Zakah every year until it is used for the marriage. This is due to the generality of the evidences from the Book and the Sunnah that prove this.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Az-Zakah on Wealth that is kept for Marriage 2.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I am currently an employee in one of the governmental departments and I receive approximately four thousand riyals per month. In approximately one year, I collected seventeen thousand riyals. This money is currently in the bank and it does not increase (i.e., from interest or investment). I am ready to spend in the month of Shawwal – if Allaah wills – as I am getting married. I am going to take a loan that is many times more than this amount to cover the expenses of the wedding. My question is: Am I obliged to pay any Zakah on this seventeen thousand? This is while considering that it has been in my possession for about a year. If there is Az-Zakah due on it, how much is it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Az-Zakah is due on the mentioned sum of money if it was possessed for a year, even if it was kept for marriage. The amount of Zakah that is due is one fortieth, i.e., 2.5%. And Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh `Abdul-`Azeez Bin Baz<br />
Fatawa Islamiyah, DARUSSALAM, Vol.3, Page Nos. 159/160</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Az-Zakah is due on whatever wealth is owned a year and reaches the minimum amount.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A person saved a sum of money from his own earnings. Most of it he possessed for a year, but he spent it on some things that would bring benefit to himself. Therefore, he asks whether it is obligatory for him to pay Az-Zakah on it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whatever wealth he saved or owned for a year while it had reached the minimum required amount, then Az-Zakah is due on it. This is the case even if he spent some of it after that on marriage or anything similar. If he did not pay the Zakah of his wealth which was due upon, then it is still due from him and he is responsible for it. It is incumbent upon him to pay it. However, what he did not possess for a year of his wealth due to his spending from it before a year’s time, then there is no Zakah due upon it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Permanent Committee for Research and Verdicts</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatawa Islamiyah, DARUSSALAM, Vol.3, Page Nos. 160/161</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Paying Az-Zakah in advance is permissible.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I am an employee who receives a salary, and every month I save a portion of it. There is not a specific percentage for the savings, so how do I pay the Zakah of this wealth?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is obligatory upon you is to pay the Zakah of every amount that you save if you have possessed it for a year. If you pay the Zakah of all of the money when a year has passed on the first amount that was saved, then that is sufficient. In this way, the Zakah of the latter sums is considered as being paid in advance before the completion of their year. And paying Az-Zakah in advance before it is possessed for a complete year is permissible, especially if there is a need for it or a religious benefit in that.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Land that is kept for building does not require paying of Az-Zakah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have a piece of land that I bought with the intent of building on it. Then after a period of time, I needed to sell it, so I sold it. Is there any Zakah due on me for the period of time that I was not trying to sell it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the matter is as you mentioned in the question, there is no Zakah due on you for whatever time passed before the sale. This is because the reason that necessitates the the payment of Az-Zakah is not present, which is the intent to sell, and you were not intending to sell it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The ruling of Az-Zakah on Jewellery, Diamonds and precious Stones</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I am a married woman and I am almost 30 years old. For approximately 24 years I have had pieces of gold that are not kept for business. They are only for beautification and some times I sell them. Then I add some money to their price and buy better jewelry. Now I have some jewellery and I have herd that it is obligatory to pay Az-Zakah on gold that is kept for beautification. Thus, I would like a clarification of this matter for myself. If Az-Zakah was obligatory on me what is the ruling of the past period of time during which I did not pay Az-Zakah on the jewellery? This is while keeping in mind that I am not able to estimate the amount of gold that I had during all of these long years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Az-Zakah is obligatory on you from the time you knew it was obligatory on you to pay Az-Zakah on jewellery. Whatever occurred before that in the previous years before your knowledge of this, then you do not have to pay Az-Zakah for it. This is because the Islamic laws only become obligatory after they are known. The amount that must be paid is 2.5% if the jewellery reaches the minimum amount required for Az-Zakah, which is 20 Mithqal (gold). This is equivalent to 11.5 Saudi Junayhs. If gold jewellery reaches this amount or more, then Az-Zakah must be paid on it. For every 1000 Junayhs, 25 Junayhs is due. In reference to silver, its minimum amount before Az-Zakah is due is 140 Mithqal, which is equivalent to it of monetary currency. The amount that must be paid is 2.5% just like with gold.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In reference to diamond and other stones, no Zakah is due on them if they are for wearing. However, if they are for sale, then Az-Zakah is obligatory on them according to their value in gold and silver if they reach the minimum amount required for Az-Zakah. And Allaah is the Giver of success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh `Abdul-`Azeez Bin Baz<br />
Fatawa Islamiyah, DARUSSALAM, Vol.3, Page Nos. 178/179</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Az-Zakah on Jewellery is obligatory on its Owner</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My wife has gold that she wears that reaches the minimum amount required for Az-Zakah. Is there any Zakah due on it? Is paying its Zakah obligatory on me or on my wife? Is Az-Zakah given from the jewellery itself or is its value determined and then Az-Zakah paid according to the value?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Az-Zakah is obligatory on jewellery that is made of gold and silver if its weight reaches the minimum amount required for Az-Zakah, which is 20 Mithqal of gold and 140 Mithqal of silver. The minimum amount of gold in the current currency is equal to 11 (and three sevenths) Saudi Junayhs. If the gold jewellery reaches this amount or more, Az-Zakah must be paid on it, even if it is only for wearing according to the most correct view of the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The minimum amount of silver required for Az-Zakah is 56 Saudi Riyals (of silver). If the silver jewellery reaches this amount or more, Az-Zakah must be paid on it. The amount of Az-Zakah to be paid is 2.5% of gold, silver and sale merchandise. This is 2½ out of 100 or 25 out of 1000. Any amount more than this is calculated in this way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Az-Zakah is due upon the woman who owns the jewellery. If her husband or other than him pays it on her behalf with her permission, there is nothing wrong with that. It is not obligatory to give the Zakah from the jewellery itself. Rather, it suffices to pay its value every time a year passes on it. This is according to the value of gold and silver in the market at the completion of the year’s time. And Allaah is the Giver of success.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Is it Lawful to Give Charity on their Behalf</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A number of years ago, I took a sum of one hundred Saudi Riyals from a number of my colleagues, after which, I travelled to another area and forgot those colleagues and they also forgot me. Now I do not know where they are, so what should I do with the sum of money which is my responsibility? Inform me and may Allah reward you with goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the matter is as you have mentioned in your question, which is that you forgot the owners of the hundred (Riyals) then it is lawful for you to give charity on their behalf. Then if you remembered any of them you must give him his right, unless he approves of your having given it in charity on his behalf. In that case, you will be absolved from blame and you and them will be rewarded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh `Abdul-`Azeez Bin Baz<br />
Fatawa Islamiyah, volume 5 / page 27</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Who is considered eligible to receive the Zakaat ?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It does not befit that the Zakaat be given to the one who does not utilize it for obedience to Allaah. For indeed Allaah The Most High has obligated it as an aid towards obedience to Him for whosoever is in need of it from the believers, such as the poor and those under debt or one who helps the believers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever does not pray from the people who are needy should not be given anything until he repents; and until he adheres to the performance of the prayers in their correct times.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Is the Zakaat ul Fitr due on behalf of the unborn child?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abdullaah bin Ahmad bin Hanbal said: I heard my father say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Zakaat ul Fitr is to be given on behalf of the unborn child – if it is known of.’*</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abdullaah bin Ahmad bin Hanbal said: I heard my father say: Mu’tamir bin Sulaimaan At-Taymee narrated to us from Humaid from Bakr and Qataadah that ‘Uthmaan would give the Sadaqatul Fitr on behalf of the small child and the elder and the unborn child.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">_____________________</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">*Note: There occurs a narration from Imaam Ahmad with this meaning mentioned by Aboo Dawood in Al-Masaa’il page 86, and Ibn Haani’ in Al-Masaa’il vol 1 page 111 number 550.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the madhab itself (the Hanbali madhab): then within it the Zakaat ul Fitr is not obligatory on behalf of the foetus, this is because there is no ruling upon it until it is born. However; it is recommended that it is given on its behalf if it is known to exist due to the practice of ‘Uthmaan (radhiyallaahu ‘anhu). See: Mukhtasir Al-Kharqee page 75 and Al-Hidaayah vol 1 page 75 and Al-Mughnee vol 3 page 99 and Al-Furoo’ vol 2 page 526 and Al-Qawaa’id of Ibn Rajab page 189 and Al-Insaaf vol 3 page 168 and Al-Mubdi’ vol 2 page 388.</p>

Translated by Aboo Haatim Muhammad Farooq</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The particular group of people to whom the Zakaat ul Fitr is to be distributed to</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Scholars have differed concerning the issue of distributing the Zakaat ul Fitr, such that there are two sayings:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first saying: That it is to be distributed amongst the eight types of individuals that have been mentioned by Allaah in Soorah At-Tawbah in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((Indeed the Sadaqaat (obligatory Zakaat) are for the poor and the destitute and those employed to collect (the funds); and for those whose hearts have inclined (towards Islaam), and to free the captives; and for those in debt, and in the Path of Allaah (the Mujahideen), and for the wayfarer: an obligation imposed by Allaah, and Allaah is All-Knower All-Wise.)) Soorah At-Tawbah: 60</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a saying which is well-known from amongst the Shaafi’ee’s.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second saying: Is that it is not to be distributed except amongst the poor and the destitute as occurs in the Hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas which preceded in which there was the statement: ((a sustenance for the destitute))*.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Al-Qayyim (rahimahullaah) said: ((It was from his guidance (Sallalaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) that he would specify those that were destitute for this particular Sadaqah, so he would not distribute it amongst the eight types of people – handful by handful. Nor did he command for that to be done that way, nor did any one of the companions do that, nor did those that came after them. Rather it is one of two sayings with us that it is impermissible to give it except to the destitute in particular.))</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the saying which is to be taken, except if you see dire need amongst someone from the other categories or an acceptable advantage by way of the Sharee’ah (to give it such), in which case it is to be given from this Sadaqah after it has been given to the poor and the destitute – in an ample portion. This is because it is a means of sustenance for them as has been established through that narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here arises an issue which should be taken into consideration which is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That it is permissible for one individual person to distribute his Zakaat to either one destitute person or to a number of them. Just as it is (allowed) for a group of people to give their fitrah to a single poor person so long as they are not committing an injustice in the right of the others who are present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second issue which is also recommended to pay attention to is that: It is impermissible to give it to those that it is impermissible to give the Zakaat to in accordance to that which we mentioned concerning the Zakaat of the types of wealth. And Allaah Knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">__________________________</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">*The full text of the Hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((Allaah’s Messenger (Sallalaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) ordered the giving of Zakaat ul Fitr as a purification for the fasting person from idle talk and obscenity, and as a sustenance for the poor. So whosoever gives it before the prayer (of ‘Eid) then it is an accepted Zakaat, and whosoever gives it after the prayer, then it is a Sadaqah (charity) from the Sadaqaat.))</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Lesson Six: Concerning Zakaat and Its Benefits</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zakaat is one of the obligations of Islaam. It is also one of its (five) pillars, and the most important amongst them after the Testimonies of Faith and the Prayer. Proof for its obligation can be found in the Book of Allaah, the Sunnah of His Messenger and the unanimous consensus of the Muslims. So whoever rejects its obligation is a disbeliever who has apostated from Islaam, and he should be made to repent, and if not then he should be killed. And whoever is cheap with giving it or minimizes any portion that is due from it, then he is from the wrongdoers who are deserving of Allaah’s punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says: <b>“And let not those who hold back miserly from giving that which Allaah has bestowed on them from His Bounty think that it is good for them. Nay, it will be worse for them. The things that they held back from giving will be tied to their necks like a collar on the Day of Recompense. And to Allaah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth, and Allaah is well-Aware of all that you do.”</b> [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 180]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, Abu Hurairah (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) reported that Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“Whoever Allaah has given money to and does not give his Zakaat for it, it will take the form of a shiny-headed male serpent with two black spots over its eyes, which will encircle him on the Day of Judgement and bite his cheeks saying: ‘I am your money, I am your wealth.’”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says: <b>“And those who hoard up gold and silver and do not spend on them in the Way of Allaah (i.e. by giving Zakaat), give them the tidings of a painful punishment. This will be on the Day when those treasures (i.e. gold and silver) will be heated in the Fire of Hell and with it their foreheads, bodies and backs will be branded. (And it will be said to them): ‘This is the treasure that you hoarded for yourselves, so taste what you used to hoard.”</b> [Surah At-Tawbah: 34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in Saheeh Muslim, Abu Hurairah (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) reported that the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“There is no one that possesses gold and silver and doesn’t give his due (Zakaat) on it except that on the Day of Judgement, it will be made into plates of fire, then dipped into the Fire of Hell and with it his body, forehead and back will be branded. Each time the plates grow cool, they will be reheated and brand him again. This will occur on a Day the length of fifty thousand years, until Allaah judges His servants.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zakaat has many religious, behavioral and communal benefits of which we will mention the following from them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From its religious benefits are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. It is abiding by one of the pillars of Islaam, upon which rests an individual’s prosperity in this worldly life and the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. It brings a servant close to his Lord and increases his Faith. This is the case with all of the acts of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. What comes as a result of doing it, such as great reward. Allaah says: <b>“Allaah will wipe away (the reward) of usury and increase that of charity (i.e. Zakaat).”</b> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 276]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says: <b>“And that which you give as a gift (to others) in order that it may increase (your wealth by expecting something in return) from other people’s property, has no increase with Allaah. But that which you give in Zakaat sincerely for the sake of Allaah, those people shall have manifold increase.”</b> [Surah Ar-Room: 39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“Whoever gives away charity the size of a date, which is earned lawfully, since Allaah only accepts the good lawful things, Allaah will indeed take it with His right Hand and cause it to grow for its owner, just as one of you raises up his colt, to the point that the charity will become like the size of a mountain.”</b> [Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Allaah wipes away the (minor) sins by way of it, as the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“Giving charity wipes away sins just as water extinguishes fire.”</b> The word charity (<i>sadaqah</i>) here refers to the Zakaat as well as the supererogatory form of charity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the benefits it has on a person’s character are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. It causes him to follow the way of the generous individuals possessing kindness and magnanimity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Giving the Zakaat requires a person to characterize himself with the attributes of mercy and sympathy towards his destitute brothers, and Allaah shows mercy to those who have mercy on others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. What has been witnessed is that giving financial and physical support to Muslims causes the hearts to become open and the soul to be pleased. And it causes a person to become loved and respected according to the extent of support he gives to his fellow brothers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Giving Zakaat cleanses one’s character from stinginess and miserliness, as Allaah says: <b>“Take the charity (Zakaat) from their wealth in order to purify and cleanse them by way of it.”</b> [Surah At-Tawbah: 103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From its communal benefits is that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Zakaat provides for the needs of the poor who are the majority of people in most countries.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Zakaat strengthens the Muslims and raises their status. This is why one of the areas Zakaat can be given in is Jihaad in the Cause of Allaah, as we will mention later, by the Will of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. It removes the grudges and ill feelings found in the hearts of the poor and destitute. This is since when the poor see the money the wealthy have and their not benefiting them with it, by giving them neither a little nor a lot, then it is likely that they will hold hatred and rancor for the wealthy as they did not enforce their rights or provide for their needs. But when the wealthy do give some of their money to them at the beginning of every year (i.e. after holding the wealth for a year’s time), these things terminate and there comes about love and harmony.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Giving Zakaat boosts one’s wealth and increases it’s blessedness, as is stated in the hadeeth from the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) in which he said: <b>“Charity does not detract from one’s wealth.”</b> This means that even though charity (Zakaat) takes away from one’s wealth numerically, it indeed never takes away from its blessedness or its increasing in the future. Rather, Allaah will replace what he gave away and bless his wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Zakaat is a means for spreading and distributing wealth (throughout the community). This is since if some wealth is given out, its range is broadened and many people benefit from it, contrary to when the wealth is just preserved amongst the rich, since the poor will not gain any part of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of these benefits that come from giving Zakaat show clearly that Zakaat is something necessary and required in order to rectify the individual and the society. How perfect is Allaah, the All-Knowing and Most Wise!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zakaat is required to be given on specific forms of wealth, which include:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Gold and silver, on the condition that they meet the <i>nisaab</i> (minimum requirement). With regard to gold, the <i>nisaab</i> is 11 3/7 Saudi pounds, and for silver it is 56 Saudi Riyals worth of silver or whatever equals that amount from other forms of paper currency. One is obligated to pay a quarter of a tenth Zakaat on the above (i.e. 2.5%). It makes no difference if the gold and silver come in the form of cash, coins or jewelry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, one must pay Zakaat on a woman’s gold and silver jewelry if it meets the <i>nisaab</i>, regardless of whether she wears that jewelry or lends it out. The reason for this is because the evidences that mandate that Zakaat be paid on gold and silver are general and not detailed. And it is also because there are specific ahaadeeth that indicate the obligation of giving Zakaat on jewelry, even if it is worn, such as what has been reported by ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Amr bin al-‘Aas (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“A woman once came to the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) with her daughter who had two gold bangles on her hand. So the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>‘Do you pay Zakaat on this?’</b> She said: ‘No.’ So he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>‘Would it please you if Allaah made you wear two bangles of fire instead?’</b> So she took them of and said: ‘They are for Allaah and His Messenger.’” [It is stated in Buloogh-ul-Maraam: “Reported by the Three[1] and its chain of narration is strong.”]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another reason is because this is more cautious and the most cautious approach takes precedence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Also from the wealth that one is obligated to pay Zakaat on is: Business merchandise, which includes everything that is prepared for business purposes, such as real estate property, automobiles, livestock, household goods and other types of wealth. It is obligatory to pay a quarter of a tenth (i.e. 2.5%) on these items.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After holding the item for one year, one must estimate how much it is worth and pay 2.5% (Zakaat) on it, regardless of whether it now costs more, less or the same amount as what he originally paid for it. As for the items he prepares for his personal use or which he leases, such as real estate property, automobiles, appliances and so on, then there is no Zakaat due on them based on the Prophet’s (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) statement: <b>“A Muslim is not obligated to pay Zakaat on his slave or his horse.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, Zakaat is due on things that are rented out, when their year time-limit is reached, as well as on gold and silver due to what was stated previously.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Lesson Seven: Those who are entitled to receive the Zakaat</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people entitled to Zakaat are those places we can direct our Zakaat to. Allaah took charge of explaining for Himself what these places are, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“The charity (Zakaat) is only for the poor, the needy, those employed to collect (the Zakaat), those whose hearts will be inclined (towards Islaam, by giving them Zakaat), for slaves, for those in debt, for (Jihaad in) the Cause of Allaah, and for the wayfarer (i.e. destitute traveler). It is an obligation imposed by Allaah, and Allaah is the All-Knower, the All-Wise.”</b> [Surah At-Tawbah: 60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1. The Poor (<i>Fuqaraa</i>):</b> They are those who are not able to support themselves with sufficient means, except for very little, which is less than half (a year). So if a person cannot find that which will support himself and his family for at least half a year, he is considered poor (<i>faqeer</i>) and he should be given what will suffice him and his family for a year.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>2. The Needy (<i>Masaakeen</i>):</b> They are those who are able to support themselves with sufficient means for half of the year or more, but not enough for the entire year. So they should receive support that will complete the year for them. If a person does not have any cash on him, but yet has some other source of income, such as a profession, a salary or investment profits that will support him financially, he should not be given Zakaat. This is based on the Prophet’s statement: <b>“There is no share in it (i.e. the Zakaat) for a wealthy person or for a strong able-bodied person who can earn a living.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>3. Those employed to collect the Zakaat:</b> They are the ones put in charge by the ruler of a country to collect the Zakaat from those who owe it, distribute it to those who are entitled to it, guard the funds and all other types of duties involved with the supervision of Zakaat. So they should be given a portion of the Zakaat in accordance with the work they put in, even if they may already be wealthy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>4. Those whose hearts will be inclined:</b> This refers to tribal and clan leaders, who do not have strong Faith. They should be given Zakaat so as to strengthen their Faith, which will make them callers to Islaam and good role models. But what if a person is weak in his Islaam, and he is not from the leaders who are followed and obeyed, but rather from the common folk, should he be given some Zakaat in order to strengthen his Faith?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some scholars hold that it should be given to him since benefiting one’s religion is better than benefiting one’s body. Look at the example of a poor person. He is given Zakaat in order to nourish his body. So nourishing someone’s heart with Faith is greater and of more benefit. However some scholars hold that he should not be given the Zakaat since the benefit of strengthening his Faith is a personal benefit that is specific to him alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>5. Slaves:</b> What falls under this is buying slaves using Zakaat funds in order to free them, as well as assisting in the liberation of Muslim war captives.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>6. Those in debt:</b> They are the ones who owe debts. This is on the condition that they do not possess that which will enable them to remove their debts. So these people should be given enough (Zakaat) that will relieve them of their debt, whether it is a small or large amount, even if they may be wealthy due to their livelihood. So in the case where there is a man who has some income that is enough for the livelihood of himself and his family, but he has some debt that he cannot repay, he may be given sufficient Zakaat that will remove his debt from him. However, it is not permissible for a person who is owed money by a poor person to cancel that person’s debt, intending to give his share of Zakaat by that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars have differed regarding the case where the one in debt is someone’s father or son. Can he be given Zakaat in order to remove his debt? The correct opinion is that it is permissible. It is permissible for a person who owes Zakaat to go to the creditor (person owed the debt) and pay him back the loan of the indebted without the latter being aware of it. This is on the condition that the person owing Zakaat knows that the indebted one is unable to repay his debt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>7. In the Cause of Allaah:</b> This refers to Jihaad in the Cause of Allaah. So those who fight in Jihaad should be given a portion of the Zakaat that will suffice them for their Jihaad and enable them to buy the necessary tools for Jihaad in the Cause of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What also falls under <b>“the Cause of Allaah”</b> is religious knowledge. So a student of Islamic knowledge should be given that which will enable him to seek knowledge, such as books and so on. This is unless he already has money of his own that will enable him to achieve that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>8. The Wayfarer:</b> This refers to a traveler that has been cut off from his journey. So he should be given enough Zakaat that will enable him to return to his homeland.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the people who are entitled to receive Zakaat, the ones whom Allaah has mentioned in His Book and informed us that this is an obligation that He mandated, which stems from His knowledge and wisdom. And Allaah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible to direct the Zakaat to any other place, such as towards building masaajid or fixing roads. This is because Allaah has told us those who are entitled to receive the Zakaat for the purpose of limiting them to just those mentioned. So this limitation indicates that we are to negate all other potential recipients that due not fall under this limitation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we were to reflect on those individuals that we may give Zakaat to, we would come to realize that among them are those who are in need of the Zakaat for personal use as well as those who are in need of it for the Muslims generally. So by this, we can see the extent of wisdom behind the requirement of Zakaat. And we would come to know that the wisdom behind Zakaat is to build a complete and upright society, as best as possible. And that Islaam does not disregard money or the benefits that can be generated from wealth, nor does it leave greedy and stingy souls to go about freely an unchecked with their stinginess and vain desires. On the contrary, it is the greatest guiding force towards the good and betterment of nations. And all praise is due to Allaah, Lord of the universe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen</strong> (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Is zakaah better in Ramadaan, even though it is one of the pillars of Islam?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zakaah, like other good deeds, is better when done at a time of virtue, but when zakaah becomes obligatory and the year has passed, it becomes obligatory for a person to pay it, and he should not delay it until Ramadaan. If the year is completed in Rajab, then he should not delay it until Ramadaan, rather he should pay it in Rajab. If the year is completed in Muharram then he should pay it in Muharram, and not delay it until Ramadaan. But if the year is completed in Ramadaan, then he should pay it in Ramadaan. End quote.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Zakaah on an Employee’s Salary &#8211; Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz</strong> (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a man who depends on his monthly salary; he spends some and saves the rest. How should he pay zakaah on this money?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He should write down what he saves of his salary, and pay zakaah on it when one year has passed. <span style="text-decoration:underline;color:#008000;">Zakaah should be paid on the savings of each month when one year has passed</span>. If he pays zakaah on the total in the first month, there is nothing wrong with that and he will be rewarded for that, and it will be regarded as zakaah paid in advance for the savings for which one year has not yet passed. There is no reason why a person should not pay zakaah in advance if he sees some benefit in doing so. <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#008000;text-decoration:underline;">But delaying it after the year has passed is not permissible, unless there is a valid shar’i excuse</span></span>, such as the wealth not being available or there being no poor people. End quote.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tuhfat al-Ikhwaan bi Ajwabah Muhimmah tata’allaq bi Arkaan al-Islam (question no. 12)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here is an Answer from <strong>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah : </strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he insists on having all his rights and on not giving any charity to those who deserve it apart from what he is obliged to give, then he should make a schedule of his earnings and write down every amount and the date on which he took possession of it. Then he should pay zakaah for each amount separately when one year has passed from the date on which he took possession of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if he wants an easier method, and wants to be more generous and give precedence to the poor and others who are entitled to zakaah over himself, then he can pay zakaah on all the money he possesses when one year has passed from the date when his wealth first reached the nisaab. This will bring a greater reward and raise him higher in status; it is easier for him and is more generous towards the poor and needy and others who are entitled to zakaah. Whatever extra amount he may pay will be regarded as a “down payment” on the zakaah for any wealth for which one year has not yet passed.</p>
</blockquote>
