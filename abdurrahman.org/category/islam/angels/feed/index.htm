<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>[In this Audio]</strong></span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لاَ مَلَكٌ مُقَرَّبٌ وَلاَ نَبِيٌّ مُرْسَلٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Neither any angel brought near, nor any Messenger sent</span>.</strong><sup>8</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>Neither any angel brought near, nor any Messenger sent</strong>”: the angel brought near – this is the most excellent ones from the angels such as Jibreel <em>‘alaihissalaam</em>, and the bearers of the Throne, and those around it, and the angels drawn close to Allaah the Perfect and Most High. So despite the closeness of their place to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and their drawing close to Him with worship and their status with Allaah, if anyone were to associate them along with Allaah in worship then Allaah will not be pleased that an angel drawn close is associated with Him, nor any Prophet sent, such as Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam, </em>and ‘Eesaa and Noo<u>h</u> and Ibraaheem, those Messengers who are firmest in resolve. <span style="color:#ff0000;">He is not pleased that anyone should be associated with Him even if it be one of the most excellent of the angels, even if it be one of the most excellent of mankind.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He is not pleased that anyone should be associated along with Him from the angels nor from the Messengers. So how about other than them from the beloved servants of Allaah and righteous people, so other than the angels and the Messengers it will be even more the case that Allaah is not pleased that they be associated with Him in worship. And this is a refutation of those people who claim that they take the righteous people and the beloved servants of Allaah as intercessors with Allaah in order to draw them closer to Allaah, just as the people of the days of ignorance used to say:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَا نَعْبُدُهُمْ إِلَّا لِيُقَرِّبُونَا إِلَى اللَّهِ زُلْفَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">We do not worship them except so that they should draw us closer to Allaah </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(by interceding for us with Allaah)</span> [39:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Otherwise they believed that those ones whom they took, they do not create and they do not give provision and they do not possess power over death nor life nor resurrection. Rather their intention was just to take them as intermediaries with Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and therefore they directed some worship towards them to draw them closer to them, so they made sacrifices for the graves, and they made vows for the graves and they supplicated for aid and called upon the dead.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 19 : Point 20</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have eemaan in the Prophets and in the Angels.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F365836907&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/eemaan-in-the-prophets-and-in-the-angels" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From that fundamentals of eemaan and the pillars of eemaan is to have eemaan in the malaa·ikah (Angels) and in the anbiyaa (Prophets). And this is as occurs in the hadeeth of Jibreel <em>`alayhis-salaam</em>, when he said to the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, “Inform me about eemaan (true faith). So he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“(It) is that you truly believe in Allaah and His Angels and in His Books and in His Messengers and in the Last Day and that you truly believe in pre decree, the good of it and the bad of it.”</span></strong> [01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in the Qur&#8217;aan,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Righteousness is not that you turn your faces either to the east or to the west. But rather righteousness is the righteousness of the one who truly believes in Allaah and in the Last Day and in the Angels and in the Book and in the Prophets.</strong></span> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 177)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The Messenger believes in that which was sent down to him from his Lord and also the believers. All of them believe truly in Allaah and in His Angels and in His Books and in His Messengers. They say, we do not make any distinction in believing between any of His Messengers. And they say we hear and we obey.</strong> </span>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 285)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, we truly believe in Allaah and in what was send down to us and in what was send down to Ibraaheem and Ismaa`eel and Is&#8217;haaq and Ya`qoob and to the Tribes and what Moosaa and `Eesaa were given and what the Prophets were given from their Lord. We do not make any distinction </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(with regard to believing)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> between any of them. And we submit as Muslims to Him.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 136)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory to have <em>eemaan</em> in the Angels, all of them. Those whom Allaah has named from them and those whom He has not named. And the <em>malaa&#8217;ikah</em> (the Angels) is the plural of <em>malak</em>. And they are species of being from the world of the hidden and the unseen. Allaah created them from light. Then as for the Jinn, then Allaah created them from fire. And as for mankind then Allaah created them from teen (clay) and then from a feeble fluid, just as Allaah the Perfect and Most High mentioned. So a person must have <em>eemaan</em> in the Angels all of them, those whom Allaah has named from them and those He has not named. We believe in all of them. As for one who believes in some of them and disbelieves in others, then he is a disbeliever in all of them (a <em>kaafir</em>). He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say, whoever is an enemy to Jibreel, then he </strong>(Jibreel)<strong> brought it (the Qur&#8217;aan) down to your heart by the permission of Allaah, confirming that which came before it and a guidance and glad tidings for the believers. Whoever is an enemy to Allaah and to his Angels and to His Messengers and to Jibreel and to Meekaal then Allaah is an enemy to the disbelievers.</strong></span> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayahs 97 &#8211; 98)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the person who disbelieves in a single Angel from the Angels, he is a disbeliever in all of the Angels. Such as the Jews, those who say, &#8220;<em>Jibreel is an enemy to us. If the one who came down to Muhammad had been other than Jibreel, we would have obeyed him. However Jibreel came down to him and he is our enemy. So we will not believe in him.”</em> [02] So therefore Allaah sent down this aayah. [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, whoever is an enemy to Jibreel, then he brought it down to your heart by the permission of Allaah</span></strong> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 97)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it (the Revelation) is not from Jibreel. Rather it is from Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. And Jibreel was only a messenger from Allaah entrusted with bringing the Revelation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And amongst the deviant sects who ascribe themselves to Islaam are those who say that Jibreel betrayed his trust, because Messengership should have gone to `Alee. However, (they say) Jibreel betrayed his trust and gave it instead to Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. Their poet said, “The trustworthy one was treacherous (Jibreel) and he withheld it from Haydar,” meaning from `Alee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author said, <strong>“That we have eemaan in the Messengers (rusul) and in the Prophets (anbiyaa·).”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Prophet (<em>nabeey</em>) is one who had a Revealed Way sent to him, but he was not commanded to convey it to others. Whereas a Messenger (<em>rasool</em>) was one who had a Revealed Way sent to him by Revelation and he was commanded to convey it.[04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Whoever is an enemy to Jibreel, then he brought it down to your heart by the permission of Allaah</strong></span> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 97)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the difference between <em>an-nabeey</em> (Prophet) and <em>ar-rasool</em> (Messenger) is that a Messenger (<em>rasool</em>) is sent with a Revealed Way, sent down to him. Contrary to a Prophet (<em>nabeey</em>), for he is sent with a Revealed Way sent down to Messengers who came before him, like the Prophets of the Banoo Israa·eel (Children of Israa&#8217;eel); because they were sent with the message of Moosaa <em>`alayhis-salaam</em>, with the Towraat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">We sent down the Towraat which contained Guidance and Light by which the Prophets, those who submitted to Allaah, judged for the Jews and the rabbis and also the priests</span></strong> (Sooratul-Maa·ida (5), aayah 44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they judged by the Towraat which had been sent down to Moosaa `alayhis-salaam and they did not come with an independent Legislation. Contrary to a Messenger (rasool), for he comes with an independent Legislation and he is commanded to convey it. But as for a Prophet (nabeey), he is commanded to convey the Message from someone before him, and Revelation might be sent to him with regard to a specific matter. This is the difference.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Muhammad Amaan al-Jaami`</strong> rahimahullaah said in his explanation of the Three Principles, <em>“They disagree with regard to the difference between a Prophet (nabeey) and a Messenger (rasool). So some of them define it and say: a Prophet is one who is sent with a Message to act upon it, but he was not given the duty of calling to it. However the second definition is that a Prophet (nabeey) is one who was sent with a Message of someone who was before him and he does not have his own independent Message, as was the case with many Prophets from the Banoo Israa·eel. And the second definition is more befitting whereas the first one is what is famous.”</em> (He goes on to mention that it is not befitting to say a nabeey is one who has Revelation but he does not have to convey it to anyone).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whoever disbelieves in a single Prophet, then he is a disbeliever in all of them. He is a disbeliever even in the Prophet who he claims that he believes in, because the Prophets were all brothers. He <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008080;"><strong>The Prophets were brothers with different mothers.</strong> </span>[05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They were a single chain. Their way was one. So whoever denies a single one of them, then he is denying all of them, because what this one had, the other one had. All of them were Messengers from Allaah. So the person who claims that he believes in Moosaa, such as the Jews, but then disbelieves in `Eesaa and in Muhammad <em>`alayhimus-salaatu was-salaam</em> then those people are disbelievers (<em>kaafiroon</em>) in all of the Prophets, even in the Prophet who they claim they are believing in. And he was Moosaa <em>`alayhis-salaam</em>. Because the book which Moosaa came with contained a mention of Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The one (the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) whom they find written down with them in the Towraat and in the Injeel. He commands them with the good and he forbids them from the evil. And he declares lawful for them the good and pure things. And he forbids the filthy and evil things for them. And he releases them from the burdens and the fetters that were upon them. So those who believe in him and honour him and aid him and who follow the Light which came down with him, then they will be the successful ones.</span></strong> (Sooratul-A`raaf (7), aayah 157)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Those to whom we gave the Scripture they know him (the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) just as they recognize their own sons.</strong> </span>(Sooratul- Baqarah (2), aayah 146)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However envy (<em>hasad</em>) led them to disbelieve in Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> because they wanted that Prophethood should not depart from the Banoo Israa&#8217;eel. So therefore they sought to monopolize the bounty of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Or do they envy the people for that which Allaah gave to them from His bounty.</strong></span> (Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), aayah 54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what led them do this was <em>al-hasad</em> (envy) and transgression. Otherwise they knew that he was indeed the Messenger of Allaah because they found him written in the Towraat and in the Injeel. Likewise `Eesaa <em>`alayhis-salaam</em> he foretold of the good news of the coming of Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And remember when `Eesaa ibn Maryam said, O Children of Israa·eel, I am Allaah’s Messenger to you, confirming what came before me from the Towraat and giving news of the coming of a Messenger who will come after me whose name will be Ahmad.</span></strong> (Sooratus-Saff (61), aayah 6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And who is this Messenger who came after `Eesaa? No Messenger came after `Eesaa, except for Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his name was Ahmad and his name was Muhammad. He had many names. So the person who disbelieves in `Eesaa he is a disbeliever in all of them. And the one who disbelieves in Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is a disbeliever in all of them. And therefore He, the Majestic and Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The people of Nooh denied the Messengers</span></strong><br />
(Sooratush-Shu`araa· (26), aayah 105)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though the first of the Messengers was Nooh and they denied Nooh. However He said that they denied the Messengers, meaning those who came after him, because whoever denies one Messenger then he has denied all of the Messengers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The people of `Aad denied the Messengers</span></strong><br />
(Sooratush-Shu`araa· (26), aayah 123)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Thamood denied the Messengers</span> </strong><br />
(Sooratush-Shu`araa· (26), aayah 141)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The people of al-Aykah (people of Madyan) denied the Messengers</strong> </span>(Sooratush-Shu`araa· (26), aayah 176)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a person who disbelieves in one, he is a disbeliever in all of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Those who disbelieve in Allaah and in His Messengers and they wish to make a difference between believing in Allaah and in His Messengers and they say, we will believe in some and disbelieve in others. They want to take a way in between. They are the disbelievers in truth.</strong> </span>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), aayahs 150 – 151)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though they believed in some of them, however believing in some is not sufficient. There must be <em>eemaan</em> in all of them, because they are all Messengers from Allaah. All of them came from Allaah the Perfect and Most High. The earlier ones of them foretold the later ones. And the later ones of them believed in the first ones <em>`alayhimus-salaatu was-salaam</em>. This is the position of the Muslims and of the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] Reported by Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 8) as hadeeth of Umar ibnul-Khattaab radiyAllaahu`anh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] The like of this story was reported by Imaam Ahmad in his Musnad, volume 1 page 274.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] Reported by al-Bukhaaree as a hadeeth of `Abdullaah ibn Salaam that he said about Jibreel, <strong>“That is the enemy to the Jews from the Angels.”</strong> So therefore he <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> recited this aayah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04]<strong> Translator’s side point:</strong> Some of the other scholars mention a slightly different definition, amongst them Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymeeyah in his book an-Nuboowaat, where he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em> “A Prophet (nabeey) is one whom Allaah the Most High has sent with a Revealed Way (Legislation) which Allaah commands him to convey to his own followers, but not to the opponents. Whereas a Messenger is one whom Allaah the Most High sent with Revelation (a Revealed Way) to call all of the people in his time to, whether they are opponents or those who agree with him, whether it is a new Revealed Way or one from before.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[05] Reported by al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh (no. 3443) and reported by Muslim (no. 2365) as a hadeeth of Aboo Hurayrah radiyAllaahu`anh. And the wording of al-Bukhaaree is: <strong>“The Prophets are </strong>[lit. paternal] <strong>brothers, their mothers are different, but their Religion is one.”</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">There are also some Angels who write down the deeds of human beings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;But verily, over you (are appointed Angels in charge of mankind) to watch you, honorable, writing down (your deeds), they know all that you do&#8221;</strong></span> (Al-Infitar 82:10-12)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Not a word does he (or she) utter, but there is a watcher by him ready (to record it)&#8221;</strong></span> (Qaf 50: 18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the companions of Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy upon him, visited him while he was sick. He found him groaning from the sickness. He said:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>&#8220;O Abu &#8216;Abdullah! Are you groaning? Tawus said &#8216;Indeed, the Angels write down everything, even the groan of a sick person, because Allah says:</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Not a word does he (or she) utter, but there is a watcher by him ready (to record it(Qaf 50: 18)&#8221;&#8216;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, Abu &#8216;Abdullah began to have (more) patience, and he stopped groaning,[1] because everything is written down. &#8220;Not a word does he (or she) utter? &#8211; Meaning any word uttered by you is written. However, you might be rewarded or punished for it. This is based on the saying that was said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[1] For what was reported by Salih bin Al-Imam Ahmad, he said: <em>&#8220;During his sickness prior to death, my father said: &#8216;Take out the book of &#8216;Abdullah bin Idris.&#8217; then said: &#8216;Read to me the narration of Laith that Tawus used to dislike groaning during sickness.&#8217; After that I did not hear to my father a groan till he died.&#8221;</em> Siyar A&#8217;lam An-Nubula (11:215).</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Among them (Angels) are those who are in (constant) bowing and prostration to Allah in the heavens.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;The heaven <em>Atat</em> (creak) and it has every right to creak.&#8221; </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <strong><em>Atit</em> </strong>is the Sarir Ar-Rahl (camel&#8217;s creaking). Meaning: If there was a heavy load on top of the camel, you would hear to it a creaking sound due to the heavy weight of the load.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;The heaven creaks and it has every right to creak. There is no place that could contain four fingers in the heavens except that there is an Angel standing, bowing, or prostrating to Allah therein.&#8221;</strong></span> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these Angles cover the vastness of the heavens.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>[1] Reported by Abmad (5:173), At-Tirmidhi (2312), Ibn Majah (4190) and Al-Hakim (2:510), from Abu Dharr, may Allah be pleased with him. And his wording is: &#8220;The heaven creaks, and it has every right to creak. There is no space for four fingers, except that there is an Angel there, placing its head in prostration to Allah.&#8221; The Hadith is referenced by Al-Albani in As-Sahihah (1722).</em> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Shaikh Saalih bin Fawzaan Al-Fawzaan<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a complete translation of a short treatise called <b>“<i>Al-Eemaan bil-Malaa’ikah wa Atharuhu fee Hayaat-il-Ummah</i>”</b> [Belief in the Angels and its Effect in the Life of the Ummah] written by Shaikh Saalih bin Fawzaan Al-Fawzaan, a member of the Council of Senior Scholars in Saudi Arabia. The source used for this translation was the Arabic version found on the Shaikh’s web site: alfuzan.net.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Although this treatise is short in size, it provides many proofs and evidences for the descriptions, duties and general characteristics of the angels, and gives many splendid points of benefit concerning the angels and our place with respect to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As the author mentions in this treatise, our purpose for learning about the angels is not just for the sake of knowing about them for our general understanding, but rather, it is so that we can become conscious of their constant presence around us and their effect in our daily lives. Also, if we become conscious of the fact that there are two angels with us at all times recording our statements and actions, we would become cautious of what we say and do lest our guardian angels record something about us for which we will be held accountable before Allaah. In addition to this, we must also bear in mind that Belief in the Angels is one of the six pillars of Eemaan, which every Muslim is obligated to have knowledge of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“These are the three angels that are responsible for life. Jibreel is responsible for bringing the revelation, which brings life into the hearts. Mikaa’eel is responsible for the raindrops, which bring life to the earth after its death. Israafeel is responsible for blowing on the trumpet, which will bring life to the bodies (on the Day of Resurrection). This is why when the Prophet  would get up for prayer at night, after saying the opening Takbeer, he sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam would say in his opening supplication: <b>‘O Allaah! Lord of Jibreel, Mikaa’eel and Israafeel, Originator of the heavens and the earth…’</b>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Death is ascribed to Allaah here because He is the One who orders it to occur. It is also ascribed to the angels because they are the ones who physically carry that out by gathering the soul and leading it out of the human’s body until it reaches his throat. And it is also ascribed to the Angel of Death –<b>‘Say: ‘The Angel of Death, who is set over you, will take your souls’’</b> – because he is the one in charge of seizing the souls after they have been rounded up in the last stage (of death).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There are also angels that are responsible for protecting humans from perils. A human being is prone to walk into dangers everyday. However, Allaah entrusts angels that guard and protect him from these dangers during his lifetime, which Allaah has ordained for him. This earth, which a human being walks upon everyday, contains many dangers. There are wild beasts, snakes, scorpions, not to mention transgressors from among humans – enemies and oppressors. However, Allaah has placed these angels around the human being. Allaah says: <b>‘He (a person) has those (angels) who constantly surround him – from before him and behind him, protecting him by the Command of Allaah.’</b> [Surah Ar-Ra’ad: 11] Therefore, so long as Allaah has decreed that this individual will be safe from harms, these angels will protect and guard him, and no human will be able to harm him. But if Allaah desires to bring an end to his appointed time, He removes them from him – one from before him and one from behind him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Belief in the Angels has a tremendous effect on the life of humans, since if a person is aware of them, he will indeed be cautious and mindful. If a person realizes that there are angels entrusted to him who constantly surround him day and night, he will surely be cautious of what he says and does, lest something is recorded about him that is not befitting. So if he knew that there were investigators following him, wouldn’t he be cautious out of fear that they might take hold of some speech or action of his which will cause him a harmful end? So how can he not then be cautious and mindful of the angels when he doesn’t see them? But as for humans, you can see them. So the one who is watching you and you can see him, you are wary about him. However, the angels see you but you cannot see them. It is possible that you might be able to protect yourself from humans – you can go inside your home or lock yourself up in some secluded area and they would not be able to gain any information about you. But as for the angels, they enter with you everywhere. Allaah has given them the ability to reach and access any place that He commands them to reach.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">His booklet: &#8220;<i>Al-Eemaan bil-Malaa&#8217;ikah</i>&#8221;<br />
Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The angels have duties. Each of them has a duty that he is entrusted with, and he does not delay in carrying it out. Rather, he executes it acting on Allaah’s order and He doesn’t disobey Him. Allaah says: <b>“(Hell) Over which are angels stern and severe who do not disobey the Commands they receive from Allaah, but do that which they are commanded.” </b>[Surah At-Tahreem: 6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Some of their Duties: </b><br />
<b>First: </b>Those who take charge of the Hellfire. They are known as the Guardians of Hell, meaning, those entrusted with the Hellfire and with tormenting its inhabitants.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Second: </b>Among them are angels that are entrusted with carrying the Throne of Allaah, as He says: <b>“Those who carry the Throne (of Allaah) and those around it glorify the praises of their Lord and believe in Him. And they ask forgiveness for those who believe, (saying): ‘Our Lord! You encompass all things in mercy and knowledge, so forgive those who repent.’” </b>[Surah Ghaafir: 7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says: <b>“And bearing the Throne of your Lord on that Day will be eight (angels).” </b>[Surah Al-Haaqah: 17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Number of Angels who will Bear the Throne: </b><br />
The angels that will carry the Throne are four. Then on the Day of Judgement their number will increase to eight. The Throne of Allaah is the greatest of His creations, which will be carried on the Day of Judgement by eight angels. This shows that they are indeed mighty, since they will carry this magnificent Throne, which is the greatest and mightiest of Allaah’s creations. This indicates their power and their tremendous composures.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Third:</b> Among them are those angels entrusted with revelation. Allaah says: <b>“He sends down the angels with the <i>Rooh</i> (spirit/revelation) from His Command to whomever He wills from His servants, (saying): ‘Warn mankind that there is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Me, so be dutiful to Me.’” </b>[Surah An-Nahl: 2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word <i>Rooh</i> (spirit) here means revelation. It is called <i>Rooh</i> because it is the revelation that brings life to the hearts, just as the rain brings life to the earth. In the same sense, it is the created Rooh (spirit) that brings life to the bodies of animals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Rooh</i> can also stand for the Qur’aan, as Allaah says: <b>“And thus We have revealed to you (O Muhammad) a <i>Rooh</i> (i.e. Qur’aan) from Our Command.”</b> [Surah Ash-Shooraa: 52]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Rooh</i> here stands for the Qur’aan, since it is that which brings life to the hearts of the believers, just as the earth is brought to life by rain. Such is the case with the hearts of the believers – they are brought to life by way of the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word <i>Rooh</i> is also used to refer to Jibreel, who is the greatest, most honorable and virtuous of all the angels. He is the one who brought the Qur’aan down from Allaah to Muhammad, as Allaah says: <b>“The trustworthy spirit (Jibreel) brought it (i.e. the Qur’aan) down – to your heart (O Muhammad) in order that you may be from the warners – in a plain Arabic language.”</b> [Surah Ash-Shu’araa: 193-195]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Jibreel brought the Qur’aan down to the heart of the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>), and he in turn conveyed it to his ummah. In another ayah, Allaah says: “Say: The holy spirit (Jibreel) brought it down from your Lord.” [Surah An-Nahl: 102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is referring to the angel Jibreel – he is the holy spirit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Attributes of Jibreel: </b><br />
Allaah has described Jibreel with great characteristics, as He says: <b>“So verily, I swear by the planets that recede (disappear during the day and appear at night). And by the planets that move swiftly and hide themselves. And by the night as it departs. And by the dawn as it brightens. Verily, this is the Word (brought by) an honorable messenger (i.e. angel) – Possessing power and a high rank with the Lord of the Throne. Obeyed (by the angels), trustworthy there (in the heavens).”</b> [Surah At-Takweer: 15-21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The First Attribute:</b> Power: Allaah says: <b>“Possessing power and a high rank with the Lord of the Throne.”</b> [Surah At-Takweer: 20] The <b>“Lord of the Throne”</b> here refers to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Second Attribute:</b> Position: Allaah says: <b>“Possessing power and a high rank with the Lord of the Throne.”</b> [Surah At-Takweer: 20] This means that he possesses a high position in the sight of Allaah, which no one else has reached.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Third Attribute:</b> Obedience: All of the angels obey Jibreel by the Permission of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Fourth Attribute:</b> Trustworthiness: This refers to the revelation, such that he doesn’t make additions or subtractions to it, but rather, He conveys it just the way that Allaah has revealed it to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Prophet Muhammad’s Seeing Jibreel: </b><br />
Allaah says: <b>“And your companion is not insane.”</b> [Surah At-Takweer: 22] This is what the disbelievers claimed about him (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>). <b>“And indeed he (Muhammad) saw him (Jibreel) in the clear horizon).”</b> [Surah At-Takweer: 23] Muhammad (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) saw Jibreel on the horizon twice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The First Time: </b>This was in the valley of Makkah. The Prophet Muhammad (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) lifted his head and saw him in the sky and he had 600 wings. Each one of his wings blocked the horizon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Second Time: </b>Allaah says: <b>“And indeed he (Muhammad) saw him (Jibreel) at a second descent – near the lote-tree of the utmost boundary.”</b> [Surah An-Najm: 13-14] This occurred during the night in which the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) ascended to the heaven and saw him in his natural state.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the attributes of Jibreel. Allaah says: <b>“Verily, this is the Word (brought by) an honorable messenger (i.e. angel).”</b> [Surah At-Takweer: 19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means: Even though the Qur’aan is the Speech of Allaah, it is ascribed to Jibreel here, since he is the one who conveyed it to Muhammad. So he is conveying from Allaah, for he dictated it to our messenger, Muhammad, conveying it from Allaah. However, it is the Speech of Allaah. Speech is only attributed to the one who states it originally, not to the one who says it conveying it from someone else. However, the Speech of Allaah has been attributed to Jibreel here from the perspective of his conveying it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Fourth: There are angels entrusted with other duties: </b> 1. Mikaa’eel: He is responsible for the raindrops that fall down from the sky. He moves them around and causes the rain to descend wherever Allaah commands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Israafeel is responsible for blowing on the Trumpet. This will be at the time when Allaah wants to resurrect the creatures from their graves. The bodies will be brought forth from the graves and reassembled. Then the only thing remaining (to be integrated) will be the soul. It is at this point that Israafeel will blow on this horn, due to Allaah’s Command, and the souls will float to their respective bodies, which had come out and risen from their graves. Then they will walk to where Allaah orders them to go. Allaah says: “The Day when they will come out of the graves quickly as if they were racing to a goal.” [Surah Al-Ma’aarij: 43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says: <b>“They will come forth with humbled eyes from (their) graves as if they were locusts spread about. Hastening towards the caller, the disbelievers will say: ‘This is a hard day.’”</b> [Surah Al-Qamar: 7-8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the three angles that are responsible for life. Jibreel is responsible for bringing the revelation, which brings life into the hearts. And Mikaa’eel is responsible for the raindrops, which bring life to the earth after its death. Israafeel is responsible for blowing on the trumpet, which will bring life to the bodies (on the Day of Resurrection). This is why when the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) would get up for prayer at night, after saying the opening Takbeer, he (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) would say in his opening supplication: <b>“O Allaah! Lord of Jibreel, Mikaa’eel and Israafeel, Originator of the heavens and the earth…”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the greatest angels due to the magnitude of their duties.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Fifth: </b>There are also angels that are put in charge of the fetuses in the mothers’ wombs. This has been reported in the hadeeth of Ibn Mas’ood (<i>radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</i>), in which he said: “The Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) narrated to us – and he is the truthful one who is believed – saying: ‘Verily the creation of each of one of you is brought together in his mother’s womb for forty days in the form of a seed, then he is a clot of blood for a like period, then a morsel of flesh for a like period. Then the angel is sent to him and commanded with four matters – to write down his means of livelihood, his life span, his actions, and whether he will be happy or unhappy.’” Allaah sends this angel to him to carry out this great important task.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Sixth: </b>There are angels that are in charge of taking the souls when their prescribed time is over. There is the Angel of Death (Malak-ul-Mawt) about whom Allaah says: <b>“Say: ‘The Angel of Death, who is set over you, will take your souls.’”</b> [Surah As-Sajdah: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Angel of Death has assistants that will aid him, as Allaah says: <b>“Until when death approaches one of you, Our messengers (i.e. the Angel of Death and his assistants) take his soul, and they never neglect their duty. Then they are returned to Allaah, their Master, the Just Lord.”</b> [Surah Al-An’aam: 61-62] So taking the soul at the time of death is ascribed to the angels, to the Angel of Death and also to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> “It is Allaah who takes away the souls at the time of their death.”</b> [Surah Az-Zumar: 42] Death is ascribed to Allaah here because He is the One who orders it to occur. It is ascribed to the angels because they are the ones who physically carry that out by gathering the soul and leading it out of the human’s body until it reaches his throat. And it is also ascribed to the Angel of Death &#8211; <b>“Say: ‘The Angel of Death, who is set over you, will take your souls’”</b> – because he is the one in charge of seizing the souls after they have been rounded up in the last stage (of death).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Seventh:</b> There are also angels in charge of recording the deeds of the son of Aadam (i.e. humans), as occurs in the hadeeth: <b>“You are constantly being frequented (in successive shifts) by angels at night and angels during the day.” Allaah says: “And verily, there are guardians (i.e. angels recording your deeds) over you – Honorable, recording (your deeds). They know all that you do.”</b> [Surah Al-Infitaar: 10-12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Every human being has two angels with him: </b><br />
Every human amongst us has two angels that are responsible over him – an angel on his right side recording his good deeds and another on his left side recording his bad deeds. Allaah says: <b>“When the two receivers receive (i.e. record his deeds) from his right side and his left side, sitting. Not a word does he utter, except that there is a watcher by him ready (to record it).”</b> [Surah Qaaf: 17-18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These guardian angels accompany a human being whether he is on a journey or sitting at home – they are next to him at all times under all conditions – during his prayer, while he is prostrating, etc. – they accompany him and do not leave him alone except under specific circumstances, such as when the person is relieving himself (in the bathroom). So these angels record his statements and his actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The angels record People’s Intentions and Objectives: </b><br />
It has been related that the angels also record a person’s intentions and inner objectives, which are located in the heart. Whatever he intends to do, they record it. This is why a person is rewarded for having good intention, since it is an action of the heart, while he is punished for evil intentions, since the intention is an action of the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These angels are put in charge of recording a person’s deeds from the time that he reaches the age of puberty – the age of discernment – to the time when Allaah takes his soul in death. And they record against him everything that he does in his life – whether that is in the form of intentions, actions, statements, or other than that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Status of the Fajr and ‘Asr Prayers amidst the Other Prayers:</b><br />
The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“You are constantly being frequented (in successive shifts) by angels at night and angels during the day. And they gather together during the ‘Asr Prayer and during the Fajr Prayer.” This is why these two prayers are the greatest of all prayers. Allaah says: “Verily, the recitation of the Qur’aan in the early dawn (i.e. Fajr Prayer) is witnessed (by the angels).”</b> [Surah Al-Israa: 78] He is referring here to the Fajr Prayer, which the angels of the night and the angels of the day attend. They gather together to witness the Fajr prayer along with the Muslims and listen to the Qur’aan that is recited in prayer. They also gather together during the ‘Asr Prayer, where Allaah asks them, even though He is most knowledgeable of the answer: <b>“In what state did you leave My servants?”</b> The angels reply, saying: <b>“We came to them while they were praying and we left them while they were praying.”</b> This means that they descended while we were praying ‘Asr and they attended the prayer along with us. And then they rose back up (to the heavens) while we were praying Fajr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this, it has been determined that the ‘Asr Prayer is the <b>“Middle Prayer”</b> that Allaah has encouraged us about, where He says: <b>“Guard strictly the (five daily) prayers, especially the middle prayer (i.e. ‘Asr).”</b> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 238] He means by this the ‘Asr prayer since that is the prayer that the (guardian) angels of the night and the angels of the day attend.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>A Call to those who fall short: </b><br />
So where are those who hold back from attending the Fajr Prayer, sleeping (instead) in their beds and not witnessing this great event every night with the angels of the Most Merciful? This is such that these angels inform about these attendees (of the Fajr Prayer) while in the most highest of gatherings, saying: <b>“We came to them while they were praying and we left them while they were praying.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What benefit has this person who refrains from going to the Fajr Prayer and instead prefers sleep gained from his actions? And what benefit has this person who misses out on attending the ‘Asr Prayer, due to laziness, preferring sleep or some other deed, gained from his actions?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is stated in the hadeeth that: <b>“Whoever misses the ‘Asr Prayer, it is as if he lost his family and wealth.”</b> And in another hadeeth it states: <b>“…then he has nullified his actions.”</b> This means that he has taken the prayer out of its proper time. So if he takes it out of its proper time, he has missed it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Eight:</b> There are also angels that are responsible for protecting humans from perils. A human being is prone to walk into dangers everyday. However, Allaah entrusts angels that guard and protect him from these dangers during his lifetime, which Allaah has ordained for him. This earth, which a human being walks upon everyday, contains many dangers. There are wild beasts, snakes, scorpions, not to mention transgressors from among humans – enemies and oppressors. However, Allaah has placed these angels around the human being. Allaah says: <b>“He has those (angels) who constantly surround him – from before him and behind him, protecting him by the Command of Allaah.”</b> [Surah Ar-Ra’ad: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, so long as Allaah has decreed that this individual will be safe from harms, these angels will protect and guard him, and no human will be able to harm him. But if Allaah desires to bring an end to his appointed time, He removes them from him – one from before him and one from behind him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> “Verily, Allaah will not change the condition of a people until they (first) change the condition of themselves. And when Allaah desires a bad end for a people, there is no turning it back.”</b> [Surah Ar-Ra’ad: 11] So if Allaah’s Divine Pre-Decree comes to pass and He desires to put an end to this person, the angels that constantly surround him withdraw themselves from him because they do not refrain from carrying out Allaah’s Command. These are the angels that constantly surround a person.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Ninth:</b> There are also angels that have responsibilities in this universe that only Allaah has knowledge of. There are angels that are put in charge of the seas and angels put in charge of the days. There are angels responsible for the winds and angels put in charge of carrying out many other duties.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of the events that occur in the universe and which constantly transpire within it on a daily basis are only by Allaah’s decreeing that. As for the angels, they carry out whatever tasks Allaah orders them to execute.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Introduction to his booklet: &#8220;<i>Al-Eemaan bil-Malaa&#8217;ikah</i><br />
Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah, Lord of all that exists, and may the peace and blessings be upon our prophet, Muhammad, as well as upon his family and all of his Companions. To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, Eemaan (Faith) is a great matter, since it is the foundation upon which success in this life and the next rests on. So it is one of the most important levels of the Religion, for when the angel, Jibreel, came to the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) in the presence of his Companions, he asked him about Islaam, Eemaan, and Ihsaan, saying: “O Muhammad! Inform me about Islaam.” The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) replied: <b>“Islaam is to testify that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah; to establish the prayer; to give the Zakaat; to fast in Ramadaan; and to perform the Hajj to the House (Ka’bah) if you are able to.”</b> So he explained Islaam as being the implementation of these five pillars: (!) The two testimonies of Faith; (2) Establishing the Prayer; (3) Giving the Zakaat; (4) Fasting in Ramadaan; (5) Pilgrimage to the Ka’bah. So the angel Jibreel told him: “You have spoken the truth. Now inform me about Eemaan.” The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“It is to believe in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, and to believe in Al-Qadar – the good of it and the bad of it.”</b> So he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) explained that Eemaan was to believe in these six things: Belief in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day and Al-Qadar – the good of it and the bad of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jibreel continued: “Inform me about Ihsaan.” So the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) responded: <b>“Ihsaan is to worship Allaah as if you see Him. But if you don’t see Him, then verily, He sees you.”</b> So he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) clarified that Ihsaan consists of one pillar, which is to worship Allaah as if you see Him. But if you don’t see Him, then verily, He sees you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the three levels of the Religion: Islaam, then Eemaan, then Ihsaan. Each one of these levels has its own set of pillars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A pillar is the part upon which something stands on. So the pillar of a house refers to the part upon which that house is established. So Eemaan (Faith) rests upon six of these pillars. If one of these pillars is missing, a person is no longer a believer, possessing Faith, since he lacks one of the pillars of Eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, Eemaan cannot be established except upon its pillars, just like a building cannot be established except upon its pillars. These six pillars (of Eemaan) are mentioned in the noble Qur’aan. Sometimes they are mentioned altogether and other times they are mentioned separately, as Allaah says: <b>“But rather piety (birr) is he who believes in Allaah, the Last Day, the Angels, the Book and the Prophets.”</b> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 177] Allaah mentions five of the pillars of Eemaan in this ayah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says: <b>“The Messenger (Muhammad) believes in what was revealed to him from his Lord and (so do) the believers – all of them believe in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. We do not differentiate between any of His Messengers.”</b> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 285]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He mentions four of these pillars here. And sometimes, He just mentions two of these pillars: Belief in Allaah and the Last Day, as He says: <b>“Verily, those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians and Sabians – whoever believes in Allaah and the Last Day.”</b> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He mentions two pillars in this ayah: Belief in Allaah and the last Day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for belief in Al-Qadar (Divine Pre-Decree), then that is mentioned in His statement: <b>“Verily, We created everything with Qadar (Divine Pre-Decree).”</b> [Surah Al-Qamar: 49]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in His saying: <b>“He has created everything, and assigned its Decree to it.” </b> [Surah Al-Furqaan: 2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Meaning of Belief in the Angels:</b><br />
The subject, which we are focusing on now, is the Belief in the Angels, which is one of the pillars of Eemaan. What Belief in the Angels entails is: Believing in their existence and believing in the duties that they carry out in the universe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the angels are one of Allaah’s creations, which He created for the purpose of worshipping Him and carrying out His orders in the universe. Allaah sends His angels in order to execute His Commands. So they are a creation from the world of the Unseen. We don’t see them, yet we believe in them with a firm resolution that doubt cannot penetrate. This is since Allaah has informed us about them, and likewise, His Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) has informed us about them in such a definitive manner that causes us to believe in them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>What were the Angels created From? </b><br />
The Angels were created from light, as is reported in a hadeeth that Allaah created the angels from light and He created the devils from fire and He created the humans from dirt. So the angels were created from light.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Attributes of the Angels: </b><br />
The angels are one of Allaah’s creations from the world of the Unseen. No one knows how many in number they are, their manner of being or their natures except for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>From their Attributes: </b><br />
<b>First: </b>They are the greatest of Allaah’s armies. Allaah says: <b>“And to Allaah belongs the armies of the heavens and the earth.”</b> [Surah Al-Fat’h: 4] And whilst talking about the guardians of the Hellfire, He mentioned: <b>“Over it are nineteen (angels).”</b> [Surah Al-Mudaththir: 30] And He says: <b>“And We have set none but angels as guardians of the Hellfire, and We have not made their number (i.e. 19) except as a trial for those who disbelieve.”</b> [Surah Al-Mudaththir: 31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this means that there are nineteen angels guarding the Hellfire – they maintain it, guard it, kindle it and are entrusted with its affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When one of the disbelievers heard of the number of angels that are guarding the Hellfire, he said, as if to mock their amount: “I will suffice you over them” – meaning if he enters the Hellfire, he will confront them, overpower them and get out of the Hellfire. He said this in order to mock and ridicule, so Allaah refuted them by saying: <b>“And We have set none but angels as guardians of the Hellfire.”</b> [Surah Al-Mudaththir: 31] This means they will not be from among the humans.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if this person claims that he is strong and that he is able to fight against a number of humans, he will not be able to fight against even one of the angels. Allaah says: <b>“And We have set none but angels as guardians of the Hellfire.”</b> [Surah Al-Mudaththir: 31] This means: “We did not make them humans or jinn.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> “And We have not made their number (i.e. 19) except as a trial for those who disbelieve, in order that the people of the Scripture may arrive at a certainty and the believers may increase in Faith, and so that no doubts may be left for the people of the Scripture and the believers, and so that those in whose hearts is a disease (of hypocrisy) and the disbelievers may say: ‘What did Allaah intend by this example.’”</b> [Surah Al-Mudaththir: 31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they lie and seek to belittle this number. How can this great Hellfire, which contains all of these creatures, only be maintained by nineteen? Allaah says: <b>“And We have not made their number (i.e. 19) except as a trial for those who disbelieve.”</b> [Surah Al-Mudaththir: 31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So no one knows the greatness of the angels and no one knows what Allaah has with Him from armies in the heavens and the earth except for Allaah. Neither these disbelievers nor anyone else knows.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Second: </b>The angels have great physical composure, as Allaah mentioned this about them in His saying: <b>“All praise is for Allaah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth – who made the angels messengers with wings – two or three or four.”</b> [Surah Faatir: 1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that there are some angels that have two wings, some that have three and some that have four. And there are some angels that have more wings than that, for the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) saw the angel Jibreel and he had 600 wings – each wing blocking the horizon. This is just one of the many angels that exist. Allaah described him as being mighty in power, as He says: <b>“He (Muhammad) has been taught (this Qur’aan) by one mighty in power.”</b> [Surah An-Najm: 5] He is referring to Jibreel. <b>“Free from any defect, then he rose (and became stable).”</b> [Surah An-Najm: 6] This means that he possesses strength and a beautiful appearance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Third: </b>The angels possess great power, by Allaah’s permission. What indicates their great strength is that if Allaah commands just one of them, then indeed he is able to let out an awful cry in the world, thus destroying the creation, as occurred with the people of Thamood, who were seized by a loud scream. Jibreel unleashed one powerful scream upon them: <b>“Verily, We sent against them a single sayhah (awful cry), and they became like the dry straw of fences.”</b> [Surah Al-Qamar: 31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So their hearts ceased to function within their bodies and as a result they died and became like dry straw. It was from the custom of the Arabs that when they would settle in a place, they would gather sticks of wood and make fences to surround their sheep and cattle. These fences would eventually dry up and become pieces of straw. So in spite of Thamood’s power and might, they became like dried-up straws as a result of one loud cry from one of the angels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also commanded Jibreel to raise up the towns of the people of Loot – and they were seven cities in which could be found humans, buildings, goods and animals. He carried them on one side of his wing and raised these cities until the (other) angels heard the barking of dogs and the crowing of roosters. Then he overturned them and Allaah caused the earth to swallow them up.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an example of the mighty power of the angels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also the angel Israafeel, the angel that is entrusted with blowing the Trumpet. What is meant by the Trumpet is a horn that will gather the souls of the son of Aadam (i.e. humans), from the first of them to the last of them. Then Israafeel will blow one time on the Trumpet, and the souls will fly about due to this blow of the horn, going back to their bodies. This is known as the Blow of Resurrection (<i>Nafkhat-ul-Ba’ath</i>). Prior to this, he will strike the Blow of Destruction (<i>Nafkhat-us-Sa’aq</i>), so everyone that is in the heavens and in the earth will die except for he whom Allaah wills. Allaah says: <b>“And the trumpet will be blown and all who are in the heavens and in the earth will swoon away except for he whom Allaah wills.”</b> [Surah Az-Zumar: 68]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Swooning away means to die. Then he will blow on the Trumpet again, which is known as the Blow of Resurrection, <b>“and behold, they will be standing, looking.”</b> [Surah Az-Zumar: 68]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is just one of Allaah’s angels, and this is just one of his duties, which Allaah has ordered him to carry out. So therefore, the angels are one of Allaah’s great creations. He created them so that they may worship Him and carry out His commands. Allaah says: <b>“Rather, they are honorable slaves. They speak not until He has spoken, and they act on His Command. He knows what is before them and what is after them. and they cannot intercede except for him with whom He is pleased. And they stand in awe for fear of Him.”</b> [Surah Al-Anbiyaa: 26-28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a description of the angels.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bismillaah Al-Hamdulillaah wa salatu wa salaamu &#8216;ala rasulullaah<br />
Amma-ba&#8217;d</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following are some of the tremendous benefits [not verbatim] that Shaikh Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdul-Wahhab al-&#8216;Aqeel (hafidhahullaah Ta&#8217;aala) shared in a <em>Dars</em> (lesson) concerning the topic of the Angels and their relationship to mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#c00000;">Loving each other &#8211; only for Allaah&#8217;s sake, not for wordly purposes</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the greatest blessings of Allaah is the blessing of brotherhood for Allaah, which the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said is a foundation of Eeman: <strong><em>Awthaq &#8216;Ural Eeman Al-Hubu fillaah wal-bughdu fillaah</em> (The strongest handhold of Eeman is love for Allaah and hatred for Allaah).</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>There are three characteristics that if a person has them, he will taste the sweetness of Eeman: that Allaah and His Messenger are more beloved to him than anything; that he loves an individual, and does not love him except for Allaah; and that he hates to return to disbelief (after believing) just as he hates to be thrown into the fire.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the Day of Judgement, Allaah will raise the level of the believers who have loved each other for Allaah&#8217;s Pleasure, and shade those who have loved each other for His pleasure, as comes in the hadeeth of the seven whom Allaah will shade.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#c00000;"><strong>Allaah raises &#8211; by degrees &#8211; those who believe in a detailed manner above those who believe in a general manner</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After mentioning the well-known <span style="color:#1274a7;font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif;">Hadeeth of Jibreel</span><span style="font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif;"> &#8211; which includes the statement of the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) (what means): &#8220;<strong>Eeman is to believe in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, and to believe in The Last Day, and the Qadr &#8211; its good and its bad</strong>&#8221; &#8211; Shaikh Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdul-Wahhab al-&#8216;Aqeel (hafidhahullaah) then said:</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;These six matters are the matters that Eeman is built upon. The (Muslims) are of two different types as it relates to these six articles. The first type of people believe in them, but they believe in them in a general manner. And this belief is beneficial for them,<em> in-sha` Allaah</em>. The second type of (Muslims) believe in these six articles in a detailed manner. And this (detailed) Eeman has raised the second type by degrees over the first type.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said (what means): &#8230;<strong>Allaah will exalt in degree those of you who believe, and those who have been granted knowledge. And Allaah is Well-Acquainted with what you do.</strong> (Al-Mujadilah, ayah 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and Allaah informs us (what means): <strong>&#8230;It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves who fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is All-­Mighty, Oft­-Forgiving. </strong>(Fatir, ayah 28)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#c00000;">The Angels and their <em>&#8216;Alaaqa</em> (relationship) to Mankind</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-&#8216;Aqeel (hafidhahullaah) brought to attention that angels attend these gatherings and they fill the space between the gathering and the heavens, and afterward they rise toward Allaah, Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;aala, and Allaah asks the angels where they came from (although He knows). [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The relationship that the angels have with mankind is even stronger than the <em>&#8216;alaaqa</em> (relationship) that mankind&#8217;s own souls have with them. What is the angels&#8217; relationship with mankind?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah told the angels that He would create mankind before He created mankind. Before Allaah created the shape of Adam, they knew that Allaah was making the shape of Adam. When Allaah shaped Adam, the angels saw the creation of Adam. The angels saw Adam when he was clay, before the soul was blown into him. The angels saw Adam when the soul was blown into him. The angels prostrated to Adam after the soul was blown into him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Adam and the angels were in heaven, then together on earth. And the angel is with the life from the instant that a man enters his wife, and the sperm enters her. So the angels are with us even before we are created! The angels [who saw Adam &#8211; the father of all of mankind &#8211; when he was clay] are with the offspring of Adam when he is just a <em>nutfah</em> (sperm), and then a clot, and then a little lump of flesh, then bones, and then flesh. [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the angels are with us during all five stages.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If Allaah wants to give life to this being, and He has created for that being a soul, then the angel receives that soul from Allaah and he breathes it into the body that is inside the stomach of a woman. And there maybe two or three or four or more souls in the stomach.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The angels do not make any mistake!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If that soul is supposed to be in that body, then that&#8217;s where it&#8217;s going to be. Then the angels write the being&#8217;s actions, provisions, wretched or blessed, and his destiny. If the being is born, he is accompanied by an angel and also a devil. The angel commands him with good, and encourages him to do that. And the devil commands him with evil, and encourages him to do that. And this is established in the Saheeh of Imam Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>There is none amongst you except that he has been assigned a partner from the angels and a partner from the jinn.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if you know this hadeeth, then you&#8217;ll know the answer to a very important question. Some people go to the doctor, and ask him: I hear three different things in my head. Number one says, &#8220;Go to the salat.&#8221; Number two says, &#8220;No, no. Sleep now.&#8221; Number three says, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So anything the individual wants to do, he will find three voices. So if it is good, such as the salat and being kind to parents and keeping relations with kin, he will find a voice encouraging him upon it, a voice commanding him away from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who commands with good, he is your companion from the angels. As for the one who commands you with evil, it is your companion from the jinn. And you are in the middle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-&#8216;Aqeel (hafidhahullaah) also mentioned that Allaah assigns angels to protect us until the command of Allaah comes, and they (the angels) one after the other &#8211; as in shifts &#8211; protect, by Allaah&#8217;s Command.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said (what means): <strong>For each (person), there are angels in succession, before and behind him. They guard him by the command of Allaah.</strong> (Ra&#8217;d, ayah 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And for example, the one who recites ayat al-kursee [ayah 255 of Sooratul-Baqarah] before he sleeps, then an angel is sent from the heaven to guard him until he awakes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Muslim who believes in the angels will not be someone who is scared, because he knows that he will be protected, by the command of Allaah, until the command of Allaah comes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has assigned the angels to mankind from before his birth til after his death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#c00000;">From those actions of the angels that relate to the human being:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1</strong>&#8211; Used to protect him while he was just a fetus in the stomach of his mother.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2</strong>&#8211; Breathed the soul into his body.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3</strong>&#8211; After the birth, they encouraged him/her to do good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4</strong>&#8211; Write down his good deeds and bad deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>5</strong>&#8211; It comes in the hadeeth that the angel who writes the good deeds is on the right-hand side, and the angel who writes the evil deeds is on the left-hand side. And the angel who writes the good deeds is <em>ameer</em> (in charge) over the angel who writes the evil deeds. If a Muslim does a good deed, the angel on the right-hand side writes the good deed immediately. If he does an evil deed, the angel on the right-hand side (the one in charge) tells the angel on the left, &#8220;Don&#8217;t write it down. Wait; he may repent.&#8221; And it comes in another hadeeth that he is given [six (Islaamic) hours (six periods of time)] to make tawbah. <strong>And if he does [repent in those six hours], the sin is not even written down! </strong>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>6</strong>&#8211; The angels write down <strong>four</strong> different things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#4040ff;">a</span></strong>&#8211; your speech,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#4040ff;">b</span></strong>&#8211; your actions,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#4040ff;">c</span></strong>&#8211; what is in your heart (your sincerity, love, tawakkul, hope, intending to do good [4]), and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#4040ff;">d</span></strong>&#8211; any good or evil that you were the cause of (even though you may not have done it), either during your life or after your death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For that reason, the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>If the son of Adam dies, his deeds are cut off except for three: ongoing charity, knowledge that people benefit from, and a righteous child who makes du&#8217;aa [to Allaah] for him.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>Whoever calls to guidance will have a reward for each person who follows him in that, without their rewards decreasing at all. And whoever calls to misguidance will be have a sinful burden to bear for all those who followed him in that, without lessening their burdens at all.</strong> (Muslim, no. 2674)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the one who directs others to good &#8211; our beloved brothers &#8211; then the angels will write for him all those who follow him in that. So the Muslim should be diligent in calling/guiding to good, because his reward for that will not be cut off.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>7</strong>&#8211; Also, the angels take the soul out of that individual.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>8</strong>&#8211; And then, in the grave, two angels ask him: Who is your Lord? What is your Religion? Who is your Prophet?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the barzakh &#8211; after the person dies and before Yawm al-Qiyammah (Day of Judgement) &#8211; there is no relationship between us and mankind except via the angels. For example, the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) mentioned that Allaah has <em>malaa`ika</em> (angels) who inform the Prophet of the salutations of peace and blessings that we ask Allaah to send upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>9</strong>&#8211; And the angels are the ones who blow into the trumpet, and this is of three different types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#4040ff;">a</span></strong>&#8211; blow of silence<br />
<strong><span style="color:#4040ff;">b</span></strong>&#8211; blow of death<br />
<strong><span style="color:#4040ff;">c</span></strong>&#8211; blow of resurrection</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>10</strong>&#8211; On the Day of Judgement, the angels will meet mankind according to their actions. The righteous will be met by the angels with glad tidings. The evil will be met by the angels with disgrace and destruction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said (what means): <strong>Verily, those who say: &#8220;Our Lord is Allaah (Alone),&#8221; and then they are upright, on them the angels will descend (at the time of their death) (saying): &#8220;Fear not, nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of Paradise which you have been promised! We have been your friends in the life of this world and are (so) in the Hereafter. Therein you shall have (all) that your inner-selves desire, and therein you shall have (all) for which you ask for. An entertainment from (Allaah), the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221;</strong> (Fussilat, ayat 30-32)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And those who kept their duty to their Lord will be led to Paradise in groups, till, when they reach it, and its gates will be opened (before their arrival for their reception) and its keepers will say: <em>Salaamun &#8216;Alaikum</em> (peace be upon you)! You have done well, so enter here to abide therein.&#8221;</strong> (Az-Zumar, ayah 73)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the disbelievers &#8211; aoodhubillaah! &#8211; they will be met by the angels with all types of blame and evilness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said (what means): <strong>And those who disbelieved will be driven to Hell in groups, till, when they reach it, the gates thereof will be opened (suddenly like a prison at the arrival of the prisoners). And its keepers will say, &#8220;Did not the Messengers come to you from yourselves, reciting to you the Verses of your Lord, and warning you of the Meeting of this Day of yours?&#8221; They will say: &#8220;Yes, but the Word of torment has been justified against the disbelievers!&#8221; It will be said (to them): &#8220;Enter you the gates of Hell, to abide therein. And (indeed) what an evil abode of the arrogant!&#8221;</strong> (Az-Zumar, ayat 71-72)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To speak about the angels and their connection to mankind is something that would take a long time. Right now, they [the angels] are with us and they hear what we are saying, and they&#8217;re looking at us with their eyes and they are writing that which we say and that which we believe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, I want to finish this talk with a question: who from mankind loves you the most? As for the one who loves you, that is the one who makes du&#8217;aa for you. Do you believe that the greatest of the angels is right now making du&#8217;aa for you? They are making du&#8217;aa for you [du&#8217;aa] that the person most beloved to you is not making for you. Not [even] your mother! Nor your father! Nor your wife! Nor your children!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is an amazing du&#8217;aa!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said (what means): <strong>Those (angels) who bear the Throne (of Allaah) and those around it glorify the praises of their Lord, and believe in Him, and ask forgiveness for those who believe (in the Oneness of Allaah) (saying): &#8220;<span style="color:#4040ff;">Our Lord! You comprehend all things in mercy and knowledge, so forgive those who repent and follow Your Way, and save them from the torment of the blazing Fire! Our Lord! And make them enter the &#8216;Adn (Eden) Paradise (everlasting Gardens) which you have promised them, and to the righteous among their fathers, their wives, and their offspring! Verily, You are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise. And save them from (the punishment, because of what they did of) the sins, and whomsoever You save from (the punishment, because of what they did of) the sins (i.e. excuse them) that Day, him verily, You have taken into mercy.</span>&#8221; And that is the supreme success.</strong> (Ghafir, ayat 7-9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I want you to memorize these ayat, and think about them at all times. [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This praise of Allaah the angels make [before their du&#8217;aa] is tawaasul (seeking nearness) to Allaah &#8212;-&gt; <strong>Our Lord! You comprehend all things in mercy and knowledge. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>The distance between the earlobe and the shoulder of one of the </strong><strong>angels who carry the Throne of Allaahu, Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala, is a distance of 700 years.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#0000ff;">Source:</span></strong> Tape: <strong>&#8216;Umrah 2005: Belief in the Angels: The Angels and Their Relationship to Mankind, by Shaikh Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdul-Wahhab al-&#8216;Aqeel (hafidhahullaah)</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] In a hadeeth Qudsee found in the two Saheehs, the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said: <strong>To Allaah belong mobile (squads) of angels who have no other work (to attend to but) to search for the assemblies of Dhikr and, when they find such assemblies in which there is Dhikr (remembrance of Allaah), they sit in them and some of them surround the others with their wings till the space between them and the sky of the world is fully covered. And when they disperse (after the assembly of Dhikr is adjourned), they go upward to the heaven, and Allaah, the Exalted and Glorious, asks them although He is best informed about them: Where have you come from? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And they say: We have come from some slaves of Yours on Earth: they were glorifying You (saying &#8220;Subhanallaah&#8221;), exalting you (saying &#8220;Allaahu akbar&#8221;), declaring that there is none deserving of worship except You (saying &#8220;La ilaaha ill Allaah&#8221;), praising You (saying &#8220;Al-Hamdulillah&#8221;), and asking [favors] of You. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>He [Allaah] says: And what do they ask of Me? They say: They ask of You Your Paradise. He says: And have they seen My Paradise? They say: No, O Lord. He says: And how would it be were they to have seen My Paradise! They say: And they seek refuge in You. He says: From what do they seek refuge in Me? They say: From Your Hellfire, O Lord. He says: And have they seen My Hell-fire? They say: No. He says: And how would it be were they to have seen My Hellfire: They say: And they ask for Your forgiveness. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Then He [Allaah] says: I have forgiven them and I have bestowed upon them what they have asked for, and I have granted them safety from that which they seek safety from. </strong><strong>They (angels) say: O Lord, among then is so-and-so, a much-sinning servant, who was merely passing by and sat down with them. And He [Allaah] says: And to him [too] I have given forgiveness: he who sits with such people shall not suffer. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Allaah said (what means): <strong>And indeed We created man (Adam) out of an extract of clay (water and earth).</strong> (Al-Mu`minoon, ayah 12)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thereafter We made him (<span style="color:#4040ff;">the offspring of Adam</span>) as a <span style="color:#c00000;">Nutfah</span> (mixed drops of the male and female sexual discharge) (and lodged it) in a safe lodging (womb of the woman). Then We made the Nutfah into a <span style="color:#c00000;">clot</span> (a piece of thick coagulated blood), then We made the clot into a <span style="color:#c00000;">little lump of flesh</span>, then We made out of that little lump of flesh <span style="color:#c00000;">bones</span>, then We clothed the bones with <span style="color:#c00000;">flesh</span>, and then We brought it forth as another creation. So blessed be Allaah, the Best of creators.</strong> (Al-Mu`minoon, ayah 13-14)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] In the Question-and-Answer session that followed, details of this hadeeth were mentioned in the narration recorded by Imam At-Tabaraani, on the authority of Abi Umaamah (radiallaahu &#8216;anhu) that the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa salam) mentioned: <strong>Six hours</strong>. Ibn Hajar al-Ascalanee (rahimahullaah) explained &#8220;<strong>six hours</strong>&#8221; by using a word (audio not clear), the meaning of which the questioner asked Shaikh al-&#8216;Aqeel about. And Shaikh al-&#8216;Aqeel said it means &#8220;<em>Waqteeyah</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it was mentioned that if the slave does not repent in these six hours, of course, the slave can still repent afterward &#8211; as long as the soul has not reached his throught.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] The Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa salam) said: <strong>If the slave itends to do good, the angels says, &#8220;Ya Rabb (Oh Lord), your slave intends to do good.&#8221; So Allaah will say, &#8220;Watch him; if he does it, write it for him as 10 good deeds.&#8221; And if he intends to do evil, then Allaah tells the angel: &#8220;Watch him. If he does it, write it down as one sin. And if he doesn&#8217;t do it, write it down as one good deed, because he left it for the fear of Allaah, &#8216;Azza wa Jall (Mighty and Majestic).&#8221; </strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All praise be to Allah Alone and peace and blessings be upon the Last Prophet, Muhammad, his family and Companions. To commence:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta&#8217; has perused the letter submitted to his Honor, the General Mufti by the questioner through Sa`d Al-Husayn. The letter was referred to the Committee by the Secretariat-General for the Council of Senior Scholars under the number 16 on 3/1/1421 A.H. The text of the question is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">A man in Breen, governorate of Al-Zarqa&#8217;, named Muhammad Idris Al-Hawamdah, claims that he treats people through reading the Qur&#8217;an on water after diagnosing the disease. According to him, an angel standing above his eyes enables him to see the disease. We tried in vain to convince him that angels do not come down to any person after the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) with revelation. He insists on his claim adding that this is a Karamah (an extraordinary event performed by a pious person) given to him by Allah. He confirms that he has no connection with the Jinn (creatures created from fire), Muslims or non-Muslims, at all; rather, he deals only with the angels. What is the ruling on the person who claims so? He tempted many citizens of the Gulf States generally and Saudi people in particular. May Allah reward you.</span></p>
<p>After the Committee examined the question, it gave the following answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The angels (peace be upon them) do not do anything except by the command of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He), and it is beyond the capacity of man to control them however he wants. The claim that man deals with the angels or that they help him has no conclusive evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reality is that evil spirits that are jinn or devils may communicate with many people believing that they are angels. They are spirits that communicate with star worshippers and other idolaters. Thus, it is not permissible for a muslim to claim that he deals with the angels, nor is it permissible for Muslims to believe him. If a man is proved to seek the help of jinn or spirits in treating the patients, it will not be permissible to visit him for treatment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) stated, Anyone who visits a diviner and asks him about anything, his prayers extending to forty nights will not be accepted. Related by Muslim in his Sahih (authentic) Book of Hadith. He (peace be upon him) also stated, If anyone resorts to a diviner or a soothsayer and believes in what he says, he will be a disbeliever in what was revealed to Muhammad. Related by Imam Ahmad and Ahl-ul-Sunan (authors of Hadith compilations classified by jurisprudential themes) through a good Sanad (chain of narrators). These  Hadith and others indicate that it is prohibited to consult or believe diviners and soothsayers who claim knowledge of the Ghayb (the Unseen) or seek the help of jinn, provided their behaviors confirm that.</p>
